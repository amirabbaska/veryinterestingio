			<div class="markdown"><p>What people seem to forget is that asteroids like this aren't exactly rare, we just happened to notice this one. Scientists estimate at least three such objects enter our solar system every day. </p>
<p>As far as examine something from outside our solar system- technically everything in our solar system began out of our solar system, so yes, if you want to be technical about it. </p>
<p>EDIT: This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2017/nov/20/interstellar-object-confirmed-to-be-from-another-solar-system" target="_blank">article</a> is where I got that info from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we used some sort of impactor to produce a sample would there be anything left behind to show that impact was unnatural? Maybe debris or something? Imagine if we saw evidence that it had been studied by something else. I know it's completely unrealistic, but I think it would be cool to leave some sort of golden record type message on it. I imagine Oumuamua is much easier to detect than our tiny Pioneer or Voyager spacecrafts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. But it would be like engraving a grain of sand  on a really long beach and hoping someone will see it. Also imagine every grain of sand from that beach is separated from each other by the distance between Australia an New York, filled with emptiness. It would not be impossible for someone to find, but almost like impossible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Just quickly - it's 2am here in Australia and I need to wake up early tomorrow so I'm going to give the best answer I can now and I'll answer any followup questions in a few hours from now.</p>
<p>Essentially, the difference here is akin to using binoculars to look at a tree one kilometer away compared to being able to go up to that tree, pick off a leaf and look at it under a microscope.</p>
<p>From far away - we can determine basic composition (using spectroscopy, and the emission/absorption spectra of different elements), colour, temperature, velocity, etc. These are all pretty simple characteristics. </p>
<p>From up close, we could take samples of this object from outside of our solar system and determine a precise composition. Right now, we can see that the object absorbs about 96% of all light that hits it. This, among other things is a strong indicator that organic molecules (the building blocks of life) are present. If we were to analyse the composition of this asteroid, we could use it to extrapolate what the conditions outside of our solar system are and determine if we (and specifically the formation of life and the abundance of organic molecules in our solar system) are a rare occurrence or something that can be found all over the universe.</p>
<p>Another analogy I could give is - imagine seeing yourself in a line of prison cells. All the other prison cells have opaque walls, so that you cannot see inside them. You know that your own cell has a broken toilet and a hard bed. You have no way of telling if all the other prisoners have shitty living quarters just like you - or if they're living it up in private mansions. Hell, you can't even tell if there are any prisoners in those cells (let alone how many there might be). </p>
<p>All the information we have gotten about the universe outside of our solar system has been long distance observations where we could not personally interact and study these conditions up close. Oumuamua could radically change our understanding of the formation of solar systems, planets and even the presence of life in our universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a weird question.</p>
<p>If you were to be instantly transported to this asteroid, say in a space suit with a radio, what would be the most valuable information you could relay back to earth about the asteroid, that you could gather without specialized equipment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the chances that taking some kind of sample from this asteroid is a bad and/or unrealistic idea? </p>
<p>If there’s organic molecules, and that points to the possibility of life, what kinds of safety measures are taken to ensure that there’s no contamination - either from it getting out or is getting in, both of which seem undesirable?</p>
<p>I don’t think we’ll see little green men walking around, but some kind of microscopic life would be completely unpredictable in how it would affect or be affected by our world, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps us to ratify theories of how the universe works. The universe is pretty big and we are assuming that what we observe in the visible universe, on our planet and in our solar system are the be alls and end alls. If we collect data from an object that has come from outside our sphere of influence we can test/observe is these theories hold up and by confirming them it may help us to know what questions to ask next. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is feasible, though technically challenging, to get a mission to the object's surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially more then just a few light years away. Yes it is coming from a direction of a neighborhood star. But the amount of time it would have had to leave that location and travel here puts that system off its path. So it could be coming from much much further away for an extremely long time.</p>
<p>Edit: at least from an article I read on it the other day.</p></div>		</li>
