			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that basically be a black hole made of anti-matter, instead of regular matter? But that would repel itself apart, so that wouldn't work...</p>
<p>What if there was a ton of antimatter surrounding a black hole, making a stable sphere (or ring) around the black hole?</p>
<p>I'm throwing all this out there with only a very basic understanding of antimatter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antimatter has nothing to do with gravity or white holes. Antimatter means it has the opposite charge from what is normal. A black hole made of antimatter would not push itself apart.</p>
<p>For example: antiproton is negative, antielectron is positive</p></div>		</li>
