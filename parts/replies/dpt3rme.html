			<div class="markdown"><p>Im just curious about one thing! Astronomers can only look at planets atmosphere with this technique right? Theres no way we can ever determine if there’s a moon out there with earth like conditions? </p>
<p>I’ve always wondered how life on a moon would look like? What would happen with the four seasons, day and night? It becomes a mess when I try to figure it out?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean. Day, night and the four seasons are only relevant to the planet that they're on. Same thing with different time periods would happen on any other planet.</p>
<p>Living on Mars, for example, we'd get out of sync with Earth real quick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im on board with that! What I meant was, what if earth was orbiting a, lets say som sort of gas giant, and the gas giant orbited the sun!</p>
<p>That must be hard for astronomers to find with methods they’re using today!  </p></div>		</li>
