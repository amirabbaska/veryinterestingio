			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my professors in university basically spent his career studying creatine and whether or not it's effective. His conclusion is statistically yes it will help, but you have to overload it for about 2 weeks before you start seeing any effects and you need to be doing cardio as well to help with absorption/utilization. If you want to see his research his name is Dr. Philip Chilibeck and I think almost all of his published material is related to creatine studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body basically uses phosphates for all its energy needs. Each cell inside of you has stores of adenosine triphosphate that it uses to create the necessary energy required to perform its functions. The adenosine isn't quite what's important, as long as there's a phosphate, you're golden. When you load creatine, your body converts it to creatinine phosphate that it stores similarly to the ATP. I'm not sure about how/when it uses creatinine phosphate when there is abailable ATP, but the CP will he used when ATP gets low. This store of phosphate will allow you 1-3 extra reps at a near maximal load due to your muscle cells having a &quot;back up tank&quot; of energy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, creatine is the most studied supplement ever. It's not magic though, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/12701815/" target="_blank">this study</a> states it will help you lift anywhere from 5-15% more. So yeah it's good for maybe hitting a new record, getting one extra set in, or maybe a couple reps on your last set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, most people think test injections means bigger muscles, but the biggest effect from testosterone is increased recovery time. For example, if you are lifting and your maximum natural recovery allows 3 times a week, testosterone will let you life 5-7 times a week.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are also correct. Taking AAS and not lifting <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199607043350101" target="_blank">results in more hypertrophy than not taking AAS and lifting over 10 weeks</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone will do way more than help with recovery.  With just around 500mg per week most people will see an immediate jump in strength once it kicks in (about 2-3 weeks usually).  Recovery will improve, strength and performance for harder workouts will improve, mental function will often improve etc...  Additional PEDs will significantly enhance cardio/conditioning and make it extremely easy to lean out and maintain all strength gains.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ATP is stored in each individual cell. It is replenished quickly, which is why you only need to rest a minute or so between sets. If you exhaust one muscle of ATP, other muscles aren't exhausted. (But there are other factors at play.)</p></div>		</li>
