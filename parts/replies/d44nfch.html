			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound like the static friction between the road and wheels does negative work on you.  Isn't it actually the friction between your bearing and the wheels (also bearings and the axle) that's doing the negative work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's friction in all of the parts you mentioned, but for simplicity I just thought of the skateboard as a single system and ignored internal energy losses. The friction between the wheel surface and the road accounts for most of the contact friction that a skateboarder feels</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a good answer but this part is incorrect. As you said W=F*D,  as there is no displacement occurring between the wheel and the ground the friction force doesn't do any work. So the majority of dissipation occurs between wheel and axle. This is a textbook Physics I example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's the friction in the bearings that transfers the road friction to the boarder.  In an ideal skateboard (no bearing friction) your momentum wouldn't be reduced by the road.  So although it's technically correct that friction between the road and the wheel is slowing you down, this friction is not a bad thing (and you would have problems if you got rid of it: skid, skid, skid, how would you steer?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are correct that static friction does not do work, but there is still plenty of heat friction at the wheel/road interface, which does negative work. There are at least two sources: 1) there is a small amount of constant kinetic friction that is also occurring, especially at the points where the wheel just begins to contact the road, and where it just leaves the road. 2) the compression and contraction of the wheel and the road as they are pressed together generates internal friction and therefore heat loss. So yes, there is negative work being done at the wheel/road interface as well as in the bearings and other places. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is by far the best answer. It has everything to do with work. When on a skateboard, an initial pushing force gives you kinetic energy, and this energy decreases relatively slowly due to low friction, allowing you to coast a large distance.  Whereas walking requires a pushing force with each step, increasing the total work done. Each forward step actually applies a small frictional force on the ground in the opposite direction, in order to maintain balance and control speed.  This negative force is why we can't maintain momentum while walking in the same manner as we can with wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also altered depending on if the two are moving on a flat, inclined, or declined surface. </p>
<p>I would think skateboard would win on decline, and feet would win on incline, but that would depend on the grade of the angle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was thinking as well.  A person still has to put in a lot of work walking to keep the legs moving, even when going down a slope.  On a skateboard you just have to support yourself standing and maneuver, you gain kinetic energy a lot easier due to the wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously a skateboard would win on the decline, but there's no reason a walker would win on an incline. You still need to do the same amount of work to gain GPE regardless - it just comes down to efficiency.</p></div>		</li>
