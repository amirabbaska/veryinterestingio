<p>Does the saw blade shape of the milky way represent waves of ejecta further out on the spinning arms? What caused the uniform density patterns?</p>
<p>And would time tend to speed up near the center making the arms <em>straight</em> if a time/gravity sink did not exist in the center?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you see in any representation of the Milky Way is considered gravitationally bound. Heck, even our two closest galaxy neighbors are well bound to the Milky Way. The general hypothesis is that the Milky Way would have a much more dispersed and less rigid shape if all the matter were normal baryonic matter. The structure you see is largely driven by the massive dark matter cloud throughout the Milky Way. </p>
<p>I know very little about the time stuff, so no idea. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, they do not. Stars exist everywhere in the milky wave and what you see as &quot;arms&quot; are actually things called density waves. They travel around the galaxy, (so it looks rotating) but they are always comprised of different stars and are caused by resonances in the stars orbits.</p>
<p>You can imagine that similar to having to fly meshes that move relative to each other. You know that the grid is stable, but you will still see &quot;something&quot; (density waves) moving through them.</p>

<p>TBH I don't think the time dilation around the central supermassive black hole has much to do with the shape of the arms. In fact, while the black hole is big, the galaxy is much much much much bigger and a fair distance away, time dilation becomes pretty negligable. So no, I don't think the arms wold be straight.</p>
<p>Besides, we haven't found very few galaxies without a supermassive black in the middle, so it's pretty hard to tell.</p></div>		</li>
