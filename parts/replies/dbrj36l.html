			<div class="markdown"><p>But even Microsoft has trouble remembering and dealing with all their disallowed things.  See, for example using <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/com1.aspx" target="_blank"><code>com1</code> in a MS URL</a> compared to what happens if you use <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/sitter_thrash_unbars_prowl.aspx" target="_blank">something else that doesn't exist but isn't a sacred name</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when you get to this level of Windows/DOS, it's absolute junk. I feel like these days they would have improved those things, but I bet they're maintaining bug compatibility with, like, PC-DOS 2.0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, Mac OS has a related reserved use for colon. In Classic Mac OS (anything pre-OSX) paths were <del>comma</del> colon separated and started with the drive name (For example, &quot;MemoryBank:Users:foo:Desktop:bar.txt&quot;). </p>
<p>OSX, as a Unix system, <em>does</em> allow colons in the filename, but to keep classic Mac OS users from getting confused the Finder will display the filename with a '/' in place of the ':'. So the filename &quot;foo:bar&quot; will be displayed as &quot;foo/bar&quot; in the Finder.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed typo (thanks wfaulk!). In addition, his explanation for the behavior seems more likely than mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'd forgotten about this.  I suspect that the reason for it is the opposite of what you stated, though.  A user expected to be able to create a file or folder in the Finder with a slash in it.  To allow the user to do that, it translated it to a colon when saved to the filesystem.  Then when it reads it back, it translates it the other way.</p>

<p>I assume you meant to say &quot;colon separated&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that makes! It's also consistent - users would expect to be able to make files and folders with slashes in the names if they could do so in Classic Mac OS. Even worse, they had HFS support built in so you could cross-mount the old OS9 system into OSX, so they <em>had</em> to support filenames with slashes in them.</p></div>		</li>
