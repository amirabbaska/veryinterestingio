Where the Cows go Bong!<br />
and the monkeys all say BOO!<br />
There's a Nong Nang Ning<br />
Where the trees go Ping!<br />
And the tea pots jibber jabber joo.<br />
On the Nong Ning Nang<br />
All the mice go Clang<br />
And you just can't catch 'em when they do!<br />
So its Ning Nang Nong<br />
Cows go Bong!<br />
Nong Nang Ning<br />
Trees go ping<br />
Nong Ning Nang<br />
The mice go Clang<br />
What a noisy place to belong<br />
is the Ning Nang Ning Nang Nong!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a physical way to play with this. i is a front vowel, a is a middle vowel, o is a back vowel. Practice saying iiiiiiiiih aaaaaaah oooooh (like tick tack tock) and you can feel the the air and your tongue sort of move around in your mouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think it's more than just a psychological thing.  It's probably also physiological.  A few years ago I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDxFrwkiHIw" target="_blank">Tedx talk</a> about different dialects and accents.  The core of the talk, I think, was how since we do a lot of speaking (a repetitive activity), we develop energy-efficient ways to make the sounds that make up our language.  He said it was called <a href="https://borissoff.wordpress.com/tag/articulatory-setting/" target="_blank">articulatory setting</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, in the vast majority of English dialects, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are both front vowels. In fact, the short &quot;i&quot; -- [ɪ] in most dialects -- is slightly further back than the short &quot;a&quot;, which is [æ] or [a]. If you say &quot;aaaaaaah&quot;, then you're most likely pronouncing it either [äː] or [ɑː], depending on your dialect -- quite a different vowel.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you say &quot;iiiiiiiih&quot;, then you're pronouncing it [iː], which is further forward than [ɪ].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It almost certainly is physiological.  Instead of front to back, reduplications generally go from close to open vowels.  This happens across almost all languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, see /u/Derebear89 's post below to understand why it sounds weird to say &quot;tock tick tock tick tock tick&quot; on repeat (which still sounds weird compared to &quot;tick tock tick tock tick tock&quot;, which means the ablaut reduplication theory doesn't fully explain this). </p>
<p>Has to do with the pitch of our voice alternating along with the word, and therefore starting on the wrong word but using the original pitch pattern, you get an offset sounding pattern than you're not used to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes little sense because someone might inherently think of Tock as an Upbeat and Tick as the downbeat thus making pitch alternation not a variable.</p>
<p>Normally the Tick has what is called an upward inflection -- and the Tock a downward inflection.</p>
<p>Preserving the pitch or inflection still makes it sound weird -- if not moreso.  &quot;tock TICK tock TICK&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it might just be the way you hear it in your mind not an actual difference in sound.</p>
<p>A way to test this would be to record yourself saying tick tock tick tock ... Then tock tick tock tick ... Then, you can crop these files to make them start on a different work than in the original recording. You can then do a blind test and see if you can label the audio file snippets correctly better than a 50/50 chance.</p></div>		</li>
