			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, lactate (not lactic acid) is an intermediate stage in the production of energy for the muscle.  There are multiple pathways to produce energy the muscles can use, and lactate produced in one of the metabolic cycles.  The production of the lactate is not rate limited, but the mechanism that takes the next step to produce usable energy IS rate limited, so you can get a build up of lactate, but it pretty quickly gets metabolized into usable energy so nothing is left over to cause pain even a few minutes after exercising.</p>
