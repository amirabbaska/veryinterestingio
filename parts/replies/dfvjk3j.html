			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that logic, but how do we refute or ignore the logic that says &quot;Every value between 0-1 also exists between 0-2. Additionally, for each value between 0-1, an additional value exists between 1-2, therefore the set of all values beween 0-2 is strictly larger than the set of all values between 0-1.&quot; Using this logic I can map each number between 0-1 to exactly 2 numbers between 0-2. Is it just a rule that says &quot;if a one to one mapping exists, then they are the same size, regardless if other mappings exist&quot;? If that is the convention, why does a one to one mapping take precedent over the one to two mapping? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just that <del>set theory</del> <em>edit: comparing infinite set sizes</em> works differently than seems intuitive when working with natural (whole), finite numbers. You can't just try to find one example that makes two sets seem different sizes, and then stop there. As long as you can show at least one way that the two sets map 1-to-1 onto each other, they are the same size.</p>
<p>Using your method, you could &quot;prove&quot; that [0,2] is SMALLER than [0,1]. Just take each number between 0 and 2, and map them to a number .25 of their value. This makes it seem like [0,2] is the same size as [0,0.5], and therefore smaller than [0,1] - which is obviously untrue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, you can 1 to 1 map every number from 0-0.5 to every number between 0-2. And by that logic the sizes of those infinities are the same. I understand that. </p>
<p>I guess I worded my logic wrong. What I meant to say is that for every number between 0-1, we can find the same number between 0-2. But we can also find an additional number in the set 0-2 that does not exist in the set 0-1. For example, we see the number 0.123 in the set 0-1. We can find 0.123 in the set 0-2, but also find a corresponding 1.123 which does not exist in the set 0-1. Since every number within the 0-1 set also exists within the 0-2 set, but we have shown that there are other numbers within the 0-2 set that do not exist in the 0-1 set, then the set of 0-2 must be STRICTLY GREATER than the 0-1 set. </p>
<p>I'm not doubting that mathematical convention dictates that these infinities are the same size, I just need help resolving the fact that the amount of numbers in the 0-2 set seems to meets the definition of strictly greater than amount of numbers in the 0-1 set, yet they are the same size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure one would describe that mapping as for each value between 0 and 1 (a) there exists a value between 0 and 2 (b) such that b = 2*a. The mapping from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 is making the argument that 2x infinity is larger than infinity, but infinity isn't a number so that operation isn't defined. The only way I'm aware of to distinguish different types of infinity is to have a countably infinite set (integers) or an uncountably infinite set (rational numbers). I'm still not sure one could say either set is larger than the other though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Demand precision, that is the solution. When comparing the size of infinite sets the first thing that has to go out of the window is our naive, finite-biased intuition. There is no &quot;one to two&quot; mapping between [0,1] and [0,2], and if you could prove such a mapping existed you would overturn modern mathematics (analysis, to be precise) at its foundations. </p>
<p>Your claim that &quot;for every number between 0 and 1 there is another between 1 and 2&quot; is correct, but it misses the point. Consider the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,...(onwards forever)}. If I take each number in this set and multiply it by 10, the resulting set is {10,20,30,...}. Is this second set any smaller than the first? If so then on what basis? How can scaling the elements in the set make the set smaller?  But what about all the &quot;missing&quot; elements? That's the delightfully intricate paradox of the infinite. Look up Hilbert's hotel. </p>
<p>Let me explain more directly. The concept of same size for finite sets is obvious: just count the elements in two sets and if the numbers you get are the same then they're the same size. But when the sets in consideration become infinite, it's no longer possible to count them. So, since we're interested in comparing the relative sizes of sets, we use a definition which makes no direct mention of their actual sizes, since they have infinite size. That's why the one-to-one mapping idea is so popular, because it's a logically cohesive way of capturing an idea we have in the finite case while extending it to the infinite.</p></div>		</li>
