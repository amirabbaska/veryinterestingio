			<div class="markdown"><p>As soon as we're dealing with something like that, it actually already exists, it's called ECMO (Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation).  This basically oxygenates and ventilates your blood, but it has to run basically all of your blood through this system constantly.  This is VERY invasive and also has really stringent requirements for use.</p>
<p>Creating a military application could be possible.  I think they did this on an episode of star trek back whenever, I think they called it a blood gas diffuser or something and it would keep someone alive for 30 minutes (conveniently the length of an episode) while their lungs were stolen or something.  I think something along the lines of this is already in the works. </p>
<p>Miniaturizing and optimizing ECMO would basically be this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you silly goose. When Neelix got his lungs stolen they made him a pair of holographic lungs, so the blood has infuser only had to work long enough for the doctor to come up with the holographic lung idea.... not the whole episode.</p>
<p>It's an understandable mistake though because the natural response is to say &quot;this is stupid and I'm glad neelix is dying and turn off the episode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gov probably already has working miniaturized models I'd bet, but probably pretty hard to get down to a working field size with current tech (that's a lot of blood to pump afterall) </p>
<p>It would be a game changer for navy seals I'd imagine.  Easier than a rebreather though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that's more of a problem of practicality/scale than possibility, though, right?  Surely we can oxygenate a liquid faster than a human can consume it, pump the liquid faster than a human needs it, and scrub the CO2 faster than a human can produce it, if we aren't limited by size or efficiency constraints.  But doing all of that on a scale that might be useful, with no risk to the human is a whole different thing.  Or am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the main problem is getting the C02 out of the lungs and into the liquid fast enough. Passive osmotic pressure through the lungs requires the partial pressure of C02 in the liquid to be lower than in the blood (about 40mm of mercury) and a given volume of fluid (liquid or normal gas) can only absorb so much C02.</p>
<p>There are 2 general avenues to try to address this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase the flow rate of the medium through the lungs so that you contantly have near 0mm mercury C02 in the fluid in the lungs to maximimize passive absorbtion.</p>
</li>
<li>Use a medium which more readily bonds with C02 so that any volume of fluid in the lungs can absorb more C02. This would presumably require some external equipment to strip the C02 out of the liquid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general proposed medium for liquid ventilation is perflorocarbon. It's about 850 times as dense as air and would need to move through at a rate of 5L/min to handle a normal resting metabolism. That flow rate may not immediately shred your lungs but it would certainly damage them.</p>
<p>Stripping C02 out of fluids isn't a problem. That's what rebreathers do (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebreather" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebreather</a>). But fluids that pull C02 out agressively enough tend to be pretty toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking to your flight buddies nearby on the radio, will be fun in liquid too.  It might work, sound does carry better in water, but human vocal cords weren't really designed for that.  I'm unsure about the quality of the audio, or how fast they'd fatigue.</p></div>		</li>
