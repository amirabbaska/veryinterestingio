			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we get an ELI5 of this comment?
I’m confused on the vocabulary “stools” “still” what’s the frame your speaking of?</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll leave my comment but I re-read the original like 10 times and I think I understand haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;stools&quot; is a typo. Basically imagine a piece of glass with paint on it. You draw a still frame of a character and put it over the frame of a background. You can have multiple layers to give depth when you view it with a camera. Because you aren't changing the background every scene you only need to redraw the transparent &quot;still&quot; that you are changing. You use the previous one as a reference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I misspelled stills as stools via autocorrect.</p>
<p>A still is a single picture. The stills are put together on video tape to create a 'moving' image... Together they move. Alone there still. Thus stills.</p>
<p>The frame is the square edge of the video tape still. It has a specific size. </p>
<p>So, to take a bunch of stills and make them into a video they put the stills into a &quot;frame&quot; and then take a picture of it. There will be a still of the background, one of the character, maybe one of foreground. They're all laid on top of each other to create a single frame.</p>
<p>To make it look like the character is moving through the background and foreground, they can slide the be still left or right in the frame and take the picture.</p>
<p>I hope I didn't confuse this worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just in case your still shaky on it:</p>
<p>&quot;Stools&quot; is probably an autocorrect error of &quot;stills&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stills&quot; refers to the still images used as backgrounds in animation</p>
<p>&quot;Frame&quot; refers to individual images that make up a animated movie (think frames-per-second)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the process he described is called cel-animation, in case you wanted to look it up. Basically its layers. The bottom layer is the background and only needs drawn once. If you have two characters that move independently of each other, sometimes one is still but the other moves, those also might be on different layers. They also used something called rotoscoping, which is basically having a film as a reference to plot movement so that its more realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Occasionally for old movies you'll notice reused animations between them, such as a dance from Snow White and the lady from Robin Hood. Occasionally the higher ups order they use old resources, and trace the poses. Funnily enough, it's not <em>really</em> a shortcut, the time spent searching through old cells and redrawing the poses was often greater than the time it would take to make fresh cells.</p></div>		</li>
