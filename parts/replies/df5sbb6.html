			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda feel bad, for pretty much everyone here (except for the negligent driller, I guess). I doubt the home owner had any idea what exactly was happening. Isn't there some sort of consumer protection from this shit, it's not like the home owner just drilled down there himself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the owner's responsibility to hire a qualified contractor(s).  Because the contractor was not qualified, the owner is definitely on the hook.<br />
If the contractor was qualified, and ran into this problem, then only the contractor would be on the hook. Doesn't fix the running away problemâ€‹ though.<br />
The running away problem can be covered via the owner paying for performance and payment bonds, as well as contractor-side liability insurance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel bad but also jealous. My town is so small it apparently has no access to an aquifer, and year-round hosepipe bans as a result. Can't set up the sprinkler for the kids if it is hot, can't wash the car, can't water the lawn. </p>
<p>Sorry, first world problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be a constant line of trucks going through what is a quiet residential area.  You don't really see the volume coming out until right at the end where you see the gushing flow going into the drain.</p>
<p>We are talking half a million gallons <em>PER DAY</em>.  Also note that report is now a year old.  The pipes are still there and we haven't heard of much progress.  (I actually live not too far from this)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some interest in this as it is actually close to where I live.  We drive by here often and when the pipes suddenly appeared over a year ago we wondered what it was.  Finally managed to catch a news report on it.</p></div>		</li>
