			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh that makes a lot of sense, thank you very much for taking the time to reply. </p>
<p>I was unaware that the bail money was repaid to the defendant upon court appearance and that bail limits were set at the judge's discretion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also scaled, or supposed to be, with the defendant's ability to pay. In theory bail is supposed to be an amount of money that will be non-trivial for the defendant to lose, but also not impossible to pay.</p>
<p>This as you can imagine has varied mileage. Often most devastatingly in the set too high for poor people, forcing them to sit in jail and lose their jobs as a result.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To expand on this, that's also where bail bondsmen and bounty hunters (two other things that tend to confuse Europeans) come in. Bail bondsmen will put up your bail for a fraction of the money, usually around 10%. You pay the bondsman $500, they pay the $5000 bail that you don't have, and your relative can go free before trial. However, if your relative skips town and doesn't show up for the trial, the bondsman is in danger of losing their money. They can then hire a bounty hunter to find your relative and bring them in to get their money back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to put it out there; this system does still exist in England &amp; Wales (where the US inherited it from).</p>
<p>The person paying can pay a security or promise money as a surety, and the amount can be set at the discretion of the court. </p>
<p>As a high profile example, the people who acted as sureties for Julian Assange didn't get most of their money back, which they'd paid into court as collateral. </p>

<p>We just don't use it as much as Americans, and it can't be used for Police bail. I.e. you actually have to be charged with something.</p>
<p>Most of the time, bail is given as a matter of course, and the restrictions are usually exclusion zones or curfews, rather than money paid into court. </p>
<p>It's only really used for very serious crimes where there's a genuine risk of absconding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is certainly sometimes almost impossible to pay. At 18 I was accused of possession of child pornography for a girl sending me unsolicited pictures from my high school. I was arrested and my bail was $100,000. I was 18...
Charges were dropped but it was still a big deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of it isn't. Because most bonds in the US are set exorbitantly high (for a lot of reasons, mostly political), the vast majority of people who are arrested cannot afford them. So they go to licensed bail bondsmen to pay their bonds. </p>
<p>At least where I live (not Ohio, despite my username), the fee for a bondsman is 10% - 15% of the bond; for higher bonds (again, where I live, typically bonds $25,000 or higher) they'll require a co-signer to guarantee the bond or collateral of somekind. That money is not refunded at the end of the case.</p>
<p>I've been a public defender for almost a decade, and I bet there's been less than a dozen times one of my clients has paid a cash bond, meaning they paid the whole amount up front to be entitled to it's return at the end of their case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AUSA here.  Yeah the bond system in many states can be really punishing. This is why the federal system requires the judge to give the defendant a bond he can actually pay.  Federal judges actually have to have a colloquy with the defendant to understand their finances before determining the bond amount.  For indigent defendants, you'll often see bond set at $5-10k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all states have typical bondsmen though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bailbond.com/massachusetts" target="_blank">Here is how it works in MA:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court of Massachusetts has condoned a practice that makes commercial surety bail virtually non-existent in that State. Judges, Clerk-Magistrates and Commissioners will usually set both a surety bond amount and a cash bail amount. Typically, the cash bail is 10% of the surety bond amount. So, the defendant has a choice: Pay the bail agent a non-refundable premium of $1,000 on a $10,000 surety bond, or pay a $1,000 cash bond to the court and receive a refund when the defendant appears and the case is resolved. Of course, most people pay the cash bail in hopes of the refund. There may also be a bail fee of $25 which seems to be collected by police and kept by the Clerk-Magistrates and Commissioners.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also for those who &quot;skip bail,&quot; meaning they've paid bail only to miss their next court date, these people are sometimes &quot;held without bail&quot; meaning they have no bail.  </p>
<p>Also the most heinous of crimes like murder are automatic without-bail charges.  There usually is no bail for a murder charge.</p>
<p>Also, when the judge releases you in good faith that you'll return on your own free will, he's releasing you on &quot;personal recognizance.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're wrong about &quot;heinous crimes&quot; like &quot;murder&quot; automatically not being bailable. This is extremely dependent on jurisdiction. I would note that a cursory Google search shows that most jurisdictions do seem to have bail for a murder offense, but it may be the judges discretion  (which is why it's news when someone is held &quot;without bail,&quot; it wouldn't be newsworthy to note that if there wasn't the possibility of bail on the charge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some states have laws against 'no bail'. I learned this when a detective testified at extradition that the defendant had a no bail warrant in another state. My motion to reconsider included the fact that that state does not have a 'no bail' status like the instant jurisdiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with this, you can pay a bail bondsman 10% of the bail for them to &quot;loan&quot; you the full amount to give to the court. If you pay the court directly, you get the full amount back. If you use a bondsman, he pays the court and gets it all back if you show up, and keeps your 10%. If you skip town, they now have to find you on behalf of the court to get their money back. They will pay a bounty, and licensed bounty hunters will try to find you.</p>
<p>Edit:
/u/chrisberman410 pointed out that the bondsman puts down 10% to the court, but assumes all liability</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bounty Hunter here. The bondsman usually pays the court 10%. If you go to court, they get that back. If you don't, they pay us the 10% because, if not, they have to give the court 100% of the bail. And we prefer the term &quot;Fugitive Recovery Agent.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bail is also proportional to the likelihood of a suspect showing up for their court date. If you were a known gang member with no ties to international crime or little to no resources you may have bail set at $10-15,000 for a felony. If you were a organized crime member with ties to international crime and resources to make an escape of the country then you may have a million dollar bail or no bail set and held until trial.  </p></div>		</li>
