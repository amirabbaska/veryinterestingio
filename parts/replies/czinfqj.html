<p>For clarification purposes, thats not always true. </p>
<p>For most of the everyday applications of fiberglass, it uses the random fiber layout setup because its cheaper to produce non-woven fibers and in a lot of cases not worrying about the layout allows it to be sprayed into place which also reduces production time of large items and reduce overall costs. The drawback to this is that you need a thick layer of non-woven fiberglass to make up for the weak structural design of non-woven materials and thickness makes those things heavy.</p>
<p>But there are also plenty of examples out there of woven fiberglass fabric used in composite structures. And the type of weave determines what directions stress can be handled and even which directions bending will be allowed and how much. Like the limbs of a fiberglass bow. Hell, you can go to your local harware store and buy a &quot;patch kit&quot; that has woven fiberglass fabric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, while at my internship last year they switched over from using spray-fiberglass to using woven meshes in the construction of vehicle operator platforms to reduce weight, which is an important factor when these things are being lifted 100+ feet into the air with complicated hydraulics. Ballpark numbers I heard was that the weight of the platform was reduced by half.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CF is strong mostly because of the reduction of impurities, which is what you were getting at for the glass. Good explanation otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
