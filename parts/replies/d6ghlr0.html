			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a thing when I had bad allergies where it felt like insides of my elbows got hit by a 2x4 after sneezing. My hands would go all weak afterwards. I found a group of people with the same symptoms on the internet, mostly guys in their 20s. None of them got any conclusive diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>
