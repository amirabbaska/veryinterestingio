			<div class="markdown"><p>That graphic is neat. I went camping back in October in Michigan's upper peninsula. The camp ground (if you call it that) was a series of lakes. You'd canoe in and portage between lakes to get to various camping spots along the shores. </p>
<p>Anyway at one particular portage between two lakes (not an especially long one, maybe 200 feet), one of the guys who lives in the area pointed out a ridge along the path and explained how that spot was the continental divide. Any water that fell on the north side would ultimately drain towards the great lakes, anything that fell on the south would drain towards the Mississippi. I struggled to imagine it at the time but looking at this graphic I can see right where he was talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a geology student and can confirm that most of the reading material on watersheds can get a bit dense.  </p>
<p>If you want a good rule of thumb, look at a river, and then look at all the topographic highs (mountains, ridges, etc.) that surround it.  Draw a line from peak to peak and you've done a good enough job at delineating a watershed that it's good enough for any lay uses.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the non-coastal effects on watersheds from sea level rise ? The effects I am thinking about include :</p>
<p>Newly inundated land will have a higher water table. The land next to the new coastline will also have to have a higher water table. And land next to that land â€¦ . Water table rise won't be uniform because the ground is not uniform. Will there will be changes in levels and flows throughout the watershed ?</p>
<p>When the outlets of rivers become part of the sea, that part of the watershed becomes flooded. Does this reduce floodwater storage capacity ? Will floods in the watershed be higher and last longer because the drainage outlet is in a state of permanent flood ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also lake watersheds.  Many lakes are municipal water sources, so any land whose water flows into those lakes may have use restrictions.</p>
<p>I once was looking into buying some property to build a home, and found out the property was in a watershed where only homes could be built - no exterior buildings larger than a large doghouse.  This rule was enacted to keep people from raising chickens and other livestock, the poop of which would end up in the city's water.</p></div>		</li>
