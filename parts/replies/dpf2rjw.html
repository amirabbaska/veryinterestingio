			<div class="markdown"><p>I think others have provided good answers, but being <em>conscious</em> is the element of <em>being aware</em>. And being aware, by definition, requires thought. There are ongoing debates on whether or not people in vegetative states are conscious. This is because they show no signs of being aware (note: some may be paralyzed and be completely aware, but there is no way to tell.. And that's why pulling the plug is a pretty big ethical issue). You can be <em>awake</em>, but <em>unconscious</em> in that regard. </p>
<p>The reflex analogy is a good one. You have to be awake to react to certain things. But not every reaction has to be an conscious one. Not every reaction requires for you to be <em>aware</em> of it beforehand. When you suddenly break a bone, do you make an aware decision to wince in pain? Or does it come automatically before you have time to think? You may be aware of the pain after. But did you make an aware decision to wince? This is what people define as a subconscious reaction.</p></div>		</li>
