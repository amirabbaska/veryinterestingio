			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, I do this myself. It's much easier to get eggshell out using another piece of eggshell. Sometimes you do fuck up and drop it, so then you have two bits of eggshell to fish out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you use another eggshell piece to fish it out, you will have more success, the sharp edge of the other eggshell will &quot;cut&quot; through the egg and let you grab the other piece. </p>

<p>Wetting your finger with cold water works as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the point above, if you do want to remove  the eggshell, wet your finger with water before you dip into egg yolk. I dont remember where I read this tip, but it seems to be working most of the times. </p></div>		</li>
