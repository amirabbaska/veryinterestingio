<p>It is important to remember what stable means. In many cases it means the isotope will not decay for a very long time. Many &quot;stable&quot; isotopes actually decay.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to go even deeper, what I find fascinating is that you could even say that the only <em>truly</em> stable nucleus is Ni-62. The reason is that as you know when you look at a chart of the <a href="http://imgur.com/ALrX4dE" target="_blank">binding energy per nucleon</a>, Ni-62 sits at the very top, meaning that you could always release energy by allowing other nuclei to decay and fuse into Ni-62. But of course, in reality is point is almost meaningless since it would take a really, really, really long time for this process to occur. In <a href="http://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.51.447" target="_blank">a beautiful paper from a few decades ago</a>, Freeman Dyson estimated that for all the nuclei in the universe to undergo such a process would take a whopping ~ 10^1500 years!^(1)</p>
<p>And of course, even this last point is moot since we would never actually get to this situation. Almost all the modern theories we have suggest that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay" target="_blank">the proton itself is unstable and that it can decay</a> long before that. Stability is never completely clear-cut but depends on the context and the timescale we are interested in.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> This value was actually calculated for Fe-56, rather than Ni-62.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Thanks to /u/tauneutrino9 I corrected the answer to reflect that Ni-62 has the highest binding energy per nucleon; fixed units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fe-56 is not the most stable.  Ni-62 is the most stable isotope.  It is a common misconception since Fe-56 is produced in stars at a higher rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was aware that Ni-62 had the largest binding energy <em>per nucleon,</em> but I thought the fact that Fe-56 had the lowest mass per nucleon would be more important (which is why I stressed the mass in my answer). However, after re-reading <a href="http://www.physics.smu.edu/scalise/quarknet2008/FewellAJP000653.pdf" target="_blank">Fewell's famous paper on this topic</a>, I have to agree with you that Ni-62 actually fits the bill better for what I was trying to say. Thanks, for the reminder, I'll fix the answer above to avoid being misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off topic, the earth's inner core is made of Ni and Fe. Since they are both produced in high rate in stars, is it common for planets to have an active, Ni Fe core?</p>
<p>Also, how come the Earth, out of the many planets and moons in our solar system is one of the only with such a core (correct me if I'm mistaken)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard/read somewhere that Ni-62 isn't stable enough in extremely high temperatures, which leads to Fe-56 winning the race. Is it true? Or was there another mechanism which somehow produces more Fe-56?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the whole, because the binding energy of the proton is more than the sum of the parts it would decay in (not sure which ones). But keep in mind that proton decay is a phenomenon which emerge in some versions of String Theory and is far from certain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the first time I've seen the concept of equilibrium invoked in nuclear physics. (Not to say I'm a physicist, I'm a biochemist, so it's interesting to see such a familiar concept come up here.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't equilibrium usually refer to a system in which the reaction can go either direction depending on concentration? In this case though, the remaining Technetium will only ever decay to lighter elements, and those light elements will not (essentially never) spontaneously reform in to Tc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're certainly not wrong, but here's what led me to my comment. There are plenty of chemical reactions that are virtually irreversible, but the fact that the same atoms could in theory rearrange themselves back &quot;to the left&quot; still makes it an equilibrium; in general all reactions can be thought of as an equilibrium, with the Keq covering an extremely wide range. It's also worth noting that if you changed the reaction conditions, you could force an irreversible reaction back to its starting state. </p>
<p>Now as I said I know jack squat about nuclear physics, but reading over the explaination, I was wondering, how would the Tc nucleus <em>know</em> that the adjacent nuclei are more stable? And in my head, I likened it to chemical equilibrium: it is easier for the Tc proton to get into the &quot;beta decay transition state&quot; and into the &quot;Mo phase&quot;, just as it is easier for acetic acid to get out of the organic phase and into the water phase, and spends virtually all its time there.  </p>
