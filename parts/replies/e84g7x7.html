			<div class="markdown"><p>How true is that though? While pure water has quite low conductivity, it still is order of magnitudes higher than typical insulators.</p>
<p>I also wonder about the mechanism of conductivity in water, such as proton exchange and molecule alignment.</p>
<p>I reckon proton exchange may assist DC current conduct, but could molecular rotations cause AC to conduct more effectively? I.e. when an electrical potential is applied to water, molecules should align due to their polarity. If the potential is switched, the molecule could rotate to project that new electric field.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe the polar bonding is too strong, and I'm honestly just spitballing, but my curiosity is peaked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is very hard to change this point using electricity. It would take a huge voltage to noticeable change this point and as far as I'm aware this hasn't been shown experimentally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have more information on this? Why would electricity change the freezing point at all? Why would higher voltage make a difference? How huge is &quot;huge&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just looked it up to refresh my memory. The idea is that if you can create an electric field of about 10^9 V/m then simulations predict that this would align the dipoles of water molecules, thus making it easier for the water to freeze into a polar form of ice. </p>
