			<div class="markdown"><p>In traditional Chinese medicine, cold water is bad for you. Even soft drinks are usually served room temperature.<br />
Even if you don't believe in this, if everyone else around you does it, you get used to it too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This belief extends to Korea too. A lot of people think cold water is bad for you, especially during a meal. Many people drink water after a meal.</p>
<p>Seems less common than 10 years ago though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember they say the cold temperature in your warm body is bad for you or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can find an answer on google and give you a more definite answer.</p>
<p>Edit, found this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Others go further into the &quot;science&quot; of it, alleging that cold liquids solidify fats in your stomach, which can cause digestive problems, whereas hot liquids aid in digestion. Still others cite the habit as having stemmed from the traditional need to boil water before drinking it to remove germs (and indeed, even today, you're probably going to get sick if you don't boil Chinese tapwater before drinking it). Most people, though, will probably give you the same answer I just got from a friend: &quot;It's good for your health.&quot;</p>
