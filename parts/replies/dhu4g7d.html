			<div class="markdown"><p>Another scenario to think of would be what the world would be like if the oceans were fresh water and were filled with plants and animals that live in fresh water.  Obviously if the ocean lost its salt tomorrow and everything died it would be a horrible problem, but if the oceans were basically giant lakes instead there would be more subtile differences that would still be interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if it was a gradual transition, say 100-200 years.  And someone cleaned the dead stuff so that excess decomposition products were kept normal.  What would the effects be on animal life and how would the climate change?  </p>
<p>*I realize I'm spinning this topic like a 5-year old.  Maybe I should've asked what the organisms/Earth might look like if the oceans were fresh all along?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fresh water tends to not have much evolutionary competition, since salt water keeps migration to a minimum. There would be big upheavals in regular freshwater ecosystems.  Then there is all the stuff that will now be able to spread to the sea since they wouldn't be stopped by salt water.  You would probably never swim in the ocean again, alligators, piranhas, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're being back into the territory of the first posted answer: the coasts would experienced increases erosion, plate dynamics world change (because they're enabled by water reactions with the crust), currents would mix, climates would swing wildly, and food chains would collapse.</p>
<p>It would probably rival all past mass extinctions. The final composition of the sea, land, air, and the state of the weather and biosphere... Impossible to predict, currently.</p></div>		</li>
