			<div class="markdown"><p>the amount of latent thermal energy in steam is unreal compared to other realistic mediums. Superheated steam, even better. Supercritical steam? Amazing.</p>
<p>No other readily available medium can transfer energy as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the water is rarely disposed as it is condensed and run back through the system almost endlessly. If anything, more water is added as there is always some steam leakage or intentional venting going on. For instance, if a power plant has a sudden need to slow down electricity production due to switching on the grid, they often release most of the steam in the system to slow down the generator(s). I was at a power plant when this was done. Very freaking loud, which is a good reason everyone has hearing protection that works there.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel it's worth mentioning that Supercritical Carbon Dioxide has some very attractive properties, and is being studied as an alternative to steam in some specific applications.  It ultimately uses the same basic principles though, so you're still setting off a reaction to heat a thermodynamic cycle.</p></div>		</li>

Feel free to ask me anything about these awesome cycles. Also, if you work in industry and are interested, I recommend attending the sCO2 symposium in Pittsburgh next March. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure, and wind power is... something like that too.  probably some semantics to the definition of a turbine, but the ultimate logic for almost any generator is that a liquid or gas spins a fan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say something about hydro being gravity based and steam being thermal expansion based but then I realized, they're both dealing with motion caused by a liquid-gas-liquid cycle. </p>
<p>Now I'm wondering, do steam generator plants ever try to capture energy from the falling condensed water as well as the steam? Or would that just interrupt the cycle in a way that would end up being less efficient than leaving it alone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in the form of hydroelectric plants. <em>ha ha</em></p>
<p>I would say the falling condensed water is pretty small potatoes compared to the bulk energy being created by the heat.  Gravity is pretty weak comparatively.</p>
<p>I'd guess it's simpler to just let the steam rise out of the generator and join the ecosystem that try to capture it and risk an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. We actually condense the water under vacuum, which increases the pressure drop in the low pressure turbines and increases the output. </p>
<p>At the plant I work at, we're pushing water at a rate of 6.5 million pounds per hour through the boiler. At peak load we generate 830 MW in each unit. The amount of energy you're talking about capturing is pretty trivial on that scale. </p></div>		</li>
