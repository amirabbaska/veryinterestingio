			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-hydrogen is the most simple antimatter to make, due to hydrogen being the simplest element. Anti-hydrogen exists of one positron and one anti-proton. Due to the volatility of antimatter making more complex matter like iron would be extremely difficult. I'm not sure if anyone has succeeded in creating more complex atoms, although it should theoretically be possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anti-helium was also produced, but there are no means of trapping it. Anti-hydrogen at least can be now trapped and stored for tests.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, this is really interesting! I assume we're talking just a small number of atoms, right? How are they even stored? The idea of keeping something away from ALL matter just blows my mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's incredibly hard, perhaps even impossible.</p>
<p>To create anti hydrogen, you first need to create positrons (anti-electrons): those are released by the decay of some radioactive elements, so production is not a big issue. You have however to make sure that your positron does not collide with an electron, and there are <em>many</em> of those (order of 10^23 electrons per gram of matter). You'd have to send your positron into a perfect vacuum and trap it using an electric field, such that it does not collide with the walls of your vacuum chamber.</p>
<p>Then you have to produce anti-protons. CERN makes those by sending regular protons against a block of metal, creating a load of particles in the process including anti-protons. Those anti-protons having a very high energy, they need to be decelerated using electric fields and then trapped in the very same way than positrons.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to send the positrons against the anti-protons, such that they interact and bind together to form a anti-hydrogen atom. When you have your anti-atom, it's electrically neutral so you cannot trap it with an electric field. Instead CERN uses a magnetic field. </p>
<p>To make heavier atoms, you need anti-neutrons. Those are electrically neutral and cannot be trapped by electric fields like positrons and anti-protons. You'd need to have a way to trap anti-neutrons and move them around freely to meet with the other constituents ... which is currently impossible to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>
