<p>There was a sort of a public hearing/meeting here at Berkeley recently, having to do with sexual assault policy for the UC system. Several administrators said directly and in no uncertain terms that they are willing to work with the police upon request, but have absolutely zero interest in referring or taking anything to the police. </p>
<p>Their only interest was in establishing a label and judgement, by their own metrics, as to whether or no someone was a &quot;rapist&quot;, or has committed a &quot;sexual assault&quot;. Again, openly admitted that these endpoints were defined by their value system, entirely divorced from the laws of the land.</p>
<p>I should have had the presence of mind to record it, since it was pretty surprising to hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is currently an act in congress that is meant to address this issue. Title IX requires schools to coordinate with local police, but the new act will dish out penalties in the tune of 2% of profits per year of violation, or at least that was what was proposed.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> working with police does not mean a requirement to report to police, that is always going to be the victim's call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't Title IX require schools to report? We just had similar meetings at the school I work at and ours was... very different. We are basically required to accommodate any students that disclose sexual assault and we are also required to report them to our Title IX coordinator so that they can deal with it and assist the student.</p>
<p>Edit: nvm I'm wrong about the reporting requirement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a university police officer for about 3 years.  The housing department was caught trying to cover up a sexual assault that occurred in the dorms. I have no idea how many they successfully covered up. The school will try to cover up these issues for PR purposes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad was a cop way back in the day and remembers an instance where a local college was suppressing a bunch of rapes that happened to be the work of a serial rapist (the rapes were uncovered when they found the rapist and saw his trophies represented many more victims than were originally reported. Plus, some victims came forward after the arrest). </p>
<p>The mayor of the city was <em>not</em> happy when he learned about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened with two friends, years apart, where I went to college. One was a family friend a few years prior to my attending college, the other was a friend who was in my dorm building. Both reported their rapes to campus police, both were pressured by the admin and campus officers to keep the incident quiet, mainly through guilting and shaming, to not report it to other authorities, and to drop out. One did, one didn't, but neither cases went anywhere. The furthest one incident went was checking to see if the alleged rapist was part of the frat he claimed to be in, which he wasn't, so the frat that held the party wasn't responsible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems odd.  I work for housing for a private college and wouldn't have any personal incentive or benefit to covering up something like this.  In fact, I'd be fired if I didn't report something like that.  I'm speculating but I would guess that directive came from someone higher up with more stake in the reputation of the school, like the VP of Student Affairs or someone like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, <em>man</em>, I wish someone who was offered that would blow the whistle somehow. Record the conversation, maybe. If a couple of administrators lost their careers over cover-ups, maybe the rest of them wouldn't be so eager to engage in that kind of nonsense.</p></div>		</li>
