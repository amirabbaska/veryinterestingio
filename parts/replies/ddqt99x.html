			<div class="markdown"><p>You're entirely correct! The movie definitely depicts that accident as happening prior to developing the first nuclear bomb. But the actual date of Slotins accident was May 21, 1946.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea and I'm desperate to find out because it sounds interesting, however it doesn't seem long enough to make a whole movie out, so could it possibly be a show, and then maybe be &quot;Eureka&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly it also goes heavily into the testing of nukes and the changes in safety procedures in regards to exposure to tests.</p>
<p>One of the early scenes they have soldiers in a trench before a nuke test being told &quot;being X distance away is safe, and your maximum exposure is y&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the later scenes of the film, I think the character who was someone who had been told the above as part of his induction, walked past a similar briefing and they were saying &quot;being 5X distance away is safe, and your maximum exposure is y/10&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
