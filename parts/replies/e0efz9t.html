<p>we have a greater density of sebaceous glands on the face and the skin is complex</p>

<p>Is there an evolutionary theory as to why this is the case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve also read somewhere that our facial hairs stopped growing pretty quickly, evolutionarily speaking, and that the oils are there to lubricate and facilitate the growth that used to happen there. I’ll try to source this when not on mobile. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't seem right to say that our face moves more than most other parts of our body. And I have to ask, how forcefully are people touching your face that it needs lubrication for evolutionary advantage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely because we have so many orifices on the face. Sweat has antimicrobal qualities. </p>
<p>Not because skin is complex or whatever else was written here. Good question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A higher sebaceous activity also means a higher bacterial population. Our faces carry relatively large amounts of skin flora. You could say they're one of the dirtiest areas of our skin, even more so than, say, your buttocks.</p></div>		</li>
