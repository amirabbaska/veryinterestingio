			<div class="markdown"><p>OP - if you want to read more about the process /u/brezzz is talking about, read the book &quot;World Without End&quot; buy Ken Folllett. Aside from being an AMAZING piece of historical fiction, it really outlines this process well. </p>
<p>Edit: &quot;by,&quot; not &quot;buy.&quot; my bad!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>World With Out End brought me back from a dark and lonely time. I had gone years just reading drivel it was the only thing available then stumbled across an English copy in a desolated bargain bin. 12 hour train ride and I was restored. Nothing but the best. Rereads of Dune, the Wheel of Time, 3 part series on the Civil War. </p>
<p>Years later I'd forgotten the book title and author, only haunting visions of the scenes it contained. Met a girl, fell in love, and she started to tell me about this great book she had just read. Just describing one scene I knew she was describing that book, and I knew I was going to marry her. </p></div>		</li>

Aside from the brilliant characters and story, there's a ton of really interesting, well-researched historical architecture and construction action. Really fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand from reading that comment, they pretty much made 2 bridge sized dams in the water and removed the water with buckets (think Moses partying the Red Sea), they build the bridge, then remove the dams. I have no idea if I'm correct though as this explanation is not that clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that you wouldn't try to dam the entire river, which would be astoundingly difficult.  For a simple example of a bridge with two piers, you'd build a U shaped cofferdam out from one shore to where you wanted one pier, get enough water out to build the pier, then let the cofferdam fall apart, and repeat the process from the other side.  Once you have the two piers you build an arch from one shore to the first pier, an arch between the piers, and then an arch to the other shore.</p>
<p>The idea is that you let the river keep flowing around the work on one side or the other, and not try to block the whole river at once.</p></div>		</li>
