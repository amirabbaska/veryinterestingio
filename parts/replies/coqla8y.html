			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The classical picture of interacting solids was electrostatic repulsion, but in 1967 Freeman Dyson and collaborators showed that electron degeneracy pressure was the dominant mechanism for the &quot;imperviousness of solids&quot; as Wikipedia puts it. </p>
<p>Dyson's three publications on this topic are below (probably paywalled if you're not at a university) . </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fermions, right. I'm not near my notes currently :).</p>
<p>So two fermions are able to stack if their spins oppose. Fermions are half or integer spin? Does that fractional/integer spin determine their ability to stack with like spins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a good explanation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Is-it-the-Pauli-exclusion-principle-or-electrostatic-forces-that-explain-why-I-do-not-fall-through-the-floor" target="_blank">http://www.quora.com/Is-it-the-Pauli-exclusion-principle-or-electrostatic-forces-that-explain-why-I-do-not-fall-through-the-floor</a></p>
<p>Two electrons cannot have identical quantum numbers in the same system. Pauli Exclusion is always repulsive, so when orbitals start to overlap, electrons get too close and are forced apart. You can prove via quantum mechanics and some relatively simple integrals that identical fermions are on average separated more than non-identical particles and identical bosons are closer apart (if you only account for the spatial part of the wavefunction, things get tricky when accounting for spin, but if two fermions have the same spin they will repel). This is something called the exchange force. If not for the Pauli Exclusion principle, and if electrons were bosons, atoms would be able to form chemical bonds willy nilly because the exchange force would produce configurations where electrons are closer together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fermions, and they can't share all the same quantum numbers. So if the nucleus is a fermion (an odd number of protons+neutrons) then they could only get near each other by having opposite spin.</p>
<p>Bosons actually like to share quantum numbers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more I learn, the more it feels like all of the quantum numbers make more sense as attributes graphed out, and that opposing values (any x and -x) can gain special properties (attraction, stack-ability, etc). I feel like my understanding from casual thought experiment is drifting towards the theory with all the branes, (again, in a dentist chair waiting for anesthetic to kick in), and all of these values are just different excitations of stacked branes.</p>
<p>It could just be my anxiety induced rambling kicking in, sorry if I'm just spouting nonsense.</p></div>		</li>
