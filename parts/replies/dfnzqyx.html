			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a rip off price for silver maple whips haha. In bulk I would shave off two zeros since the trees are pretty much weeds. So approximately $11,000,000. Though quite frankly you woild be mostly likely be expanding a preexsting state DNR restoration nursey and getting the materials for the price of the upkeep cost.</p>
<p>The cost issue mainly come in land issues. Thats alot of farmland to buy to convert to state forest. It might be more possible to take your whips and seeds and pay farmers a small fee or tax cut to convert a small portion of the land to new woods they promise to protect. Might work better if it was a better timber like walnut etc. Then allow them to cut it down in 40 years and replant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that the Silver Maple is also a real dickhead-  unless it's planted in a swampy area, it will break apart and possibly cause property damage and/or injury.</p>
<p>That being said, at least it's not a Weeping Willow. Fuck those guys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also litters its seedlings everywhere and it weak wood makes it drop branches and limbs often. Lifespan is 200 years less then oaks and 100 less then other maples.</p>
<p>Just lucky its not like a pear tree which splits in half like a ticking time bomb after 15 years. The ones everyone thinks is nice to plant by parking lots here. I have fond memories of silver maples but pears are just mean spirited but im biased. I had one almost killed my grandfather. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scrolled to say the same... silver maples are jerks. Had to pay to have one of these POS cut down in my front yard. Buuut, if your objective was the most biomass growth in the shortest period (far from any buildings), stupid silver maples might work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just planted ten native trees from Arbor Day foundation. The ten trees were ten dollars. It's an awesome organization. If you don't have a yard, community garden, or green thumb, just donate ten bucks &amp; the foundation will plant the ten trees in the forest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If every person who owned a house in the U.S., Canada, and in Europe bought 1 of those trees would it be enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming all of /u/AkumaBengoshi 's math is correct, and there are ~12 million people in Pennsylvania (not just homeowners, everyone), every homeowner in Pennsylvania would need to plant ~13 trees to counteract just their coal power plants, not  counting any other sources of pollution.  </p>
<p>More importantly, we'd have to find space to plant those 12 trees per person that wasn't already in use for something else or already covered in trees.</p></div>		</li>
