			<div class="markdown"><p>So the tornadoes in the UK are formed from local temperature contrasts. In most of the world, this only happens over water, and you get a water spout. In the midwest we do occasionally get a cold air funnel, but they rarely reach the ground. My guess is the landscape of the UK allows them to reach the ground more often, but as I said they have the dynamics of a waterspout, which is what makes them so weak.</p>
<p>Tornadoes that form on the Great Plains are completely different in dynamics. The entire air mass is rotating as a result of a difference in wind direction at lower and upper levels. The cause of these is vertical wind shear, not thermal contrast. These tornadoes become visible because they are picking up actual debris. In the UK, they are only visible because water condenses in the cold air column (like waterspouts don't suck up water, what you see is condensation). </p>
