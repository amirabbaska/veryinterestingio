			<div class="markdown"><p>So, We are basically still using steam engines to produce electricity? A very complicated one, but still a steam engine creating heat that causes steam in water, to be pushed through a steam turbine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all turbines.  </p>
<p>Coal power? Nope, that's heating water using coal and driving a turbine with the steam. Natural gas? Same story. Wind power is just sticking a big turbine outside on a windy hill, and hydroelectric means sticking the turbines below the waterline of a dam. And, yeah, nuclear power is... functionally 90% identical to your basic coal plant, with a reactor in place of your coal fire.  </p>
<p>About the only different sort of power generation we have are photoelectric cells, which we use to turn light from solar radiation into electricity; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator#Design" target="_blank">thermocouples</a>, which turn heat directly into electricity using the Seebeck effect. Those aren't terribly efficient, which is why we only use them in situations where there isn't space for a steam turbine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural gas actually is usually driven through the turbine directly.  Though it IS pretty much a steam/co2 turbine at that point if you follow the reaction products.  </p>
<p>Coal plants can be similarly easily be converted to natural gas using a boiler though... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Nuclear reactors, coal-fired boilers, gas-fired boilers, oil-fired boilers, and solar concentrators, all produce their energy in the form of heat. The most practical way to turn heat into electricity is to use the heat to boil water and spin a turbine that turns a generator, regardless of the heat source.</p>
<p>Pretty much all nuclear power is used to make steam, with the exception of radioisotope thermal generators (which use the Peltier-Seebeck effect) and betavoltaic batteries (which are basically solar panels absorbing a different sort of 'light'), and those form an utterly miniscule fraction of nuclear energy use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does this bother me so much? Are we just reinventing the wheel over and over again? Where's the scientific process of improvement in that? Why are people not figuring out how to turn the radiation itself into electrical output or improving on the betavoltaic  process to be more efficient? It seems like we have made very little real progress in technological advancement. I mean, Tesla is just using 18650 batteries chained together for FSM's sake. What is going on around here! Am I the only one that sees us as barely improving on archaic tech?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say it like that's a bad thing. Turbines are wheels, which are more efficient than pistons. Steam is water, which is readily available in many places, has great properties for heat transfer, moves nicely through pipes in both gas and liquid states, and at least starts out non-toxic.
The steam engine is a great invention, partial proof of which is that we still use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power determined by steam load is only true for pwrs. BWR plants are the opposite, you raise power, which raises steam generation, and the turbine automatically load follows the steam generation. </p></div>		</li>
