			<div class="markdown"><p>I always see people saying not to wash your hair every day. My problem is I have fine hair, that looks greasy if I don't wash it (even for one day). I tried dry shampoo, but it doesn't cut it. I will say though, my hair seems pretty healthy despite being washed daily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are accustomed to washing your hair every day, your body has likely upped the rate of oil production to try and compensate. It would take a little bit of time for your body to adjust to less frequent washings, during which it would feel like your hair is a greasy mess.</p>
<p>I switched from daily shampooing to every other day, it took a week or two but after that it felt perfectly normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. When I moved from washing daily to washing every 3 days, my hair oils decreased considerably. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fine. Wash your hair daily. I also do it and my hair is healthy even though I use a flat iron on it daily. In fact, my conditioner rehydrates my ironed hair better than not washing it.</p>
<p>Theres no actual science backing up the constantly regurgitated myth of rebound oil production.</p>
<p>Here are some readings:</p>
<p>Article has linked study: <a href="http://www.labmuffin.com/moisturising-make-skin-produce-less-oil/#comments" target="_blank">DO OILS MAKE YOUR SKIN LESS OILY? THE MYTH OF REBOUND OIL</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1yu3h3/what_peer_reviewed_hard_scientific_evidence_do_we/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=comment_list" target="_blank">R/skincareaddiction on the matter</a></p>
<p>But tl;dr: skin doesn't produce more oil, its just that dryer skin shows oil more, therefore the solution is to keep skin moisturized (your scalp is skin like the rest of your body btw) (people who have good experiences with switching to infrequent showering probably had overly dry hair/scalp prior to switching)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's partially why shampoo instructions say to do it twice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've found I can split what I used to use in a single shampooing into two parts.. 2/3 first, wash, rinse out, then the remaining third goes in and covers/foams through more of my hair than the first 2/3 did..</p>
<p>Shampoo in pump bottles has also saved me a fair bit of money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>damage to your hair</p>

<p>Does this actually do anything negative to your health, though?  Like is there any 'actual' negative' health aspect to 'damaged hair'?  Every time I hear this, it just seems like such a trivial, meaningless thing.  It seems equivalent to calling a pencil whose eraser is worn down (but is otherwise fine) a 'damaged pencil'.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s just aesthetics. You can’t have long, beautiful hair if it’s breaking off and looks frazzled and damaged. Having healthy hair may be trivial and meaningless to some, but to a lot of girls it is a very important thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it has that much of a visual impact for someone who has a lot of hair, I can understand not wanting it to look unhealthy I suppose.  How about for guys with short hair, is it really that big of a deal, is it really as obvious as for someone with more hair?  I just don't notice these things consciously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also extremely variable and mostly bullshit. When I used to grow out my hair, I would shampoo very often, at least every other day but usually every day. It was still healthy and fantastic-looking. IMO the shit people do to their hair besides clean it, like styling and dying products, are what damage hair the most. My cleaning frequency was basically wash every day, condition every three days. Never used dye or styling products, just wet-combed and let it loose or pulled back.</p></div>		</li>
