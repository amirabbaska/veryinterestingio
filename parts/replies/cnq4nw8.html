			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be a sidebar discussion, but I am curious... Have you ever dealt with sleep apnea in someone that wasn't obese? If so, is it a common thing, and can it be typically categorized as having to do with particular medical conditions?</p>
<p>I ask because of the dozen and a half people I have seen with sleep apnea, every one of them was morbidly obese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's definitely a correlation that obesity causes people's air passages to be blocked (due to the extra weight). However, I have seen all shapes and sizes when it comes to folks with sleep apnea.  I've seen skinny teens with apnea, to my manager who ran marathons and was in tip top shape have obstructive apnes, etc..</p>
<p>Obese people are at risk to have apnea but not everyone who has apnea is obese.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That particular study brought people into the lab to sleep but only tricked them into thinking that their sleep quality was being monitored like your own lab would do it. After that random results were relayed to them when they woke up and their behavior matched up with what they were told. </p></div>		</li>
