			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true. Life-cycle analyses show that you use less energy, water and greenhouse emissions by recycling products than making products out of virgin materials - and that goes for glass, paper and plastics.
There may be exceptions, such as glass in a regional are that may be transported hundreds of kilometers. But there's often a local use, such as roadbase, which is still more effective than landfill.
Also, once you've set up the processes for collecting and sorting aluminium, you can piggyback on these to collect and process other products, in effect subsidising the environmental costs.
We don't actually spend tens of millions of dollars on recycling for the fun of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is to keep a lot of this stuff out of the landfills. This article also shares some interesting insights about the actual costs of using Virgin materials <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a3752/4291566/" target="_blank">http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a3752/4291566/</a></p></div>		</li>
