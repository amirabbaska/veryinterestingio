			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is related but water that doesn't match the tonicity of your body (about 0.9% salts) also causes blood cells to burst through osmotic pressure, and this can cause pain in contact with permeable membranes, either fresh water (hypotonic) or seawater (hypertonic) both can sting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 100% related.  In fact, it the only thing that matters. If you do a sinus rinse with a netti pot using water with the proper salts concentrations, there is zero pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you’re just joking, but I still want to say that I’ve struggled to wake up out of depression for some time. But getting to sleep at a regular time and throwing myself into the shower as soon as my eyes open helps significantly. It doesn’t get rid of all the anxiety, but it does give me that little bit of momentum that’s so hard to come by, which in turn reduces the anxiety of entire morning routine. </p>
<p>Sorry for being a downer, I just had to put my thoughts somewhere, and this is good enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Showers are actually good for anxiety because the stimuli of water hitting your skin helps “reset” the sensitivities your brain has conditioned you to. </p>
<p>I have ptsd with extreme anxiety and taking a shower is one of the few things that will help calm my nervous system enough to sleep.</p></div>		</li>
