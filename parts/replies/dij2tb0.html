			<div class="markdown"><p>Replying to this comment for visibility. Some previous commenters have mentioned this, but I think it's worth repeating:</p>
<p>Sedation comes in multiple levels. </p>
<ol>
<li>Minimal - anxiolytic/anti-anxiety (nitrous oxide/laughing gas or oral medication)</li>
<li>Moderate/conscious sedation (IV or oral medication)</li>
<li>Deep sedation - (IV or inhaled medication - not N2O)</li>
<li>General Anaesthesia - (IV or inhaled medication)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sedation is a continuum dependent on dose and drug. The delivery of medication does not dictate the level of sedation. General Anaesthesia is generally not performed in outpatient care. General Anaesthesia for dental procedures is incredibly rare. </p>
<p>If you had a needle in the arm for your wisdom teeth, it was probably moderate sedation with midaz. You might have forgotten the procedure, but that's what a good sedative does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had full GA for wisdom teeth extraction. Hospital in-patient, anesthetist interview, nil-per-mouth, taken to operating theatre, rendered fully unconscious, then hours to recover before I could walk. My surgeon told me afterwards that he had his foot on my face at one stage, trying to get one of the teeth out. I hope that was a joke but who knows...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had my wisdom teeth out the anesthesiologist turned on the drip and asked me to count to 10. I got to 3 and blacked out. Woke up in the parking lot. If I was conscious at all during the procedure it was minimally so. It wasn't supposed to be GA but damned if I would have been able to tell the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah iirc General Anesthesia requires a breathing tube because you're so far under that your lungs don't work anymore. </p>
<p>I just got an IV, I'm sure I was able to breathe by myself.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There is also a difference in whether or not they want to. As far as I can tell from reddit and my American family is that wisdom tooth surgery is in GA and morphine is given for pain management afterwards.</p>
<p>For my own wisdom tooth surgery I had LA and got paracetamol and ibuprofen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really about the benefits or disadvantages. It's about what is appropriate for your particular case. </p>
<p>If your problem is anxiety in the dentists chair then a bit of sedation is just fine. </p>
<p>If you are a special needs patient, or the dental work is extensive and not amenable to local anaesthesia then you need a general Anaesthetic in the hospital. General Anaesthesia is not just &quot;not remembering&quot;. It also means you don't move at all, allowing the dentist or oral surgeon to do the more difficult work more easily. But it also means you will lose your ability to prevent fluids or blood from going into your lungs. It also means your blood pressure, heart function, and breathing abilities are more adversely affected. Which is why you need the anaesthetist there to protect you and keep you safe. And that anaesthetist also needs a wide variety of specialized equipment and monitoring to be able to do that safely and effectively. And that sort of setup is rarely available outside of a hospital or dedicated day procedure setting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you need something to breathe for you when you get put under like this?  I had some sort of GA when I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth extracted (2 were partial bony impacted), and I don't remember if it was an injection or a nose mask thing (it was over 10 years ago) but I do remember the countdown and then waking up in a different room, and feeling really good for some reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be complications with general anesthesia.  An anesthesiologist is a trained doctor who can monitor you more closely in a hospital setting. There are more resources and equipment at his disposal to make sure you go under and wake up safely.  Especially for surgeries where you will be under for an extended period of time and may need a breathing tube. </p>
<p>The dentist can do GA too but it's ultimately safer in a hospital setting.  All-in-all it's safe. But it's safer in a hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty much the same here. General anesthesia is generally performed only by an oral surgeon. It's usually performed in the equivalent of an ambulatory care center and not a hospital. </p></div>		</li>
