<p>Had to stop by my local pharmacy three times already because of a mixup with my prescription, then they didn't have it in stock and had to order it for me. The pharmacy is right down the street and I don't need it <em>right this very second,</em> so it's okay. But it's an uncommon steroid cream. I figured they might have it, but apparently not a lot of people have use for it.</p>
<p>The pharmacist always looks afraid I'm going to yell at her. It's not <em>her</em> fault - are people normally angry at pharmacists?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going into pharmacy (likely not community though) and basically yes. People don't always see/treat pharmacists as healthcare professionals, and it's a retail setting (community pharmacy) so you get all the perks and treats that are associated with interacting with customers. Obviously I'm biased against the retail setting - there's a lot of normal/kind customers too, you definitely won't be yelled at all day!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The commonly used medications are always in stock, it's the more name brand and less commonly used medications that require placing an order or having to check if neighboring pharmacies have supplies. Also, we received shipments daily because they keep a very accurate computer database that's updated several times a day due to the amount of medication supply being tightly monitored. Every time a prescription is filled, a bottle is scanned and it knows the amount taken each time. </p></div>		</li>
