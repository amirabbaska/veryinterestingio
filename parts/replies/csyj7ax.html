			<div class="markdown"><p>9 months is a little long in that estimation. For production birds, like Buff Orpingtons, Production Reds, Barred Rocks and even Easter-Egger's, they start laying at around 6 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably fair... I usually get peeps around Easter and they start laying around Thanksgiving(6-7 mos), but then they lay slow through winter (NE US) and really get cranking when the spring hits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone asked me how long until their chickens started laying eggs I would say 6 months, that seems to be the magic time (some a little before, some a little after). </p>
<p>Also, a full spectrum light in the chicken coop on for about 14 hours a day will help egg production in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is still a long estimation. Chickens can start laying as soon as 4-5 months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still too long of an estimation. Some start the cycle before they've hatched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens can easily live to be 20 years old, and often live as old as 10.</p>
<p>Broilers and other chickens raised exclusively for meat are often slaughtered at a few weeks old, and egg layers when egg production begins to decline (which is inevitably will), usually around 2-3 years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like &quot;grown enough&quot;.  They're not fully mature, but allowing them to attain full size -- at least if they are free range, which is what I have experience with -- tends to make the meat tougher. </p></div>		</li>
