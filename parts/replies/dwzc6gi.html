			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is obviously a correct answer, it's not the answer to the question being asked.</p>
<p>The question mentioned 'hours passing like minutes <em>after</em> you wake up,' so not referring to the time that passed while you were asleep.</p>
<p>I can only assume it has to do with familiarity of the situation altering your perception of time to speed it up; as it's well known that routine causes the feeling of time moving faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I agree the point of reference thing really makes sense to me. Like this morning seems SO long ago because of all the stuff I can think about that I’ve done so far today but it’s only been 4 hours </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a psychological perspective, I would guess that it’s a combination of perception and chemical changes in the brain. Our own biases and preferences change the way we perceive our world and alter our memory of past events in many different ways. It wouldn’t surprise me if this was universal across all humans:  time seems to go extremely fast when we don’t want it to, but goes slow when we don’t want it to. I can certainly speak from the psychological perspective but I would love to hear from the neuroscience or biology camp</p></div>		</li>
