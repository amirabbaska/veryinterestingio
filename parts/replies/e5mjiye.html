			<div class="markdown"><p>Good write-up.  Also worth noting that evidence for feathers comes not only from the the fossilized feathers we have found on some dinosaurs, but from bones.  Certain types of feathers leave what are known as quill knobs on the bones, like those <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5958393_Feather_Quill_Knobs_in_the_Dinosaur_Velociraptor" target="_blank">found on this velociraptor</a>.</p>
<p>In many cases we have multiple lines of evidence to support different aspects of how dinosaurs looked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People were initially surprised and disturbed to discover that there were animals that had existed but now didn’t, and they may have leapt from that to putting the most “primitive” possible interpretation of the animals that the fossil remains supported. Even when I was a kid the idea that birds <em>are</em> dinosaurs was quite strange and new to most people, we thought of them as their own, old, primitive thing, and the living reptiles as their final relics, lingering on into the age of the warm-blooded. In the 19th century it probably seemed natural that these creatures that “didn’t make it” were similar to the slow, cold reptiles of today, only even less like the bold, successful mammals and therefore no longer around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has taken a long time to put together all the evidence and to <em>find</em> the relevant fossils in the first place.</p>
<p>Additionally, once an idea becomes popularized it gains a certain moment and is difficult to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not (beyond parrots, crows, mynas and a whole bunch of other beaked birds- possibly some before the extinction). The organ that allows birds to make complex sounds- the syrinx- seems to have evolved inside of the bird family tree.</p>
<p>It's possible some dinosaurs may have evolved an equivalent- but alas, no way to prove it without a fossil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No doubt. We can only try to imagine 100 hundred million years of different sounds evolving with thousands of different species. There were probably dinosaurs who killed with sound, hunted with sound. Certainly some learned to mimic their prey.</p></div>		</li>
