<p>Also, just to add so I feel useful in my life, many south Koreans want nothing to do with North Korea for all reasons listed above by the OP comment. </p>
<p>Also, though not as relevant, two cultures here; both very different. I say this only to add that in many cases, though we can compare things for benefits/disadvantages, two different cultures are going to have fundamental differences (obviously) which can show to see why something works in one place vs not working in another. </p>
<p>I always think of gun laws vs the U.S and other countries. Anyway, not too relevant as OP covered all the bases. </p></div>		</li>
