			<div class="markdown"><p>I find sometimes students are able to explain things better than teachers (no offense). For example, a math teacher who has gone through years of calculus and upper division courses often can't see what it is the class is confused about. They are so used to the subject it's hard for them to recognize where the confusion lies. Often, another student who understands the material but is on the same level Is able to translate between professor and class. I wish teachers would dedicate more time to things like, &quot;does anyone have anything to add to the lecture that may clear things up for the class&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be annoying to the professor, but I go out of my way to jump in if a student asks a question and then doesn't understand the teacher's response.  It more often than not clears up the confusion and prevents the teacher wasting time trying to explain or dismissing the question.</p></div>		</li>
