			<div class="markdown"><p>How about the cuckoo that takes exactly one egg and replaces exactly one egg in a nest of many eggs; but the new egg is quite different to the other bird's eggs in look and size than what Mama bird should expect to see on return to her nest? Does she count them I have always wondered...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Response to brood parasites (like cuckoos) depends on the local prevalence of those parasites.  Birds that aren't in danger of cuckolding (like ravens) will incubate pretty much anything in or near the nest, while those that are (like American robins) are alert to things that look wrong and even evolve eggs that are obviously their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the cuckoo is exploiting a behavior common in small elevated-nesting birds to feed the loudest mouth as fast as possible. These elevated nesters are on a quick mission to stuff the babies with biomass as fast as possible, get them fledged, and get them on their own way. Unlike with ducklings (and other ground-nesters) who are out and about, elevated nesters didn't adapt behaviors to keep track of their young; confinement to the nest handles that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cuckoo is likely to be the only chick. Cuckoo eggs hatch earlier than their 'siblings' and the cuckoo chick will push the other eggs out of the nest before they hatch. This prevents any need for competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new egg most likely is not different. Cuckoos mimic the eggs of the host nest, sometimes eggs can even mimic size (to a certain extent)! Female cuckoos will as adults lay eggs in the nests of the species of their adoptive parents.</p>
<p>It's a cool example of evolution at work; studies showed that the eggs which resembled the host eggs best were more likely the be accepted. Otherwise the host bird might reject the whole nest or destroy the egg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is it. You can look at a group of up to 4-5 objects and know at a glance how many there are. It's not until you have more than that or they're not all in view at once that you have to actually &quot;count&quot;. I think studies have indicated many animals have this former ability (with varying thresholds) but I think only humans have the latter. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they're fundamentally different processes in the brain even though they seem very similar to our consciousness.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw an episode of Animal Cops where they rescued baby ducks from a storm drain, but the adult ducks had left the area because of an incoming storm. So they returned the next day with the baby ducks in a box, and one of the adult ducks started following them. They determined that she was the mother, recognizing the sounds of her babies, so they returned the ducklings.</p></div>		</li>
