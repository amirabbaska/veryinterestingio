			<p>How about the cuckoo that takes exactly one egg and replaces exactly one egg in a nest of many eggs; but the new egg is quite different to the other bird's eggs in look and size than what Mama bird should expect to see on return to her nest? Does she count them I have always wondered...</p>		</li>

			<p>Response to brood parasites (like cuckoos) depends on the local prevalence of those parasites.  Birds that aren't in danger of cuckolding (like ravens) will incubate pretty much anything in or near the nest, while those that are (like American robins) are alert to things that look wrong and even evolve eggs that are obviously their own.</p>		</li>

			<p>It means that birds who spend time and resources caring for their own eggs have higher reproductive success than birds who can't tell the difference between their eggs and other eggs.  It starts with one bird with a random mutation who lays eggs that are a slightly different color, and that gives her a reproductive advantage.  The mutation gets passed on to her offspring, and thousands of years later the entire species has evolved colored eggs.<br><br>It ain't like there's a robin sitting in a tree thinking &quot;you know, I feel like pink is going to be in this year&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>(S)he is saying that Robin eggs are distinctive (they are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/American_Robin_Eggs_in_Nest.jpg" target="_blank">blue</a>).  They evolved this coloration as a way to distinguish their own eggs. </p>		</li>

			<p>That phrasing can be confusing (They evolved this ___ to) because it implies some active choice. It would be more accurate to say that this coloration evolved when it gave robins with blue eggs a substantial enough advantage over other robins that those birds died out leaving only the descendants of the original blue-egged robins</p>		</li>

			<p>Robins whose eggs look similar to cuckoo eggs, are likelier to mistake their own eggs for cuckolds and push them out of the nest.  Thus robins who lay bright blue eggs are selected for.</p>		</li>

			<p>If I remember correctly, the cuckoo is exploiting a behavior common in small elevated-nesting birds to feed the loudest mouth as fast as possible. These elevated nesters are on a quick mission to stuff the babies with biomass as fast as possible, get them fledged, and get them on their own way. Unlike with ducklings (and other ground-nesters) who are out and about, elevated nesters didn't adapt behaviors to keep track of their young; confinement to the nest handles that. </p>		</li>

			<p>The cuckoo is likely to be the only chick. Cuckoo eggs hatch earlier than their 'siblings' and the cuckoo chick will push the other eggs out of the nest before they hatch. This prevents any need for competition.</p>		</li>

			<p>Some random group of Cuckoos pushed eggs out; this behavior was so successful that it out performed the non-pushing cuckoos till all cuckoos were pushing cuckoos.</p>		</li>

			<p>So by instinct when they are born they see eggs and push them out?</p>		</li>

			<p>I wonder what would happen if there were two cuckoo eggs and one hatched first. I bet it would push the other one out even though its more advantageous for the species for both to survive. Their instinct is to probably clear their nest of all eggs.</p>		</li>

			<p>They're blind when they're born, but yes, as soon as they are hatched they will demand food. Their host parents scramble off to collect dinner and the little cuckoo starts pushing other eggs out.</p>		</li>

			<p>The new egg most likely is not different. Cuckoos mimic the eggs of the host nest, sometimes eggs can even mimic size (to a certain extent)! Female cuckoos will as adults lay eggs in the nests of the species of their adoptive parents.<br><br>It's a cool example of evolution at work; studies showed that the eggs which resembled the host eggs best were more likely the be accepted. Otherwise the host bird might reject the whole nest or destroy the egg.</p>		</li>

			<p>This might be the best biological answer. Counting isn't likely what's at play here, it's just parenting.<br><br>I'll add to the tidbit about vocalizations by the young to alert the mother. In mice, something many scientists spend a lot of time around in deep dark basements of research buildings, they have unique vocalizations that their mother is attuned to. Scientists actually call them songs, and if you were to mix 2 litters of nearly identical neonatal mice together, the mother could quickly differentiate her young with their vocalizations.<br><br><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704988" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14704988</a></p>		</li>
