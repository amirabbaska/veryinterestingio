			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be part of an explanation but most importantly we have (at least) two different long-term memory systems with differing neurological bases.</p>
<p>Infantile amnesia affects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory" target="_blank">explicit or declarative memory</a> which is correlated with activity in the cortex (mainly the frontal and temporal lobes) and limbic system (mainly the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices). This system stores episodic memories and semantic information that we are consciously aware of having, and retrieving, and which can be expressed verbally.</p>
<p>We also have an older system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory" target="_blank">implicit memory</a> which is used for motor and cognitive skills (procedural memory), conditioning and priming which involves subcortical structures like the basal ganglia and cerebellum. This system is used for skills like walking or drawing.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the reason for infantile amnesia might be that the parts of the cortex and the limbic system involved in encoding of episodic memories aren't properly developed until the age of three or four.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Its like you start with an emotional memory, then as you age you add the portion that we consider a conventional memory.</p>
<p>Therapy targeting infant issues goes after the emotional remainder of events.  So if something happened that made you feel scared or ashamed as a young child, you likely won't remember the event, but you will walk around with a sense of fear or shame that you can't place and can't seem to shake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's such an interesting idea to think that some of the traits we have had all our lives could have been formed from situations &amp; experiences in infancy. Things like being a nervous, anxious, fearful person. I've often wondered this about myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an extremely generalized look, you can Google infant attachment theory to see how bonds between the seemingly &quot;no-memory&quot; infant and parents can create long lasting effects on your traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bias is extremely strong on the matter, but this is something that frightens me deeply about circumcision. A baby is a fucking complex computer with the sole purpose of taking in sensory information and learning from it. When we start out by cutting away at the genitals of an infant, I haven't the slightest doubt that would create lasting mental trauma, and I can only imagine what affect that might have on the mentality of people in any given society after widespread practice. Supposedly male infants who were circumcised more often move their hands over their genitals like a protective instinct, and end up reacting more irrationally to pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an absolutely crazy idea. If that were true, then in a country like the US (where circumcision has been routine for males for decades) you would see a high level of male violence when these kids grow up. This would manifest itself in all kinds of aspects of society, like high gun ownership, police brutality, murder rates, propensity to sign up for foreign wars, high incarceration rates, physically aggressive sports like football and hockey and an obsession with crime and punishment. ^^ohwait...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think I have a high pain tolerance, but my wife is always complaining that I'm touching my junk in a resting position. (IE: sitting on the couch, on the computer, and come to think of it, even while I drive.)</p>
<p>I can't think of any negative impressions it has had on my life, but then again I've never known a difference to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

I knew what I was going to say in response to this comment two minutes ago but now I can't remember it, as it was an emotional response that hadn't gone through a translation into a more conventional form of communication yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps though he was able to develop his &quot;own&quot; language even if he never spoke a word of it.  I mean... I'm sitting here &quot;thinking&quot; in English.  If he was never introduced to any language, don't you think at around the age of 2-3 he would be developing his own sense of what things are called even if he doesn't speak it?</p>
<p>So I would argue he doesn't have to be introduced to any language that we know of in order to keep his memories, he's developed some sort of internal language of his own.</p></div>		</li>
