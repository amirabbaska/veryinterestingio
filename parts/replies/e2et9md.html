			<div class="markdown"><p>There are training videos online from WW2 about how to bomb out train lines to properly render them inopperable. Turns out you need to take out at least about a meter of rail, preferably offset from one side to the other to be sure the train will derail. An inch or three of gap on non-high-speed line is a nussiance, but not a danger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>your probably speaking of that one. its pretty insane. they keep taking massive chunk of the rail and the train doesnt even care. even when it finally derails its pretty mild</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating! I wonder how they salvage the cars once they start going off the tracks. They ran tests afterwards like there were no issue with the train cars. Seriously cool, thanks for posting that link!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is generally un welded rail which is being phased out as much as possible, welded rail still uses gaps to expand but they are special bits of rail usually called breathers or scarfs which can be welded in. </p>
<p>Eliminating joints is a big part of increasing passenger comfort and reducing broken rails </p></div>		</li>
