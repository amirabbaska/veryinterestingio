<p>I'm genuinely curious  about their  physical defects. </p>
<p>Are you sure they weren't suffering from chronic wasting disease? (Very similar to C.B.E. or mad cow disease). Deer don't generally in breed and have a pretty decent genetic variability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not positive it was interbreeding but assumed based on the small area they had to occupy for years. The city and surrounding burbs created a circle that prevented them from venturing too far. </p>
<p>The antlers were the most obvious defect to see but may very well be caused by something else. The behavior was beyond normal deer behavior, like running at cars. Including parked ones. </p>
<p>Edit: the area would be right for CWD so it's not a stretch to believe that was the cause of the behavior. </p></div>		</li>
