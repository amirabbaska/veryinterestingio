			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have 100% humidity and the temperature drops, there is suddenly more water in the air than it can hold. This will condense into water/ice droplets (depending on temperature and other factors) and that is what you see as fog. So essentialy there's never more than 100% humidity.</p>
<p>This is why the air becomes so dry in winter. Outside all the water condenses/freezes out of the air, and then when air comes inside and heats up from the negatives up into the twenties, you'll only have a very low percentage of humidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The variables for volume, temperature, pressure and capacity for holding humidity interact. Heating air = adding energy to the observed system = accelerating the molecular &quot;Brownian motion&quot;, thus - if your system is enclosed (i.e. in a bottle) - the pressure rises. In open systems the volume would rise instead of holding pressure, so the heated air would expand and have more space for holding water molecules. Imagine a hair-dryer: It drys your hair by heating everything up, the water in your hair evaporates, plus transporting moisture saturated air away. When things cool down, think bathroom window after a hot shower, the capacity of the air to hold water decreases and the transported water condensates on cold surfaces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it increases exponentially. Relative humidity is a really bad piece of information to broadcast in weather because nobody underatands it correctly.</p>
<p>Absolute humidity is really the value we should use (measure of weight of water per unit volume). The closest thing you will see in weather is dewpoint. Dewpoint is essentially absolute humidity, just on a non-linear scale. Relative humidity is a calculated value that has no meaning to human perception, as we can only sense absolute humidity.</p>
<p>For reference, I run some accelerated humidity tests at work at 85C/85% relative humidity. There is more than 30 times as much water in the air in that test than there is on a really humid day in Florida.</p></div>		</li>
