			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like an IF diet. While fasting your body produces testosterone and keeps insuline levels low (test helps burn fat, insuline gets the fat stored for later use). Basically You fast for 16 hours (or more) and eat everything in 8 hours window. Once you teach your body that, you should notice that you can focus better on various tasks as hunger isn't affecting you and your body goes to 'survival mode'. At least that's how I understand that without reading the proper explanation, but it's something along the lines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is sound advice.</p>
<p>For me I eat a bowl of oatmeal (cinnamon and flax seed, not sugar) in the morning when I get to work then have a snack (walnuts) then eat lunch and have another snack (walnuts) then have dinner and maybe another light snack before I head off to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been skipping breakfast for the last 2 months now and have been having my first meal at 10:30am after a few coffees. I find that I can't  wait too much longer after 10:30 to eat because I start getting hangry. I think it's working out really well.</p></div>		</li>
