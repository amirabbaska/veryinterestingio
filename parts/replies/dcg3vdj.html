			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, yeah.</p>
<p>Imagine (numbers pulled out of thin air) that it costs you two cents per standard 16-page block. Alternatively, you can assemble a partial block for two cents (the cost of the original block) plus ten cents (the cost of cutting it apart and fitting it in manually). The remnants can be discarded for free, or can be reinserted into the machine for an extra four cents of labor, plus an increased 0.1% failure rate overall when your mangled paper jams the machine.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>Obviously you just jam 16 pages in and call it a day.</p>
<p>It turns out mass production is an incredible cost-saving device and exceptions are expensive. Often you're better off accepting a little waste just to avoid a weird special case. See, for example, cars that come with luxury features installed by default, but disabled in software; sometimes it's actually cheaper to install the hardware in all cars, then disable it in some cars, than it is to specialize your hardware assembly line based on whether the feature should be included or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why its often more expensive to repair something than replace it. The labor cost to even diagnose the issue heavily is likely more expensive than replacing it outright. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly it is, because you have to run the 16 blank pages trough the printing press in any case. For example, the most common standard for book printing machines is 32 pages. So now you have basically 5 possibilities what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Leave 16 pages blank
Leave the blank pages in the book, normally at the end so that the publisher can place ads there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manually remove the 16 blank pages
This is also very common. You print the 32 page signature and before binding you remove the 16 blank pages by hand. Problem here is: You have to pay for the paper you throw away and the manual Separation costs also. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Print 2 times 16 pages and manually separate them
This might be the most common way. Instead of 16 blank pages you put in the same 16 pages another time. So you only have to print half the run length of this signature, what makes it cost-effective. Tough, you have to manually separate them afterwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Print 2 times 16 pages on a &quot;Non-Collect-Folder&quot;
Basically the same as option 3, with the difference, that you need a special option in your folder after the printing machine, which enables you to do the separation in the press. This takes extra makeready-time and the press can't run on full speed anymore. </p>
</li>
<li>Use a narrower web
Also possible, you can use a smaller paper-web, so that you don't have 32 pages across one signature but 16. But the printers don't really like this. They have to do another complete makeready of the machine, put in the smaller paper, readjust all the cuttings and foldings,...</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each of the top few posts, yours included, have said that the standard page count of a modern signature is a different number.<br />
I've now seen 8, 16, and 32 all mentioned as the norm.<br />
Just wondering if you know, or assumed that your number is correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine if you would have to leave most of a signature blank your publisher would just push you to cut a few pages to get rid of that signature. 6 blank pages might not be a big deal but 14 would be. </p></div>		</li>
