			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Very insightful!</p>
<p>Should I be concerned about freckles and/or moles in places that's never seen sunlight? (like around my groin area) - I just noticed some freckles in the tip of my penis a couple years back. They're very faded, and definitely not raised.</p>
<p>And I have a couple of moles in my buttocks area - they're dark about 2-3 mm's in diameter.</p>
<p>(sorry, I know, I'm not asking for any kind of diagnosis, of course. I'm just more curious about how freckles in particular form in areas that don't get exposed to sunlight.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do a simple check for yourself using the ABCDEs.
Asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation/change, increasing diameter (&gt;6mm), and evolution (change over time). If any of those things happen exist or occur over several months, I'd recommend you go to a dermatologist for a definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p>You can get moles and freckles in areas that have never seen direct contact for sure. Sometimes pigment and cells cluster in random places, no real rhyme or reason. Birthmarks are good examples of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had 5 moles, all small, maybe a centimeter or two, since I was a child. A few years ago, I decided to get them all removed. I worked in surgery, and we had more than one pt come in with an innocuous looking mole, which turned out to be cancer. One of my 5 came back as pre cancerous. The pathologist had a hard time deciding if it was melanoma, or just pre cancerous atypical melanocytes. So, they ended up going back and excising a much larger area. So check yourself. I was only 28 at the time and I always wear sunscreen and try to stay out of the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't a centimetre quite big for a mole? Apparently you're supposed to check moles that are 6mm or over. </p></div>		</li>
