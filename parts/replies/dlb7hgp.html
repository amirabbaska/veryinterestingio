			<div class="markdown"><p>You can purchase extension cords that slide pins into those holes.  They mechanically latch and you cannot remove the plug.  </p>
<p>I have a &quot;Husky&quot; brand cord with a little switch on the outlet.  That engages the pin to mechanically lock the plug.  They work really well, particularly when you're pulling multiple extension cords plugged end to end.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a great idea. Our plugs in the UK don't have these holes, but now I wish they did. Our plugs do seem to be held more firmly by the sockets than yours though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because UK prongs are thicker, they can push the sprung contacts inside the socket further apart, and so they exert more of a grip against the prong. To do the same on an American prong would need a more heavily sprung contact, which would make it harder to insert the plug (I think), and possibly cause more wear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If daisy-chain is plugging extension cords end to end ie. 3 sets will triple the length of the chord, then not really.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the angle of the cord (parallel to the wall), it's impossible to exert a force perpendicular to the wall by pulling the cord without also exerting a moment that causes the pins to dig in instead of sliding out easily. </p>
<p>Which is why if you try to unplug a British plug by pulling on the cord (as is often done in the States), you will likely damage the cable/plug. Even if you pull ok the plug itself, you need to pull quite hard because of the friction on the three chunky pins.</p></div>		</li>
