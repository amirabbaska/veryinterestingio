			<div class="markdown"><p>Acne is caused by bacteria that are normally found on your skin that get &quot;trapped&quot; in the follicles (for example by an excessive production of sebum) and trigger an inflammatory response. </p>
<p>Cystic acne is essentially an inflammation that's deeper down and that gets more pronounced than in the superficial parts of the follicle. So it's got to do with your genetics (or homones) giving rise to a greater inflammatory response/responding excessively to the trapped bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what decides if the cystic acne forms an abscess or is reabsorbed into the body? Better yet, how can the body reabsorb dead materials such as neutrophil remnants in the pus? Doesn't that go against the surgical motto to always incise and drain an abscess?</p></div>		</li>

<p>For pimples, anaerobic bacteria colonize a hair follicle and consume the sebum produced by sweat glands. </p>

<p>Pimples arise in sebaceous glands, which may or may not be associated with a hair follicle. Sweat glands are not involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweat glands do still create sweat - which can provide a nice transport for said anaerobic bacteria, so they can &quot;ride the wave&quot; of sweat and go colonize another nearby sebaceous gland. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also, if you look closely, the result of pore after pore getting a hair follicle. On my 18 year old, i've watched the locations of the pimples move to each new pore and basically get a pimple from the sebum plug getting removed for the first time. As it gets cleared, it tends not to have a second zit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For boys , it’s testosterone and estrogen . Puberty is kinda what happens when dudes on testosterone don’t make sure to keep their estrogen low. Their body can go into a sort or up and down swing trying to self regulate , and one of the first side affects is acne, especially the shoulders , neck, face , teenage acne stuff . Because it’s caused by an artificially inflated version of the same thing . </p></div>		</li>
