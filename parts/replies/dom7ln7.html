			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, yes. It gets even weirder though: each wave of migrants is, by this definition, arguably rendered indigenous by the next. E.g. I move from country A to country B, which has hitherto only had a single culture. Later, people from country C arrive. My descendants are apparently now indigenous.</p>
<p>The idea of dominance is a bit odd too...does it mean that if your people have always lived somewhere but remain the majority then you aren't indigenous so that indigenous is a synonym for &quot;colonised&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>How would that synonymize the two terms? One group does not have to be more numerous than the other to be dominant. As long as the dominant group have the most stuff. Take 9 out of 10 African countries/ethnic groups for example.</p></div>		</li>
