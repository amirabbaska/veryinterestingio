			<p>For those trying to visualize ionic vs metallic bonds, think of ionic bonds as the way Legos bond. One atom has a hole (missing electron in its outer shell) and one has a disk (extra electron in its outer shell). The disk perfectly fits into the hole and is set. <br><br>For a metallic bond, have you ever seen two people form a seat for a third by using their left hand to grab their right wrist and the right hand to grab the person across's left wrist? That's a much weaker bond. Or consider a box closed with a French fold (one corner of each flap tucked under the next flap).  Moderate strength, but you can't put heavy things in that box. </p>		</li>

			<p>How does this bonding compare to this mythical graphene I keep hearing about?<br><br>Edit: Thank you for answering. </p>		</li>

			<p>Graphene is single layers of carbon bonded in hexagonal forms.  Entirely unalike, if that helps</p>		</li>

			<p>Also isn't the point of graphene that it's... bendy? </p>		</li>

			<p>Not 'the point' of it, but as by definition it's a single atom thick, heck yeah bendiness is a property</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Describe the property of this material&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well Dr, we've observed that it has a coefficient of bendiness (Î¼B) of at least 0.98, this is our most bendy material yet!&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>You're joking, but there's a property in mechanical engineering that could legitimately be nicknamed the coefficient of bendiness.<br><br>If you look at the equations for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflection_(engineering\)" target="_blank">bending of beams</a>, the factor &quot;E*I&quot; appears pretty much everywhere.  E (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulus_of_elasticity" target="_blank">Young's modulus</a>) is a measure of the stiffness of the material in tension/compression, and I (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area" target="_blank">area moment of inertia</a>) is a measure of the stiffness of the beam's geometrical shape.  Together they represent the beam's resistance to bending.</p>		</li>

			<p>Graphene has a few uses it can have a variable electro conductivity when doped with other substances, it's super strong, and as you pointed out, flexible</p>		</li>

			<p>Fun fact: the discovery of graphene won a noble prize. To discover it, scientists used tape on graphite and transfered it onto a silicon wafer.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's really cool that at school I was taught that carbon was either in graphite or diamond form, and that was your choice... Now we have C60, nanotubes and graphene which were all there for the looking!</p>		</li>

			<p>Graphene, which is just a single sheet of graphite, is hexagons of covalently bonded carbon in a giant (ie indefinite) structure. As /u/andtheasswasfat said, obsidian is an amorphous solid of SiO2 (another giant covalent) and MgO, an ionic compound. </p>		</li>

			<p>A single layer of graphene is pretty weak, being only one atom thick.  You can of course layer together a lot of graphene, although <a href="http://admin.acceleratingscience.com/mining/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/istock_000019978938_graphitejpg-4.jpg" target="_blank">you're probably familiar with that</a>.</p>		</li>
