			<div class="markdown"><p>Both metal and salt are crystalline.  If you cut a crystal at an angle other than the natural shape of the crystal, you end up leaving a bunch of unbonded molecules or molecules with distorted bonds on the surface.  Both of these have high potential energy, which they release by either bonding with the environment (and corrode) or breaking on an angle that corresponds to the natural crystal structure.  Good blade steels have very small crystals so this effect is minimized.</p>
<p>Amorphous materials aren't crystalline at all, so cutting them doesn't leave unbonded or distorted molecules on the surface (they just redirect their bonds to their neighbors, but since they don't have a preferred orientation they can do this without the high distortion energies of a crystalline material).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure crystalline materials will have surface states no matter which plane you cut along, they're just more stable along certain crystal planes.  In fact amorphous materials will have unstable surface states too, it's just that there isn't a more stable form they can relax to.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about a making a knife out of Legos on a global scale. From the perspective of the Sun, the Legos make a fairly sharp edge. As you shrink down to human scale, we see how rough the edge is.</p>
<p>Obsidian is the same. What makes it up are molecules, SiO2, MgO, FeO, etc, that are flash frozen and haven't developed a crystal structure. They are held together by ionic bonds. As discussed elsewhere, metallic bonds work when a relatively large number of metal atoms are together. The bond is weaker as you try to thin the edge of a metal knife.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obsidian is mostly SiO2 like glass, which is covalent. It also has some ionic MgO in it. I imagine the amorphous structure makes it strong due to the increased intermolecular forces between dipoles, but it mainly has to do with the absence of slip planes and other flaws in a crystal lattice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? It has nothing to do with slip planes or magnesium. Obsidian is a glass quenched quickly from a volcanic melt. It has no crystal lattice, and it will have the same composition as the melt it came from (basalt, rhyolite, etc). The fact that it exists as a stable amorphous solid makes it able to take a very sharp edge, because the glass is is still stable even at very high surface area/volume ratios. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What does it mean &quot;it would corrode almost instantly&quot;? Like instantly as it was used to cut something? Or instantly like the material wouldn't be able to maintain that structure and it would change without any use of the blade?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The high surface area to atom ratio would cause the metal on the surface of the blade to oxidise with the oxygen in the atmosphere and corrode, losing the fine edge. A thicker metal edge would cause less of the metal to be oxidised, as the oxidation mainly occurs at the surface that is exposed to the environment, and keep it's edge longer. </p>
<p>An obsidian blade would be a lot less likely to react with the surrounding environment and keep it's thin edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Graphene, which is just a single sheet of graphite, is hexagons of covalently bonded carbon in a giant (ie indefinite) structure. As /u/andtheasswasfat said, obsidian is an amorphous solid of SiO2 (another giant covalent) and MgO, an ionic compound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single layer of graphene is pretty weak, being only one atom thick.  You can of course layer together a lot of graphene, although <a href="http://admin.acceleratingscience.com/mining/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/istock_000019978938_graphitejpg-4.jpg" target="_blank">you're probably familiar with that</a>.</p></div>		</li>
