			<p>For those trying to visualize ionic vs metallic bonds, think of ionic bonds as the way Legos bond. One atom has a hole (missing electron in its outer shell) and one has a disk (extra electron in its outer shell). The disk perfectly fits into the hole and is set. <br><br>For a metallic bond, have you ever seen two people form a seat for a third by using their left hand to grab their right wrist and the right hand to grab the person across's left wrist? That's a much weaker bond. Or consider a box closed with a French fold (one corner of each flap tucked under the next flap).  Moderate strength, but you can't put heavy things in that box. </p>		</li>

			<p>You're joking, but there's a property in mechanical engineering that could legitimately be nicknamed the coefficient of bendiness.<br><br>If you look at the equations for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflection_(engineering\)" target="_blank">bending of beams</a>, the factor &quot;E*I&quot; appears pretty much everywhere.  E (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulus_of_elasticity" target="_blank">Young's modulus</a>) is a measure of the stiffness of the material in tension/compression, and I (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_moment_of_area" target="_blank">area moment of inertia</a>) is a measure of the stiffness of the beam's geometrical shape.  Together they represent the beam's resistance to bending.</p>		</li>

			<p>The high surface area to atom ratio would cause the metal on the surface of the blade to oxidise with the oxygen in the atmosphere and corrode, losing the fine edge. A thicker metal edge would cause less of the metal to be oxidised, as the oxidation mainly occurs at the surface that is exposed to the environment, and keep it's edge longer. <br><br>An obsidian blade would be a lot less likely to react with the surrounding environment and keep it's thin edge.</p>		</li>

			<p>Old school bridges benefited from the arches allowing them to extend the length and longevity of operation. They were much stronger because of the way they were formed together.

			<p>Covalent bonding is atoms playing World of Goo.  Each atom bonds to just a few other atoms - one or two, sometimes three, occasionally up to six.  Once those bonds are in place, the atom feels no real attraction to any other atoms that it isn't bonded to.  You can make long chain molecules with covalent bonds, but it's harder to make a solid block of stuff.<br><br>Metallic bonding is like those Buckyball magnet toys: a big block of metal atoms stuck together.  Each atom is attracted to each other atom - there are no &quot;bonds&quot; where atom A is paired up with atom B, which is paired up with atom C, and so on.  A and B and C and every other atom are all pulled towards each other.</p>		</li>

			<p>Both metal and salt are crystalline.  If you cut a crystal at an angle other than the natural shape of the crystal, you end up leaving a bunch of unbonded molecules or molecules with distorted bonds on the surface.  Both of these have high potential energy, which they release by either bonding with the environment (and corrode) or breaking on an angle that corresponds to the natural crystal structure.  Good blade steels have very small crystals so this effect is minimized.<br><br>Amorphous materials aren't crystalline at all, so cutting them doesn't leave unbonded or distorted molecules on the surface (they just redirect their bonds to their neighbors, but since they don't have a preferred orientation they can do this without the high distortion energies of a crystalline material).</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm pretty sure crystalline materials will have surface states no matter which plane you cut along, they're just more stable along certain crystal planes.  In fact amorphous materials will have unstable surface states too, it's just that there isn't a more stable form they can relax to.  </p>		</li>

What makes it up are molecules, SiO2, MgO, FeO, etc, that are flash frozen and haven't developed a crystal structure. They are held together by ionic bonds.

			<p>Obsidian is mostly SiO2 like glass, which is covalent. It also has some ionic MgO in it.

			<p>What? It has nothing to do with slip planes or magnesium. Obsidian is a glass quenched quickly from a volcanic melt. It has no crystal lattice, and it will have the same composition as the melt it came from (basalt, rhyolite, etc). The fact that it exists as a stable amorphous solid makes it able to take a very sharp edge, because the glass is is still stable even at very high surface area/volume ratios. </p>		</li>

			<p>The poster talked about slip planes in halite because they were responding to a question asking why halite couldn't be sharpened in the same way. It all comes back to the crystal lattice of minerals which creates the slip planes in easily cleaved minerals. (in all minerals, really) crystal lattices create these differing physical properties of minerals compared to the rock obsidian. <br><br>Cleavage planes are an easy to visualize property of the crystal structure of halite. Naturally, halite breaks at 90 degrees in 3 directions and at the same microscopic scale would be much more dull than obsidian. This is all because halite has a crystal lattice and obsidian does not. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think he mentioned slip planes because harder materials tends to be able to hold finer edges. <br><br><br>Though he said there was a lack of defects...in a glass's crystal lattice. Bizarre.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;  but it mainly has to do with the absence of slip planes and other flaws in a crystal lattice.<br><br>I think he meant the flaws associated with a crystal lattice are missing in obsidian. </p>		</li>

			<p>You do realize no crystal lattice is <em>why</em> there are no real slip planes and whatnot? You agreed exactly with the person you 'disagree' with</p>		</li>

			<p>I assume that with salt you mean the stuff you sprinkle on your eggs (Chemical name: Sodium Chloride, also called Halite or rock salt if it's a mineral). This kind of salt really likes to arrange in regular cubes. If you give it an edge, over time the crystal will wear out and go back to it's prefered cube shape. That means that the angle of the edge changes to 90 degrees, the prefered angle for rock salt. Obviously, an edge that makes an angle of 90 degrees is not sharp at all.<br><br>Amorphous materials are amorphous because they don't really care about being in a neat crystal structure. Thus, they will not tend to rearange their molecules after having been cut. This means that their edges remain a lot sharper.</p>		</li>

			<p>Salt atomic structure is a cube. No matter how you cut it it will always be a cube. This is because it will cut along the lattice structure.</p>		</li>

			<p>To be fair some metals can be sharpened much further than obsidian. For example the tungsten needle in a tunneling electron microscope is only an atom thick at the point. </p>		</li>
