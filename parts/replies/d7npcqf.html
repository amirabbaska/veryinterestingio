			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the person measuring may only measure four times in a 24-hour period, at least as far as National Weather Service records are concerned. </p>
<p>This is why Silver Lake, CO still holds its 1921 record for 76 inches of snow in a 24-hour period, since in 1997 Montague, NY's 77 inches was measured six times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that seems unreasonable - why does it matter? If you have 6 inches of rain and measure it 100 times, it does not change the amount of rain that fell!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine if you measure more often, you can finesse the 24 hour period to be during the peak snowfall.</p>
<p>I had an example here, but it was clunky, and I'm sure someone will come along with a better one, or prove me completely wrong, so I'll just assert the above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For snowfall it's because snow self compacts. When they take a measurement they will clear the measuring surface to prep it for the next measurement. Measuring more often gives the snow less time to self compact and also reduces the amount of snow pressing down by increasing the number of clears through the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It mtaters for snow because snow is compressible. The longer the period of measurement, the less difference each additional snowflake makes, as it ends up compressing the snow beneath it. Makes no difference for rainfall.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snow is different than rain, as it contains air and compacts over time.  That's why fresh snow is fluffy, after all.</p>
<p>If you measure snow often (and in so doing clear off the measurement platform each time), then the you look at proportionally 'fluffier' snow than if you measured less often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This applies only to snow fall. Because snow compression. If you scrape it off after every inch instead of every 6 inches, it changes the final tally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, &quot;1 inch&quot; of rainfall means 1 cubic inch fell for each square inch of the affected area. Dimensional analysis checks out: in^3 / in^2 = in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  And if you're using a nice metric system, that means 1L of water falls per sqm for each 1mm of rain, which makes it rather easy to calculate, say, how much water you got in your rain tank (mulitply mm of rain by roof area, done!).  If you're using imperial units it's <em>almost</em> as easy!  Multiply the area of your roof (in sq feet) by 144 to get it in square inches.  Then multiply that by the amount of rain (in inches), which will give you a volume in cubic inches.  Then divide that by 231 (approx) to get the total volume in gallons.  Easy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you can think of it as a larger surface area of the opening increases the sample size, and the skinnier measuring device is the more 'precise' (not accurate) the reading will be.  That's why if you look up 'rain gauge' the majority of designs have a flared opening of sorts. </p></div>		</li>
