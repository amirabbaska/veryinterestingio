<p>Does the nutritional content change? Yes, starches break down into sugars as the fruit gets bruised or ripens. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But won't the starches get broken down into sugars anyway, once digested?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it will. The main difference is that it takes longer time to digest polysaccharides than monosaccharides (the reason why you eat pasta and not pure sugar before running a marathon)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But aren't they both just carbohydrates? So depending on how you interpret the question, the nutritional content may or may not change... So if if you interpret nutritional content as just fats, proteins and carbs it doesn't change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you damage it mechanically &amp; that makes more susceptible to fungus &amp; bacteria which will <em>ferment</em> the sugar in the damaged area to alcohol over time, but the peel on a banana is protective against that.</p>
<p>a fully ripe banana has a black peel but the flesh is yellow. a bruise shows up as a darkened, softer spot on the flesh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific a bruised banana is broken down from a polysaccharide into the smaller monosacharide or sugar molecules. This is what you body does during digestion anyway but it does change the rate of digestion basically changing it from a complex carb to a simple one. </p></div>		</li>
