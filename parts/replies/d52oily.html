			<div class="markdown"><p>The octopus would be highly defensive during this period of time and force feeding may not be feasible.  It has evolved to protect the eggs until death by starvation, so if given nutrients it would likely continue protecting its eggs.  </p>
<p>However, examples of this happening have yet to be observed in nature, and there have been no experiments to date explicitly studying such circumstances.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking along the lines of how people in a coma are given nutrients - sedate the octopus, and place the nutrients directly into the octopus (I doubt intravenously would work, but the equivalent). Would this be considered cruelty?</p></div>		</li>
