<p>I'd add that, for all we know, the current &quot;laws of physics&quot;, if you will, are only what we can see now: for all we know, there was a whole different set of rules that applied when matter didn't exist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where I get frustrated with claims in an argument over whether things are &quot;proven&quot;. Granted there's a huge spectrum where something can fall on the scale between proven and unproven, but so many people use it in an argument as an absolute when discussing scientific theory.</p>
<p>Of course, &quot;proof&quot; isn't really a term best used when dealing with the sciences, that's why theories exist in the first place. The term is really better suited for mathematics. Either way, in the general sense, science creates hypothesis (which in and of its self is guess, it's merely educated) and uses data to come to a reasonable conclusion about its validity. The idea that anything is &quot;proven&quot; goes against the fundamental rules that makeup the scientific method in the first place. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Using the word &quot;proven&quot; in science is lazy. I'll get off my soap box now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy is like water. Sometimes it spills all over whatever and just flows wherever it's easiest. Then the same water can be turned to ice. The ice acts different than the liquid water, but really it's the same stuff in a different form. You can make ice into liquid, and you can make liquid water into ice. They seem very different, but they are fundamentally the same. What we think of as solid stuff is just sort of frozen energy. We can change it back and forth, but we can't make ice from nothing, and we can't make it into nothing....probably.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Science has both laws and theories.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk3TKuGNBA" target="_blank">Here's a nice video</a> that explains what these words mean in science.  In a nutshell, a law describes how, a theory describes why.  Note that a theory is not merely a proposed explanation, like it is in everyday language.  In science that would be called a hypothesis.  Only when a hypothesis is sound and verified can it graduate to a theory.</p>

<p>No, but it can mean that the law or theory you use is incomplete or limited in scope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they are not. E=MC^2 is not the full equation.</p>
<p>Energy can exist without mass, mass can't exist without energy.</p>
<p>Mass is not conserved. Mass is just a form of energy. </p>
<p>Also no the question if energy can't be created how does it exist doesn't necessarily get into the beginning of the universe type question. Always existed in some way shape or form no beginning satisfies the answer quite well.</p>
<p>Hell laws don't even have to always apply in every circumstance. The answer could be as simple as energy can't be created or destroyed in x circumstance. Universe has X circumstance but at one point did not.</p>
<p>Regardless there is no concrete answer but this top answer is completely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Matter antimatter annihilation destroys two masses and emits two massless photons.</p>
</li>
<li>Gamma radiation? The source loses mass and only emits a massless photon. </li>
<li>[Two black holes]( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves</a>) of mass 29 and 36 solar masses collide and leave a black hole of only 62 solar masses whilst emitting only 3c^2 solar masses of massless gravity waves (gravitons).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why the hell is this being upvoted and all disagreements being downvoted?! Seriously, ELI5 needs to be held to higher standards. </p>
<p>The answer is that matter <em>and</em> mass can be created and destroyed. <strong>Energy</strong> (of which mass is a form) is constant and cannot be created or destroyed. </p>
<p>E = mc^2 <em>only</em> if the particle is at rest (p=0), otherwise E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^(2))^(2) so for a massless particle all the energy is in the form of momentum, p. They still don't have mass.</p>
<p>Edit: before you downvote me, reply to me and tell me what you think is wrong with what I've written!</p>
<p>Edit2: /u/stuthulhu Even with regards to your edit, mass-energy is equivelent to saying energy. No physicist uses the term anymore because it was only used to get across the idea that mass is energy. Mass-energy however implies they are identical when they are not, mass is one form of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually <em>you're</em> wrong on this. A pair of matter / antimatter particles (I assume you mean quantum fluctuations here) have a combined net energy of precisely zero. So if they meet and vanish, the energy content of the universe doesn't change at all. A particle pair of zero energy vanished and leaves us with zero energy. Same energy after the event as before it. No violation of conservation of energy happened at all.</p>

<p>It has energy, though.</p>

<p>That's a fundamental misunderstanding of antimatter. Antimatter has a positive mass and hence a positive energy. And how on earth does pair production have a zero total energy. It has two photons of energy hf, which is positive. This might be a good time to point out we have never discovered any negative energy density particle. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes! That my entire point. Energy is conserved!, mass is not. </p>

<p>Two misses? I only know of one. But this one is at something like 5 sigma (1 in a million chance if error) and has been peer reviewed unlike last time. It is fact. </p></div>		</li>
