			<div class="markdown"><p>Yours is the only comment that survived, so I'm curious what some of the &quot;mixture of things as mentioned in other posts here&quot; was. Things like shape and size of the various organs and muscles involved (lungs, diaphragm, larynx, mouth, tongue, etc.)? Maybe it is impossible to say what combination of traits in these physical structures leads to &quot;good&quot; singing (especially since the quality of a voice is so subjective), but I wonder if you can shed any further light on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the above.</p>
<p>It is similar guitars and violins, where the physical resonances (due to shapes and materials of the body) work together differently and more musically in certain people.</p>
<p>One thing that's quite interesting is that all the modern singers you hear on radio have a very noticeable, but pleasing, resonance in 2-3kHz range from their nasal cavities, which lets their voice cut through dense mixes and background noise.</p>
<p>We can perform similar adjustments to other singers voices with equalisation during mixing, but it's never the same - always sounds more unpleasant relative to singers who naturally have that resonance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everyone has that. That's an enormous range. Unless you meant a more specific range within that range that's noticeable and pleasing, but 2-3kHz is huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape of your skeleton, the size of your nasal cavity, how big or small your head is, everything about your body, especially the skeletal structure, influences how you sound. The size and density of your teeth, the girth of your tongue, your height! Everything. </p>
<p>Family members tend to sound similar because they physically look like each other. Their facial skeletons are similarly shaped. They were also raised listening to the same voices as the rest of the family.</p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>One important factor in how you sing is the vocal folds. The length of the vocal folds affect how high or low the voice can go. The thickness of the vocal folds will also affect how it sounds. Trained singers can, however, manipulate the vocal folds and their breathing to sing higher and lower than untrained singers can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vocal major here.</p>
<p>Singing is a process that's both psychological and physiological.  Certain things are determined for you by genetics, voice type, for example; according to vocal pedagogy expert Roger miller in &quot;Securing Baritone, Bass-Baritone, &amp; Bass Voices&quot;,  there are five common variants of the baritone (mid-range male) voice alone.  Certain famous singers have unique traits that are difficult to impossible to match, because they are physiological;  Freddy Mercury of Queen had a rapid, uneven vibrato that is almost impossible to mimic, and high sopranos have a fullness at the top of their range that can't be matched by other voices.</p>
<p>Speaking of fullness, there are several component sounds that go into proper (western-classical, which also includes rock or jazz) sound production; the most commonly talked about are Ring and Richness but consonants and vowels also belong there.  According to &quot;the Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults&quot;  Ring is an overtone^1 in the 2800-3200 Hz range, caused by the larynx, though it is debated whether it's caused by the vocal chords or the space around it.  Richness is a lower partial^1 in the 330 to 750 Hz range, and is caused by an open, relaxed pharynx (the back of the mouth/throat: think around the back and bottom of the tongue and you've got the place.)  Consonants and Vowels are a product of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_vowels" target="_blank">shape your tongue and mouth are making together.</a>  Also important are the nasal sounds like 'm' or 'n'.  These use the nasal cavity for the buzziness.</p>
<p>Now, in order to get these proper sounds you have to support with your breath.  You might notice that people who tend to be more confident about singing sing better?  That's why (though it's also because they've practiced).  Also important for sound is singing in a range that is good for you.</p>
<p>See, every voice has a range (absolute range of notes), tessitura (range of best notes) and timbre (quality, which is a largely abstract, though quite real, result of the dozens of little physiological things that go into a voice).  Now, this is dangerous ground because literature is divided on what and where the registers are, so for the sake of transparency, this information is in &quot;the Diagnosis and Corrections of Vocal Faults&quot;.  The range is split up into 4 registers, and each register is a section in the range where the vocal cords are acting in a certain way.  The Vocal Fry<del>, often used by Mariah Carey,</del> produces a very low rattley/breathy tone, and is caused by the vocal cords relaxing and the glottis (the thing that prevents food from getting in your wind pipe) letting air pass over it.  The Modal register is everyone's power house; it's where everything's working in a normal, optimal fashion.  Right above the modal, and overlapping slightly, is the Falsetto; the vocal cords tighten, with the exception of a small fringe region that continues to vibrate. Finally, above that is the Whistle register, so named because in a high woman's voice it sounds like a whistle.  Little is known about the Whistle register because it is difficult to film; the vocal tract tightens up to have the smallest surface.</p>
<p>This is by no means the end of the details that go into singing, but now we get into opinion.  Common wisdom tells you that the optimal range is best, but singers like Mariah Carey and Freddie Mercury were popular while singing primarily in other registers.  Common wisdom tells you that clean, well made vowels ad consonants makes for better singing, but country music utilizes the singer's natural accent to stylize.  Certain voice types have wider appeal, like the booming operatic voices, but every voice can fill a particular niche.  A non-operatic male voice doesn't have the power for opera for example, but has the emotional subtleties necessary for art song.</p>
<p>The straightest answer that satisfies both academic literature and common wisdom is that, barring faults like physiological structures that aren't formed properly, the best sounding voice is the one that is being used so that its strengths shine.</p>
<p>Compare <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hR_DY6K7y4&amp;list=PLO96K56QaFcprICdJFir4KmeSbkTL8VXD" target="_blank">Lied singer Fischer-Dieskau singing Schubert's &quot;Whither?&quot;</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPZlUivmU9s&amp;list=PLm4xK0UUL4o-zKAjnoWjtOzeBQchbjY6M&amp;index=15" target="_blank">Pavarotti singing &quot;Che Gelida Manina&quot;</a></p>
<p>These two aren't the best to compare, because they are different voice types (Dieskau was a baritone and Pavarotti was a tenor), but they illustrate using your strengths more than your weaknesses.</p>
<p>EDIT: oops, forgot the note, and typos</p>
<p>Thank you, hochizo, for pointing out the mistake</p>
<p>1: When waves interact with each other, they add or subtract from each other depending on where the crests and trows are.  Overtones and lower partials are the result of these; spaces and frequencies adding up to make extra low and high notes.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_\(music\)" target="_blank">Here's a wiki page on the harmonic series, which are the natural overtones</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n3qMB6AD_0" target="_blank">here's a short video that explains it well</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not backed on a rigorous study, but on several hours talking with my vocal professors during lessons.</p>
<p>The vocal instrument as a whole, meaning nearly the entire body, is made up of many different types of tissue.  The ones that see the most change will be the muscles this includes the diaphragm, the muscles that position you larynx, and the muscles of the mouth.  The primary difference in the vocal folds won't be thickness, indicating higher strength, but the distance they can stretch without tearing.  Practice does change them, but it does so by building stamina as well as flexibility.</p>
<p>The next thing you will notice, depending on how long or badly you've been practicing, is damage.  The voice wears out with use.  The hoarseness that comes with shouting is when your vocal cords are bleeding from over use and can't hold shape from exhaustion.  Even singers with good habits will eventually lose control of them because of extended use.  Usually, 60-70 years old is the end of a singer's professional career.  Not to say they can't sing, but that it becomes difficult to perform a difficult solo well.</p>
<p>Now, and this gets to the heart of it, I think, practice builds stamina, but that's about all it does physiologically.  Range, power, subtlety, all the most important parts of singing are due to good technique, which practice builds on.  If you had never sung before, but had perfect technique, by which I mean perfect control and understanding of the instrument, the only advantage a singer with a lifetime of experience would have on you is stamina.  Likewise, a master of violin can do better on a broken student violin than an amateur on a Stradivarius.</p>
<p>Flexibility, and range by extension, is a strange topic, because it is one part excericise and two parts experience.  Freddy Mercury was the king of flexibility.  He could navigate the transitions between registers, not an easy task even with years of experience, without a hitch.  In fact he was actually a baritone.  The tenor you heard in his music was him traveling through all the different registers and stretching each as far as it needed to go.</p>
<p>Sorry, rambling.  TL;DR:  yes, but not significantly.</p>
<p>EDIT: welp, this replied to the wrong comment, but the guy above me is quite right, technique over physiology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on your definition of &quot;significantly&quot; but yes, I would imagine so. I've never done the images, but the body does physically change from practice for singing.  </p>
<p>However, I'd say that probably the biggest difference between a beginner amateur singer with a good ear, and not singing so great, and then becoming good at singing, would be a change of technique. </p>
<p>However, after that, the excercise and everything would definitely make a difference on top of that, but more as a kind of tone, or range, or power kind of thing. Kind of first technique goes from poor but on pitch, to good, and then practice can take that to great. </p>
<p>If you sing really badly, off pitch and everything, that's a whole other can of worms. And a lot of people say they can traing hearing better, so that would not be a physiological change, but more of a mental one.</p></div>		</li>
