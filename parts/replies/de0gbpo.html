			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit, I know prices are messed up everywhere. I have my own chickens and rabbits, and I grow my own produce. Fuck paying for lettuce when I can have a couple of rows of it! </p>
<p>But seriously though, fuck prices of shit. It gets to the point where I want to grow my own trees just to combat some shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, if something is stolen, it costs 10x the cost to make that loss back. Idk how this works, I just know that's how they measure loss. </p>
<p>Example: someone steals a $20 ham. The store must sell 10 hams ($200) to negate that loss. This is only grocery stores, afaik.</p></div>		</li>
