			<div class="markdown"><p>Capsaicin isnt hot. It sticks to specific receptors in our Taste buds, which makes us feel the &quot;heat&quot;. The turned on receptors are just sensitive to the heat of our oral cavity </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the binding of the capsaicin to the receptor does cause the burn feeling, not the temp in your mouth. The receptor does the same action if exposed to extreme heat or strong acid in your mouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It causes the burn feeling because it starts reacting to the heat. See just the post below. I have posted a link which explains this far better </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the problem with that is that it's not literal heat, it's a sensation of pain on your taste buds. It could probably burn a whole through your stomach if there was enough acid in the food, but stomachs are pretty strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not the stomach melting that you should worry about. It’s the way out.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I think the anus and throat would go first as they are softer tissue not used to such acidic materials flowing through them..</p></div>		</li>
