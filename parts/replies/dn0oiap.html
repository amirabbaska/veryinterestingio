			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, they can't. They can figure out where it's going to land... But it will be too late to actually do anything about it if it <em>is</em> headed for land. There's a big misconception that we're able to accurately predict ICBMs as soon as they're launched. In reality, there is a <em>lot</em> of stuff that can change while the missile is cruising. Everything from &quot;oh god, the missile had less fuel than we thought, and isn't going to fly over the country,&quot; to &quot;holy shit, it just changed course by 5 degrees, and is now headed for an entirely different part of the country.&quot; By the time they've nailed down the target area, they'll only have a few minutes before it arrives.</p>
<p>There's also a big misconception that they're easy to reliably shoot down. In reality, the systems that <em>can</em> target ICBM's aren't tested. They've literally never needed to be used, so we have no idea if they'll <em>actually</em> work. The only reason we believe they can defend against a missile attack is because the government says they can. And even then, most systems are only capable of targeting missiles below a certain altitude. The problem with this is that an ICBM will speed up to supersonic speeds after reentry, and by the time it's below those required altitudes it'll be moving too fast for the defense systems to be accurate. It's like trying to hit a fired bullet with a rock and a slingshot. At those speeds, your best option is to simply put the rock somewhere in the bullet's predicted flight path, and hope you were accurate enough. Or just prevent the bullet from ever being fired to begin with by plugging up the barrel with the rock, which is what most systems try to do; They'd rather shoot down the missile during the boost phase (right after it's launched, and traveling towards the atmosphere,) instead of waiting for reentry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To some extent, I agree. However, in the case of the two missiles fired over Japan, these missles were already 200-400 miles in space when they were over Japan, and traveling at several thousand miles per hour. It would have been virtually impossible for these missiles to have hit Japan. (granted we would not have known this until the missiles were well into their flight)</p></div>		</li>
