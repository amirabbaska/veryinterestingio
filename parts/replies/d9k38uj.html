<p>but a major limiting factor in the past has been the maximum length of elevator cables, which is on the order of 800 feet, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extremely curious about this. I don't know the first thing about elevators, but chairlifts 6,000 ft long with 3,000 ft elevation gain are extremely common. Let alone some aerial tramways (some of them built more than half a century ago) that do even crazier things, at time without a single support. All of them using cable technology. What makes elevator limited to 800 ft?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article I read on it indicated elevator cables have to be able to support the cargo weight of the car plus the weight of the cable. The longer the cable, the more of that total weight is the cable, requiring a fatter cable, which weighs corresponding more. The cable also has be able to be contained on a reel that fits within the limited space confines of the building core. The multiple constraint satisfaction equation brings it to about 800 feet. Many of those constraints don't apply to the ski lifts and gondola systems -i.e. they don't have to lift straight up and are less limited in the space for the supporting infrastructure. Again, much of this is a combination of technological and economic argument that goes into the total design problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that 800 feet is more of a rule of thumb limit where it becomes expensive/impractical rather than a hard limit. There are mineshafts that are are more than 1km deep, and I have taken a cage down 800 meters, so it is clearly possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is about more than just the cable. Mining lifts go miles down and still operate as a single stage. There is a potash mine in my area that has a 4.5 km lift. It carries 20 people down 4.5km (2.5 miles) in one stage, then again though it doesn't have to stop and start every 12 feet. It reaches about 80 km/h at peak velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this then be where carbon fiber tech could come in, assuming they can get the technology to the point where mass production is possible? Would that solve some of the limiting factors at least with elevators?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chairlifts are supported every couple of hundred feet, spreading the weight of the cable.
In an elevator shaft the whole cable is supported at a single point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a system that didnt rely on only vertical movement? I saw the article mentioned that the primary transportation would be mag train, and I know they mean getting around the 6 mile base (etc) BUT what if you add some sort of spiral structure tram system that ran the exterior of the building and was angled upward so that it worked like a subway going around the building? OR an axis system that uses a central pole with angled grooves to rotate and rise? If you want me to explain myself better I can map out what Im thinking, but can someone tell me why this wouldnt work or hasnt been done? It has to be too obvious...
EDIT: my spelling is horrible, apologies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with offshore cranes, some of which are capable of lowering objects to the ocean floor (cable length 3000+ meters).  Yes, it's certainly possible to work with cables that long.  However, it's difficult and costly.</p>
<p>For one thing, steel cable is incredibly heavy, so when you start getting extremely long cables, the weight of the cable becomes as great or even greater than your live load.  Your line tension skyrockets, which means you need a thicker cable, which weighs more so your tension is even higher, so you need a thicker cable, and so on.  You end up needing a cable that looks monstrously oversized for the load you'll be lifting.  And then you need a <em>huge</em> winch to handle the huge cable, and huge motors to power the winch.  God help your electric bill.  We get around the motor issue with our cranes by using a gearbox with insane mechanical advantage, but that means the hoisting speed gets very slow: on the order of 10-20 meters per <em>minute</em>, far too slow for a passenger elevator.</p>
<p>For another thing, even materials as stiff as steel are elastic.  The longer your cable, the more &quot;bouncy&quot; everything gets, which takes expensive equipment to compensate and correct.</p>
<p>So basically you're talking about a winch and associated machinery that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and takes up a conference room's worth of space, not to mention ~100kW of electrical power, <em>per elevator</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's true.</p>
<p>Because indirectly this &quot;problem&quot; is factoring an economic limitation.</p>
<p>IF a taller building needs a bigger footprint, and money is not a problem, then we could build a 12,000 feet tall building, with a base 12,000 feet wide. </p>
<p>Of course, the price would be ridiculous, but that's not a limitation for OP question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the base is 12,000 feet, it would have more people which would require more elevators.</p>
<p>Maybe you mean a tapering structure. Sure, yes, it is an economic limitation, but a very strong one.</p></div>		</li>
