			<div class="markdown"><p>In bright, reddish-yellow flames, what you see is soot (small particles of unburnt carbon) glowing through their heat, yes.</p>
<p>With the blueish-purplish flames you get when you have the fuel combusting more cleanly (such as in the flame of a blowtorch), what you see instead is excited molecules that are formed during the combustion relaxing towards the ground state, and in doing so, emitting certain frequencies of light. For example, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Spectrum_of_blue_flame_-_intensity_corrected.png" target="_blank">this</a> is the spectrum of a pre-mixed butane flame, with the peaks labelled by the specific molecules that cause them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flames don't get hot enough to become plasma. What you're actually seeing is the soot coming off the flame glowing because it's so hot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually white, which means it's emitting across the whole visual spectrum and a good deal of the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum too. UV is too short a wavelength for us to see, but it certainly affects our bodies, and the sun emits plenty. IR is too long a wavelength for our eyes to see, but a lot of it is keeping our planet nice and warm.</p>
<p>When it looks reddish or yellowish at sunset or sunrise, that's because with the angle we're seeing it at, there's a lot more atmosphere scattering the shorter wavelengths like green/blue/violet.</p>
<p>There's two reasons for images that show it yellow-orange though: First is that so many people expect it to be yellow that it's often tinted that way in images because people won't recognize it otherwise.</p>
<p>The other reason is visibility and/or filters: if you're using certain filters on a telescope, it's cutting out portions of the EM spectrum so you can focus on the parts/effects/regions/etc you want to actually see. By design, this can affect what portions of visible light you get to see. The very common Glass filters (covered in Chromium and I think Nickel) give the classic yellow-orange look for example, but Mylar can give it a blue tint!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well it's green, not white. there is always a hump in the spectrum and our sun's hump is in the green part. however, our visual system is tuned to see that particular spectrum as white.</p>
<p>images of the sun tend to be at sunset or sunrise*, when the sun indeed is yellow for the reasons you state. other than a child's drawings (or filtered scientific images as you point out) you don't see many images of the sun where it is yellow.</p>
<p>* There's a few reasons - sunset/sunrise is a more interesting picture and if the sun were not near the horizon it would be out of frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not hot enough to glow blue. There are stars with wavelength peaks that are blue, but they're much hotter than the sun. There are cooler stars that glow red or yellow. The temperature of our sun makes it glow white. The reason we perceive sunlight to be yellowish, however, is because of our atmosphere which scatters the shorter wavelengths. This also causes the sky to appear blue.</p></div>		</li>
