			<div class="markdown"><p>Whales like this actually completely collapse their lungs during deep dives so that there are no air-filled spaces left. They actually EXHALE right before the dive. They don't explode at the surface because they don't inhale at depth, like we would if we were SCUBA diving with a tank.</p>
<p>Deep-diving whales store most of their oxygen in their muscles, bound to molecules called myoglobin (the muscle version of hemoglobin), so they don't have to worry much about circulating oxygen in their blood stream. If they have too much dissolved gas (especially Nitrogen) in their blood, those can come out of solution as they ascend, so these whales can actually get &quot;the bends&quot; if they come up too quickly. </p>
<p>Fun fact: Skeletons of really old sperm whales actually should signs of &quot;the bends&quot; due to gasses coming out of solution in their blood stream, and the effects of this accumulate over the course of thousands of dives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense now! You encompassed about 2-3 comments here and added some extra info. Thanks</p>
<p>I guess they also have to store a lot of myoglobin in their brains, though I wasn’t sure if the brain was a muscle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No myoglobin in the brain, but myoglobin is only \~80% of the oxygen storage in a diving whale. Some of the oxygen does get stored by binding it to hemoglobin, which can circulate to different parts of the body, such as the brain, to keep the tissue functional. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s pretty nutty considering most Dugong and Sea Otters only go down for 5-10m. I guess other whales go down for much longer, but damn, I don’t think nowhere near 2h 17m. </p></div>		</li>
