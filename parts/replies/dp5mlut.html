<p>I'm not surprised to learn that they can predict what KIND of stars created our matter if not the precise NUMBER. Although I did read somewhere that based on the age of the universe and the sun we can estimate that our system is probably about a 4th generation system give or take IIRC. It's not hard to guess from that that there were probably about four stars, esp if each was smaller than the last. Perhaps more if there was mixing or binaries or other stuff going on.</p></div>		</li>
