			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a rate of sea level increase of about <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/features/rising_waters_how_fast_and_how_far_will_sea_levels_rise" target="_blank">3.2mm/year</a>. That's a volume of 3200 m^3 per square km, or about <strong>3.2 million kg</strong> per year, per km^2. A big aircraft carrier like the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/USS_Enterprise_%28CVN-65%29.jpg/800px-USS_Enterprise_%28CVN-65%29.jpg" target="_blank">USS Enterprise</a> weighs 25 times that.</p>
<p>What does all that mean in regard to your actual question? No idea, but it doesn't sound like much, as far as weight goes.</p></div>		</li>
