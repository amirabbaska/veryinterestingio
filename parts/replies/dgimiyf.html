<p>I find this really interesting. I've had it once before when I crashed pretty badly on a bike. It felt like I was watching someone else crash and I even thought, &quot;Damn, this guy's gonna get hurt.&quot; Initially, there was no pain, just a need to get up and move, which makes sense with the &quot;fight&quot; part. </p>
<p>I'm curious what causes the disassociative feeling since there's really not much of a point to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say for sure, but it may be self-protective for the brain. When you are experiencing something terrible, it can numb out some of the pain. This may be why victims of repetitive trauma (such as repeated episodes of molestation) dissociate more often; it is a defense mechanism the brain has come to rely on.</p></div>		</li>
