			<div class="markdown"><p>You obviously were born and raised in a big city. You are simplifying rural people to the point of stereotype. There are so many things wrong with your response, that i dont have the time or patience to explain all of the ways in which youre wrong. </p>
<p>One glaring example is &quot;trade requires several things. A relatively educated workforce, access to writers...&quot;where exactly do you think that trade originates from? Are city people born with the mechanical, electrical, technical skills required run and maintain the equipment necessary for civilization to survive? I guess your local whole foods gets their super fresh tomatoes and oranges from the community gardens on the roof of your high rise apartment. I wonder where their beef comes from...huh.</p>
<p>&quot;If you lived on a remote farm and a stranger came calling, wouldnt you want to grab your gun?&quot; Ive lived on a farm in bum fucked egypt south texas all of my life. When we get strangers that come up to the house, its because 1. Theyve broken down and needed help. 2. They were lost or were in some kind of trouble and needed help. What do you think our response was to these people? Of course we helped the poor bastards. Can a city person say they would the same thing in a similar situation?</p>
<p>Strangers have never looted us, stolen our crops, or enslaved us. Probably because we all have guns. &quot;Fast city folks&quot; seem to spend a whole lot of time in traffic due to the congestion. In the time it take you to get home from work, i could have drove 3 counties away did my business and been back home to watch teen titans. Ive never been to church either so all of those arguments are invalid as well. Imagine that. I can say with 100% confidence that all of my neighbors will tell you the same thing...because i know all of neighbors personally. Can a city person say the same?</p>
<p>One of my best friends is a Karen State refugee. And the other is a refugee from Eritrea. My best friend in school was from Vietnam. I pretty much lived at his house, ate with his family, beat up his little brother, played video games and ate pho every sunday. I consider them my brothers. So my exposure to other cultures, most definitely is not limited to my immediate environment. Can a city person that lives in the segregated slums say the same thing?</p>
<p>My point is, you are full of shit. And you are propagating a divisive attitude, while at the same time, trying to belittle people in a smarmy way to make yourself look smarter than you are, about something you know nothing about.You probably thought that nobody would call you on it.</p>
<p>This explanation simplifies the issue. Lets make it more concrete.</p>
<p>If rural people decided to stop doing business with city people, would they get back on reddit to complain about how hungry they were before they starved to death? So you tell me. Who is the slave? The self sufficient farmer/rancher selling his goods to a dependant city worker? Or the super progressive city zombie selling his time/life to buy what the farmer is selling him? (Assuming he can get a job. With all that education hes probably over qualified for everything.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 -- I was talking about how civilizations arose in history, not speaking of your particular situation. It was in this context that I referred to looting and slavery. </p>
<p>2 -- I acknowledged in a later post that cities need an agricultural surplus to develop, that most cities need food from the countryside. </p>
<p>3 -- Regarding having my car break down in some desolate corner of Texas (yes, I have driven across it several times), I would be worried about the members of a remote farmhouse, having seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. </p>
<p>1-- I respect rural religious attitudes. All of them, though I was raised a Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>2 -- I understand how vital rural areas are, both in producing food and distributing manufacturing around the country. (Ye Olde &quot;company town.&quot;) A few cities shouldn't have all the best jobs. </p>
<p>3 -- On a later post, I noted the great writers that came from small rural towns, some of the greatest, most talented writers in America -- Faulkner, McCullers, O'Connor, etc.  Authors who wrote about the vagaries of the human heart in all its complexity.</p></div>		</li>
