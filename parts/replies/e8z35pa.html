			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, yes. The hot/cold receptors are most commonly activated between 68 to 86˚F for cold, and 86 to 104˚F for hot. If you go further in either direction your body starts sending pain signals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At Epcot’s now-closed Wonders of Life pavilion, there was an exhibit that included a big coil of about 1/2” piping. The pipes were wrapped around a spool and alternated very warm and very cold. It would simulate the paradoxical cold effect without actually being a dangerous temperature. You would instinctively jerk your hand back at first, but it was fine. It was really weird to just put your hand on there and feel that sustained sensation.  </p></div>		</li>
