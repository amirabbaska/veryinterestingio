			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I right in thinking that essentially you'll still be <em>noticed</em>, ie tracked on radar, it's simply that you're doing something allowed?</p>
<p>If ATC somewhere tries to contact you anyway and you don't respond, would that change things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are not on a filed flight plan and outside of controlled airspace (which is most of the airspace in the united states) then you have no obligation to talk to ATC and no obligation to even have a radio turned on.  </p>
<p>One thing I should note If you are flying in from outside of the country you must be on a flight plan and must talk to ATC and must land an airport with Customs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they track the planes coming from outside the country? How do they follow them without having the systems on? How do they check that they landed in an airport with Customs? Should they contact the local authorities to &quot;assault&quot; the plane? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there any uncontrolled airports in the US where you can fly an commercial-sized aircraft?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely there are many that can handle &quot;smaller&quot; commercial aircraft such as a 737. It would be a bit harder if dealing with say a 747 or A380.  </p>
<p>A good example would be that Southwest operates 737s out of Chicago Midway on a regular basis. The longest runways at Midway are around 6,500 feet and there are many smaller airports with 6-7,000 foot runways. It is also not that common in some areas of the country for rural airports to be older converted military bases from WWII training that have been turned over to the FAA and kept up for Civilian use.<br />
A good example is this <a href="http://www.airnav.com/airport/A08" target="_blank">small airport in Alabama</a>. If you look at the pictures you will notice the area of the runway maintained and repaved is 6,400 feet, but you can tell it was once much bigger.</p></div>		</li>
