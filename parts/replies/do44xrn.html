			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the salts helped kill the bacteria which I don't see as probable since the infection is inside the tissues not on the surface. It would take a few days for the damage created by infection to heal and stop causing pain. The pain you feel from an infection isn't caused by the infectious agent by by your own immune systems inflamation and response to the infection.</p>
<p>Gargling salt water for 15 seconds and spitting it out isn't going kill germs and heal the infection so quickly that it will ease the pain. </p>
<p>That's just a flat out incorrect guess.</p></div>		</li>
