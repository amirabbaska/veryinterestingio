			<div class="markdown"><p>I paint furniture using water based paint and humidity is something I am always battling. Since water based paint dries by water evaporating from the paint I often have to point a fan to get it to dry faster.</p>
<p>When it is raining or 100% humidity, pointing a fan at fresh paint does nearly nothing. I understand why now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good observation. That is correct: the lower the air's humidity, the faster stuff will dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this also why a hot humid day feels hotter than a hot dry day, all else equal?   Body cools down by sweating -&gt; endothermic evaporation.  Slower evaporation, less heat absorbed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New Orleans here, literally the most humid place in the States.  It’s about 100% humidity here for 3-6 months out the year and it’s oppressive.  Your wet from the time you set foot outside until your back inside.  The air is so saturated with water your sweat can’t evaporate to cool, the heat index as it’s known. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also change humidity by heating the air correct? Hot air holds more vapor than cold air (I heard 7% per degree?) so all else equal, painter guy could increase the temperature of air on a rainy day and it would dry faster?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partly why some paints use alcohol or acetone as a solvent instead; while the air might have 100% vapor pressure of water, it almost certainly wouldn't have a significant vapor pressure from alcohol or acetone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should add onto that a quick blurb about other phase changes. Like people don’t realize sublimation also occurs with water. We see it clearly with dry ice, but solid water also does this (albeit at a much slower rate). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to visualize this by thinking about old ice in a freezer. Eventually the ice shrinks and disappears</p>
<p>(of course this is also due to the defrost cycle and other variables but sublimation is still a factor)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Directly goes from solid to gas (i.e. subllimates), but that's exactly what's happening.</p></div>		</li>
