			<div class="markdown"><p>When you sniffle, like inhaling sniffle if that makes sense, do you feel pressure? Also, the bag area under your eyes (not saying you have bags, I'm sure you look fabulous), does it hurt when you tap it or rub it? I had sinus headaches forever and then I eventually had to get surgery because mine were getting clogged. Talk about pain so bad you wanna commit homicide.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have to be a little careful here, since this could describe any of the autonomic trigeminal cephalagias. The key here is what's meant by &quot;short&quot; duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5 seconds to 4 minutes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUNCT_syndrome" target="_blank">SUNCT syndrome</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 to 30 minutes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_paroxysmal_hemicrania" target="_blank">Chronic Paroxysmal Hemicrania</a></p>
</li>
<li>30 minutes to 4 hours: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache" target="_blank">Cluster headache</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are other symptoms, as well - notably the autonomic ones and headache cadence - but the duration can help determine the correct diagnosis and course of treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a notification that you replied, but it's now gone. I would definitely recommend a CT of your sinuses, just to see if they're narrowed or blocked. That can rule out certain things. The way I know when I have a sinus headache is when I have the sniffles and I sniff in through my nose, and I feel painful pressure in my head and face. Like someone hit me with a hammer. </p>
<p>My sphenoid sinuses were blocked with mucus retention cysts, and they were getting so bad that they were eroding towards my pituitary gland. I ended up losing sight in my right eye every time I got a bad one, and they kept telling me it was migraines but I knew it wasn't. I had to have surgery, and I got to endure a spinal tap to make sure no bacteria got into my spinal fluid! Gotta love when your body doesn't do what it's supposed to!</p></div>		</li>
