			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I would like to add to this: </p>
<p>In sport,  if one participant comes up with an innovation that produces objectively better results (better aerodynamics,  new technique, etc)  you immediately see that innovation spread to everyone else in the sport.    If it improves safety you might even see it become a mandatory component of the sport for the benefit of all participants. </p>
<p>But in politics and domestic policy,  if one country comes up with a system that produces objectively better results it seems every other country says &quot;yeah well fuck them, we're going to keep doing it the stupid way and keep being stupid because fuck <em>them</em> &quot;  </p>
<p>Amazing.  Just amazing that we do this.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just something I think could be important to think about in regards to that analogy. Sports all operate within the same framework and have identical goals with the same 'population'. Countries are wildly different in that regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get your point but we can exercise some nuance here.     I think it can be said that all people in all countries have closely comparable goals of wanting to live long healthy lives and not waste unnecessary money on achieving that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on the SG&amp;A?</p>
<p>You discussed the differences in student loans which I think is a related but also separate topic with other driving forces.</p>
<p>Is there a salary comparison between French and US healthcare professionals? Doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists etc etc etc (Adjusting to a common currency of course)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concerning SG&amp;A, I didn't do a specific analysis, it's just that these are relatively fixed costs and typically benefit from scale effects.</p>
<p>So the cost per capita to manage 60 M people is lower than the cost of 6 companies trying to manage each 10 M people (while maintaining equal coverage and accessibility).</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a salary comparison somewhere, but these are always tricky (typically, you'll get French figures post Social Security taxes, while the US one will be &quot;gross&quot; ). Also , most French doctors are independent, not on government payroll, so what they earn is proportional to how much they work...</p>
<p>Right , I found this numbers from US Congress , don't know the exact methodology, but at least they are adjusted for Purchasin Power Parity (link below):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>US  (GP) : 161 k$ PPP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>France (GP) : 92 k$ PPP </p>
</li>
<li>UK (GP) : 118 k$ PPP</li>
</ul>
