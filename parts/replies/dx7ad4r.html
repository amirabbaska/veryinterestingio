<p>No. The code used to judge how secure your password is exists only on your machine.</p>

<p>When I do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to twitter.com</li>
<li>open chrome developer tools</li>
<li>Click &quot;sign up&quot;</li>
<li>Start slowly typing a password 1 character at a time</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expected</strong>:  No calls being made to twitter's API</p>
<p><strong>Actual</strong>:  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9QBWD" target="_blank">As you can see</a>, after I type the first 5 characters, it starts making calls to twitter's API - specifically and API endpoint called &quot;password_strength&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some websites go beyond checking your password length etc and will do a check against a blacklist of known weak, or overused passwords. Also, if you have a more sophisticated check than length, then you would usually try to hide your method from hackers, so you don’t give them any hints on which kind of passwords they don’t even have to try. If this was done client side, you would expose the source code for your check :)</p></div>		</li>
