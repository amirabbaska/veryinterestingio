			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding Australia there was the megafauna which was either hunted to extinction, destroyed by man made fires, or climate change or a combination of all. With it largely gone the ecosystems changed dramatically in a relatively short space of time. Grasses and fire resistant trees and shrubs could now thrive as you said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason I didn't include the megafauna is because while they were around they didn't have as big an impact on the land. Two main reasons. The first is that they didn't have the size advantage of elephants and the second is lack of hooves of animals such as bison or horses. They didn't leave the same sort of impact. It is mostly speculation now but I believe that over-hunting and destruction of habitat was the main reason for their destruction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were most likely extensive grasslands well before that crazy bison population explosion since North America had many grazing animals all along (equids, camelids, cousins of the pronghorn, etc.)</p></div>		</li>
