			<div class="markdown"><p>you're connecting the nudity in Renaissance painting to the philosophy of Renaissance humanism. But Renaissance artists made nude sculptures because the ancient Greeks and Romans made nude sculptures, that's what the Renaissance <em>was</em>, a revival of classical culture, that's what the word means. And the ancient nude sculptures certainly weren't made in a philosophical background of humanism or thinking 'the individual was exceptionally important'.</p></div>		</li>
