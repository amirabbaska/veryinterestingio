			<div class="markdown"><p>Whelp, the other guy deleted his question and I spent time typing this up so whatever, I'll just post it here:</p>
<p>&quot;Why are male mammals often bigger than the females?&quot;</p>
<p>Mammals use a different strategy for survival. You will often see r strategists or K strategists. When you look at the algebra for how an environment works, r is the maximum population growth potential and K is the carrying capacity of the system. <em>Basically</em>, r strategists want to crank out as many babies as possible, and if the system can't support that many, that's fine. Whatever survives survives. K strategists do the opposite: having a few offspring that maximize the utilization of the available resources and waste fewer resources on offspring that won't survive.</p>
<p>It's not an all or nothing concept; it's a sliding scale that leans more towards one side or the other. Mammals are more towards the K side, while insects are more towards the r side. (Within mammals, some are still more r than K - like rats or mice, and some are more K than r - like whales and elephants; likewise, insects may be more one than the other.)</p>
<p>For r strategy animals, it doesn't make sense for males to use up valuable resources in the environment that the females use to raise their young. Success is defined by having as many offspring as possible so more of them survive: if only 0.2% survive, have 10,000 of them and you still have a viable population growth potential. In that system, males contribute <em>nothing</em> to growth of the species except for the miracle of sexual reproduction to drive evolution and adaptation. So there is evolutionary pressure for the males to be as small and inconspicuous as possible. In the extreme, you have examples like anglerfish: males are tiny and barely capable of surviving. They latch onto the nearest female and atrophy until their &quot;bodies&quot; melt away into her flesh and the only thing left is their gonads being sustained by her metabolism like a parasite. Super efficient, eh?</p>
<p>There's still some pressure for the males to become beefy instead, though. They have to survive long enough to be able to mate at all, which in some environments, for some animals, means they still need to be equally as capable of surviving as the females. In addition, the longer they survive, the more offspring they can have. In the deep, dark abyssal zone where deep sea anglerfish live, there isn't enough food for a male to try to survive: it's much easier to mooch off the female. In other environments, it might be.</p>
<p>Males also have to compete with other males to reproduce. If you're smarter, bigger, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ" target="_blank">faster, stronger</a> you can outcompete other males for reproduction. Females are pressured to be selective as well. If she mates with a weak male, she'll waste her resources producing and caring for offspring that have no chance of surviving. Sometimes this leads to an evolutionary arms race where the females physically fight off undesirable males, who then evolve to be strong enough that she can't fight them off. That creates an additional pressure for males to bulk up - <em>if</em> the environment can support it.</p>
<p>Then there's the K strategists. In K strategy, females often don't just dump eggs friggin' anywhere and leave. They incubate them, protect them. In exchange, the embryos have more time to grow bigger and stronger before they're born and have to fend for themselves. In the case of mammals, we actively provide nourishment for the embryos instead of loading them with a predetermined amount in their eggs. Mammals then take even <em>more</em> time to produce milk and let the offspring grow even <em>stronger</em> before they have to fend for themselves. It's a huge investment. If the offspring dies, the female is out a <em>lot</em> of time and energy. But the payoff is that her offspring are a lot less likely to die. Instead of 0.2% of your 10,000 surviving, you get, like, 50% of a small handful, or more out of fewer.</p>
<p>It's so much of an investment that it drives evolutionary pressure on the males in a few ways. She has <em>way</em> more pressure to be choosy about her mates. She's not just stuck making a batch of eggs for a week or two and dump them, she's stuck being pregnant for <em>months</em>, then she's faced with the sunk cost fallacy: either invest more time and resources caring for the young and hope they're worth it, or abandon (or eat) them and lose the investment so far. That creates a greater pressure for the males to 1) compete against her to force themselves on her, and/or 2) compete against each other to prove themselves worthy. That's why bucks waste so much energy growing massive antlers every season that are largely useless for anything other than fighting off other bucks. Lions get bigger, beefier, and with protective manes around their necks to help them fight off rivals or hold down an unwilling female.</p>
<p>The whole species is living longer, too. So instead of reproducing once or twice in their lifetime (like, say, cicadas), the females are living long enough to reproduce five, six, ten times in her lifetime. If the male lives that long, too, he also gets to reproduce ten times in his lifetime. But surviving that long means he has to be just as capable as she is, which often means being every bit as big as she is.</p>
<p>There's also evolutionary pressure for the males to start helping the females raise their young. Males spend so much energy fighting to get her pregananat, it would be a waste if she got eaten by a predator or couldn't find enough food to keep <em>his</em> offspring alive. So he goes hunting, too, to help her. And since it's dangerous to the unborn offspring if she gets injured while hunting, it might even be more beneficial for her to just not hunt, and instead rest and use all her energy protecting and growing the young while he brings back food for both of them.</p>
<p>While this pressure is happening to push males of one species bigger, it also means the species that <em>eats</em> that one has to get bigger, too. The buck is getting big enough to fight off the other bucks, but it also makes the buck more capable of fighting off a hungry bear. So the bears that are big enough to take down the buck gets more food and reproduces more, which is pushing the bears bigger. Since the bears are getting bigger to kill the <em>big</em> bucks, the smaller bucks are becoming easy pickings. So they're dying off before they can reproduce at all. So the bucks have to get bigger to fight off the bears <em>and</em> each other. This will keep going until the resources just aren't there to support getting any bigger, or there's pressure not to get bigger for some other reason. For the adult buck to get so big, it has to be so big as a baby, which requires more food and will slow down mom while she's pregnant with such a fat fetus. That makes her more likely to die and take him with her.</p>
<p>So the K stategist is pushed into that niche where they're as individually fit to survive as they can be, which usually includes the males being big, maybe bigger than the female. The r strategist doesn't care if the individual is as fit as possible, as long as <em>some</em> of the many, many offspring are <em>fit enough</em>, and males aren't as useful in that strategy (some species do away with them altogether when necessary - female aphids can clone themselves and can be <em>born pregnant</em> with more cloned females).</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I truly appreciate the gold. However, I agree with Redditors recently calling to boycott Reddit gold until the administration follows through with promises to deal with hate subs and political propaganda. Instead, I would ask you to donate the money to a good cause. Given the topic of conversation, I think donating to conservation efforts would be apropos, and I have a fondness for <a href="http://tickets.georgiaaquarium.org/dev/contribute2.aspx" target="_blank">coral reef conservation</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some female fireflies will imitate the flashings of different fireflies to lure males in for food. </p>
<p>Photuris fireflies have a compound which repels jumping spiders, who are known to prey on fireflies. Female Photinius fireflies will lure in male Photuris, eat them, and then assimilate this compound so they can pass it on to their eggs as a defense. Photinius fireflies who don’t prey on Photuris are way more vulnerable to spiders!</p>
<p>It’s called a “femme fatale” strategy. </p></div>		</li>
