<p>Just underneath the epithelium, there's a huge amount of white-blood cell tissue. This includes cells that eat bacteria, cells that make antibodies to
bind to bacteria, and cells that can recruit lots of other white blood cells to participate in the battle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is at an eternal war against pathogens from the moment you are born to the moment you die. There's cells that make other cells blow up (CTL's, NK cells...), cells that eat other cells (macrophages, dendritic cells...). Spies (NK), battle stations (lymph nodes), carpet bombing (cytokine storms)... The things that your body can do to stay healthy is absolutely incredible. Immunology fires me up. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having had an anal fistula repaired (like cutting a segment of lemon out of the muscles around my ass) to prevent serious infection, I can say that even deep surgical wounds in the anus heal incredibly fast and cleanly. A few salt baths, a few doses of various dressings and it was done in a few weeks. Almost painless too. Almost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While dendritic cells do phagocytize, the functional outcome is a little different since they preserve much of the material for presentation.  When you say eat, it implies mostly to destroy, so I would say macrophages and neutrophils.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe. We don't have particularly precise estimates for either bacterial or human cell counts:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this &quot;white blood cell tissue&quot; (a.k.a. lymphoid tissue), of which the rectum has more of than the rest of the large colon, the surface layer of the rectum (as well as the colon, mouth, vagina or any orifice) has a plentiful layer of goblet cells. These goblet cells secrete mucus which gives the rectal surface more protection. The mucus actively pushes bacteria from in-to-out.  </p>
<p>There are also increased mucosal (mucus producing) cells around the anus than say the usual skin. This is why the exterior anal area has a different color than the skin.</p>
<p>To add to the notion that our colons are a reservoir of mostly gram-negative (E.coli being a regular colonizer) bacteria, bacteria from one area do not mix well with other areas. For instance, if you ingest your feces, that same bacteria that keeps your colon safe with &quot;good bacteria&quot; will make you sick if it gets into your stomach in a large enough quantity. And certain areas, like the bloodstream, the spinal fluid, and even the bladder, are sterile at baseline, and have no friendly-neighborhood colonizing bacteria (unlike your skin and colon). The immune system (white cells, antibodies, et cetera) sweeps these areas to keep them sterile.</p></div>		</li>
