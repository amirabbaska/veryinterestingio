			<div class="markdown"><p>Like really dirty. We use 4L icecream containers to keep water cool in a daddy cool. It will freeze from all sides and condense all the dirt to the center. I have pulled them out when not completely frozen before and stabbed a hole in the middle with a knife. In the cup or so of water that came out, there was around a teaspoon of dirty crud. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really fucking dirty. I've never done what he describes on purpose but I have emptied a container before where 90% of the water was frozen and the bottom part wasn't... and that last 10% water is full of all sorts of shit. It doesn't look like swamp water or anything but it's pretty gross with visible contamination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh.  So you're freeze-concentrating the impurities and dissolved gasses to clarify the solvent!! </p>
<p>Couldn't you invert the insulation to get the freezing front to travel from bottom to top?</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://youtu.be/NGnNmbusY-w" target="_blank">Here's a video of the Clinebell in action</a> - it's a plate freezer that drives the freezing from the bottom.   Really techno, they are.</p>
<p>Also looks like something out of 1970s Detroit - wet and dry vac to handle excess water in food prep??  The smaller model uses 2x4s as spacers.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  Ever see what happens when you freeze a soda?  You get (nearly clear) ice and the heavy dark syrup and sugar separating out. </p>
<p>This happens in a lot of applications - &quot;apple jack&quot; is just fermented cider that has the water frozen out of it so that you're left with the sugars, flavors and alcohol plus a lot of water ice - there are a lot of variants on this in different countries.  Fruit juice can be concentrated that way (no heat to wreck the flavor) though the commercial plants are pretty good size and operate in several stages.  Even sea ice pushes the salt out as it ages - sailors have depended on this in emergency situations.</p>
<p>The &quot;freezing front&quot; is pretty much what it sounds like - the ice crystals as they advance into the liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, except that water expands as it gets below 4 degrees. You would have to freeze it faster than it would drift to the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From u/bart889's comment, the Clinebell chiller freezes from the bottom up to allow the impurities trapped in the remaining liquid water to travel with the expanding water you mention, then to be discarded before harvesting the clarified ice.</p>
<p>If you insulated the top of the container with something rather than the bottom and put it in the freezer, with any luck it should work the same way, allowing the impurities to be poured off more easily (at the expense of figuring out how to insulate the top of the container rather than simply using an ice chest as he mentions).</p></div>		</li>
