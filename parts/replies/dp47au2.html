			<div class="markdown"><p>But you could argue the same thing with a DNA virus, all it needs to do is transcribe to RNA. DNA could also integrate to host DNA, no? So far people have said; increased mutations, and avoidance of DNA destroying mechanisms in cytoplasm ( but RNA is less stable, so that Is counter). You also say RNA can do other stuff, good thought. I just read that retrotransposon material makes up 42% of human DNA, so it does seem that RNA viruses are pretty successful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a DNA virus would have to have the host transcribe RNA and translate it into the viral proteins as well as copy the DNA to put into the new proteins to make new virus. Copying DNA is pretty laborious compared to transcribing RNA. A retrovirus does have the laborious task of reverse transcription and insertion into the host genome, but once it's their it only relies on RNA transcription and doesn't need DNA replication to complete its replication cycle. </p>
<p>Frankly, all of the viral strategies work well, which is why viruses have been infecting every class of living organism for as long as history has been able to record it. Single strand DNA, double strand DNA, single strand positive RNA, single strand negative RNA, double strand RNA, single strand RNA that undergoes reverse transcription. Viruses of all of the above types are still around today after millennia of hosts trying to fight against them. </p></div>		</li>
