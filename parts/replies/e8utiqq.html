			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't seem right. Putting it in &quot;normal&quot; water wouldn't stop the corrosion. The salt water would have been pulled into crevices by capillary action/pressure, the dissolved ions allow a galvanic circuit to be complete which causes corrosion. Also there would be enough deposited contaminates on the box to make even distilled water a suitable electrolyte and it would still corrode.  putting it in distilled water would dilute the concentration so you'd have less conductivity and slow it down but it would still corrode. You could put it in vaccuum tho and dry it off completely, which would slow it down way more than a distilled water bath, or you could hook it up to cathodic protection and stop corrosion that way, or several other ways. Basically if this was being done to stop corrosion, this is a very poor way of doing it, leading me to believe it is not done for that purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary reason is to keep the oxygen level low to reduce oxidation. So initially store them in fresh water or even salt water is a simple way to protect them directly retrieve them from the sea.</p>
<p>Drying them in vacuum might be a good idea but to have the on a small boat that you dive from is hard. So keeping them in water when you transport them to land  where you can handle them in a better way is good enough. </p>
<p>If you retrieve them out on the sea with a large ships you can have have the correct equipment in the ship but close to the short where the transport time to the short is a few hour is  it not worth the effort</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a thought - wouldn't allowing the unit to dry out cause the salt concentration to go up, causing corrosion that way? I would think the fresh water bath isn't to &quot;stop&quot; corrosion, but to just slow it down enough, but diluting the salt content, to get it to a lab where the other steps can be taken. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what would happen.</p>
<p>Keeping it immersed in fresh water is the option that has the least corrosion, better than letting is sit in high salt brine before it reaches a proper lab</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you'll find the reason the salt water exposed box is placed in fresh water is to keep air from getting to it. Air will corrode wet material much faster than water.</p></div>		</li>
