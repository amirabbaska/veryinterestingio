			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, most police would prefer that civilians stay back when they are pursuing a suspect (especially if multiple officers are involved) to reduce the risk that an officer mistakes the helper with the subject of the pursuit.</p>
<p>Did you ever have a civilian help you catch someone? If yes, are you glad they did?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but how many times does this happen, compared to a poorly executed trip hindering the officers' pursuit instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was a cop, we were chasing a stabbing suspect. He must have been Usain Bolt’s long lost cousin because the dude was fast and Jamaican. Dude was running through back yards and I was trying to parallel him through another back yard. I came to an 8ft privacy fence and went to jump it. I grabbed the top of the fence and pulled myself up. I got my arms over the fence and that’s where my forward progress stopped. Two hours of directing traffic had taken its toll. </p>
<p>Just then, three Mexican dudes hanging out in the alley (yes they had been drinking) ran up and said something in Spanish. I’m Hispanic but I don’t know Spanish. So after they flashed some judgmental looks at my direction, they reached up, grabbed my arms, and pulled me right over. I fell eight feet and landed right on my back. They started laughing. I got up to continue chasing the suspect and I immediately realized I had fallen right in front of my supervisor’s vehicle.  I was made fun of. We caught the guy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will vary by jurisdiction, but if you're going to give general guidance on it, I wouldn't say &quot;if your intentions were obviously <em>reasonable</em> and good&quot;... and that's the rub.  With the benefit of hindsight, will your actions seem reasonable if you were in fact wrong...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a fight last week in the city where a big guy was, really drunk, and fighting with a female officer. She was clearly struggling, and I thought about helping but didn’t want to end up in some legal quagmire. After a few minutes, backup arrived and they took the guy down and cuffed him.</p></div>		</li>
