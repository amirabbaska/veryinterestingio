<p>It would be interesting to see studies on the health, fitness, intelligence, etc of 'muts'</p>

<p>These studies already exist, Mexican-Americans are biracial 'muts'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect signal-noise ratio is going to be too low to get anything useful out of that.</p>
<p>It's why I suggested going from two people that are very genetically isolated straight to a 50/50 mix in the next generation.</p>
<p>Even then, you'd have to measure IQ, physical fitness, and a number of other things of both parents and their kids.  Then you'd have to see if there are any statistically significant increases in quality between the parents and the kids (say, IQ is statistically higher, because recessive genes that reduce IQ by a few points have significant trouble finding a match in another isolated genetic group).</p>
<p>If you tried to do the study on repeatedly mixed 'muts' descended from people not all that separate to start with, I think you won't get as significant of results and would find it hard to draw conclusions.</p></div>		</li>
