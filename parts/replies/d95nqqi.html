			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that its not only the hopping that is at play. Hackers also use VPN. Which if you dont know how it works, it encrypts the data before it exits your computer. When the data arrives at the ISP its encrypted and looks like garbage to them. So even if they know who your first ISP is they cant know who did anything. </p>
<p>Its like you enter your first cab but instead of looking like a 23 year old male, you look like dog who wants to get to point B. And since there are already a lot of dogs traveling alone in your city you see nothin unusual about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this analogy that you paid for the entire trip in cash (encryption). Now, before even being able to track you, they need to figure out who &quot;you&quot; are through even more work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like travelling with a false moustache. They can work out where you went after a fair amount of work, but will have to trace the entire route (through several busy tunnels) to find out WHO you are (Or where you live).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cash actually works pretty good. Start out by determining which batch it was printed with(the bill's serial #), determine which bank it was sent to through its initial papertrail from the reserve. From there, you'll need to use security cameras and a lot of math to follow the bill. It's possible, but no easy task (unless the luck factor pays off!)</p></div>		</li>

I know a lot of people in that field and everyone is relatively nice and are willing to share information. Do you actually work as InfoSec or do you educate people on InfoSec?</p></div>		</li>
