			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would I be alone in the jungle when ive evolved to shape my own cities and villages with systems in place to give me a very high survival rate? Humans and animals started on the same level playing field, the current human environment is simply a manifestation of our evolutionary traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider that chimpanzees have far, far superior short term memories to us - or at least appear to.  In simple memory tasks, chimps can perform almost flawlessly with almost no apparent effort, memorising puzzles and other sequences that most humans would find impossible, after just a few seconds of viewing.  If a human could do this, we'd consider them super intelligent.  Almost all chimps seem to be able to do it, yet we consider them below us in intelligence.  We're certainly much more 'intelligent' at higher order thinking, but in other ways we're far behind.  We just evolved to be better at different things..  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A" target="_blank">Link</a></p></div>		</li>
