			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother's Turkish ex saw saw my my parent's cat in the driveway and screamed bloody murder, started sobbing and crying uncontrollably, then locked herself in the bathroom for two hours.  A week prior to that I watched her cuddle a red rock crab in a tidepool and pet a banana slug.<br />
My brother broke up with her after spending a month living with her and her parents in Istanbul because &quot;she seemed a little emotionally unstable&quot;.<br />
She writes children's books about cats now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a girl from India who was afraid of cats and dogs (especially cats). I don't know exactly the reason (we discussed it, but seems to be more &quot;innate&quot;). Having pets where she's from isn't as common, and I guess they don't have the same &quot;Disney-fied&quot; perception of animals that many people in &quot;western&quot; cultures have. Cats and dogs are usually just feral and treated like any other wild animal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably because of the prevalence of rabies in street cats? dunno just a guess.</p>
<p>I used to live in India and a lot of people would be afraid of any dog which didn't have a collar/look like it was owned by someone because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Haha, in the Midwest, it's common knowledge (but untrue) that all racoons are filthy and will give you rabies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know. Many Thais live in Bangkok, the metro area of which is unofficially estimated to be about 15m people, making it bigger than any city in the US or Europe. Many of these people have beliefs about cats that are exactly like westerners. However, there are also many Thais who grew up on rice farms, with little or no education. It's hard to understand why they believe what they believe sometimes. Most Thais are Buddhist, but most Thais ALSO believe in ghosts, which isn't a Buddhist belief as far as I understand it. </p></div>		</li>
