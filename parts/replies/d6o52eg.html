			<div class="markdown"><p>I can totally find myself in this explanation. When I'm having a conversation at home, I usually start walking about as well. When thinking back later on, recalling the conversation, I always find that visual cues have 'connected' with key parts of the conversation. For example: decided on birthday gift: door knob. Where to meet up: pack of smokes on the table. The entire conversation has been coupled with visual stimuli.</p>
<p>It's almost as if my brain insists on a visual stimulus of some sort while having a conversation like this. Sometimes, usually while at work, I don't have the opportunity for moving around and I find myself imagining a virtual room of sorts where I'm having that conversation.</p>
<p>Similarly, I recall listening to teachers telling stories in history class, for example. I was always doodling on a piece of paper, which allowed me to focus on the story much better. Even today, sometimes I find myself doodling during a meeting. Colleagues discussing things for minutes on end. Then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, I have something to add to the conversation while my colleagues thought I wasn't even paying attention.</p>
<p>Has any research been done in this area? I'd love to read more about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying this for a laugh, but I wonder if blind people pace about. I mean, this is an inherent trait, but if they have not seen from birth maybe that &quot;need&quot; is not there. </p>
<p>Alternatively, someone blinded later on in life, do they pace about? </p></div>		</li>
