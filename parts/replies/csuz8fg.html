			<div class="markdown"><p>This should not be the highest answer.</p>
<p>The answer is, first, that the price does change significantly. It goes up and it goes down; we've seen huge shifts from over $4/gallon to less than $2.80/gallon. However, the price of gas doesn't change as much as the price of oil does because:</p>
<p>1) The cost of light sweet crude is only somewhat related to the cost someone pays at the pump.</p>
<p>2) There are transportation and refinery costs which don't change based on the price of oil.</p>
<p>3) There are all sorts of taxes.</p>
<p>4) There is gas station overhead.</p>
<p>5) The gas you buy at the station today is not being bought today. It was bought 6 months ago. Or more. With a futures contract. <em>For clarity, the gas itself was not bought 6 months ago. The crude oil to make the gas you are buying at the pump today was bought 6 months ago. So you pay the price it cost. 6 months is an example. Depending on the position you hold in the supply chain, the price of your reflects the price of crude anywhere from 1 - 12 months. So you don't know what a given station's cost basis for their gasoline is on a given day.</em></p>
<p>6) Then there is markup or profit, which doesn't change.</p>
<p>So, the cost does eventually go down and you will find yourself paying less, but it is not linked in time (or rather, crude is a leading indicator of oil prices— though this can get complicated if the shift is demand based), your cost falls later than their costs do, and the cost component which is changing is only a fraction of the entire cost of the gasoline.</p>
<p>Your comment gives people no understanding of the forces at work and the cost breakdown, and just basically says &quot;oil companies are jerks&quot;— which is prejudicial and unhelpful.</p>
<p><em>Edited to make the list readable. To clarify one point. And to add this: The ELI5 question is just a bad question, because the price does change significantly. It just doesn't change 1:1, but the reasons above I gave are roughly why it doesn't change as much as the poster thinks it should. I'm going to leave this as is. People responding are going way past the level of ELI5. Feel free to augment.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The data does not support this conclusion. Look at <a href="https://blog.gasbuddy.com/Crude_Chart.aspx" target="_blank">this chart</a> of US gas prices and crude prices over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Gas prices drop in real time when crude drops, just not as precipitously. There is no lag because of futures contracts.</p>
<p>About <a href="http://www.nacsonline.com/YourBusiness/FuelsReports/GasPrices_2008/Pages/HowToGetGas.aspx" target="_blank">57% of the gas stations in the United States</a> are owned by or affiliated with the oil companies. They are often tied to long-term futures contracts in order to maintain some price stability. That leaves 43% of all US gas stations as completely independent. </p>
<p>Those independent gas stations often base their prices on how much it will cost to replace the gas they already have using spot pricing on the wholesale market. Spot pricing is immediate and much more susceptible to price fluctuations. So when crude plummets, that gets reflected in the wholesale market and many of the independent retailers have the flexibility to quickly slash prices in order to attract customers. Prices end up falling all across the board because when half the gas stations start slashing prices, the other half have to follow suit as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The data does not support what conclusion? </p>
<p>My argument is simply that the ELI5 question: &quot;Why do people pay a similar price for fuel now at $55 a barrel as we did when it was $140 a barrel?&quot;</p>
<p>Is a bad question because it's not accurate.</p>
<p>You seem to agreeing with me, while potentially debating how much of a factor spot vs. future vs. price risk plays into it, which isn't really all that relevant to the broader point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right. the price of crude going up to $140 a barrel was probably good for the petrol companies because it meant they could charge $4 a gallon at the pump. Ok, so it's come down again now, but not as low as it used to be. once consumers get used to the idea of 'expensive' fuel, it's easier to charge more. </p>
<p>&quot;See, you're not paying $4 a gallon any more, aren't we nice?&quot; - when you really should be comparing the cost to the $2 a gallon you were paying a few years ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It can be spun and excused anyway, the fact of the matter is the end consumer is being gouged at the current time.  And they are because they have to buy.  So they are charging what the market will bear. People can make do with the current price, so no one is changing habits.  Once people start changing their driving habits, the market will respond by charging a &quot;fairer&quot; price.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but what's interesting is that when the price goes up, you see that reflected almost immediately but when the price goes down, you don't see that reflected at the pump at all. That's the real issue. If they're going to raise prices in response to increased oil costs, they should be forced to lower prices when the price goes down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congradulations! you've gotten the point of OPEC driving down the prices.  Relatively expensive oil production methods became profitable when the price per barrel was so high, to the point that alternative fuel sources were going to be explored in the near term, because it would be more cost effective to get the new sources/technologies than it would, in the long term, to continue paying through the nose for the expensive oil.</p>
<p>However, the budgets for the above posts' author's job are based upon the continued high oil prices.  When the companies were invested in finding the new technologies for alternative oil/fuel sources, OPEC took the rug out from under them.  Hell, they took the building, too.  The smaller oil companies are already invested in the tech, they don't have the capital to continue the experiments, so they start by laying people off.  Their stock prices take a hit, and at some point in the near future, they will be bought by a conglomerate for pennies on the dollar/yen/franc/pound of what they are actually worth.  Master stroke by the nations of OPEC.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an absolutely classic problem in the oil industry.  The dumbest of the companies see the price going up and try to increase their profits by increasing capacity, often using lots of debt to finance the expansion.  Then, the added capacity that they (and all their other herd-mentality competitors) lights up, and the prices start dropping a bit.</p>
<p>Then, every one of the players thinks 'I can't get as many dollars per bbl as i expected, so let me pump more bbl.', so the price goes down even further, in a hilarious circle.</p>
<p>Then a bunch of people go bankrupt, a bunch of fields are shutdown, and eventually prices stabilize.  Then a few years later demand grows a bit, and prices start to increase again...  and the oil companies decide to make huge, reactionary increases to their supply again....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is technically true, though the negative connotation really isn't. Yes, they charge the price that gets them the most profit. But that's how a market works. The &quot;fair&quot; price for a good is exactly what people are willing to pay for it. In any given market there's an equilibrium point, and that's where the price will be. </p>
<p>Granted, demand for gasoline is pretty inelastic since everyone pretty much needs it. But that doesn't change the fact that they are setting the price at exactly what you'd expect them to set it at. </p>
<p>It's not nefarious, it's just how business works. By necessity, I might add - a publicly held company is literally obligated BY LAW to maximize profit. They can be taken to court by their shareholders if they do not. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No it's not. Executives have a fiduciary duty to act in the best financial interests of the company, but that doesn't necessarily mean &quot;maximize profit at all costs.&quot; Long-term stability has to be taken into account, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say &quot;at all costs&quot; - fiduciary duty obviously includes long-term stability. My statement was correct - a publicly held company is obligated by law to maximize profits (obviously without breaking any other laws).</p>
<p>Article with some background on the case law behind this: <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2012/05/case-law-on-the-fiduciary-duty-of-directors-to-maximize-the-wealth-of-corporate-shareholders.html" target="_blank">http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2012/05/case-law-on-the-fiduciary-duty-of-directors-to-maximize-the-wealth-of-corporate-shareholders.html</a></p>
<p>Relevant quote from the judgment in Dodge v. Ford, the seminal case for this: &quot;A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end. The discretion of directors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end, and does not extend to a change in the end itself, to the reduction of profits, or to the nondistribution of profits among stockholders in order to devote them to other purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>People love to get all up in arms when they hear that a corporation is doing something that  <em>gasp</em>  is going to make them more money than if they didn't do that thing - and people need to grow up. Companies exist to make money. They are obligated by law to make money. Yes, some companies cultivate a socially responsible image (which, one could argue, is in their financial best interest if it makes consumers like them better), but in general, we shouldn't expect a company to do anything other than make money. We certainly shouldn't act like setting gas prices at $2.50 instead of $1.50 is some heinous crime.</p>
<p>EDIT: And here's a wikipedia article (so grain of salt) that details what it means to act in the best interests of a company. Companies aren't required to maximize profits  <em>at all costs</em>, as you put it - but they are required to do what is in their best interest. If the same number of people (or close enough) will buy gasoline at $2.50 as at $1.50, then it would be against the company's best interests to charge the lower price.</p>
