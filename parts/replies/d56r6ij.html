			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun and unexpected fact: 70% actually evaporates faster than 99%
The mixture of water and ipa forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol#Properties" target="_blank">azeotrope</a>, and the boiling point is slightly depressed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not at all what you observe when using IPA as a cleaning product, the alcohol evaporates first and you are always left with the water, therefore making 99% a faster evaporator as there is less water left after cleaning which will evaporate quicker.</p>
<p>Source: I work in a cleanroom where I work with 70% and 94% IPA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I also work in and have worked in cleanrooms for over 10 years using IPA. I have not made the same observation. I would ask, what leads you to believe what is &quot;left behind&quot; is water? IPA and water are both clear liquids, so how can you be sure what you are observing is water ?</p>
<p>I do admit I've never tested this actually. I've never put 70% and 99% side by side and compared evaporation rates. Probably a smarter experiment would be to simply measure the boiling point. </p>
<p>I also admit I believed the same as you up until about a year ago. I always assumed 99% was more volatile than 70/30, explained simply by Raoult's Law. That was until a superior of mine, an extremely technical man for whom I have a great respect, said that 70% evaporates faster than 99%. He didn't just tell me, he made the claim in a meeting in front of many of my, and one or two of his, peers. I assumed he was mistaken for a while until it bugged me so much I had to google it. Plain as day, literature says BP of 70 is lower than 99.   That one was a shocker!!</p>
<p>Anyhow, I hope this is received well. Have a nice day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mixture IS an azeotrope, but the azeotropic point is much closer to pure ethanol than in the case of IPA. So the BP is depressed in Ethanol/water mixture, but it swings back around by 70% ethanol such that the BP is higher than pure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify Alcohol kills bacteria by denaturing proteins, effectively destroying the mechanics of the cell. </p>
<p>The extra water in the 75%, gives the alcohol extra time needed to denature and unravel the proteins of most germs. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2ogs8y/how_does_denaturation_occur_between_proteins_and/" target="_blank">here</a> is a reddit thread from /r/askscience that goes into more details. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part makes sense.  Thankfully the second part is not necessary because it is false.
Believe it or not, mixing ipa with water <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl_alcohol#Properties" target="_blank">reduces the boiling point!</a>
PS I told the guy up there too,  not trying to be redundant,  just wanted to make sure you got the message without rubbing you the wrong way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the right answer. Permeating the cell wall is part of anti-septsis but the denaturing of proteins part is what is important. </p></div>		</li>
