			<div class="markdown"><p>Providing lumber in exact measurements would be incredibly wasteful.</p>
<p>Lumber is cut out of logs when they are still wet, then dried in a kiln. There is no way to predict exactly how much a piece of wood will shrink while drying. Most 2x4s wind up similar in size, but it's not exact. Providing an exact size would mean cutting the logs over-sized and grinding them down after drying. Instead they just set a standard dimension at the sawmill and give you the result after it dries out.</p>
<p>People who work with wood know this, and don't have a problem with it. &quot;2x4&quot; is a convenient and descriptive name, so that is what it is called.</p></div>		</li>
