			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the best answer, there's no reason to assume a closed system in this instance.  You showed that keeping all else constant, you can vary the final temperature solely by changing the order in which the waters are combined, and I believe that was the spirit of OP's question. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You can't assume that! If the cold water is very cold, it will warm up faster than the hot water cools. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The clue here is that water is still water and not ice. So it really can't be THAT cold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the same logic, the hot water can't be too hot or it would be steam. </p>
<p>As long as the cold water is colder than the hot water is hot, we get a different scenario :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a &quot;room temperature&quot; room (72 degrees), the biggest differential between the cold water and room temp (72-33=) is 39 degrees. Otherwise you have ice, not water. The hot water can be 211 degrees, for a maximum differential (211-72=) 139 degrees. So on average, my assumptions are correct.</p>
<p>But I was careless in my comment. I wasn't trying to compare the hot water bucket to the cold water bucket. I was trying to say that because hotter hot water cools faster than less-hot hot water, the ideal is to reduce the temperature differential between the hot water and the air as rapidly as possible, and that the way you mix the buckets can affect the time during which there is a greater differential.</p>
<p>This is the same as the reason why you should add your cold cream to your coffee as soon as possible if you want it to be drinkably hot the longest.</p></div>		</li>
