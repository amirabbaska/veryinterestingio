			<div class="markdown"><p>It differs between viruses. HIV for example is relatively fragile and can only stay viable in dried blood for a few hours. Meanwhile Hepatitis B and C as another commenter pointed out can stay viable for 7+ days (even weeks) in dried blood!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends; some diseases can stay viable outside the body (and may chiefly spread that way), while others don't last very long at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to remember is that the kind of things that have evolved to infect nice cozy humans at at a warm wet 37C aren’t necessarily equipped to survive for long outside of those conditions. There are bugs literally everywhere but we’re the best environment for the ones we’re afraid of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are bathrooms with biohazard boxes on the walls for used syringes.  They're designed so people can't open them up easily.  Why?  Because people <em>want</em> syringes. Drug-addled minds don't care about infections, they just want that useful tool that they found in a trash can.</p>
<p>There are bathrooms with tiny trash cans next to the toilet, or built into the stall wall.  As the transgender population grows, us guys will start seeing them in our restrooms too.  They're made to be quickly and easily opened, emptied, and re-lined with a new bag.  Why?  Because <em>nobody</em> wants what's inside.</p>
<p>I've worked in a highly regulated institutional foodservice location, and I've worked fast food.  Both had separate mops and mop buckets spray-painted red or orange, just for bathroom use.  In both cases, we used gloves.  If you work any such job and your managers aren't forcing you to to this, they're doing it wrong.</p></div>		</li>
