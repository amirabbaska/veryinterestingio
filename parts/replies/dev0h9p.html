			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard a similar wives' tale about any trauma the mama may have during her pregnancy.  I had a cat who ate my bird when I was pregnant and was almost in a car accident.  My son was born with a strawberry on the back of his neck shaped like Sheeva and a nevus sebaceous (He'll have to have that removed when he reaches puberty because the Dr. said it could turn cancerous) on the top of his head.  Idk my sister had stress-free pregnancies and her daughters have zero strawberries/birthmarks.  Weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Turkish tradition, pregnant women should not take anything which doesn't belong to her. If she took something from someone else without a permission, it will appear as a birthmark on the baby. </p>
<p>I'm not superstitious but my daughter has a small birthmark on her left ankle and my wife has definitely sure that she has not taken anything to be clear of that but the ankle. Maybe something slips into my wife's shoes but anyway it is funny in this way. </p></div>		</li>
