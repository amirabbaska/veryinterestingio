<p>I forget the exact number but I think there are only typically 300 variations for keys with the style locks we had. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for older cars too, occasionally you'd find by chance that one Ford key could unlock and start another totally different Ford make and model, same with other brands too.</p>
<p>Newer keys are totally different though, even keys that don't use specialized chips and transponders (which can be almost infinitely unique) at the very least have that unique groove running down the middle of the key that, when combined with the key's normal teeth on both sides, massively reduces the chance that you'll get the exact same physical cut twice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had several friends with Toyota pickups over the years that had a key that would open my doors but not start the vehicle. It's just a matter the number of key variations for a specific model year or in some cases a model range, as well as the amount of wear on the key. Sometimes a worn down key will let you take advantage of less sophisticated vehicle locks with a little wiggling while turning it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The building management was likely a bit lazy and just installed a bunch of locks from the same box/shipment.  Lock makers intentionally duplicate the pin settings to make it easier for people to have one key for their whole house without requiring re-keying.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The building was owned and managed by one guy that wouldn't have been a slumlord if he hadn't been so inept. The dude was beyond cheep. My deadbolt broke and instead of just replacing it (couldn't have been more than $30) he took it apart and ordered a replacement part, then spent hours trying to reassemble it. The whole process took like 3 weeks.</p></div>		</li>
