			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you should - as /u/ramk13 pointed out bacteria can breed in filters. Brita filters have bactericides inside, but they're not effective for any significant length of time and ultimately it's there primarily to combat bacteria growth due to the effects s/he pointed out <em>within the filter's effective life</em>. If you use Brita, you should always replace the filters regularly. If that's not viable, then it's best just to drink straight out of the tap - Filter effectiveness definitely isn't at the level of making unsafe or marginal drinking water safe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: there is supposedly a superior Brita filter option that lasts much longer -anyone use this model yet?
(I just use the plain vanilla one in conjunction with a main water line sediment filter (5 micron Poly filter) </p>
<p>Per the WireCutter:
“Based on past lab tests and three months of real-world testing, we’re confident that the Brita Longlast Filter and the 10-cup Brita Everyday Pitcher, our two picks for this guide, make the best water-purification combo for most people.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this: I mostly use filters to avoid lime scale in my kettle. In my previous home (with average-hardness water) the filter would last 3+ months without issue, where I live now (with rock-hard water) limescale starts building up in the kettle after 3~4 weeks. Without a filter, it takes 3~4 boiling for the kettle to start building up limescale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how intense the contamination is. Filters are a use-item, which means they're guaranteed to degrade over time just by virtue of their mechanism of action. You'd probably have to test it yourself to be sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My filter comes with a color guide to help check the state of things. Different places have different water quality. I've had filters have their life halved in a megacity and extended in a city that pre-treats the water and it's safe to drink from tap. </p></div>		</li>
