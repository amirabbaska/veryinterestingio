<p>I personally like to use a split that's around 40% KCl, 40% NaCl, 15% MSG and 5% potassium tartarate (&quot;cream of tartar&quot;).</p>

<p>Do you make it yourself or is this a commercially available mixture?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just make it myself in a big batch (way cheaper) but it was inspired by looking at a lot of the expensive commercial substitutes and then experimenting. Flavor is always really subjective, so playing with the ratios and even ingredients can be really valuable!</p>
<p>It's probably more work than a lot of people want to put in and I'm not paranoid about using plain old salt when I'm out, but once you have it down and make big batches, it's pretty easy stuff.</p></div>		</li>
