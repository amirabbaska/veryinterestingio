			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the correct answer. The age of the universe changes depending on what reference frame you're in, but backtracking from when the edges of the observaable universe were all the same temperature (isotropic CMB) gives us a nice average of some kind.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>At large enough distances, two 'points' in space may be increasing in distance greater than the speed of light. At that point, those two points are effectively 'cut off' from one another. If we are at point A, point B has now moved beyond our observable universe forever, and will never effectively interact with us again, not in light, not in gravity, not in any way, at least as long as our understanding of physics is correct.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No, you won't be seeing younger versions. The more recent light doesn't become <em>faster</em> than the older light and reach us first or anything. Rather, <em>no new information</em> from that object will <em>ever</em> reach us. Light released from it at that point <em>cannot get to earth</em> because the distance is growing faster than the light can cross it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t make sense to assign a speed to the expansion, only speed per distance is meaningful.</p>
<p>The second question doesn’t make sense.</p></div>		</li>
