			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a joke comment and a clever one at that, but explaining it might help someone on here so I'll give it a go. Pretty much millions of years of evolution have gone through guess and check methods per say, where only organisms with the best traits for surviving will survive. For an example if any type of organism didn't have neurological signals telling them that they need water, that type of organism would die off faster than a type of organism that did have this trait. Subsequently, only the organisms with better adapted traits survive, and only they are able to pass their genes on to their children, which can ultimately lead to every trait we have. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a passive process, it may not have always been a passive process. If this were in fact the case, natural selection would have killed anyone who had to actively think “I haven’t had water in two days, I could die if I don’t drink” versus people who just “feel” thirsty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our brains where “doing things” long before we had consciousness. </p>
<p>Even an new born knows to breath and suckle.  </p>
<p>Our oldest evolutionary relatives, all the way down to one celled organisms were “surviving” without any consciousness.</p>
<p>We’re the newest additions to the matrix.  The matrix had to be up, running and debugging for several hundreds of millions of years to even add our program to it 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>And in the grand scheme of things the development process was actually really REALLY fast.  </p>
<p>And it’s still ongoing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  And when you're really thirsty, water gets in  your bloodstream pretty quickly.  Like just a few minutes. </p></div>		</li>
