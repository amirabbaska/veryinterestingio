<p>Just today I saw that Kinder has finally solved the problem--sort of. They're now offering the Kinder &quot;Fun&quot; egg, which is two half-egg plastic pods. One side holds the toy prize, and the other holds Kinder chocolate paste and two crunchy candy balls. There's a small scoop between the halves you can use to eat the chocolate paste.</p>

<p>These have been a thing in Germany for a long time now, I think they always market them as the &quot;summer!&quot; version of Kinder Eier.</p></div>		</li>
