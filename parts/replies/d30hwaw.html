			<div class="markdown"><p>If the planet is inhabited, we and everything we bring will be invasive species. Invasive species around here can lead to disruption of the ecosystems they're introduced to, which can result in decrease in population or extinction of the natural species that live there.</p>
<p>There's a chance we could do that to whatever life might be on the planet we start inhabiting. Personally I think we should colonize planets anyway, but it definitely is ethically concerning if it means our actions could kill a large amount of alien lifeforms.</p></div>		</li>
