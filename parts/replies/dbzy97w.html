			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an episode of <del>Freakonomics</del> Planet Money where they had a panel of economists with varying political views create a hypothetical &quot;perfect&quot; candidate. I can't find the episode but from most of what I can remember (may not be 100% correct); eliminate income tax &amp; mortgage interest subsidy, increase sales/consumption tax. </p>
<p>In their perspectives they agree that these policies would benefit the economy however the debate becomes political.
Found the episode: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/10/26/499490275/episode-387-the-no-brainer-economic-platform" target="_blank">Part 1 here</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/11/02/500413695/episode-413-our-fake-candidate-meets-the-people" target="_blank">Part 2: Candidate meets a focus group</a></p></div>		</li>
