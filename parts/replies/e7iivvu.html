			<div class="markdown"><p>The RCIC system is designed specifically for high pressure water inventory control and reactor coolant during an isolation event (Reactor Core Isolation Cooling). It uses a large external tank of water as it's initial source of cooling, then switches to the suppression pool which is inside containment once the tank is low. The issue Fukushima ran into is that while the suppression pool will absorb all that decay heat from the fuel for a while afterwards, without a method of cooling the suppression pool itself, the reactor eventually succumbs to high pressure boil-off. Simply, the relief valves on the pressure vessel will slowly dump water inventory from the vessel to the suppression pool to keep the pressure low enough to avoid rupturing the entire vessel. Since the RCIC system is not adding any additional water aside from the external tank at the onset, the water level in the vessel slowly lowers as the relief valves dump steam.</p>
<p>While RCIC will put the water from the suppression pool back into the reactor, it slowly gets hotter and hotter and level gets lower. Though RCIC ran much longer than designed, without a place to dump all that heat, it was a losing battle. Unfortunately the reactor designs of that era rely on electric pumps to cool the suppression pool, which were unavailable due to the tsunami. While all plants of that design (and just about every design) have backup diesel generators in case of loss of normal off-site power, the specific design of the Fukushima site rendered the diesel generators inoperable when the tsunami flooded their electrical systems as well as the diesel themselves.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Unit 1 at Fukushima was of an older model than units 2-4, and did not have a RCIC system at all. They had an isolation condenser, which used natural convection to keep the reactor cool in an isolation event. While, this seems safer as it is passive, it still has the same issue RCIC does, which is that without a place to dump all that heat, the unit eventually succombs to overheating and boil-off. In the case of Unit 1 specifically, operators closed the valves for the IC prior to the tsunami to avoid excessive cool down and damage the vessel, only to unexpectedly lose their ability to reopen the valves once the tsunami hit. Though it would not have made a difference in the long run since there was still no electricity to run heat removal pumps, unit 1 lost its ability to add water to the reactor at all within an hour of shutdown, and the water level in the reactor quickly boiled off through the relief valves until the fuel was exposed within several hours. The existence of RCIC (and HPCI) extended the amount of time units 2 and 3 had before they exposed fuel, but the end result was pretty much the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, recent reports and studies have been indicating that the RCIC system did not fail due to the heating of the coolant, but failed instead when the operators attempted to restore DC power to the plant. This may have unintentionally tripped the system to stop automated operations because the water level in the reactor pressure vessel was too high at the time of power restoration. This RPV water level rise from loss of power was also the cause of the flooding in the system itself. Theoretically, the system could have lasted even longer than the time that it did, and this is one of the focuses of the research going into this system to test the true limits.</p>
<p>You're absolutely correct about the heat buildup in the system, though. The RCIC system is intended to just delay catastrophic failure long enough for other cooling systems to be re-implemented set up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>RCIC was running with no control power at all, not in auto, not in manual, just physical system response. </p>
<p>When dc power was restored, one of the trips is the high exhaust pressure trip. This is set generically at 25 psig for BWR plants. The wetwell chamber was over 100 psig easily when control power was restored, so it tripped RCIC. </p>
<p>When RCIC is running continuously, it’s not likely to fail even with 250 degF or hotter water, but it will fail if it’s operated in “batch mode” where you start and stop it. When RCIC tripped, it mechanically seized up due to overheat. </p>
<p>The RCIC bearings are oil cooled by the RCIC turbine itself. So when RCIC trips, it’s oil flow decreases as the turbine coasts down. For normal temperature (&lt;218 degF I believe), RCIC can withstand the coast down with no oil flow. Above that, it will seize up. </p>
<p>The trips should have been defeated, however we didn’t have explicit instructions to do that in the EOPs. Instead it was “defeat RCIC trips as necessary” and had a list of the common ones to defeat. So that didn’t help either. </p>
<p>This is only at unit 2 by the way. At unit 3, RCIC did trip on high exhaust (they still had DC power) and seized up on coast down. Our studies now indicate around 15 psig wetwell pressure is the max suppression pool saturation temperature or can reliably operate RCIC at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um...surely you mean combining non-gas in turbines designed for compressible flow, right? Non compressible turbines are a thing, your car uses one if it's an automatic, dams use them for power generation, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sorry that I did not make that clear. Many turbines are designed for two-phase, non-compressible flow (in fact, the Terry Turbine that is used to generate power for the RCIC pump system is able to handle two-phase flow quite well). It is just in the case of the primary turbines in the Fukushima plant, they were not designed with that in mind.</p></div>		</li>
