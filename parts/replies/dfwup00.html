			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to visualize your comment, <a href="http://www.torontorealtyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/103QueenswayLockbox.jpg" target="_blank">this is a fairly common sight in Toronto</a>.</p>
<p>The condo development mentioned on the printout, 103 Queensway, is near High Park and the Humber River (both desirable places), but it's also built right on a busy rail line and is less than 1 km from one of the city's sewage treatment plants.  There's no way that each of those lockboxes represents a tenant that bought and lived in a unit, then decided to sell and move out at the same time as everybody else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that pic. What drives the point even further is that I was mainly thinking of what I've seen in the 'downtown core' of Toronto - a full 10KM east of this photo (and the city is only 40KM wide).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what sucks. I wasn't in a position to buy even 2 years ago. Now I am in a position to buy and want to stop throwing large amounts of money into a pit every month but everything is telling me not to buy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't necessarily throwing money into a pit by renting, especially if a seemingly 'valuable' condo (luxury building?) has condo fees and taxes as high as your rent. You're better off putting your money into a safer investment, or even buying an investment property in a more sound market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article is supremely naive and misleading. For one thing, &quot;Toronto region&quot; is a vast mess of suburbs with huge price and class variations. For another, this is a report by a realtor board that only stands to lose by any sort of tax impediment to sale.</p>
<p>Most of all, the laws and classifications for foreign money are thin to non-existent. There are a dozen different ways somebody can legally launder a property without drawing attention to their foreign residency or citizenship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get your first point. We're talking about the &quot;Toronto&quot; region when we're talking about the sales and income stats that OP gave.</p>
<p>It's not a report by a realtor board. It's an article by a newspaper written by a journalist who did research.</p>
<p>And you know there's a conspiracy based on, what? A feeling?</p>
<p>I'll go with the journalist, thanks.</p>
<p>Would love to see a source on your other conspiracy theory re: laws and classifications. I'm guessing this is just another opinion that you have, proven by your feelings?</p></div>		</li>
