<p>Blaze and the Monster machines being our latest topic. We were pretty sure AI has taken over their world and the last few humans who remain are the focus of the story. We believe most of the calamity that the monster machines find themselves in are really attempts by the last humans to free themselves from their AI truck overlords.</p>
<p>The recent crossover episode with paw patrol is putting a kink in that theory, but we have not watched it yet. We don't decide what we get to watch, the kids decide that one. Watching the same episodes over and over requires creative thinking to maintain personal sanity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's very similar to how you develop a taste for music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a degree in music, can confirm. I hate listening to modern rock/pop music. People think I'm stuck up, just another classical musician sitting in his ivory tower. However, this is not the case. I <em>love</em> music, I love hearing complex musical ideas and hearing them expressed in unusual ways.</p>
<p>This is because I've heard many thousands of hours of classical music. Moved through the symphonies and the eras looking for something that fits the sub genres I enjoy, but still mentally engages me.</p>
<p>In Bach's <a href="https://youtu.be/kugv9Cptqd4" target="_blank">Passacaglia and Fugue in c minor (Bwv 582)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/bNZY61mPfl4" target="_blank">(Part 2)</a>he takes one idea and plays it over and over and over again, but every time he plays it, he harmonizes it differently or changes the rhythm.</p>
<p>Now move to a new era, <a href="https://youtu.be/TEbyBINYBfo" target="_blank">Beethoven's 5th Symphony</a> is FAMOUS because we all know of its 4 note intro, but listen further into the 3rd and 4th movements and you'll hear what starts with a military-like waltz mixing this rigid and unforgiving brass sound with a dance in the strings and woodwinds and it will grow and the whole things becomes chaotic and tense until all of a sudden this massive brass fanfare emerges as though the very light of Olympus were illuminating you and all the gods and goddesses were coming to celebrate <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>How can Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Smash Mouth, AC-DC, or any of these other popular musicians compare to this? What do their love songs and and rebellion songs offer in comparison to the complex depth and harmony offered by the masters with the full width and breadth of instrumentation at their command?</p>
<p>Schubert's <a href="https://youtu.be/5XP5RP6OEJI" target="_blank">Der Erlkonig</a> - Father is trying to save his son from the elf king and the song ends with the child dead. All done on one piano and all four parts sung by one singer.</p>
<p>Ralph Vaughn Williams' <a href="https://youtu.be/cc5_n5Fojkk" target="_blank">Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</a> He takes a 60 second bit of ancient church music <a href="https://youtu.be/TVVRHjQ5Vd4" target="_blank">(Why Fum'th in Fright)</a> and turns it into a 17 min long trip through existence using only strings.</p>
<p>Claude Debussy's Jeux is a ballet a guy and two girls playing tennis that ends by implying they wander off to have a 3-way.</p>
<p>Saint-SaÃ«ns: <a href="https://youtu.be/RcAGFgPCigw" target="_blank">Danse Bacchanale</a> from Samson and Delilah - a giant seductive, lively dance performed by Delilah and her maidens for Samson in an effort to get him to drop his guard (protip, it works) It's a lively dance, punctuated with a slow waltz section that returns to the dance with a vengeance (in this video the conductor activates turbo mode on the timpani and the orchestra just hits a race). The end is filled with power horns and goes off the rails.</p>
<p>Finally Gilbert and Sulivan's <a href="https://youtu.be/R1dy44jV8EM" target="_blank">The major General's Song from Pirates of Penzance</a>is a simple patter song where an old man boasts about his achievements and paints himself into a lyrical corner. When he manages to get out of that predicament the pirates demand he do it again and faster. Imagine if Eminem stuck to a metronome in rap god.</p>
<p>Its not that modern, popular music is bad its that I can listen to 15 seconds of it and get the gist of the whole piece and get bored and have to find something that is more mentally engaging.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - To me modern music is like Hop on Pop and &quot;classical&quot; music is like Lord of the Rings. Its not bad, just simple and boring to me.</strong></p>
<p>Edit: just a reminder, just because something is simple doesn't mean its bad. I still love me some Slim Shady, some  queen, Kansas, Dragon Force, and others, I just don't have the love for <em>all</em> their works like you guys do. Keep hitting me with questions though, I love talking music!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I can relate to your analysis of the classical music, especially the part with the Beethoven's 5th (and honestly .. Beethoven's 6th, 7th and 8th too) - people only know the famous part, but it becomes even better later. And I happen to be a huge fan of Bach's harmonizing too - chorals he uses in St. Matthew (and St. John) Passions and how he harmonizes the same melody differently yet so well every time is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>However, I start to disagree when you say that popular musicians do not have anything better (or different) to offer. A lot of people fall into this trap of thinking how this or that music genre sucks because it can't offer &quot;insert what you like about music here&quot;. Coming from someone that will enjoy both Beethoven and Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bach and Muse, Mozart and Eminem...it is all about <em>what</em> you pay attention to, what you draw enjoyment from.</p>
<p>Sure thing, popular music nowadays has less complex harmonies than classical music - and that is why I listen to classical music, to enjoy complexity (yet, heh, simplicity) of the beautiful harmonizing. Yet, there are things classical music <em>can't</em> offer - relateable lyrics being one thing. Listening to Mozart's Requiem (one of my favorite pieces) I can relate to the <em>music</em> very well, but lyrics barely do much, because 1) they're in Latin and 2) they're the standard, generic religious lyrics (since it's a mass). On the other hand, I can listen to Pink Floyd and enjoy the gems such as &quot;Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines.&quot;, coupled with harmonization that may be simpler than Mozart's, but still beautiful in its simplicity.</p>
<p>Or another thing would be the beat - something to keep your foot tapping on the floor because you just can't resist. Then there's different sounds that can be made using computers, electrical guitars and whatnot nowadays - while classical music is confined to the standard, old instruments. I'm a sucker for mixed genres, and I absolutely enjoy hearing when a band mixes the &quot;standard&quot; rock instrumentation with the typical electronical music sounds. Or even do what Muse does, and incorporate parts of classical pieces (or motives from them) into another genre.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, but what about pop?&quot; you might ask. Well, as complex as classical music may be harmonically, if you went to music school (and I am going to assume you did considering your knowledge), you know that classical harmony follows the same rules all the time, barring the &quot;new&quot; classical music from the 20th century (which I do not like, but I understand there are people used to it enough to enjoy it) - in other words, you can often predict what comes next. So many times I found myself humming to a Bach piece I've never heard before, instinctually, because I could simply <em>feel</em> the next note; and you could very easily interpret this as Bach's music being &quot;simple and boring&quot; to me, since it's so simple I can predict almost everything he'll do. </p>
<p>However, our brain likes knowing what comes next, it likes simplicity and familiarity. So the fact that most of the pop songs follow the same harmonical pattern does not bother me all too much, and while that may not be enough to occupy your brain full time like complex polyphonic structures would, that's why even in pop music you get to listen to other parts of it - vocals, lyrics, melody, beat...there is plenty. </p>
<p>If you cannot mentally engage yourself enough with modern music, you may be listening to the wrong parts of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They might, they just can't really show it in modern art forms. The classic pop/rock/alternative song with it's AABA format and time constraints really limits what sort of musical creativity the musician can provide, no?</p>
<p>Classical music certainly has structure, but it's usually more fluid (especially as you advance through history) and there's less in the way of time constraints. A Mozart piano sonata has a pretty tight structure, but can be 20 minutes or longer. Then you get to Beethoven and he sort of plays with the structure. Three movements in a piano sonata? Nah, two's enough for me. And again, the length can be 20-40 minutes, which allows for much more exploration than a 3.5 minute song.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can certainly play classical pieces on electronic music. It's hard to get your hands on, but the Bach pieces composed for the moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos are interesting. (Several pieces were used in <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> most notably.)</p>
<p>One of my favorite music genres is what I call &quot;classical jazz,&quot; which is basically taking classical pieces and listening to them played by a jazz pianist or jazz trio with plenty of interpretation / improvisation sprinkled in. Jacques Loussier is my favorite performer, but there are a number of others. Here's a very accessible piece - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Kx39rH-QHk" target="_blank">Jacques Loussier - Jesu, Joy Of Man's Desiring</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not OP, but I know some people who listen to classical music very thoughtfully in that they sit down, put the music on and just sit there and listen. It's not background music, not music you have on while you do chores or are driving somewhere, but music you put on an listen to, like you would sit down and read a book. I can understand why it would be difficult to spend time doing that for modern music, given its simplicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been thinking over your detailed comment all night. It's a shame that you have trouble in equally appreciating of all music, so I hope to give you some food for thought. I look forward to your response which I know will be thought provoking.</p>
<p>I'm a musician myself, I studied classical music at uni but I play &quot;popular&quot; instruments. I choose to enjoy every single possible piece of music, as long as it was made with passion and not just to sell. This ranges from Handel, to the deepest darkest Metal, to Penderecki, to Herbie Hancock and so on and so forth. I'll be using the term 'popular music' to describe anything not 'Classical' or Jazz.</p>
<p>The first point I would like to make is yes, everything has been done before in some way or other. But that also applies to Classical music too! Bach's counterpoint was imitating the music of before his time. Stravinsky took folk melodies and folk dances to generate his interesting rhythms. The list goes on. But what made these composers stand out is how they used these influences to create something new and interesting at the time they were alive, with the tools they had disposable to them.</p>
<p>The second point is that the music of today was never really written by Classical composers. A crude statement would be &quot;if popular music has all been written before, then why do no classical pieces sound truly like it?&quot; I see two main reasons why this is the case.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Popular music borrows more from African music than the Western Classical Tradition. Rock n' Roll, the 12 Bar Blues, even fundamental syncopation and swing. This only began to influence classical music in the 60s with Steve Reich and co.</li>
<li>Each era is defined by it's own limitations. Whether that be dissonance being &quot;disallowed&quot; or certain instruments not even being invented at that time, as time moves on the wealth of musical creativity grows and never shrinks. Many fundamental aspects of popular music concepts only arrived during the 20th century, from electric guitars to the idea of a piece of music with only 4 repeating chords. Electronic music was only possible with the popularity of the synthesiser in the 80s. (The Ondes Martenot being an exception).<br />
An example is the mixolydian sound, I love when the bVII resolves to the major I. One finds this all the time in bands such as Tool and the Beatles. Yes, Sibelius and Vaughan-Williams may have used modal influences but their V-I counterpoint training always shows through. Even Renaissance music doesn't utilise modes the same way. I've yet to find a historical composer that uses these modal inflections consistently, so I see this as a fairly recent creation of popular music.
Also consider the recorded medium and audio production.</li>
</ol>
<p>My third point is one mentioned in lots of the other comments. You're appreciating certain parts of each composition you mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bach: Thematic development</li>
<li>Beethoven: Long term resolution</li>
<li>Schubert: Compelling narrative told with limited instrumentation</li>
<li>Vaughan-Williams: Thematic development with limited instrumentation</li>
</ul>
<p>People often say of Mozart &quot;he only uses V-I harmony, it's so boring&quot;. They are correct that many other composers used a wider palette of sororities, but they are missing the point that Mozart's melodies were second to none.<br />
If one listens to Bach to hear crushing dissonance they would be left disappointed.
If one listens to Beethoven to hear a saxophone solo then they would be left disappointed too. Anyone could make these accusations of any piece of music. This is exactly the same as the comment &quot;popular music is not harmonically interesting&quot;. Let's take a look at my favourites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Who - Quadrophenia album: Consistent development of really rocking leitmotifs with a compelling narrative</li>
<li>Genesis - Firth of Fifth: Piano introduction with irregular time signatures and advanced harmony; this makes a reappearance re-orchestrated halfway through the track</li>
<li>Kate Bush - King of the Mountain: Etheral vibe, my kind of harmony (bVII-I, scale degree 4-major3 resolution)</li>
<li>Queen - everything they ever did: Guitar and vocal orchestration, plus advanced harmony while still selling records.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now lets take a look at some pieces that aren't necessarily my all time favourites but we can all learn to appreciate:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC/DC - Back in Black: It rocks. Hard. Satisfying guitar riff. Improvised guitar solo that makes you feel like a rock star.</li>
<li>Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit: See above, plus dynamic contrast between sections. More non-functional harmony in riffs.</li>
<li>Katy Perry - Firework: Interesting non-static synth sounds, inspiring lyrics for those who need it. Fancy a dance? This would work well.</li>
<li>Skepta - That's Not Me: One line flows yeah I got some of those.</li>
<li>U2 - With or Without You: Guitar effects compliment the trance inducing backing rhythms, the contrast between the range of vocal sections highlight the word setting. Non-traditional song structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each one of these we could pinpoint something 'negative' that is actually a positive. E.g. the U2 track is a repetition of 4 chords, I'm sure there's a metaphor in there somewhere linked to the lyrics. Just like how when one listens to Beethoven you don't want a saxophone solo, the instrumentation works well because it's what we expect and Beethoven would have adjusted his orchestration if he had saxophones at his disposal to make it work.</p>
<p>My next brief point is that one must value the cultural setting in which a composition was wrote. Did the composer write for a commission in a court (Bach)? Was it written purely for dedication with no monetary motive (Stanford)? Was it to please the government (Shostakovitch)? Was it a social commentary (The Specials-Ghost Town)? Was it to help with work (Slave songs/Sea Shanties)? Understanding why a composition was wrote often improves our own understanding and enjoyment of it, although I know many music fans would disagree with me. If it helps us to enjoy something more, why wouldn't we factor it into our evaluations?</p>
<p>I will leave you with a question. For my dissertation at uni I created a prog-rock album that uses time-signature changes and motifs to drive the narrative. You could say that it's popular music composed with a classical mindset. I am now orchestrating the album for a modern extended orchestra, and I'm purposefully not including guitars or a drum-kit in this new ensemble. I'm still paying attention to the original voice leading from the album and I don't have to add any counter-melodies because the original album had them too. The only difference is the extended number of instruments and the different timbres and playing techniques that these can provide.<br />
So to recap, there's a rock band version and an orchestral version of the near exact same piece of music.</p>
<p>Is either one of these versions worth more artistically?</p>
<p>Shameless plug for the album:
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2I8AK0nSEIiWvtkaRfz12K" target="_blank">https://open.spotify.com/album/2I8AK0nSEIiWvtkaRfz12K</a></p>
<p>(I'm not sure if I've covered everything I hoped to but in the interests of your will to live I've condensed my thoughts.)</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that I think you simply have a personal preference for Classical music, just like I have a preference for Prog-Rock. That's okay! We all like different things. It is interesting to justify our preferences though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point is dead on! I love it, you got it and your second point is straight on the head. Had a young Bach ended his minor pieces in the minor mode and not the picardy thirds, they would have strung him up by this thumbs. It wasn't until much later that he had the fame and chutzpah to dare to end the Toccata and Fugue with that big, heavy chord. The early 20th century was a huge time for really pushing and exploring the limits of what humans consider appropriate sounds and I would hypothesize that some of the odd sounds and harmonic transitions from it plays some role in influencing the big experimental rock names of today. The guys in Tool are no slouches, they know their shit and I would definitely be interested in attending a theory seminar where they talk about the harmonic analysis of one of their pieces. I'd like to see the influences and effects of their experiences on their music. Also, the african bit, very much that. You really see it come out in rap and I love Eminem and his more serious works for it because he does a great job blending western thematic development and theory with african influences.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn't say exactly the same, <em>but</em> can certainly respect the similarities.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><em>EVERYTHING THEY DID EVER</em> For real, that band is amazing and I will <em>always</em> love them for popularizing &quot;rock opera&quot;. I would love to see more rock opera on that level. Bohemian Rhapsody tells such a great story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the U2 track is a repetition of 4 chords</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm actually surprised you didn't make a comparison to the Canon in d minor here. Its a good example of something basic being recycled to death yet still sounding good.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is how I feel about Beethoven 7-9, great point! Someone brought up Lamar's To Pimp A Butterfly album and discussed the commentary and purpose of it and it was a good point too.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading this! Its good to hear from someone with similar training and I'm glad you pulled yourself out of the ruts that classical training can push you into! I'd like to leave you with a touch of inspiration regarding our craft, straight from one of the best musical movies ever made: Fantasia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are three kinds of music on this &quot;Fantasia&quot; program. First, there's the kind that tells a definite story. Then there's the kind that, while it has no specific plot, does paint a series of more or less definite pictures. And then there's a third kind, music that exists simply for its own sake. Now, the number that opens our &quot;Fantasia&quot; program, the &quot;Toccata and Fugue&quot;, is music of this third kind, what we call &quot;absolute music&quot;. Even the title has no meaning beyond a description of the form of the music. What you will see on the screen is a picture of the various abstract images that might pass through your mind, if you sat in a concert hall listening to this music. At first, you're more or less conscious of the orchestra. So our picture opens with a series of impressions of the conductor and the players. Then the music begins to suggest other things to your imagination. They might be... oh, just masses of color, or they may be cloud forms or great landscapes or vague shadows or geometrical objects floating in space.</p>

<p>When we listen to a piece of music, our minds are constantly anticipating what will come next. Melody, structure, and repetition allow us to have expectations of what will follow, and how a piece meets or defies our expectations determines in large part our overall impression.</p>
<p>What happens when melody, repetition, and structure are removed from a song? Our ability to predict what comes next is destroyed. You can't imagine the future - you can't remember the past. We can exist only moment to moment. This music is impossible to get stuck in your head, it's impossible to recall once it's finished. All that remains is the experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't sound stuck up, but you can see how a long, involved discussion about how 'complex' your music and 'simple and boring' other people's music <em>reinforces</em> this idea that this has <em>very little</em> to do with some attempt to discover the beauty of the abstract forms of music and more to do with establishing 'sophistication'</p>
<p>When people really are discussing those abstract principles of elegance and beauty in Art or Mathematics or Philosophy,  they don't discuss things this way. Some mathematician trying to argue a system of logical principles doesn't say <em>&quot;Oh, please, How can you stand such a simple and boring first-order logic like ZFC. Doesn't even compare to the complexity of Lambda Calculus.&quot;</em>. They don't use value-laden words, not because they are consciously avoiding them, but because they are after something else, something that goes beyond that idea's social role.</p>
<p>Look at the conversation you've spawned! Many of those responding are trying to affirm that some of the music they like is &quot;complex&quot; (whatever that designation might imply) as if 'complexity' in your taste of music matters! It's obvious that words like 'complex' and 'simple' are serious to many people. I don't think that's surprising either -- they are words intended to convey superiority. Imagine I said that to you: &quot;/u/drfarren, just because you are simple and boring doesn't mean your bad&quot;!</p>
<p>The meta-issue is that an intelligent person like you, in a world facing so much suffering, even spends a second thinking about which type of music is &quot;complex' or 'simple' enough for you.</p>
<p>The meta-meta issue is that I've spent time on this knowing that nobody's view will be any different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this argument, very well put! I, very honestly, would not be offended in that scenario you perscribed. There's times when friend of mine will metaphorically slap me around for being a simpleton in fields that they are experts in and to be honest I enjoy it. Its the passion behind their words that shows me that there is value in what they say and do. I could sit an listen to an hour long seminar on Green Eggs and Ham and how I'm an idiot for not knowing all these minor nuances so long as its delivered with energy and passion.</p>
<p>You <em>are</em> right as well, there is complexity all around us in all sorts of places. We can compare Tool to children's nursery rhymes and I'd be at a disadvantage in terms of &quot;complexity&quot; because it simply is the way nursery rhymes are.</p>
<p>I do regret that my words come across as saying people are boring for liking simple things. I think most people are dynamic and interesting. There's no shame in it. Remember <a href="https://youtu.be/U7ovEiZFhAU" target="_blank">&quot;Its the simple things in life you treasure&quot;</a>.</p></div>		</li>

Sometimes they prefer YouTube stuff over tv, but I always try to interact with them and ask questions throughout the video, so they can tell me things. It's usually simple stuff, but I can tell it makes them feel good when they think they are telling me something I didn't know instead of me always telling them things.</p>
