			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste.&quot;</p>
<p>Aren't there fossilized dinosaur organs?  Can they just check for a bladder?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely rare to get organ fossils, due to how fossils are formed. Organs are soft tissue so decay very quickly, too quickly for the minerals that fossilise things to form. Thus, you only have this chance in animals that were almost instantly buried after death. For example the one you are referring to in your link only existed because it was very quickly buried undersea, meaning decomposition couldn't take place.</p>
<p>You also have the problem that organs are inside and not usually exposed. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>There are no e</del>Examples of preserved organs other than bone, skin, and integument (hair/feathers) <del>as far as I am aware</del> are exceptionally rare. Gut contents may be preserved in position, giving some information about the beginning of the digestive tract. There are claims of preserved brains and hearts, but none that have convinced me or my colleagues. <del>I have to go to work but I can expand on this later if there is interest.</del> Apparently the theropod dinosaur <em>Scipionyx</em> form Italy actually does ahve exceptional fossil preservation of the intestines.</p>
<p>Also, as far as I can tell, the fossil in the link you provided has exceptional preservation of skin, but they can't even see the bones (even with CT), so even if there is some exceptional preservation of organs, we haven't seen them yet, and it may be impossible to see them without destroying the fossil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The first evidence of recorded liquid waste elimination attributed to a dinosaur was presented to the public in 2002, but no scientific paper had reported fossil evidence of liquid waste of tetrapods elimination to assume that dinosaurs urinated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The aspect of these urolites is <strong>very similar to soil deformation caused by modern ostrich urination, and certain groups of dinosaurs could have a similar urinary physiology. These urolites are the first evidence of liquid waste attributed to dinosaurs.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>So it's still up in the air?  But /u/StorminNorman may have been on to something with the ostrich theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if i recall correctly birds dispose of semisolid uric acid as a weight-saving measure</p>
<p>it costs energy, it's an extra biochemical conversion step to make it. still useful, if you want to be light weight and fly</p>
<p>non-flying dinosaurs wouldn't have the weight issue, they didn't fly, so i would assume they peed liquid urea. unless like ostriches they are recently evolved to lose flight</p>
<p>crocodiles are semi-aquatic. i don't understand their physiology and production of uric acid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would believe so. The very few we have found (I can only ever find about four different urolite pictures) seem similar to erosion patterns from ostriches urinating but because we only have so few examples we really can't say for sure how dinosaurs urinated. I think you would definitely see very different evolutionary solutions across different species.</p>
<p>Edit - here's a link that shows the comparison of different urolites compared to hot water being poured to try and simulate the pattern. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are pretty cool especially if you never thought about such fossils before. People don't realize the amount of information we have about creatures that lived millions of years ago. People think we make stuff up about their lifestyle without realizing we probably have some sort of evidence supporting it. Trace fossils help us fill in our gaps of knowledge about these incredible creatures. </p></div>		</li>
