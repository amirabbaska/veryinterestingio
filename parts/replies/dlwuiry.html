			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahhhhhh. Nice way of explaining it thank you!  </p>
<p>Would you happen to know the process/if there even is a process for trying to prove if a culturally significant number like <em>e</em> or Pi is normal? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These things tend to be pretty difficult, because you're basically trying to prove that there <em>isn't</em> a pattern to the digits of pi or <em>e</em>.  That is, you're trying to show that the digits of pi or <em>e</em> behave like a random string of numbers, even though they're clearly not random at all.  It's easy to generate a bunch of empirical evidence that these numbers are normal -- just look at the first billion digits and test whether they seem pretty random -- but that doesn't really help you to prove it.</p>
<p>My impression is that there aren't currently any good techniques for proving that specific numbers like pi or <em>e</em> are normal.  We know that these numbers are irrational -- though proving pi is irrational isn't particularly easy -- and we also know that they're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number" target="_blank">transcendental</a>, which is significantly harder to prove.  Somehow normality seems to be yet another jump in difficulty, and some significant new ideas or breakthroughs are needed before we can approach the problem.  I'm not an expert on this particular problem, but the sense that I've gotten from other mathematicians is that we are unlikely to see a proof that pi or <em>e</em> is normal in our lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super interesting. Thanks for taking the time to respond, and yes it's fascinating to discuss because it seems so impossible to do! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As normality is effected by the base you are using, it seems to me that it's a rather artificial attribute. Is there any actual utility to the definition?</p></div>		</li>
