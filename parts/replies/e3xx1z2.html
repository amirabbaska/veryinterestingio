			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong, because &quot;observation&quot; is &quot;measurement&quot;, and measurement is supposed to be irreversible by the standard definition. In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0106078" target="_blank">double slit eraser,</a> you can restore interference even after the particles have been &quot;observed&quot; by polarization filters.</p>
<p>The filters cannot logically be an &quot;observation&quot; or &quot;measurement&quot; in the same way the final detectors are, because the measurement at the detectors is not reversible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congratulations - you just asked the most important question for most quantum experiments. </p>
<p>Because observation in the macroscopic world (humans, cats, dogs size) is passive, most people assume quantum observation is also passive i.e. looking at something isn't doing anything to it. But in order to look at something on the quantum scale, it involves some form of interaction. </p>
<p>So for you to see a football moving, light has to hit the football and then travel into your eyes. But light is so insignificant to a football that this doesn't change how it moves. However, when you start considering particles, suddenly things are much more significant and it would be like trying to see a football but your only method of seeing it was to throw other footballs at it. At that point, interactions are going to change what it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not really an easy answer, it basically depends on your experiment itself and how you set it up. Good experiments aren't similar measuring one football with other footballs - that was to make it easier to visualise. Good experiments are more like throwing lots of ping pong balls at one football. The main idea is that to observe particles, you need to interact with them and this changes them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a lower-level answer, but is wasn't really ELI5, so here's another attempt:  </p>
<p>The 'observe' term just means the collision is having effects at our big 'human' scale. When we 'observe' which slit is gone through, it might be better to say that we <em>make which slit is gone through 'observable'</em>. It's not dependent on someone actually standing there and looking.<br />
The reason this makes the particle stop acting like a wave and start acting like a 'ball' is because the quantum effects (particles behaving like waves) only happen at a very, very small scale. This applies not only to the size of the particle, but the size of the interaction itself.<br />
So let's consider two particles bumping together. In fact, since we don't want to commit to thinking in a classical 'billiard balls' way, let's call them 'quantum packets' and call it 'interacting' rather than particles bumping.<br />
If the quantum packets interact and the effect is so small that it would average out when looking at the stream of particles as a whole, then the interaction is only having an effect at the tiny scale of the packets involved. They could even hit each other quite hard and it still all average out, so the 'observation effect' isn't just due the fact that we're 'poking' it.<br />
However, if a packet hits a very high energy packet, releasing so much energy we can see it as a flash, then the interaction is happening on a much bigger scale. The result of this is that we can see it, hence the link to it being 'observable'. What it really means is that the whole interaction is taking place in the 'human world' scale rather than the 'quantum world' level. You might not see an ant on the moon, but you can see a nuclear explosion there (maybe).<br />
Now the original packets (particles) are very small, but their interaction isn't. It is, from their perspective, absolutely enormous, with millions of photons flying off after their impact. So if we look at the interaction <em>as a whole</em>, it's taking place at the scale where things act like billiard balls, so will find that this particle, which was previously inhabiting the world as a smooshy thing spread across a whole bunch of probabilities of where it might be, is now acting like a tiny hard thing that was definitely in a place a particular time.<br />
So how does this affect the double slit experiment? Well, as a smooshy thing, the smoosh of the particle could interfere with other parts of the smoosh as a wave, meaning we get the effect we'd see when a wave passes through double slits. But as we've made it act like a billiard ball <em>as it passes through the slit</em>, it's got no chance to smoosh around with itself on the other side, and it's going to slam against the backboard like if we released it from that point just the other side of the slit.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that when we shoot one particle at a time through the double slit the interference pattern is built one particle at a time on the detector.</p>
<p>Since we know the speed of the particle, can't we make out which slit the particle went through simply by measuring the time it hits the detector?</p></div>		</li>
