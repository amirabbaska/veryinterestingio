			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a buddy who used to use a lot of drugs intravenously and more or less said the same thing- when he would collapse or otherwise ruin veins due to using a dull needle, blood circulation would still continue just fine. If he left the area alone for a while, usually one of the previously much smaller veins would gradually grow in size and became one of the primary, large veins, replacing the collapsed one as a main &quot;highway&quot; out of the arm, (until, of course, it became a prime candidate to IV into and eventually collapsed itself...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP or likely even as knowledgable as OP, but to my understanding it's unlikely for a slow clot to form in such a big vessel. It's more likely to break off and travel through the vessel to a smaller point and clot there instead - hopefully less catastrophically.</p>
<p>I would imagine if such a senario DID happen though, that some amount of additional vessel formation would occur as the pressure built up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor (masters in anatomy), but most likely no. The Pulmonary Trunk has to withstand high pressures (being produced by the right ventricle of the heart). I think when the OP wrote about new collateral arteries being formed she/he meant smaller distributing branches further out in the systemic circulatory system, not large muscular arteries branching directly off of the heart.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Very unlikely since they would have to be quite large and muscular to withstand high pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, what does someone with a Masters in Anatomy do, exactly? Like what career is such a degree exceptionally applicable to (other than being a medical doctor, which you said you are not)? Or are you going into your PhD and your primary focus of study was best bolstered by an anatomy masters?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Once the pulmonary trunk obstructs you die if you can't unblock it. Slow thrombus build up can definitely occur but until there's total obstruction you can still get blood past the partial blockage by increasing pressure on the right heart. Once it gets large enough it starts to produce symptoms and some of those are quite significant and life threatening.</p>
