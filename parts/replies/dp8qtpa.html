			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than that, it's actually the correct answer to the question. Factory shifts would logically be 8 or 12 hours, and 8 came from a movement in the early nineteenth century calling for &quot;Eight hours labour, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest.&quot; It became a common demand of labor unions around the mid 1800s and slowly took hold.</p>
<p>6 days a week was the norm until the twentieth century. Then some factories had Saturday and Sunday off so both Jews and Christians could have their day off. Also, some factories had workers who commuted during the week, and needed time on Saturday to get back home. Henry Ford instituted a five day work week, and in the Depression it was a way to reduce unemployment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunday because god. Maybe. Saturday because of the unions. And the 8-8-8 thing is not the the primary reason for the working day either. It was just the slogan of the unions who fought for a shorter working day.
TL;DR: the workers united in unions demanded, and got it</p></div>		</li>
