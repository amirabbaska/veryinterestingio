			<div class="markdown"><p>What's even crazier is, usually, in the course of such an activity (working out, programming, studying, practicing an instrument), it's quite pleasurable!  Yet, somehow, in the moment of anticipation, your brain refuses to acknowledge all those pleasant chemicals it's about to get and instead tells you, &quot;Surely, beginning this activity is your descent into a living hell.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a little deeper biological level, the problem is that we are running software (our modern lives) on outdated hardware (our brain). </p>
<p>An example - I have an extraordinarily difficult time motivating myself to work out.  However, ive never had a bad experience exercising.  Every single time i do it, i feel great afterwards. </p>
<p>Logically you would think that would mean i would find it easier to start doing.  But for the brain, it associates exercise with getting food.  But I can get infinite amounts of food whenever i want.  </p>
<p>When the brain is satiated, it naturally demotivates you to do work, because by its logic, you have already ahieved the thing you would need to work to get. </p></div>		</li>
