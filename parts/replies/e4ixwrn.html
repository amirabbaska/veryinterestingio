			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Breathing is used primarily to control your co2 levels and thus your blood ph. </p>
<p>Hyperventilating decreases your co2 levels by exhaling it off quickly. Doing it into a bag recycles that exhaled co2. O2 levels shouldn't change significantly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying that this negates the effect on blood pH caused by breathing into a bag, or the effect on the body of changes in blood pH... But just out of curiosity, isn't there a buffer system innately built into the blood? If so, what chemical acts as an acid and base depending on the body's needs? </p></div>		</li>

I think the initial answer is far enough off base to be misleading and not accurately answering the question.</p></div>		</li>
