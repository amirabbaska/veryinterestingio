			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI for the future it's not all that great to drive a car with out the battery. The alternator will have peaks and valleys of voltage output which isn't good for electronics, the battery smooths that out. If you're in a pinch, yea go ahead and drive without a battery, but if you can, get a battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's terrible for the alternator and will certainly lower it's lifespan. It's not designed to run the entire car by itself, it's just meant to keep your battery topped off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, compression starting is a major advantage.  You're kind of screwed with modern automatics if you're in a situation where compression starting is a need.</p>
<p>Apparently older automatics were designed so that they could be compression started and, depending on the exact system used, some modern automatics can be compression started as well, but it's not safe and you have to be going something like 30-35 mph (48-56 kmph).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that’s very interesting to me, since I had the impression that manual was more difficult to control going up a hill- just from watching a friend struggle. I’m still on the fence about whether to make the switch and invest, but that’s good to know! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought my first automatic after I got married, so that she could drove both our cars if needed.  I'm on my second such car now, 7 years later, and cannot stand the shifting decisions the automatic makes on our mountain roads.  I do choose to restrict it to 3rd or 2nd on some hills at some speeds, but it just isn't the same.   The last manual I had for 8 years, and put brake pads on at 7 years.  With the automatics I seem to need pads every 2-3 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not trying to be rude, so please don’t take it that way, just want to understand your argument... the steepness of the road shouldn’t matter as the automatic will just adjust to the necessary gear for the grade you’re on and traction control has generally proven to make better decisions in slippery conditions than people do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of Europeans have a really dated view on automatics. Modern automatics have become considerably more refined with sophisticated computer controls taking over much of the work, a lot of the newer automatic transmissions are effectively just a manual transmission with computer controlled actuators doing the shifting and still giving the driver the option of shifting themselves. Many of the concerns I've read on here are things solved in the majority of automatic vehicles today, who have largely caught up to manuals in regards to effective shifting for control.</p>
<p>Just about the only practical benefit manuals have left is fuel efficiency, but even that gap has begun diminishing in recent years with better and better tech making it into controls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some automatic transmissions just can't decide what gear to stay in for best power output up a hill. My car is somewhat older, a 2002 Maxima, and only has 4 gears. Anything faster than driving in a parking lot, and it's probably in 3rd or 4th gear. It's got lots of power so it has no issues going up hills, but the 3.5L engine isn't the most efficient off highway. My wife's car is a little 2008 Elantra. It's got 4 gears I think, and the transmission isn't great, but the engine can't be more than 2.0L. There's always a lag when you floor it to accelerate to an on ramp or to pass, but once it's up to speed it's really efficient on
fuel. It out-accelerates my Maxima off the line, but catches up in a second or two because I've got more available horsepower (more than twice of her car).  This summer we moved and the GMC Penske truck also had a lot of gears, 6 or 7. It was the worst as far as anything I've driven, and I found myself using the automatic manual mode many times on the hilly highways of Utah and Arizona. It would constantly flounder between a lower and higher gear on hills, so I would shift it down and then back to auto when the hill was over. </p>
<p>Also, let's not forget that you can shift down to help use the engine as a brake on steep descents, so I assume they're alluding to manual selection of a lower gear for better power output up the slope and better control down. Of course you can do that in an automatic, so it's not really an exclusive feature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even during real winters? I drive automatic for work and all of them struggle during winter unless I tell it what gear to use for slopes. It will shift at wrong times and cause wheel slip with potential loss of control. </p></div>		</li>
