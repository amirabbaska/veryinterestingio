			<p>E = mc^2 doesn't hold for photons. The full equation reads<br><br>* E^2 = m^(2)c^(4)  + p^(2)c^(2)<br><br>where m is the invariant mass of the particle (zero for photons). The famous formula you cited only holds for the particle's rest frame, which doesn't exist for photons.</p>		</li>

			<p>Should that be + (plus) instead of multiplied? Or is it formatted like that to show that they're seperate terms?</p>		</li>

			<p>Does the p stand for the momentum of the particle?</p>		</li>

			<p>That would definitely happen, long before you even start to approach black hole limit. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is the principle behind creating an artificial singularity. Energy density just like mass warps space time. Kugelblitz drive. </p>		</li>
