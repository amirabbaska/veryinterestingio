			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not 1:1, but there is definitely a correlation between an engine needing higher octane, achieving better fuel economy, and meeting stricter emissions standards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relation is actually causal</p>
<p>The higher the compression ratio and the more complete the combustion, the more power you get out of your fuel. With this extra efficiency you can:</p>
<p>Keep power the same and reduce fuel consumption. Less fuel also means less emissions.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Keep fuel the same and raise the power.</p>
<p>A 2019 Toyota Carrolla is doing the former, and a 2019 Mustang is doing the latter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well I think that depends on your definition of quality. If the quality is higher compression than yeah it's exactly the same. If the quality is it smells better than it's got nothing to do with it. I mean it's gas not finely crafted leather handbags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I know exactly what octane means but this is a bit like saying that a harder bolt is not higher quality, the head simply doesn't break off until higher torque is applied; stainless is actual higher quality. Come on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those cars would run just fine on north American 87 octane. The engine control unit (ECU) can adjust timing within a range of octane to keep the motor safe. Fuel octane just helps to avoid detonation or pinging. Higher compression engines, or engines that have a lot of cylinder pressure need higher octane fuel usually. NA motors with 8 or 9 to 1 compression not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question! I'm in Albuquerque for the summer, and the standard gas here is 86. The car I'm driving says it wants a minimum of 87, but I asked my parents (who own the car) and my dad said 86 was fine unless I heard weird noises from the engine. Why is it that 86 seems to be the standard here where I've never seen it that low in my home state (Washington)?</p></div>		</li>
