			<div class="markdown"><p>It always takes some damage. Wood is naturally a much better material than paper for overall strength, but when you wet paper, the spot that got wet is never the same. Same principle, but on a much smaller scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct, although my usage was from studying a university class in rheology as a part of a geology degree. </p>
<p>Regarding wood, folk will use this plasticity to bend it into desired curves using steam. The wood will be held in position, after it has been bent, until it has cooled and dried. An example would be in making the hoop backs of Windsor chairs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or the sides of a guitar, or the ribs of a small boat.  Tricky thing is that the fibers on the inside of a curve are compressing, the fibers on the outside of a curve are being stretched, have to slide by each other. The compressed fibers can crumple up and lose some strength, if the bend is too sharp, and the stretched fibers can break, or, more commonly, there will be some runout of the grain and the wood will split right at the outside of the bend, so cabinetmakers will often use a <a href="http://www.jefflefkowitzchairmaker.com/chairmakers-journal/boggs-side-chair-build-7-steam-bending-part-2" target="_blank">bending strap</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, heat is really critical.  When I've steamed ribs for a boat, which were 14 mm ash, I had about 30 seconds to get one from the steamer and bent into position. </p></div>		</li>
