			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't. Diminishing returns relates to the ratio of value you get out of something compared to your investment in it. Trying to approach the speed of light would be one example. Eventually, to get the last little bit of speed needed to actually be AT the speed of light, you'd have to pump an infinite amount of energy into it. Higher investment leads to less profit.</p>
<p>Diminishing marginal utility relates to the value of increased consumption of something. So, I'm hungry. I eat a hamburger. I eat a second. The second one is less valuable to me, so it has diminished marginal utility compared to the first.</p>
<p>Edit: Less valuable because it doesn't make me as unhungry as the first one did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A better example would be throwing two balls at once. Twice as fun? How about four? A hundred?
The increased enjoyment per ball would decrease as the number goes up.</p>
