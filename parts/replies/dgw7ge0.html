			<div class="markdown"><p>Not 100% sure what u/_fitlegit is referring to, but iirc from back when I was lifting a ton the general rule of thumb was you can only <em>healithly</em> gain ~1-1.5lbs of muscle mass per week, and you can only <em>healithly</em> lose ~1-1.5lbs of fat per week. Any more in either of those numbers and you start digging into the other.</p>
<p>IE - if you burned 2lbs of &quot;fat&quot; this week, you most likely started to eat into your muscle mass. You put on 3lbs of &quot;muscle&quot; this week, you probably added a lot more than muscle. </p>
<p>This isn't cut and dry so there is some flex room depending on how rigorous your routine is, but the key to remember is that <strong>muscle weighs a lot more than fat does</strong>. So the scale is actually one of the worse ways to judge your progress IMO, and I prefer to go by waist size. Had a girl I used to work with hit the gym with us for a few months so she could &quot;lose weight for the summer&quot;. 5 months later she had <em>added</em> a bit over 10lbs IIRC but dropped a few sizes alongside it.</p>
<p>So it definitely is possible to burn fat while gaining muscle mass, but don't expect your weight to be changing; hell it may even go up due to the muscle mass and because the first few months of strength training gives MASSIVE results if you do it right and never had done it before.</p>
<hr />
<p>e: also for the below comment about &quot;the progress is just so extremely small compared to a regular cut and bulk cycle that it isn't worth it*&quot;</p>
<p>it's only not worth it if all you care about is the cutting of weight. If your goal is to get into shape, get strong, and don't want to put up with all that BS cut/bulk shit people do, you can ignore that whole cut/bulk phase bullshit. What's the point of dropping 15lbs if your bench and deadlift drop 50lbs as well? I refused it when I lifted regularly, I preferred to focus on just getting strong regardless of my current &quot;cut&quot;; I also enjoyed eating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just realized this is basically what I'm doing now. I'm trying to eat less overall calories but consuming more protein and whey and still lifting 4 days a week. Slowly losing weight but trying to build or at least maintain muscle during the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been pretty successfully doing this for the past few months. I went from 195 to 185, and Dexa scans about 6 months apart showed that the weight I had lost was virtually all body fat (only 1 pound of muscle lost). It's working but in terms of weight loss it's a slow process. Here's what I'm doing in case it helps anyone else:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy management of food -- lots of protein, not many carbs, eating at a 500-ish calorie deficit most days</li>
<li>30 minutes of strength training and some HIIT per day, 5 days a week</li>
<li>30-40 minutes of moderate cardio, 5 days a week (exercise bike in my case)</li>
<li>goal of each gym session is to burn 500 active calories (as determined by my Apple Watch)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I write it all down, it's a lot. But it does work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regardless of whether you're in an anabolic or catabolic state, your body constantly needs energy, which it gets from the sugar in your blood. Ketosis occurs when there's not enough sugar in your blood to supply your bodies energy needs, so your body starts converting your stored fat and releasing it into the bloodstream to make up the shortfall. Insulin regulates this process. </p></div>		</li>
