<p>Are you able to explain how? I assume all space has some sort of matter in it (this might be where I'm going wrrong). How is it matter can be at the farthest edges of the universe and not get there by going faster than the speed of light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a ELI5. Imagine you are driving a little car on a huge balloon. Your car has a top speed of 100 whatever and can never go faster then that. Now you drive from one side of the balloon to the other. As you do so, the balloon is inflated. To you it would appear the destination is moving faster then you as the balloon expands, moving it further away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That just raises lots more questions!</p>
<p>These videos tend to be so vague as to be useless.  They dumb it down to using only common words, but in doing so the words are so hopelessly overloaded it's impossible to know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>I was optimistic about this one, because he started talking about Hubble's observations.  I love it when science tells us <em>how we know something</em>, because it shows an understanding that science is a process, not just a set of facts, and helps us understand what questions we were trying to answer in the first place.  Then he kind of waved his hands and went back to reciting facts again.  Darn.</p>
<p>In the end, he just kind of throws up his hands and says &quot;because infinity!&quot;  Sounds cool, but not helpful.  Clearly the words he's using, like &quot;expand&quot; and &quot;space&quot; and &quot;after&quot; and &quot;existence&quot; and &quot;always&quot;, have some special meaning here that is not the common English meaning of those words.  Either that, or he spends the whole video contradicting himself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning that is only the observable universe that is 93 billion light years in diameter. No matter where you are in the universe, you can only observe the 93-billion-light-year sphere centered at your location. Move beyond that edge, and your sphere just has a different center. You'll never observe the entire universe. As such, we have no reason to believe the universe has a edge at all. It may be much MUCH wider than 93 billion light years, or it may be truly infinite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Logical deduction. We know the universe started at some point and we know the speed of light is finite. It follows that some places in the universe are so far away that it takes light longer than the lifetime of the universe to reach us (And thus we can't see them). </p>
<p>We measured that we can only observe a 93 billion lightyear sphere around us. We know the age of the universe and the speed of light are independant of your specific location. Hence, every place in the universe has the same horizon of 93 billion lightyears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of space like an expanding balloon.  The further apart two points are, the faster they're moving apart (every bit of space is expanding. the more space there is between two points, the more expansion there is between them, and the faster they separate).  As I understand it, two points that are <del>93</del> edit: many billion light years apart are moving away from each other at the speed of light.  If you tried to send a beam of light from one to the other, it could never make it, because the distance grows as fast as the light can cover it.  Since light is the fastest thing in the universe, that means we can never interact with anything outside of this range.</p>
<p>To know this we need two pieces of information: the speed of light, and how fast the universe is expanding.  To measure the expansion, I believe we use red shift.  Basically, as space expands, it stretches out the wavelength of any light moving through it (moving it towards the red end of the spectrum).  By measuring the red shift of light from distant space objects, we can tell how fast the universe is expanding.  The speed of light is (apparently) measured indirectly.  Using these two numbers, we can define the observable universe, the hard limits of what we can interact with.</p>
<p>Edit: Did some research, I'm an idiot.  The observable universe is just the area that light has had time to reach us from.  This can be calculated knowing the expansion of the universe, how the expansion of the universe is changing, and the speed of light.  This does require us to guess somewhat when it comes to how the universe has behaved historically, but odds are good that things still work pretty mutch the same way.</p>
<p>The above description still describes a theoretical upper limit for the size of the observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you please expand (no pun) on this a bit?</p>
<p>I mean, if the observable universe is 93 billion ly in diameter (46.4 billion ly radius) how can it be &quot;observable&quot; if the light reaching us can't have come from a point more than 14 billion ly away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(substitute cm for inches if you use the imperial system)</p>
<p>Imagine an ant crawling on an elastic cable 5 cm long.</p>
<p>The ant crawls 3 cm along the cable, then the cable is stretched to 10 cm length. </p>
<p>Assuming the cord stretches equally, the ant will be at the 6 cm mark. </p>
<p>The ant crawls another 3 cm, to the 9 cm mark. </p>
<p>The cable doubles again to 20 cm, putting the ant at the 18 cm mark. </p>
<p>The ant crawls another 2 cm to the end of the cable.</p>
<p>Despite having crawled only 8 cm, the ant has moved 20 cm total distance.</p>
