<p>supposedly the planets are close enough to be seen approximately the size of our moon with the naked eye from one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>That's false. I ran some <em>very</em> rough numbers earlier and at absolute best, viewed from the surface, another planet might get up to 200 arcseconds across. That's about three times as wide as Venus appears to us, and about a tenth as wide as the moon. Someone with keen eyes could probably see the disk of nearby planets, but not much else.</del></p>
<p>Their hill spheres, which roughly govern the radius over which a body can significantly influence neighboring bodies, are also significantly smaller than any of their closest approaches. I think the system would be stable, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>Edit: I initially missed some numbers on the Wikipedia page.  The b and c planets come within 0.004 AU of each other at opposition, which would indeed give one a width of about 0.6 degrees when viewed from the other.  That's insane, I don't understand how that kind of orbital configuration can possibly be stable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems to imply that Venus appears as 1/30 the width of the moon in the sky.<br />
Which might be true, but it sure seems wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought so too, so I checked, and it's actually correct, according to NASA's fact sheets on <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/venusfact.html" target="_blank">Venus</a> and the <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html" target="_blank">Moon</a>. The Moon has an average apparent diameter of about 1900 seconds of arc, and Venus at closest approach has an apparent diameter of 66.0 seconds of arc, about 1/29th of the Moon.</p>
<p>I can think of two reasons why this seems wrong. The first is that it's hard to actually <em>see</em> Venus at closest approach, since it's between us and the Sun. This puts its light side directly away from us and also places it near, or even in front of, the Sun in the sky, where it gets lost in the glare. Venus is most readily observable when it's about a quarter-orbit ahead of or behind us and has an apparent diameter of about 37.9 seconds of arc.</p>
<p>The other reason is that most people have a falsely large notion of how big the Moon looks. If you hold a US quarter (which is a bit bigger around than a 1 Euro coin but smaller than a 2 Euro coin) up to the Moon at arm's length it would cover up the Moon entirely with room to spare. You'd need to be holding the quarter about 2.5 meters (~8 feet) away for it to have the same apparent diameter as the Moon. When asked to guess this distance, most people respond with much smaller figures (myself included, the first time the question was posed to me).</p>
<p>So that's why it seems wrong. Venus <em>can</em> get 1/30th as wide around as the Moon, but you'd never actually see it that large and if you're like most people you also perceive the Moon as bigger around than it really is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Moon has a semi-major axis of 0.00257 AU from the Earth.</p>
<p>The closest planets in this system have a semi-major axis from their star of 0.01111 and 0.01522 AU respectively, which is a difference of 0.00411 AU - a bit less than twice the distance between the Earth and the Moon.</p>
<p>That's... actually quite close. These are bodies which are significantly larger than the Moon, too - both of these planets have approximately the same radius as the Earth does.</p>
<p>Given that at twice the distance, something will appear half as large, and given that the Moon is about 1/4th the radius of the Earth, Trappist 1b and 1c would appear actually much larger than the Moon does to each other, assuming their orbits allow them to approach each other at this distance (and given their relatively low eccentricities, it won't be too far off).</p>
<p>Neither of those bodies are likely to be habitable, though.</p>
<p>1d - which is the closest which is plausibly habitable - has a semi-major axis .006 AU greater than 1c and .007 AU less than 1e. So from 1d, 1c and 1e could at their closest approaches appear roughly the size of the Moon.</p>
<p>1c would be like a new moon at that point (you'd be looking at its dark side), but 1e would be quite visible from the dark side of 1d.</p>
<p>The planets all seem to have fairly low eccentricities, which suggests reasonably circular orbits.</p>
<p>These planets would seem to have Moon-sized objects in their skies, though the sizes of the planets would vary <em>considerably</em> from their point of view over the course of their orbits.</p>
<p>When 1c is &quot;full&quot; in the sky of 1d, it would appear quite small, as it would be 0.03622 AU away - or about 14x the distance between the Earth and the Moon. Even though 1c is about 4x the radius of the moon, it would only appear to be about a quarter the size of the Moon when it is full.</p>
<p>Still, that would be a pretty decent-sized disc - about 500 arcseconds across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm quite sure that's not right.  That's over twice the size of the full moon.  That would mean the planets would have to pass about as close as the moon is to us.  I did the trig, definitely not that big.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how do we know that none of them are moons of the other?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Light curves of an exoplanet simply look different than the light curves of an exoplanet+exomoon combo. The transit features caused by the exomoon would be &quot;bound&quot; to the transit features of the planet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/wasp-28b3-hi-res.png" target="_blank">Here is what a single exoplanet light curve looks like</a>. An exoplanet+exomoon combo will have some bumpiness to the light curve. From <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1530" target="_blank">figure 6 of this paper</a>, you can see a simulation what an <a href="https://astrobites.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hek_fig7.png" target="_blank">exomoon lightcurve</a> could look like in blue. The bumps caused by the exomoon can have a separate period of their own associated with the period of the exomoon around the exoplanet, but the constant proximity of the exomoon to the exoplanet means that the bumps will always follow the exoplanet's dominant light curve.</p>
<p>To be clear, just because the 7 exoplanets in the system aren't exomoons of each other does not mean that the exoplanets don't necessarily have exomoons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strength of tidal forces on a body is approximately proportional to 1/r^(3), the inverse cube of the distance from the mass in question. Angular diameter simply goes as 1/r. The tidal forces drop off much more quickly with distance. So just because something is the same apparent size as the Moon does not mean it exerts a comparable tidal effect. Our own solar system provides a perfect example of this: the Moon and the Sun are both about half a degree wide from a terrestrial point of view, and the Sun's net gravitational force on the Earth is a couple orders of magnitude stronger than the Moon's, but the lunar tides are still stronger than the solar tides.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that although <a href="https://www2.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9827/3354" target="_blank">tidal effects may help to trigger some earthquakes in already-existing fault zones, in general they don't cause large-scale seismic disturbances in the Earth</a>.</p></div>		</li>
