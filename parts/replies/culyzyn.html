			<div class="markdown"><p>The French system has some similarities, with seventy/seventy-one/etc being <em>soixante-dix</em>/<em>soixante-onze</em> (sixty-ten, sixty-eleven) and eighty/ninety being the same, <em>quatre-vingt</em>/<em>quatre-vingt-dix</em> (four-twenty, four-twenty-ten).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, some places (like in Belgium, I believe) have words for seventy (septant <em>sp?</em>) and ninety (nonant <em>sp?</em>) instead of the typical French system. Then they just say those: septant-et-un (71).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And 'huitante' for 80.</p>
<p>I had Swiss French teachers at school and university. I just use that system normally. </p>
<p>It annoys the French, but most of them use American English anyway, so, as a Brit, it's not like I owe them any sort of linguistic allegiance.</p>
<p>I came 3rd in my undergraduate translation exams, and I still find myself having to a quick bit of arithmetic in my head when I hear some French numbers...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a similar thing in Korean, where we have separate numbers for maths and separate numbers for &quot;counting&quot; (one flower, two people, three dogs, etc. 꽃 한송이, 두명, 개 세마리). This is because we have our original Korean numbers, and the math numbers come from China - a similar situation with Japan, that uses Chinese numbers and writing system. </p>
<p>We also count larger numbers in 10,000s. I think this is the most interesting, and confusing, part of our number system. So instead of saying &quot;one million&quot;, which basically means one million 1s, we say  백만 which is (one hundred ten-thousands). Isn't that strange?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am Chinese for starter. The way I see million/billion/thousand, is that it's the same idea as 10^4 万) and (10^8 亿) in Chinese. But instead of using 1000 as a separator, we use 10,000. You can say we say 100 000 instead a million, but we say 1 亿 (yi. Not sure of the equivalent in Korean) instead of 100 million as you would in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the old system seems to be dying out a little as most new Welsh learners are now only taught the new system. It's a shame because I find it much more elegant.</p></div>		</li>
