			<div class="markdown"><p>its called The Trap. get arrested for something stupid, that you didn't do. go jail, get charged with a crime, get a 10k bail. now your poor, your family is poor and no one has the money to bail you out, so you can either sit in jail for 6 months or plead guilty to a crime you didn't commit, and get out of jail tomorrow. of course of its a felony you can no longer get decent jobs, gov't assistance, student loans and so on. so you sit in jail for 6 months, the charges get dropped and you're now free. but you've lost your job, your apartment, your car has been repo'd and now you might even owe court costs and might even owe for being in jail. good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the explanation. This is really interesting.</p>
<p>What sort of alleged crime would constitute a $50k bail bond? I'm interested in knowing the money to severity of alleged crime ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very jurisdiction dependent. In my jurisdiction, $50k would be common for anything that carries a potential sentence of 20 years or more (Class B felony). This tends to be high risk/value thefts, drug distribution, offenses with bodily injury or the the risk of bodily injury...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regular person here. It's important to get the viewpoint of a non-attorney who is not part of the system.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the bail system is intended to keep regular people from being able to afford an attorney. If a defendant can afford their own private attorney, their chances of a successful defense increase dramatically. Prosecutors love the bail system because it makes their job so much easier for this reason.</p>
<p>One point you left out are those certain charges which have no bail. For instance, in Florida if you are charged with certain sex crimes you're automatically denied bail by law and your defense becomes almost impossible. Your attorney has to visit you in jail where they record your conversations and provide the tapes to the prosecutor. As a result it's virtually impossible to mount a defense against these  types of charges, giving prosecutors a stellar conviction rate. It takes a lot more money to defend yourself if your charge has no bail set.</p>
<p>Bail is very popular in the US. It's part of the reason why our prisons are the most popular in the world. American voters love it because it makes them feel safe to have so many people in prison. They apparently don't care about the humanitarian crisis it enables.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fair enough; what should we do instead? If you could create a system from scratch, how would you address the problems bail is attempting to address? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there are a lot of &quot;Fuck the judicial system. Fuck capitalism&quot; posts in this thread, but what is the alternative? We move to the honor system? Bail bondsmen take on a hell of a lot of risk--not just financial, but in dealing with the type of people they deal with. They're going to have to charge relatively high rates or else, guess what, no more bail bondsmen. Now you're 100% stuck in jail unless you're very well off financially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess just let all the criminals wander the streets while they await trial.  Surely, they'll show up to court out of the kindness of their own heart.  These are the same people who consistently resist arrest. The crimes that guy is talking about, where no bail is set, are typically the worst of crimes and most people don't want those people back on the street.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not an attorney, but I thought that any conversations with your lawyer, even in jail, were confidential?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought so too. Apparently it turns out to be just TV wisdom. I'm close to a person who lives in prison now, and I did what I could monetarily to help his defense and offered an alibi &amp; testimony, but we failed. Just wasn't enough money.</p>
<p>The system doesn't work like most Americans think it does from movies and TV, and the number of Americans with personal experience who still retain their voting rights is just not enough. Americans are hard-headed and trying to explain reality to them is difficult. I'm afraid a lot more people will have to go to prison before enough people find out for themselves how things actually work in the real world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't commit crimes and you won't have to worry about the bail system.  And if you happen to get arrested, be thankful there's a way to get out of jail while awaiting trial.  I was accused of a DUI years ago in college, and even having the cash in the bank to pay the full bond, it wasn't worth it.  I paid a bondsman 10% and was on my way.    Paying 10% and having the other 90% on hand to hire an attorney is much better than having the full 100% held while awaiting trial, especially since it took 14 months for my case to be found not guilty. </p></div>		</li>
