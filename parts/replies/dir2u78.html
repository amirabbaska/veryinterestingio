			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're confused about how you could ever get enough data points from this if the half life is so long, take a moment to consider how many atoms are in a mole: 6.02*10^23. </p>
<p>How long is the half-life? 4.5*10^9 years.</p>
<p>So if you had one mole of U-238, then after 4.5 Billion years 3.01*10^23 atoms would have decayed, or 2.12*10^6 atoms per second over that time. If the decay were linear (it isn't)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you wanted to know how long a battery would last, but you didn't want to wait an unknown number of months for it to run out. Assuming the battery charge would go down at a constant rate, you could use the battery until it was at 99%, and multiply the amount of time by 100. Radioactive decay is the same, except exponential instead of linear, so you just have to use slightly more arithmetic. And unlike a battery, it's more consistent in the way it decays as long as you use a large sample.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a stupid question at all.  If you have a good sample, you can actually pretty much measure it directly by using &quot;activity&quot;.</p>
<p>A measurement of activity gives you number of decays per second in a sample and if you accurately know the weight of U238 in the sample (which you can convert to number of atoms of U238) you can determine how many U238 atoms decayed in a given time frame out of the total number of U238 atoms.</p>
<p>Since the half life is so long, over a normal measurement time period for us, activity is basically a constant.  With a good activity measurement and the equations of radioactive decay, we can readily calculate the half life, give or take the uncertainty in the measurement method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with U-238 having such a long half life, does this mean that 4.5 billion years ago the world was a more radioactive place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does!</p>
<p>Actually, it gets better than that.  U-238 is the more stable natural Uranium Isotope, with a 4.5 Billion year half-life.  It's fertile, but not a fissile material (it can't be fissioned by hitting it with a neutron).</p>
<p>U-235 is the natural fissile form of uranium, and it has a half-life of 700 million years.  The Current concentration of U-235 0.7% of natural uranium.</p>
<p>So if you go back in time, the % concentration of U-235 was much higher.</p>
<p>So high, in fact, that there were <em>natural nuclear reactors</em>.  They've discovered them in at least one place, in the Gabone in Africa, where for millions of years, sea-water would come in with the tide and act as a moderator and allow nuclear fission to occur.</p>
<p>We can tell this by the U-235 fission products (and their decay chains) leftover in the area.</p></div>		</li>
