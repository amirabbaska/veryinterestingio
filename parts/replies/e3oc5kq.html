			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue starvation mode is when your brain becomes predominately dependent on ketone bodies. I see starvation ketosis a lot in ICU, and it genuinely makes patients acidaemic.</p>
<p>Gluconeogenesis from proteins does occur later, but again in ICU happens earlier than expected due the very high levels of catabolism that occur with physiological stress.</p>
<p>Whilst people talk about the order of 'fuel utilisation' as being carbohydrate, then fat then protein, there is in fact considerable overlap in part dependent on metabolic demands and available fuel sources.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember that the brain needs glucose (or ketone bodies) and that the whole body is designed to keep the brain supplied with energy.</p>
<p>Diets are interesting. The common feature is that they reduce calorie intake but in a way that manages hunger. It's probably why there is variation in their effectiveness as hunger is likely triggered differently between people. </p></div>		</li>
