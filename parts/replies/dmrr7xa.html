			<div class="markdown"><p>One advancement I wasn't aware of until I got into the hobby of flying drones is the battery's ability in delivering power. Not all batteries can discharge as quickly as others, and batteries with higher &quot;c&quot; ratings can dump their energy faster than ones with lower ratings. I feel like the hobby industry is in part driving the battery industry because they are always looking for faster discharging batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true that there are tons of batteries in the hobby industry and seems to be Any toy that is given to my kids.  My mind jumps to...go to a construction job site and you see how many companies are competing to have the best batteries.  Cordless tools with better batteries have changed the construction industry significantly in the last 10 years.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. While other components have tripled in power, etc or more in the past 5 years, battery capacity in phones has not even gotten 50% more dense in 5 years, and still uses the same lithium technology.  The density increases average 5 to 8 percent each year. Far slower than most tech. </p>
<p>This may change pretty soon, though. The last 2 years have had a couple different techs starting into fruition that should greatly increase storage density. Wait until  it's actually here before you believe it, though. </p></div>		</li>
