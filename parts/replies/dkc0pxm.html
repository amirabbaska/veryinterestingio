			<div class="markdown"><p>If you sort like a deck of cards by searching the deck for the smallest card and putting it on top of a new pile it will take ages. Algorithms computers use to sort (generally) divide the problem into very small problems (sort 7 and Ace)(3 and Q) then combine the solutions (sort this pair against that pair) - (sort these 4 against these 4) and so on. This works out much faster particularly if you had a giant deck of cards. Fourier transforms with discrete data points can be solved in a similar fashion because of some symmetry properties</p></div>		</li>

<p>The fast Fourier transform is a version of the discrete Fourier transform which is computationally much faster. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be added that the trade-off here is between speed and precision. You get much greater computation speed because you're throwing out less relevant chunks of data. If done carefully, the result should still be &quot;close enough&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you go into a bit more detail? I don't remember this being a concern (but it's been a long time).</p>
<p>I thought FFT doesn't throw away any data the DFT has.</p>
<p>A quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> check puts Cooley-Tukey at O(epsilon N) for FFT vs O(epsilon N^3/2) for naive DFT.</p></div>		</li>
