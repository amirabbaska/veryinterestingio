			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, there are two reasons (might be more). One is that it makes it obvious that a basket was actually scored. If you play without a net, it's actually pretty difficult to tell without being directly under the basket that the ball went through. Second is that it slows the ball down and drops it neatly almost directly underneath, making it easier to retrieve and start the next possession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It generally makes the ball fall through the hoop and go straight down, while simultaneously slowing the ball down so that it's easy to retrieve quickly after a shot is made. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the ball comes straight down from the hoop. Makes the ball easier to retrieve rather then have it go in a random direction.</p></div>		</li>
