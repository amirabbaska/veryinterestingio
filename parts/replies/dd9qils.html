			<div class="markdown"><p>Few points here. First, porn wasn't hit hard by broadband, it drove it's adoption. The internet was a godsend for porn because it freed them from the need to sell tapes and opened up their market massively. Now the market is the second and main point. Porn and movies are not the same. One is tolerated, socially frowned upon and legal only for adults, while the other is a centrepiece of our culture. It's impossible to overstate the effect of this difference. the third and final difference is porn is a private activity and movies are generally a social activity. You go out to the movies with friends, or a date. It would be unusual to invite friends or a date over for a porn evening. This means cinemas for movies and, prior to the internet and vcr's, seedy little viewing booths for porn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both things can be (and in fact are) true. </p>

<p>Or maybe not that impossible, since things limited in access and socially frowned upon tend to be expensive rather than cheap or free. </p></div>		</li>

Porn is not like other things. It has effectively unlimited demand, a relatively abundant supply and low cost of entry.<br />
Remove the access restriction by enabling anonymous online consumption and here we are.<br />
Porn is not Hollywood. It really is almost impossible to overstate the difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice article: I just want to say that production companies don't spend on production &quot;to justify&quot; a higher price, they do so to produce a better product, and therefore to help decommoditise their product.</p>
<p>So I think there's a feedback loop: decommoditisation -&gt; higher prices -&gt; possibility of higher costs -&gt; decommoditisation.</p></div>		</li>
