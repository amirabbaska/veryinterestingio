<p>As others have said, crocodiles have a false palate to avoid too much water in, but they still swallow amounts of water (they don't wait for the food or even their mouth to drain before swallowing).</p>

<p>Does swallowing water like that affect their body temps and cold bloodedness and everything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely but when swimming, water temperature affects them all the time anyways so there's no change in temperature when they drink it vs when they swim in it. Their internal temperature depends on the environment (water, air, food...). If they eat something warm like a gazelle, the temperature in their stomach will be warmer while the meat is still warm, like when we drink something warm in winter it makes us warm. It has been proved in cows and humans that warm food and water make digestion faster (it's a chemical process; all chemical reactions happen faster in heat than in cold), so we could assume that eating warm food and if the water they drink when doing it is warm, crocodiles would digest better than let's say eating fish in cold water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool.  I just figured swimming in cooler water was one thing, but swimming in and injesting cooler water would speed up the process (adjusting temp inside AND out).  Now sure how much insulating fat a crocodile would have, compared to a whale and blubber, but I would think swallowing water would bypass any of that.</p>
<p>But thanks for the info.  I've never thought about the temperature of a warm gazelle inside a crocodile. I've always heard stories about them stashing food underwater somewhere for later consumption, and assumed by then there wouldn't be any original body heat left in the meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because of (lack of) osmosis. Osmosis in short means that (example) if a very salty solution and a less salty one are divided by a membrane, water will move from the less salty one to the other, to try to balance the concentration. If you put seawater and freshwater divided by a membrane, saltwater 'absorbs' the water from the other side until both sides are equally salty. In our bodies our cells have salt but not as concentrated as seawater, while more than fresh water. The cell walls are the membrane. An example which we now know might not be true, is when our fingers get wrinkly in the water. We thought that it was because water gets in and cells get bloated with water (they look like dry raisins but it's actually the opposite).</p>
<p>In freshwater then, cells absorb water because the saltiness tries to be the same as the outside. Therefore, freshwater fish don't need to drink water. They need to pee diluted urine to get rid of the excess water. In saltwater, it's the opposite. Our cells get dehydrated, as water tries to dilute seawater to reach a balance (nice try). So, saltwater fish need to drink water constantly and pee very salty urine.</p>
<p>Sharks are an exception because their blood has a high urea concentration (urea, uric acid and others make up urine). The saltiness with seawater is balanced so there's no osmosis.</p></div>		</li>
