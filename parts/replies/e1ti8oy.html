			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a former shooter (pyrotechnician) for one of the largest fireworks companies in the US. I shot shows for about 27 years but gave it up seven years ago.</p>
<p>To answer your question, shooting professional firework shows is actually an amateur hobby (for lack of a better word) for the vast majority or people involved in it.</p>
<p>Most shooters only do a few shows a year. There's more work to be had if you really want it, but it's still limited because just a few holidays a year make up the bulk of the business. </p>
<p>On a typical small to medium sized show you'll have a crew of mostly volunteers - friends and family who work for free because they enjoy it - and often just one paid 'shooter' who is responsible for the show.</p>
<p>The usual way of getting into shooting fireworks is simply by knowing a shooter and volunteering to be an unpaid helper, and after you've gained enough experience helping someone else shoot shows you may get to the point of being able to be a shooter yourself. In that respect, it's a real grassroots business.</p>
<p>(Even though it's a &quot;hobby&quot; for most shooters, the pay is, last I checked, 10% of the cost of the show. Typically the shooter keeps it all but on larger shows he may split it with one or two other experienced shooters. It can easily be a couple of grand.)</p>
<p>All of that said, companies do employ full-time pyrotechnicians. Whenever you see the very large, complicated and expensive shows then you can bet they are shot by full-time professionals. </p>
<p>I can't really say for sure how those guys got their jobs. I suspect that some of them got into shooting the way most of us do but at some point decided they'd like to make a career of it and applied to the company they'd already been shooting for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a pyrotechnic designer (shows not product) for 3 years. Worked with various NFL clients, corporate gigs, stage shows, did scoring pyro for Super Bowl 50, etc. That was a full-time salary job but it was a special case since most fireworks companies are a lot more run of the mill. I was in a company with three people in the art department and then one became the boss and the other left leaving me in charge of all the pyro from designing the soundtrack to ordering product, creating layouts to helping shoot the show. It was a really involved process that I created from the bottom up using my knowledge of film (film degree) since arranging fireworks in a composition is a lot like arranging clips in a movie. The software wasn't too far off from something akin to premiere. </p>
<p>I got sick of it after a while though since there's only so much you can do with fireworks. Was fun designing player intros for the NFL for a while there though. Disneyland is where the previous pyro designer had gone so maybe it is the dream? Not for me though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might take home 10% of the show - but are you responsible for the costs related to building the fireworks? Is the term &quot;shooter&quot; someone who is responsible for only the show or even for actually crafting the fireworks used in the show?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My perspective: 7 years in a fireworks club in Switzerland doing about 1-3 displays a year.</p>
<p>There are different tiers to this job:</p>
<p>At the bottom there are the advanced enthusiasts who are just happy when their hobby mostly pays for itself. That's where I'm at. I put in a whole bunch of my free time throughout the year and a bit of money. In exchange I get to play with the big guns (up to 8 inch shells or boxes that are the size of a pallet) and get to see fireworks that are much better than anything I could buy for the same amount at the shops on national day...</p>
<p>Then there are the workers at professional companies. In order to do what we do several of us had to get certified - which means building work experience with professional companies. From my understanding you can get paid quite a bit of cash with these gigs but not enough to live off it (here) AND it's heavily seasonal work so most people there are migrant workers or locals looking to get certified.</p>
<p>And finally you've got the inner core of a professional company. This is going to be at most a handfull of people who can make a living off this full time. It is possible but you need to be very good, have the necessary connections, infrastructure and bankroll and still work a ton.</p>
<p>Being able to pull in enough large gigs to live off this is very difficult because you'll have a few large holidays (new year, national day) where <em>everyone</em> wants a fireworks display but you only have a limited number of people and a limited inventory of mortars and stuff. Plus, large displays can easily take a week to setup and tear down again. Then the rest of the year there's almost no work and <em>everyone</em> of your competitors is trying to get it as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember, this thing is a bomb that could go off with a single static electricity spark.</p>
<p>Do dissecting a shell is ugly work...</p>
<p>And what do you see when you open it? Black powder. Everywhere. It’s hard to discern what is what, once you open it... and all the insides fall out! </p>
<p>So, assuming an infinite plane and no gravity, sure! you could open it up and kinda see what it will do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>pick up a copy of H.G. Weingart’s book on fireworks. It’s got everything you need to know in it.</p>

<p>I believe it is G. W. Weingart. The book is Dictionary and Manual of Fireworks.</p></div>		</li>
