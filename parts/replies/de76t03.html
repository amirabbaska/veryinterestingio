<p>but the acid concentration is very small.</p>

<p>It's not just small, it's essentially zero. Repeating my comment further down:</p>
<p>The surface temperatures are much too high to allow droplets to stay in liquid form, resulting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virga" target="_blank">virga</a>, precipitation that evaporates well before ever hitting the ground. Multiple investigations have shown there's essentially no sulfuric acid (H2SO4) near the surface, even in vapor form. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/b5HiQAF.jpg" target="_blank">Krasnopolsky &amp; Pollack (1994)</a> showed that concentrations in their vertical profile models drop to essentially zero below an altitude of 35 km. That's in good agreement with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gIxOJsh.jpg" target="_blank">Bezard &amp; de Bergh (2006)</a>, whose spectral fits show no sulfuric acid vapor at the surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, yeah. The problem compounds when astronomers who aren't experts in planetary atmospheres and were taught this &quot;common wisdom&quot; end up writing popular layman-level articles that spread this myth further. This is unfortunately true with a few other common myths about planetary atmospheres, when a closer examination of the actual data would disprove it (e.g. a magnetic field is necessary to maintain an atmosphere).</p>
<p>If you're hovering in the atmosphere just under the cloud base around an altitude of 40 km, though, then yes, you'll get rained on and it will suck big time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understood it there is plenty of acid rain but it evaporates well before it reaches the surface. So a hypothetical Venus plane would have to deal with it but not someone on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's no acid on the surface, OK. But it'd be interesting to know just how strong the stuff in the cloud layer is. I'm having visions of that scene in <em>Dune</em> where the sandstorms of Arrakis instantly corrode and wear down anything caught in them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The acid in the atmosphere would be very, very nasty, but the sandstorms aren't just corroding what they hit, they're actually sandblasting it down with dust particles hitting at high velocities.  </p>
<p>In reality, although it depends on the material, of course, the sandstorms would probably have a much more dramatic effect in a short period of time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I have had an idea that's haunted the back of my mind for years. Would it be possible - not necessarily feasible - but possible - to transform Venus into an earth-like planet over the course of tens of thousands of years? Here's the idea I had:</p>
<ol>
<li>Redirect comets to strike the planet depositing water. Perhaps it might even be possible to have some of them strike the planet in such a way that they free appreciable amounts of atmosphere into space. </li>
<li>Build a huge shield in solar synchronous orbit, reducing the solar radiation to the planet, hopefully lowering atmospheric temperature and pressure. </li>
<li>Wait</li>
<li>When there's surface water, begin to spread the plants, bacteria, algae, etc necessary to begin converting co2 to oxygen.</li>
<li>Earth 2.0, perhaps with a higher atmospheric pressure. </li>
</ol>
<p>Would the idea work if you could find a way to do the above? Or is it impossible for other reasons, even if you could somehow accomplish those?    </p></div>		</li>
