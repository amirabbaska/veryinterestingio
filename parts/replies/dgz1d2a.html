<p>Thermal radiation at any frequency will heat up objects that absorb it. There's nothing that equates infrared to heat. The only reason we associate infrared radiation with heat is because objects at commonly available temperatures will emit the majority of their thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum. But 1 W of visible light will heat stuff up just as much as 1 W of infrared (assuming both are absorbed 100%).</p>
<p>Additionally, sound is absorbed by walls and other objects, at which point it is turned into heat.</p>
<p>Assuming all of the emissions (EM radiation or sound) remain inside the house, they'll all end up heating up whatever it was that absorbed them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I genuinely don't understand this comment; do you mean to say that the newly-gained usefulness of the heat doesn't technically change the device's efficiency, as efficiency is still technically measured in terms of the fraction of energy devoted to the device's original design? </p>
<p>I think it's fairly clear from OP's question that he's not concerned with such a definition; he's asking us to now view all household devices as serving two purposes: heating the house, and accomplishing their summertime functions. Given this new formulation, are they perfectly efficient? I think /u/KillProcess gives a reasonable summation in this thread. </p></div>		</li>
