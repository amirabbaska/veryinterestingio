			<div class="markdown"><p>The two groups are 150 times further apart than the sun to Pluto. So assuming the stars are about the size of the sun you’d just see a single point. We’re talking about a baseball held 50 miles away from you in terms of size.</p>
<p>But it would be a very very bright dot. It would be about as bright as the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The minimum stable orbit radius for a small circumbinary (orbits a binary pair) object is about 6x the orbit radius of the binary it orbits. I'm not sure how it changes for large objects but I expect it is fairly similar or a little higher. So assume that each heirarchical layer has to be 10x bigger than the one below. That ratio is small enough to fit 4 stars inside the orbit of Mercury with a total mass the same as the Sun without destabilizing Mercury's orbit</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'd get minimal heat radiation from the far group.  As longs as you got appropriate solar energy to be a habitable system from the near group you'd be fine.  they'd need to be tightly enough grouped that the orbit treated them as one gravity well to inhabit with a stable orbital path.  I don't think they'd likely be uniform visibly though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're proposing a stable orbital path between the massive inner star and the almost-not-a-star on the outside?  </p>
<p>It  sounds almost like the planet would need to be in a trojan path (?) With the small sun, in which case it would never know it's there by direct observation, as it will always be blocked by the central sun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nu Scorpii is a septuple star system.</p>

<p>1 of only 2 known. The other being AR Cassiopeiae; which is a bit more complicated than Nu Scorpii with 3 main sets instead of 2; consisting of a triple system (AB) with two binaries orbiting each other in a matter of days and a third star orbiting once every half millenia; then there's two stars (C &amp; D) that orbit each other every few millenia, and orbit AB like every half a million years. And two other stars (F &amp; G) that orbit AB ever 400,000 years or so.</p></div>		</li>
