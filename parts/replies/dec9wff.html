			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously though... I was talking to my GF for a long time on the phone and I had my arm at a 45-degree angle behind my head. When I hung up, I slingshotted my arm down to my side and the pain of the blood rushing down to my fingers was crazy. I might have hyperextended it too </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I set my arm up over my head with my hand on my opposite shoulder while watching a movie. Arm fell asleep and I kind of forgot it was up there. Looked over and freaked the fuck out when I say a hand on my shoulder. It was just my hand and couldn't feel it because it because my arm was asleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once fell asleep on a futon that was still set up as a seat, but with the mattress folded, so the the backrest part was just the wooden frame.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to get my arm behind me, against the backrest, with my full weight on it.</p>
<p>Slept for 4 hours. When I woke up, I couldn't feel or move my arm at all. Took almost 15 minutes to start getting feeling back in it, over an hour to have any sort of fine motor control.</p>
<p>Arm didn't feel right or work properly for 3 days afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once fell asleep on my stomach and on top of both arms. There is no telling how long the blood was cut off from my arms. It must've been at least a couple of hours. When I woke up, I sat up and moved my arm up to scratch my nose...except I didn't feel anything. I looked down and my arms were both still by my side. They were completely unmovable had no feeling until the blood returned. It was super uncomfortable, and tingled for about 15 minutes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me, except in my legs... I somehow slept on my back with both my legs sort of tucked under me (feet under my butt.) I got up and was groggy from my nap, and wanted a glass of water. So I nonchalantly got out of bed, only to fall on my face. Thankfully I didn't slam my head into anything, but I panicked for a good minute wondering what was wrong with my legs, why I couldn't feel them, etc. For that groggy, panic-filled minute I also imagined myself at the hospital being diagnosed with some weird nerve disease or some shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like sleeping on my stomach with both arms up and crossed, supporting my head on my pillow. I try not to do it but I subconsciously assume this position every night when I'm asleep cause its just comfortable.</p>
<p>Pretty much every morning when I wake up, both arms are completely numb and unmovable. I have to awkwardly roll over, causing both my arms to flop over my face, and lay there until they wake up and I'm able to move them. It's like waking up with two strangers arms attached to you every morning. It wasn't until reading this thread that I realized this probably isn't normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I woke up aone time and couldn't move my arms, which was concerning. I looked down to see what was wrong with them, and was alarmed to note that my arms were gone. I figuratively shit myself before I realized where they were, and had to bodily flail and flop around to get them down so I could get the function back. It hurt like hell when the feeling came back to them, but I'm not complaining because at least no one had stolen them in my sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You ever wake up in a weird position where you're arm is tucked under your head and when you go to move it is dead?</p>
<p>I somehow did that to both of my arms this morning and thought I was paralyzed until I freaked out and kicked my cover off of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it's the ulnar nerve that is compressed when you sleep in that position with your elbow bent.  You'll feel numbness and tingling in your pinky and half of your ring finger leading up to your elbow.  It's the same nerve that is referred to as the funny bone.  It usually gets compressed at the elbow.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sometimes get this. When I go to sleep, I lay on my side with my whole body under the covers. Sometimes when I wake up I'll have my arms out of the covers and up behind my head. Usually one or both of them are numb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People still get way over-zealous when attempting to pop deep black-heads. Last time I did that I couldn't stand up straight for 3 hours because my knees had spent so long bent slightly forward against the sink. Home dermatology is dangerous business.</p></div>		</li>
