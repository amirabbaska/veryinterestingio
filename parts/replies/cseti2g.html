			<div class="markdown"><p>We did that as kids, without a compressor. Imagine an upside down bucket (diving bell) weighted down with a big bunch of rocks hanging on strings around it. A bunch of kids on the pier with foot-operated car tire inflators pump like crazy. These go into a home-made &quot;manifold&quot; and feed the hose that goes into the bell (actually under the bucket). The air simply mixes in the bell and excess bubbles out from under the rim of the bucket. We've spent hours doing this, lots of fun for the guy 2-3 m underwater, but the guys on the pier get tired rather quick. The part of the lake next to the pier was shallow like that and we'd wade around it, using a long garden hose to feed the air. It smelled rubbery and wet, but work it did. I'll never forget the experience, it was just cool.</p></div>		</li>
