			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is only used in electronics for its corrosion resistance. It's not a particularly good conductor, but good enough for plating for corrosion resistance. Gold has virtually no reaction to salt water.</p>
<p>Silver is the absolute best electrical conductor and copper is a very close second. Copper is used for everything since it's much cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is a great conductor, 3rd best conducting element, behind silver and copper.  It is ahead of Aluminum and we make a lot of power lines from aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point is, gold wouldn’t be used in electronics if it wasn’t for its corrosion resistance. There is no other reason to use such an expensive material. Aluminum is used for its light weight (and price). Also high voltage reduces loss from resistance since higher voltage means lower current. </p></div>		</li>
