<blockquote>
<p>Now we have learned that in March 2005, there was a “near-miss” event while disassembling another W56 warhead. Apparently the production technicians were using a faulty tool, putting too much pressure on the warhead. On November 29, 2006, Pantex was only fined $110,000 – 18 months after the near-miss incident. What was not made public at the time the fine was levied, however, is that according to safety experts knowledgeable about this event, it could actually have resulted in the detonation of the warhead. This incident was particularly dangerous because the W56 warhead was deployed in 1965, pre-dating the three basic enhanced safety features which reduce the possibility of an accidental detonation that are now required on more modern weapons. There are still several older warheads slated for dismantlement that do not include these enhanced features.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the warhead type and how old it is. As other users pointed out, older warheads without safety features can be more dangerous. As far as I'm aware, most if not all of the work is done by hand. They're not so dangerous or radioactive that you can't be near them. In fact, you can hold a chunk of uranium or plutonium in a gloved hand and be totally fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fusion fuel is the extra part of the warhead that makes it undergo fusion instead of just fission. This greatly increases the size of the explosion. The fusion fuel is usually lithium deuteride and deutrium/tritium. </p></div>		</li>
