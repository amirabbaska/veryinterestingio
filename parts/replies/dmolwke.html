			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this some. Sometimes even people going to great lengths to cover their tracks make mistakes. Some hackers for instance have a twitter, paypal or something else. At any point if they access those things without using the proper measures they can track you down. The social media sites turned over the IPs that were used to access the accounts. This brought down some illegal sites and exposed the owners identities in the past. The OP question was about child pornography or posted death threats. Those kind of people typically would not be going through the lengths that someone with hacking skills might use and are much easier to catch. Typically at best they are using a VPN out of the country.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you take every single measure possible, you probably won't ever be found</p>

<p>I don't dig this.  I feel like if you take all precautions necessary, all you're doing is making it not worth the effort it would take to track you down; rather than outright impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;you probably won't ever be found&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't say impossible, I'm pretty sure you where both thinking along the same lines, and I agree.</p>
<p>If you use random usernames, connect through TOR, use a PC solely for posting on 4chan, have lots of background traffic to try and mask your uploads, and be careful to speak &quot;differently&quot; on 4chan, It would be very hard to identify you. Not impossible, but so hard that any mere mortal would likely give up.</p>
<p>The truth is that even people who do this tend to get caught, and it's usually down to error. If you go and look up some articles about people being caught (try drug trafficking, terrorism, CP etc) you will notice that any time they reveal how they were found it's usually something stupid like &quot;the dude connected from a library once&quot; or &quot;his alias included his D.O.B&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the measures you mentioned above, you could also post using a laptop you don't use otherwise, and only connect to some random mall's free wifi. Avoid doing it at the same place too often and too long. I wouldn't bank on &quot;masking traffic&quot;, you're still sitting at the same source - ideally you wouldn't be using the same equipment and not be in the same place at all, hence the drive-by on free wifi using a burner laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arguably yes, but as a simplistic example, you load TAILS on to a USB, go to an internet cafe and do something illegal, it is extremely unlikely they would find a digital identifier for you personally. </p>
<p>They may get CCTV evidence of you being in the cafe at the right time to have committed the crime, and they may find evidence of you downloading TAILS, thus giving them suspicion and possibly a case. </p>
<p>But then that would be technically your fault for leaving a trace of the download and choosing a cafe exposed to CCTV.</p>
<p>It certainly isn't easy to have complete total anonymity, as it's essentially like a game of 4D chess. You have to anticipate <em>every</em> method of identification and put a counter in place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only an internet cafe, but it's possible to break into a secure network or use a external WiFi adapter with an amplifier and use it from a distance. Speeds may be terrible but it will get the job done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you can drive-by on a mall's free wifi, if you make a one-time throwaway post that way, I highly doubt they'd be able to link it to you. At best, they'd trace it to the mall, assuming they connected all the other steps after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you're relatively safe from a routing standpoint, but you still might inadvertently leave other trails. From memory, the guy who ran either KAT our TPB was caught because he used the same connection to log into both the site admin tools and Facebook.</p>
<p>Never use your 'illicit stuff' VPN for legit stuff.</p>
<p>You might also mention that you're from a particular country or city, which, if they've got other information, may lead to dots being connected.</p>
<p>They are really very good at what they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about a guy who got caught because of dropbox once, cant remember the case, something piracy related.</p>
<p>Dude routs his network through a &quot;super high tech&quot; VPN so he can do his &quot;bad shit&quot;. Also has dropbox installed which syncs his legal files over said network in the background.</p>
<p>He enables/disables VPN at various points during the day when switching from legal to illegal activities, his dropbox continues to sync the entire time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. Never log in anything your real identity owns while you're flying hot. Why would some random John Doe log into your account? They won't. So don't.</p></div>		</li>
