<p>The fact that your cornea does not need or have blood vessels in it, also means the body's immune system also has much more limited access to the cornea.  This explains why a corneal transplant from person to person in 1905 was (more or less) the first successful transplant, since the host's immune system didn't recognize the graft as foreign and kill it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep!</p>
<p>That said, it can last a lot longer on a little bit of oxygen.</p>
<p>The scary one is Contact Lenses.  This is part of the reason why you have to change your contacts, since wearing them too long can damage the cornea easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the whole reason why silicone hydrogel materials were developed for contact lenses in the late 90s. The addition of silicone substantially increases the transmissibility of oxygen through the lens material. This is especially important for stronger prescription lenses, which are generally thicker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this. It blows me away how many people constantly sleep in their contacts. This can cause irritation and infection, and it's just an awful sticky feeling trying to take them out later.
Please take out your contacts, and rub them with solution before you put them back in!</p></div>		</li>
