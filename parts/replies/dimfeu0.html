			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely on point with the fallacy of determining disease mechanism from what meds work. I'll add a nuance though, that diagnosis of ADHD is not reached based on the efficacy of meds, it's a clinical diagnosis made by finding symptoms across different environments. So when people use their response to meds to support the presence/absence of a disease it's inductive reasoning, which isn't necessarily invalid, but it does not say with certainty they have the disease or not.</p>
<p>Furthermore neuroscience tends to see the neurotransmitter level as the mechanistic &quot;floor&quot; so to speak with a lot of disorders. While I agree with you personally, and think this approach misses the forest for the trees, for the sake of argument I think a more forgiving analogy that is better in line with our (extremely sparse) understanding of Adderall for ADHD wouldn't be steroids for inflammation but rather an antibiotic for the bone infection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's pretty easy to see why we as a society don't want every single student taking stimulants as they do have side effects and long term health issues attached. Although we might have better students, we'll also have a significant bill to pay in actual medication costs and in the accumulation of side effects/abuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These medical sounding posters are being somewhat disingenuous. Yes, most people are more productive if you give them stimulants. But stimulants as a treatment for ADHD was discovered in the late 1930s when Charles Bradley gave a bunch of kids with behavioral issues Benzadrine and about half of them improved significantly.</p>
<p>You'll notice that's not a 100% significant improvement rate. The other kids presumably experienced some improvement but for those with ADHD this &quot;fixed&quot; things in a way it didn't for others.</p>
<p>Basically, if you don't have ADHD, stimulants aren't going to give you a magical intelligence boost that will let you accomplish things you couldn't before - not in the way they would benefit a person with actual ADHD. This is why the response of the patient is considered important in confirming whether or not they actually have it. The fuzziness comes from the fact when the effects of medication are reported by the patient rather than directly observed by the doctor, it's a hell of a lot harder to tell the difference.</p>

<p>Said Erdos never. It certainly won't make you more knowledgeable, but it certainly will boost the speed at which you're able to tackle problems and the amount of effort you can put towards a problem. Don't expect to become a genius, but if you're doing a lot of mentally demanding work like mathematics or software development or something similar, then stimulants are a huge boost to productivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're either bringing too many of your assumptions to bear here, or I was unclear in my response. If you take a classroom filled with people who are basically otherwise normal and put them on stimulants, basically everyone will do better. In the case you're talking about, you're assuming that the behavioral disorders all cluster around ADHD. It's entirely possible to give stimulants to people whose behavioral problems have nothing to do with focus, and have them not respond with improved focus, or have their improved focus not be seen because they are too busy trying to set fire to the school. Stimulants aren't magic &quot;good citizen&quot; pills, at low doses they are just good at helping people focus. I don't think the findings you cite support your conclusion about what was going on in the two groups. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, but if I get &quot;sick&quot;, take an antiviral and then get better, I'm inclined to believe a virus was the cause. If I get a bad cough and take antibiotics and see quick relief, I'm inclined to believe bacteria was the cause. This is because we know what the medication is affecting and we know it's related to the underlying causes. You're failing to make the differentiation that some medications treat the root cause or a cause of some set of symptoms that indicates an underlying disease and some medications that treat symptoms. </p>
<p>Think about more complicated diseases. It turns out that TNF blockers reduce or eliminate certain diseases like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. I can take some type of pain medication to alleviate painful cramping, and that's treating a symptom of the disease, but what about TNF blockers? Is that treating a symptom or is it treating something related to the root cause? It's for sure treating something more fundamental to the disease, at least, as it's the immune system's response that is causing those other symptoms, even if it's not treating the main cause, what is causing the TNF issue with your immune system such as gut bacteria or something else, but you can be sure that if someone presents the symptoms of Crohn's disease and you give them a TNF blocker and it rids them of their symptoms, that they have Crohn's disease.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you're wrong, for sure. In the absence of any other symptoms or indications of a disease, a medication having some effect does not mean much, moreso when it's something like a stimulant that is known to have an effect in normal people. It's still difficult, though, as when we're talking about changes to dopamine systems that are thought to be a cause or at least indicative enough of the disease, so a change after taking the drugs <em>could</em> be indicative of a disease. The biggest thing to warn anyone about is self diagnosis. It's ok to wonder if you may have something like ADD and you weren't aware after seeing some type of improvement after taking stimulants, but you need to be evaluated professionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but I think your examples do a better job of showing how far away from the complex cases you mention the talk about what stimulants tell us about ADHD is. </p></div>		</li>
