			<div class="markdown"><p>Intuitively that doesn't seem wrong to me... You're capturing and redirecting energy that would otherwise have left the system and putting it back into the system. It seems to me that you could totally use the heat leaving a sun to warm that sun up to a higher temperature. What am I missing there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you've <em>missed</em> anything, but bear in mind that my example was basically a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> - The reason you can't heat up the sun that way is the same reason your bright dot can't ever get hotter than the sun.  At some point (ignoring conductive/convective losses), you'd reach a radiative equilibrium point where your bright dot dumps energy into the sun at the same rate the sun dumps energy into <em>it</em>.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your argument confuses me. You seem to make a point about energy, in the absolute sense. That no more energy can flow to the sun as can flow out from the sun.</p>
<p>However, if I take a very small amount of energy, and I confine in to an infinitely small volume, the temperature in this volume will become infinite. Higher than the temperature of the sun. But we needed only very little energy to achieve it. Much less energy than is present in the sun.</p></div>		</li>
