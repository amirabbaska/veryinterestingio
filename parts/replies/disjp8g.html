			<div class="markdown"><p>That is fascinating. You mention that with training someone can learn to remember smells. What kind of training is available for such a thing? Is it limited to just those in the perfume industry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The training is mainly done in perfume companies such as IFF, Givaudan and Firmenich, but a few schools exist in France (mainly). The best-known school is called ISIPCA, in Versailles. The training (of this specific smell-remembering part) is basically smelling controlled-quality materials used by the perfume industry (essential oils and odorous chemical compounds) over and over again, then smelling them blind (without seeing which one it is) and trying to remember which one it is. It's a lot of repetition. There are several levels of difficulty to this, but the beginning can be done with a <a href="http://www.aromaster.com/product/master-wine-aroma-kit/" target="_blank">wine aroma kit</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm understanding either of you incorrectly, but that seems kind of different to the OP's question, though. To make an analogy, it sounds like OP is asking why can't we 'write' smells in our heads like we can 'write' sounds and sights, and you're saying that people can be trained to 'read' smells. The fundamental actions/processing of the qualia seem different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random person here: you don't need professional training to do this, either. Any good chef does it on a daily basis, and even okay chefs do it with assisted taste memory methods like smelling things before adding them in (&quot;okay so it tastes like this, what can I add so it tastes better <em>proceeds to smell different things to combine flavors in head and decide if it should be added</em>&quot;).</p>
<p>It's just about practicing, if you're consistent with anything then your brain is pretty good about focusing on it and doing it correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about what things you've (inadvertedly) trained yourself to pay attention to and catalogue, <em>because the brain changes through practice and added mental training</em> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2279137/" target="_blank">reinforcing the pathways</a>.
I mean just look at that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17024677" target="_blank">london taxi cab driver study</a> , their brain literally had notable physical brain changes for better visual memory &quot;just because&quot; they trained it.<br />
If you're not training things and you don't indirectly get training for it through related areas of training, you are not going to do as well as if you had trained for it, whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p></div>		</li>
