			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the explanation I heard from a Protestant seminarian. </p>
<p>It was explained to me as 6 representing &quot;he will try to look like perfection, but he will fall short just as man has. So 666 is &quot;he's a man, he's a man, he's a man&quot;&quot;.</p>
<p>Same as you, though, I can't vouch for the accuracy of it, it may simply be a convenient tie in to the Nero explanation, or possibly the Nero explanation is the tie in to this simpler explanation, since, as others said, Caesar was no longer Nero at the time of the writing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close. When you factor in comments below as above. 6 is the number of man and 3 is the number of divinity, God. When you triple 6 you have a symbol of man making himself God.
Shout out D-Styles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the number of man was 7, because of the 4 elements (the world was very aristotelian at the time) + 3 (the number of God). What do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually recently encountered several reformed religious people that believe &quot;The God of this age&quot; in 2 Corinthians 4:4 refers to hedonism or the elevation of oneself. Though other people tend to interpret the term as a reference to Satan. Interesting to find that same parallel in Revelation's different interpretations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the number for man was supposed to be 5. Because, even though the Devil (6) is imperfect, he's still more divine than we are.  Any truth?</p></div>		</li>
