			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a nuclear fuels engineer intern the rule of thumb was about 1% of the rated (max) power per day. So after the core is too used up to maintain full power, power starts declining. The longest coast down I saw was \~20 days, to 80% power, before the refueling outage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>18 to 24 months per cycle, typically 3 cycles depending on enrichment. 18 month cycles are 3-5% U-235, 24 month are slightly higher. Coastdowns will be specific to the core load, and what reactor engineering has analyzed, and is basically a cost benefit decision (how many MW can they make without hurting future cycles) but in general I’d say a couple of weeks and maybe 15 or 20% power. It doesn’t take long once you run out of dilution for power to drop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really;</p>
<p>I can’t speak for boilers with direct experience, though it should be the same. For PWR’s, there are 3 separate heating loops that separate the reactor from atmosphere. The reactor runs at around 600 degrees and 2200psig. There is a pretty big margin for sub cooling as it is. As far as the secondary steam system, the condenser is already under a vacuum, so you wouldn’t gain much there either. </p>
<p>What does make a difference is ambient temperature. The colder outside it is, the more efficient the system becomes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Altitude doesn’t affect the boiling in this case. You set the reactor pressure to control the boiling point. For a BWR plant like the one I operate, we run at 1025 PSIG, which means we boil water at around 545 degF. </p>
<p>Changing the boiling point doesn’t have huge effects on fuel life. What does affect it is preheating your feedwater supply, so that the core wastes less energy bringing this cold water to boiling point before it makes steam. You use waste heat from steam that condenses in your turbine to preheat the feedwater. </p></div>		</li>
