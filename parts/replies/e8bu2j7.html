			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of this is because both oxygen and CO2 need to move from higher concentration (or partial pressure) to lower concentration. It's akin to if you have two solutions of salt in water with different concentrations and put them into contact with each other, the salt is not going to concentrate on one side.</p>
<p>(To do that you would need to somehow pump it. Things like that happen elsewhere in the body for other things, and require energy.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric air at sea level contains 20.9% oxygen. If you exhale after two minutes, at rest, you should be exhaling 10-13% oxygen. This is empirical evidence collected by me breathing into my oxygen monitor after holding my breath until i feel like i cant any longer.
By taking a quick breah and exhaling as mouth to mouth you are probably giving 16-18% oxygen to the person. Plenty for the brain to survive until paramedics get there, which is all you are really trying to accomplish with CPR.</p></div>		</li>
