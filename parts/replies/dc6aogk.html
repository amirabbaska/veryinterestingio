<p>I love the smell of coffee, HATE the taste of it.  When I tell people that, they look at me like I am a monster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweet, Salty, Bitter, Sour and Umami (kind of like savory) are all tastes, and there may be a 6th.</p>
<p>Anything beyond those are not tastes, but odors if I understand correctly. I assume it largely works in reverse, because while I associate those tastes with certain smells, I do not think I have every actually smelled them. </p>
<p>The reason you probably do not like coffee is that it is bitter, but you like the smell because you can't smell bitter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm anosmic meaning I can't smell anything. I basically can taste everything and I am immune to all bad smells, not even Durian can sway me. But if someone pours too much pepper in the air or is cooking with a lot of chilli I can &quot;feel&quot; it in my nose. It's itchy and makes me want to sneeze, though I can't smell it. The same thing with things like Vaporub or other menthol balms. I can &quot;feel&quot; the mint in my nose, but not smell it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at coldstone, there is undeniably an odor to those stores. The waffle irons were stationed closest to the door strategically, and our waffle batters used quite a bit of cinnamon in them, so anyone close to the entrance would get a hit of that smell. </p>
<p>Besides that, I can say something about the actual ice cream really sticks into the fabric of your clothes each night. I'd go home after a closing shift with just a STINK of the sweet cream mix soaked into my black polo uniform. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always disliked the idea of garnish.  It seems like such a waste, especially when it serves no purpose other than to make the dish look &quot;pretty.&quot;  There was an episode of Cutthroat Kitchen I saw where the judge starts talking about the garnish and the chef goes &quot;That's just garnish.&quot;  The judge says something like, &quot;If it's on the plate, then it should be edible.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds more like the cinnamon was meant to be dispersed over whatever dish it was served with, to the individual's taste. The spoon would allow you to sprinkle a little or a lot or none at all. But hey, I wasn't actually there, and also I always eat garnishes anyway.</p></div>		</li>
