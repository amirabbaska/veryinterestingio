<p>Yearly average temperature is obviously a combination of latitude and altitude. But when you look into it, altitude is most important - the temperature drop from a 1000m meter mountain (\~8*C) is roughly the same as that from moving 15 degrees of latitude (or \~1500km) closer the the pole. </p>
<p>If you look at a terrain map of Canada, it is basically all very low and flat from the great lakes until you get to the north of Baffin Island. And where there are substantial mountains on Baffin, Devon, Ellesmere islands, there are indeed ice caps (although these mountains are smaller than those in Greenland, and the ice caps are similarly smaller). But Nunavut, with its low altitude and higher annual temperature, is ice-free despite being on the same latitude as Southern Greenland.</p></div>		</li>
