			<div class="markdown"><p>Often the waste goes through a fish meal plant, which turns it to powder used for fertiliser. The oil can also be extracted for fish oil tablets. Iâ€™ve worked on commercial trawlers in New Zealand where there is no waste from the target species. The skin is removed by running the fillets through two frozen rollers. The skin sticks to the frozen rollers and gets ripped off. The vessel fishing factories are only set up to process one type of fish at a time, so by catch species are hand filleted. </p>
<p>They also have specialised engineers whose sole job is ensuring the filleting machines get as much meat off the fish as possible. Even very slight improvements to filleting efficiency can have a significant financial benefit because of the way fishing quotas are managed in New Zealand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but you won't get near as much for that per pound as you would for a nice fillet.  </p>
<p>It all depends on that difference in sell price, as well as the size of the fish in question, as well as the price of labor compared to that of running the machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, it's not too good.  However, when tilapia fillet is $2.19/lb, how much time can you pay a person with a boning knife and stay competitive?  I'm sure too that the remaining carcass is processed into other products like fishmeal, fertilizer, pet food, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if OP is right, and an employee can fillet a fish in 30 seconds, that's over 100 fish an hour. If the average tilapia is makes just 4 pounds of filet a piece, and your payroll cost is $10/hour, you're still making a hefty profit, at least on this side of the process. More expensive fish, like salmon or swordfish, probably would yield a higher return. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here you can literally buy that fish bone with some meat, and I assume the price is exactly what makes it cheaper to just leave those parts in there. </p></div>		</li>
