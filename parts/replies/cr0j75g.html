			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incredibly cool.  Why have I not heard about this before?  Are there not any implications here about using fungi to bio scrub radiation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the fungus only takes in the radiation and does nothing to the radioactive material itself (akin to plants absorbing sunlight vs. reducing the actual output of the sun), I don't think this would be a workable application. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fungal research moves notoriously slowly because there are very few fungal pathogens of humans. However, there is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20421152" target="_blank">evidence that melanin could be used to protect people undergoing radiation therapy</a>. Also, eating melanotic fungi before radiation exposure has been suggested to reduce radiation poisoning  as it shields the stem cells in your stomach which are able to rescue your bone marrow after a lethal radiation dose. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23113595" target="_blank">This might result in a protective technique for people working in radiation danger zones</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think those are interesting results, but this is quite preliminary information.  As it stands, there's some evidence that they <em>might</em> grow toward radioactive sources, but with genetic or a mechanism, it's far from certain.</p>
<p>That one paper has only been cited a few times, no biological mechanism has been proposed, and most importantly, they don't have any genetics!  Find a mutant that no longer displays that behavior as a control, and you'll convince me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a mechanism yet, but perhaps the fungi are using the radiation as an energy source (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632287" target="_blank">melanin certainly seems to be capable of facilitating that</a>) and growing towards it through something similar to an auxin-mediated mechanism? </p></div>		</li>
