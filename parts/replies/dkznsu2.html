</blockquote>
<p>That depends entirely on how sensitive your measuring device is. Maybe there is some fundamental physical limit on how low of a force can be measured, but we don't currently know that there is. (If there is, it would be very reasonable for it to be similar to some kind of Planck unit.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered if you could theoretically use this to determine if we're living in a simulation. Put an object really far away from anything (obviously easier said than done...). Make sure it only has a very small amount of acceleration from gravity.</p>
<p>If the universe is a simulation, very small values are likely to be rounded down to zero, so the object will never move. If it's not a simulation, even though the object's velocity will be undetectable at first, over time it should increase enough to see.</p>
<p>Or if the universe is a simulation but rounds all non-zero values to some minimum instead of rounding down to zero, you'll still see it accelerate faster than expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like if someone had capabilities of simulating world we live in, they will surely have technology to account for this. Rather than having values round down to 0/constant, simulation could calculate a value (indefinitely small if required) that would show acceleration of said object to be consistent with our understanding of Physics.</p></div>		</li>
