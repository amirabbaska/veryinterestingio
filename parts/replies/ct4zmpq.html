<p>What a time to be alive. We have at our fingertips, short videos to explain complicated shit. Its mind boggling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, angular velocity...  Parallax is the change in angle as you traverse a distance. (Which can be used to measure distance to the object)</p>
<p>It is related though, but for photography of distant objects, the angular rate is all that's important</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thrusters, if there's fuel. Gravity assists for longer journeys. </p>
<p>To aim the camera or where they want to change only where the spacecraft is pointing, they use reaction wheels. Generally 2 wheels are spinning... They slightly slow down one wheel and the difference in momentum will turn the spacecraft. It's s very smooth change and so stable that Hubble can maintain its aim at a fixed point for days on end for projects Ike the Ultra Wide Deep Field with nary a vibration. </p>
<p>Edit: Want to point out that New Horizons uses thrusters for pointing as well. In order to keep it small &amp; light, no reaction wheels were installed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, reaction wheels are incredible. I needed a tolerance of 5 degrees to point an antenna on a cube sat and the adac system was rated in arc minutes. This is for a sub $100k spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They usually either shoot out gas like miniature rockets which are placed at their extremities, making them turn, or they use reaction wheels. Reaction wheels are basically heavy flywheels attached to a motor. When the wheel spins, the reaction force (every action has an equal and opposite reaction) causes the craft to turn the other way.  </p>
<p>You can see flywheels in action by standing on a swivel chair. Without changing the position of your feet, try and twist your body quickly to face in another direction. Instead of you rotating, the chair will turn in the opposite direction. This is the principle spacecraft use; you are the flywheel and the chair is the spacecraft, and you've just pointed it at pluto!</p></div>		</li>
