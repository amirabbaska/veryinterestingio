			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the main points tbh. A GoPro only looks good in bright, beautiful sunshine. It's image sensor is about the same size as my cell phone. </p>
<p>I usually shoot with my rx-100 or a7s-ii in 99% of situations because of the larger image sensor (and shallower depth of field) over my hero 6. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most ENG camera have 2/3 inch to 1 inch sensors. Now they may have three of them (one for each color). This is why you will rarely see ENG cams shooting in available light. Even in lit interiors they use a cam mounted key light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None have 1&quot; sensors. That would require a large and very expensive prism block. Also, ENG cams shoot under available light pretty easily. They do use an on-camera light on occasion, but depending on the camera and the situation that may be used more for making people look decent than for required illumination.</p>
<p>I shot a lot of this kind of thing back in the '90s with much less sensitive cameras. It wasn't always easy but it could be done. Now, it's not really a problem—although I only shoot with single sensor cameras now, prisms are no longer part of my world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That ia generaly true, but news cameras does not use as big sensors as one may think. Its far smaller than fullframe, often its even smaller than 1 inch, which is very surprising if we look at the big body. (but they still offer a good low light performance) </p></div>		</li>

<p>and space.  there are surely some nice rigs with neat gimbals and such, but a shoulder mount camera can still take up less space than an Erector set drum kit around your body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for pointing out video quality. I defy anyone to say a piece of GoPro footage looks better or even remotely comparable to footage taken on a professional grade camera. </p>
<p>The biggest problem with small cameras is dynamic range - the brightness point at which colours appear to turn pure white to the camera (and the darkness point at which colours turn pure black). With small cameras, you have to kinda choose which bit of your scene you want to be colourful, and you'll notice that if the sky looks alright, the ground might look really dark or even black. This effect is exacerbated when using a camera indoors. </p>
<p>The dynamic range is normally measured in stops, if anybody was interested in googling it. </p>
<p>Now I've mentioned it, you'll see it everywhere. </p>
<p>I was going to page OP but I'm on mobile. F that username. </p>
<p>Edit: fixed the measurement of dynamic range. I mis-remembered it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just an example to back you up here since I already went and found it.  Multi million dollar post production budget and the difference is still so obvious. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dynamic range is measured in <em>stops</em> not f stops. Your aperture is measured in f stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that GoPros suffer from that problem, not all &quot;prosumer&quot; cameras do. There are several cameras out there with 13+ stops of range. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. The higher end of &quot;prosumer&quot; equipment is much, much better. Even my fairly low-end Canon DSLR takes better videos and has better range than my smartphone of comparable price, so size really is important, getting back to the point at hand. </p>
<p>To my knowledge, though, we have still yet to quite make it to the dynamic range of human vision (25 IIRC) even on state-of-the-art professional cameras. We've come a long way, and we're nearly there, but not quite. </p></div>		</li>
