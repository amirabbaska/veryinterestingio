			<p>Wait, I'm confused. Do we have to have a microsoft account to have windows now? I'm on window's 7 and don't think I've ever had a microsoft account. What good is a PIN if everything is stored locally, anyway?</p>		</li>

			<p>You can opt for a local account during setup. You don't need to set a password or a PIN with that one if you don't want to.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's worth noting that you lose out on a <em>ton</em> by having a local account instead of a Microsoft account:<br><br><em> cross-device syncing of settings and information (super helpful if you have multiple Windows devices)<br></em> Cortana<br><em> app store access (there are at least <em>a few</em> worthwhile apps at the moment)<br></em> OneDrive file syncing<br>* even more stuff that hasn't been announced yet for a Fall update<br><br>It's like not having a Microsoft/Google/Apple account on your phone - I simply don't think it makes sense if you want an OS to act in a modern manner.  Of course, if you don't want any of those things, feel free to turn them off and use a local account, but then the OS will feel much more incremental than it actually is.</p>		</li>

			<p>If everything is stored locally, and you use a local account, then everything is just as good as it was before.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; So in theory, they're correct as no one is going to be at the machine long enough to try 10000 combinations. <br><br>It is potentially many more combinations than that since the pin length can be chosen by the user.</p>		</li>

			<p>How is this enforced? Will it only accept input from the laptop keyboard? </p>		</li>
