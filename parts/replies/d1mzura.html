			<div class="markdown"><p>And <strong>please</strong>,  when arguing online, don't just call out the name of the fallacy and declare you've won the argument. It's lazy and doesn't prove you were right anyway.  That's it's own fallacy. Instead,  disassemble their argument once you've identified the weak spot. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: We should relax the laws on beer.<br />
B: 'No, any society with unrestricted access to intoxicants loses its work ethic and goes only for immediate gratification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad:  <del>&quot;that's a strawman,  and an appeal to probability,  and probably a little bit of affirming the consequent.  Typical redditor</del></p>
<p>That's going to just change the debate to one about logical fallacies and who started it.  The moment you see people bringing up named fallacies in a thread, just bail out- it's going nowhere. </p>
<p>Good: &quot;ok, we agree on that: no unrestricted access to intoxicants for everyone.  Now what if we just relaxed the laws on beer like I suggested?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. Years on the internet has shown me that the vast majority of keyboard warriors completely misunderstand the concept of a logical fallacy. They drop it like a mic and assume they've won, because they fail to understand that a person can have a logical fallacy contained in their argument and still <em>not</em> be devoid of merit. </p>
<p>The true value of understanding logical fallacies is in ensuring your <em>own</em> arguments do not contain them. Or, alternatively, recognizing them when grappling with an argument, to ensure your own beliefs are not <em>based</em> on them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. A fallacy just means that your argument isn't valid, not that your conclusion is false. Claiming otherwise is known as the fallacy fallacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a <em>formal</em> fallacy indicates an argument isn't valid. <em>Informal</em> fallacies do not imply this. (I'm assuming you're using the technical sense of &quot;valid&quot; here.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes further than that. It's about respecting the human being at the other end of the comment. I'm the first to admit I fail there occasionally. Arguing should be neutral, not fighting or winning.</p>
<p>I've had people on here say the most ridiculous bullshit, like &quot;you're getting eviscerated because you're stupid,&quot; and this is describing my comment receiving five or six downvotes, and when I was right anyway.</p>
<p>We have to work harder to respect each other and collectively care about educating each other and coming to common understandings rather than competing and attacking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, but this isn't exactly a straw man, because Person B just stated a bias and didn't make any arguments based on it. Here's a slightly modified example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Person A) My wife doesn't work. She stays at home with the kids. She loves it and it's been great for the kids.</p>
<p>Person B) What!? Women can be just as productive members of the workforce as men, sometimes even more! In fact, a 2007 study found that Fortune 500 companies with more female board directors attained “significantly higher financial performance” than those with the lowest female representation. On top of that, you've got to consider blah blah blah...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ok you get the idea.</p>
<p>Person B's argument isn't <em>wrong</em>. In fact, he or she might be making really compelling arguments against the position that women shouldn't join the workforce. But that's not a position held by anyone in the conversation—she's not arguing against Person A, she's arguing against a <em>straw man</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here are more straw man arguments that avoid the slippery slope and are common today:</p>
<p>&quot;All of these liberals that support socialized health care just want a bunch of handouts and want the government to support them while they leach off of the system!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gun rights supporters are just a bunch of anti-government rednecks that want to shoot everything that moves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<del>Pro-Life</del> Pro-Choice supporters are promiscuous and just want zero consequences for having unprotected sex.&quot;</p>
<p>An argument that creates a fake target (typically an exaggerated stereotype) and then attacks that target is a straw man argument. It's very common to see this in a lot of internet debates, where one person will attempt to label and pidgeonhole their opponent as a specific type and then argue against that type rather than arguing against their opponent's actual position or statements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's subtle, but none of those are strawman arguments, they're all examples of <em>ad hominem</em> arguments.  In all cases, you aren't misrepresenting the proponents' viewpoint, but impugning the speakers' motive for holding those viewpoints.  </p>
<p>This is most obviously clear in the third example.  Calling pro-life (pro-choice?) supporters promiscuous doesn't misrepresent the pro-choice policy position in the slightest.  It merely questions the morality of the people who hold that position.  Thus, it's not a straw man argument, it's an <em>ad hominem</em> argument.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is the strawman version, arguing against something that A did not say. In your example they are just asking. And then A's answer would just be &quot;no&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
