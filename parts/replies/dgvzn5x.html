<p>A person is also paid by how much they can produce. in 1917, TV had not been invented yet. The closest thing would have been reading about it in a paper, or hearing about it from a friend. So a single athlete could only really entertain one stadium of people at a time. </p>
<p>You add a few decades and you start getting radio and TV. Suddenly, the same athlete (well, not the exact same one, he would be old) can entertain 10-100x more people. Mix in the fact the overall wealth is exploding and people have more disposable income to put towards entertainment and you have an industry that is growing. </p>
<p>Mix this with what u/roprog has already said, and you have athletes increasing in income at a ridiculous rate. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The US has a severe (and getting worse) shortage of doctors and nurses, despite paying them a whole lot of money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure why that is for nurses, but for doctors in the US, residency spots are capped by the government. Medical schools can (and currently do!) enroll more students but the number of people who can actually move from medical school to medical practice is limited by the number of residency spots.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably because it's a shit job for the most part. I'm an imaging tech and would never want to become a nurse no matter how much more you'd pay me. RNs and CNAs put up with and have to deal with some of the worst people you'll ever meet, are constantly overworked due to chronic understaffing, always end up taking the brunt of their patient's emotional frustrations, and on top of all that the job is physically and emotionally demanding.</p>
<p>Imagine if you worked retail and the angry person constantly demanding to speak to a manager was your patient. Now imagine that due to their illness you have to help them ambulate to and from a commode chair, wipe their ass, and still get yelled at by them and then talked down to by their family when they come in too.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just jaded and cynical from spending my entire adult life working in healthcare, but it's seriously one of the most thankless jobs on the planet in my opinion. Yes, I've had extremely sweet, polite, and grateful patients, but they really are few and far between it seems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are less US med school seats (MD and DO) than there are residency spot available. There are a lot of med students from either foreign countries or UD citizens who went to other countries for medical training and then apply for residency in America. Also, there are quite a few residency spots that go unfilled ever year due to a undesirable location and/or specialty.</p></div>		</li>
