			<div class="markdown"><p>They did protect Japan, the Allies didn't destroy Japan's reputation because they were our new non communist friend in Asia, public opinion had to be positive towards them especially as Emperor Hirohito was still &quot;in charge&quot;. Protecting the Japanese reputation was a completely deliberate move made by the Allied governments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the main reason. Just after the war, the Cold War began and Japan was our ally for a variety of reasons, big part being strategic location. During the Korean War we fought the Chinese &amp; Russians as well. We couldn't make the Japanese stand out historically as &quot;evil&quot; because &quot;evil&quot; during the 50s/60s, etc were the Communists.  There are a lot of good answers here and they are a part of it. But I think this is the bigger one; like revisionist history in order to save some face and keep the public at the time focused on the new &quot;evil&quot;.  So textbooks, schools, etc just didn't emphasis the atrocities as much as it did with the Nazis. With Germany there was more of a clearer &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; in terms of visual and audible references. With Japan is was less distinctive in the first place, at least to the West and the &quot;after&quot; wasn't THAT much more different in presentation. I hope I'm somewhat understandable here.  Because the distinction was more ambiguous for Japan, the message about them being &quot;not evil&quot; had to be more prominent (and the bad not acknowledged). </p>

<p>Exactly right. It typically takes a protest on the part of Germany or Israel letting them know it's not considered appropriate to get it taken down.</p>

<p>Not so much swept under the rug as not brutally seared into the public memory by generations of occupation and education. We never really 'occupied' Japan as we did Germany. Japan was told what to do after the war and it did it, Germany was ruled and policed by allied forces for a generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there was a Japanese government during that time. State governments existed in Germany after a year or so, but the governments of East and West Germany were only established in 1949. Until then, Germany as a whole was directly ruled by the Allies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true to an extent, but the scholarly consensus in Japan was always in favour of acknowledging the events at Nanjing. It was never something that was deliberately brought up, but wholesale revisionism was frowned upon. That's starting to change now, with the rise of the right in Japan, and larger groups are starting to essentially don the clothes of denialism. It'll be interesting to see if the mainstream buckles under pressure.</p></div>		</li>
