<p>There were a few kids from my middle school who went to different high schools, and a few kids at my high school who came from different middle schools than everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to an arts magnet elementary school and it was great. We had school wide &quot;town meetings&quot; ever week where a certain class performed a skit of some sort. We had a &quot;magic box&quot; where people would submit essays and artwork throughout the week and they would pick the best one. We also had &quot;hotspots&quot; which were different clubs you could join that did activities for a half a day every other Friday. For example, mine was the community service one so we'd go to a soup kitchen and help out there.</p>
<p>Overall I really liked it. At the end of the day, our curriculum was pretty standard; still had to do standardized tests, normal classes, etc. but it added enough variety to school and made it fun and engaging.</p>
<p>My class was the only one to go K-5 and the school is now closed. To this day, a lot of my friends are ones I met there, and I think a large part of it was the sense of community our school had, instilled through the arts magnet program. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This not the case in all places anymore. Many public schools in my area have &quot;rebranded&quot; themselves as magnets. Some places I've heard of all public schools becoming &quot;magnets&quot;. </p>
<p>A magnet school means it is open to students from outside the traditional district. In some urban areas, it is open to any student in the city. Other places mix urban and suburban students in predetermined percentages. The original idea was to being students with common interests together into learning communities. With their success, though, came more interest and more money. Now it has expanded to the point where there are plenty of openings at Magnets and students don't have to maintain any behavior or academic standards to attend.</p>
<p>Another issue is that while each does have a theme, but students generally apply to every one. This has led to students with no interest in the arts being at the Performing Arts magnet (which has negatively impacted those who went there for the arts...) or students who are strong in Language Arts ending up at a STEM school.</p></div>		</li>
