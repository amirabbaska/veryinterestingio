			<div class="markdown"><p>So would you poop it all out, or would it start coming out of wherever it could, considering that a shitload (heh) of your body is actually bacteria? For some reason, I have a vision in my head that someone would basically just start leaking until their kidneys fail and I have no idea how reasonable that imagining is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body's white blood cells, and in particular,  your macrophages (a type of white blood cell), attack infectious bacteria and other agents by swallowing them. It happens constantly in your body. A whole bunch of dead bacteria would mean that it'll happen a little faster since those bacteria will stop reproducing. Those macrophages are then eventually filtered out of your blood and pooped out. </p>
<p>Fun fact: the reason your poop is brown is because it's full of dead red blood cells that were filtered out by your liver. Without them, your poop is actually green.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So... does this mean black licorice doesn't absorb dead red blood cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last number I saw was 10:1 non-human to human cells, but something like 1 to 3 percent of total mass. A typical person probably has 3 or 4 pounds of bacteria in them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother in law had Clostridium difficile infection following a long run of antibiotics to treat a rather nasty upper respiratory infection. It was not pleasant for her, they tried treatment but it was pointless. Endless diarrhea, exhaustion and risk of dehydration being just the beginning. In the end she got a fecal transplant from her husband, they say this is best as diets are similar and they live together so bacteria in there is similar. Within a day or two she was 100%, amazing how something as simple as shoving someone else's poop in there can make all the difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is. We underestimated for a long time just how important those bacteria are. And now there are studies being released tying poor fecal bacteria diversity to conditions like obesity, depression, and anxiety, conditions that were always thought to be psychological.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In particular, Staphylococcus epidermidis, perhaps the most abundant bacteria on the skin, is one of these bacteria. One recent study described its removal like this: &quot;The removal of S. epidermidis (i.e. through overuse of topical antibiotics) may be detrimental to the host for two reasons. Firstly, removing S. epidermidis eliminates the bacterium’s endogenous antimicrobial peptides, allowing potentially pathogenic organisms to colonize the skin more effectively. Secondly, without bacterial priming of the skin, the host may be less efficient in warding off infection. In this light, S. epidermidis may be thought of as a mutual, thus, adding to the human innate immune system.&quot; Study here Bacterial priming is similar to what happens in the intestine, where the presence of generally good bacteria boosts the immune system so it can respond more quickly to bad bacteria.</p>
