			<div class="markdown"><p>Octonions don't represent 7-dimensional rotations. To represent rotations in d dimensions you need d(d-1)/2 real numbers (one angle in two dimensions, three angles in three dimensions, etc.). In 7 dimensions you need 21 angles, and octonions don't have 21 components. Also, products of rotations in any number of dimensions are associative, and octonion products aren't, so they can't work even if they have enough components.</p>
<p>You can get a nice representation of rotations in any number of dimensions, which includes the quaternions as a special case in 3 dimensions, from even-graded Clifford algebras. The number of components doubles every time you add a dimension, so in 4 dimensions you have an 8-component object, but it's not the octonions. It is (surprisingly) isomorphic to two independent copies of the quaternions.</p>
