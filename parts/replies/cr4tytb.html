			<div class="markdown"><p>i know you are joking with me but algea based fuels can be made
relative easy in a production facility.</p>
<p>The problem is the enormous scale you need to have to take over a world wide system . the tech to keep it working on such a scale is just not there yet with out massive funding from the all governments world wide and even then it will run costly for car drivers.</p>
<p>algea bio diesel goes for 33 dollar A gallon right now. not barrel a gallon </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that the biggest obstacle is that of scale. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.algenol.com/" target="_blank">Algenol</a> is currently producing fuel for ~$1.30/gal. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Biofuels.aspx" target="_blank">DARPA</a> has claimed that they are approaching $1/gal algae biofuel costs. </p>
<p>Even if these are exaggerations, I'd say algae biofuel on a large commercial scale is only about two decades out. The funding is already there and working on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not all <em>that</em> far off from the current price of diesel in some areas. </p></div>		</li>
