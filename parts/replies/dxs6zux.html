			<div class="markdown"><p>I always found it odd that when you're sad, sometimes you feel better knowing others have it worse, while other times it doesn't make you feel better because you just want pure sympathy. The kind of sympathy that says &quot;your situation is horrible!&quot; sometimes feels cathartic.</p>
<p>Could never tell when it's either, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going through a slight depression, and I kind of pulled away from my friends a bit; they noticed. At some point we were going to an event in another state, and we were going to get a ride from someone; they flaked out. My friend was so angry and somehow that made me able to push aside what I was feeling and try to comfort him. You kinda reminded me of that with your post.</p></div>		</li>
