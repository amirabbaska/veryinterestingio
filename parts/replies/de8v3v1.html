			<div class="markdown"><p>I will admit there is a bunch of differences between the housing and student loan.
But even though this may be true </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas in 1980 college graduates only make 40% more than non-grads, today the number is around 85%.</p>

<p>If you completely saturate the market to where every job requires a degree and ever person has one then the ROI will not offset.
And you will be left with people with engineering degrees working at fast food places.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you please show your math?  This is a big claim that you haven't bothered to support, particularly given that the parent comment was challenging your unsupported assumption that a bubble exists in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will admit the initial question did make the presumption that there was a bubble which was my fault for not wording it better.</p>
<p>However, there seems to be a trend that the markets are undervaluing a higher education:</p>
<p>35 percent of the job openings will require at least a bachelor's degree; 30 percent of the job openings will require some college or an associate's degree; 36 percent of the job openings will not require education beyond high school. (my popup blocker prevented me from the site FYI but the stats were on google)

<p>So if you go to school at around 40,000 a year and end up in lets say you only end up owing 40,000-60,000 back. Taking 40,000*3.5% year means about 116 a month just for interest. If you are in a job market lets say graphic design and make the average: 46,900 USD...</p>

No kids you could probably pay this off in several years if you made the average.</p>
<p>If you had 1 kid you couldnt even pay towards the principal.</p>
<p>Now if you take this use case and then added in the fact you are now competing with several other people that have gone into college for graphic design since we made it so you need a degree to be considered for a job.</p>

<p>mixed in with the above stats. It is highly unlikely you will pay your loans. Or if you do you will not pay them off till 15ish years from now. which you have to consider how likely you will make big purchases between that time (new car, house, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't we already doing this?  Meaning are people with advanced degrees not already working at McDonalds?  A former babysitter we used had a doctorate in something semi-obscure like French literature.  After we stopped using her (another story) I saw her working at Target.  To clarify she had the degree, not working towards it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting doctorate in &quot;something semi-obscure&quot; is like investing into a poor stock - you pay your money for little to no profit. I'd be more worried if engineers, doctors and other &quot;hard&quot; specializations started working in fast foods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It may have not popped because there may not be a bubble there at all. A bubble, by definition, happens when some good/service sees unsubstantiated and artificial increases in price, usually due to manipulation by financial markets. But the earnings premium for a college degree is higher than it has ever been before, and it continues to increase. source.</p>

<p>I work in higher ed at a tier-1 STEM University.  </p>
<p>Our grads are absolutely <em>crushing</em> it.  We can't afford to hire them to fill our own engineering positions, even.  We have to get older employees and drop-outs like myself instead!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Graduates from high-quality/more-prestigious universities are going to be hired first. That's not where you're going to see the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that you have tons of kids getting degrees from the &quot;other&quot; state schools, or &quot;other&quot; private schools. When it's time to apply for the relatively small number of entry-level positions, those 85% of grads who went through the theory-based program at <em>Middle State College of Texas at Smalltown, Podunk Campus</em> have no chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is the opposite of what I usually hear (especially on reddit). I was under the impression that college degrees were actually <em>less</em> valuable these days so people were not only paying much more but getting much less. Perhaps because so many more people get degrees it just really screws over the uneducated who probably used to be able to get more decent paying jobs. </p>
<p>Not sure, but interesting reads so thanks.</p></div>		</li>
