			<div class="markdown"><p>Trucker here - this is the core reason most do it. The a.c. doesn't work if the engines not running, and with the box already hot and 90+ degree temperatures, those emissions laws are actively harmful.
(The company really needs to spring for APUs, though.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of big companies do not allow APUs last time I was driving. Grounds for termination. I was reading some thread in response to this about the environmental effects and I can't be bothered to scroll down on my phone. People really don't realize that almost all trucks have clean idle now due to DEF which make emissions much safer than most gas vehicles. Also, most trucks now (at least the ones I've driven) are made to automatically shut down after 5-10 minutes of idle time while parked so a driver would have to put it into optimize idle to keep it from shutting down on them. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't they allow APUs? I mean I could see a cheap company might not want to buy them but why would they fire a driver if they were willing to bring their own or something?</p>
<p>Also wouldn't it cost less over the longer term due to less fuel use and less wear on the big, expensive engine?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesnt even seem possible to you that someone could have a valid reason to be annoyed with an environmental stance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>locomotive engines are a nightmare to restart if they stall, I live in a town at the top of 17 mile 3% grade hill and every once in a will a train will stall in or just out side of town, it take a crowd of tractors and trucks to restart the engine, they have fuel trucks to top off the tank and portable generators to give extra power to the starter, and glow plugs. our town has a plan for if a train stalls and blocks 3 or more crossings in town. </p></div>		</li>
