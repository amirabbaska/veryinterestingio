			<div class="markdown"><p>That's approximately the timescale of the &quot;motion&quot; of electrons within an atom. In other words, it's the time needed for a nucleus to grab onto electrons and form a chemically stable atom.</p>
<p>If it doesn't live long enough to do that, the chemists don't want to call it an element.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something something and then you go up 8 elements and it's stable.  Then go up another 8 and it's stable etc.  And theoretically, somewhere around element 124 (or insert figure divisible by 8) there <em>should</em> be stability, but that we can't reach there to test it?</p>
<p>Or am I just making things up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are thinking of octets in terms of molecular orbital theory, so it has to do with electron orbital stability, not nucleus stability. The reason the &quot;noble gases&quot; are so unreactive and stable is because they have extremely stable electron configurations in their s and p orbitals. </p>
<p>Elements with full s and p orbitals (eight electrons) tend to be hard to ionize or react with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're thinking of either the octet rule (8 valence electrons improve stability) or the first 3 Noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) which are elements 2, 10, 18. The number of valence electrons help to determine how reactive an atom is and most atoms participate in bonding to reach a stable valence shell. The Noble gases already have a full valence shell, so they are almost completely unreactive in terms of bonding (especially the smaller ones). However, these can still experience radioactive decay. For example, Radon is a Noble gas and it's most stable isotope has a half life of 3.8 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason heavier elements are unstable is because the strong force (force that keeps protons in the nucleus) can't hold on to such a great number of protons, so it's unlikely a super heavy element will be stable </p></div>		</li>
