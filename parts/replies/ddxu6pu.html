			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If you look up a power curve for DC motors, you'll find input current (which is proportional to power at constant voltage P=IV) into the motor is also proportional to demanded torque. At stall, you're demanding max torque, but producing no output power at the shaft (it's not spinning). All of this energy goes into heat of the coils and casing of the motor   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's interesting that motors typically make peak power at half their max RPM (limited by the EMF feedback as the motor speed rises), but their max efficiency is usually closer to 90% of maximum RPM because the higher motor current means more losses from resistance in the coils.</p>
<p>For brushed motors there's an additional consideration about friction in the brushes but even those are more efficient at higher RPM. Most electric motors are geared down a lot for that reason (saves weight and power to use a smaller motor spinning faster).</p>
<p>Edit: This seems to have caused a bit of confusion. This is about <em>electric</em> motors only. Combustion engines are different, typically are most efficient at a low RPM because reciprocating engine losses scale with speed and intake airflow can often be better at filling the cylinder at lower RPM (part of why torque on gas engines falls off at speed.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically called locked rotor current. Your protective relays for large motors are set specifically to ensure locked rotor current trips the breaker prior to insulation damage occurring on the windings,  but are set high enough to handle short duration locked rotor current during pump startup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point working making about ICE vs Electric.  ICE produces zero torque at zero RPM. Electrics can produce full torque.  There are several positive effects for electrics because of this. 1) no need for clutch or torque converter.  2) better traction control. (actually this is because the torque curve on an electric is flat up to a much much higher RPM, ICE engines tend to produce more torque as they go faster, hence wheel slip at lower speeds is a positive feedback loop ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is quite a bit wrong with this post...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the torque curve on an electric is flat up to a much much higher RPM, ICE engines tend to produce more torque as they go faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true. The torque curve of an electric motor is a downward sloping line. Electric motors make less and less torque at higher RPMs (and as a result, make max torque at 0 RPM). </p>
<p>Combustion engines normally have a fairly flat torque curve past some minimum RPM, which might drop off a little up high. Turbocharged engines have much different torque characteristics. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>better traction control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason electric cars might have better traction control is because they are easier to control, and more responsive compared to a gas engine. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>no need for clutch or torque converter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, this isn't an intrinsic property of electric motors. The reason is because electric cars these days don't have a transmission, and therefore don't need a clutch/TC. There are a bunch of reasons why this is the case, but simply put electric motors have a much wider operating range than gas engines. For example one factor is spinning an electric motor at very high speeds is not detrimental to its health. Running a gas engine near redline all day long (regardless of load) is very bad for it. </p>
<p>In applications where maximum performance is required at all times (see Formula E, their cars use a 5-speed transmission), a transmission may become applicable once there are no other areas to improve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a motor you have one magnetic field following another magnetic field. As you put load on the motor, the angle at which the field follows the other becomes larger and larger. If the strain on the one that's following becomes too high, what will happen is a thing called &quot;slipping poles&quot;. Basically the main field makes another rotation before the field that's following has a chance to. This will keep happening and the motor will stop. When the motor stops spinning you'll also lose what's called counter-electromotive force which is just generator action in a motor which produces current in the opposite direction that you're applying current to make the motor run. This normally lowers the overall current in a motor so that it's able to run without it burning out, but once the motor stalls and current is still applied, you lose the CEMF and your motor wiring can burn up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detonation refers to a very specific (and usually catastrophic) event in the context of engines. The rules require &quot;accurate, in-depth&quot; explanations, so yes, this matters. It would be like answering a question about nuclear reactors vs bombs and throwing around the term &quot;critical&quot; incorrectly.</p>
<p>Engine combustion (in a non-diesel engine) is like lighting the corner of a piece of paper. The paper burns from the corner and progresses across the rest of the piece of paper. In a non-diesel internal combustion engine cycle, the spark at the spark plug triggers combustion of fuel:air mix right at the plug. The combustion spreads through the rest of the chamber - a variety of factors such as compression ratio, temperature of the mixture, fuel:air mixture ratio, etc all determine how fast the burn happens - ie 'flame speed'. The point of combustion is called the 'flame front.'</p>
<p>Because the burn happens gradually, the total pressure on the cylinder head, gasket, piston, piston rings (and ring lands, which support them) and cylinder walls is within design spec, as is the temperature of the gasses. The ignition is also timed to start before the piston has reached the top of its stroke, but because it takes some time for the burn to happen, it matches the downward motion of the piston later in the cycle (and where the connecting rod has more leverage on the crank, generating more torque.)</p>
<p>In a detonation, the entire air:fuel mixture ignites all at once, typically when heat from adiabatic compression exceeds the ignition temperature of the fuel:air mixture. There is enormous heat and pressure generated because all that energy is released instantly. Generally, the cylinder head gasket is blown out (if you're lucky), or the piston or cylinder wall cracks, or the superheated gasses, under immense pressure, escape through the gap of a piston ring or tiny leak in one of the valves. In either cases, the gas is so hot that it melts the metal as it passes through the hole. It's also not uncommon for the piston connecting rod to bend, or shatter, from all the force.</p>
<p>&quot;Knocking&quot; refers to combustion that happens normally (ie the mixture is ignited in one spot and burns smoothly), but happens at the wrong time in the engine's cycle. Assuming it's not a problem with the ignition system - bits of carbon deposits and such in the engine cylinder are typically what initiate knocking; the mixture has gotten hot enough that the additional heat from that bit of contamination is enough to set it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating, thank you. It's the first I've heard of this phenomenon. Essentially, if I'm understanding correctly, detonation is the principle on which diesel engines operate, no? Compressing a fuel:air mixture past the point of spontaneous combustion?</p>
<p>What sort of malfunction would cause this in a gasoline engine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not correct. Diesel is by definition a direct injection engine. So no fuel air mixture ever exists in raw form. Air is compressed at a much higher compression ratio which increases its temperature. At the top of the compression fuel is injected. The air is hot enough to ignite it ... Hence why diesels do not have spark plugs (but one of the reasons why they are harder to start in winter). </p>
<p>In a properly designed gasoline engine this can work as well. A lot of new gasoline engines are direct injection </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually overheating. If your cooling system stops working for some reason, the engine gets hotter and hotter until detonation occurs. Then you have an expensive trip to the repair shop.</p>
<p>If your engine starts to overheat (most likely on a hot day stuck in traffic), pull over and call a tow truck. Do NOT try to 'limp it in' to garage to save a tow fee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on, my understanding from my combustion class is that <em>deflagration</em> is a subsonic flame front, <em>detonation</em> is a supersonic flame front, and an <em>explosion</em> is a simultaneous reaction. Therefore, diesel engines, which are compression-ignition are actually explosions, but I thought that spark ignition engines were actually <em>detonations</em>. Are you saying that they are actually really fast, but subsonic, <em>deflagrations</em>?  It's that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't taken a combustions class, but if my recollections of Urbanski is accurate that is correct. Gasoline ice is precise deflagration. Diesel is somewhat less precise explosions, although diesels from 2007 on are both more precise and more picky about what is in the fuel. Detonation is the supersonic shockwave, and the more common explosives need a boost from some type of cap to start their detonation (why C4 will burn without setting itself off). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A detonation differs from a deflagration in that at the moment of ignition the fuel separates into very small parts which instantly combine into different molecular forms.  This releases large amounts of energy instantly.  Explosives can be in a form that deflagrates, these are explosives that push, or those that detonate, these are used to shatter.</p></div>		</li>
