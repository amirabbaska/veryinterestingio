			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you need tor to access the dark web? I thought tor was just a tool to mask your identity online so you can't be so easily tracked or located. As far as I'm aware, you could access Silk Road without Tor. In fact, how would a website like that know you were masking your IP address?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A website doesn't usually know or care which IP adres  you use, <strong><em>you</em></strong> should care which you use. Using TOR  quickly leads to doing things that are illegal. Think drugs, childporn, hitmen etc. You don't want to get tracked doing those kind of things.</p></div>		</li>
