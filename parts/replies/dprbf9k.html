			<div class="markdown"><p>no problem. I used to think this effect was cool until I got used to it and also realized how lazy it was. There was an anime of a sci fi version of the Count of Monte Cristo from the early 2000s that made heavy use of this effect, if my memory serves correct. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stan was the first thing that popped into my head when I read the title :) They probably wanted to use a plaid jacket, stereotypical of salesmen, and used the effect as a parody on the afforementioned cartoons.</p></div>		</li>
