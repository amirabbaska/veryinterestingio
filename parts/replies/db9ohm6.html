			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I understand that, I understand the physical justification. I just referenced Feynman so that it can be known where I got my doubt from. My main doubt is mathematical. It's that e^-i∞ is defined whereas cos(inf) and sin(inf)  are not. </p>
<p>Second doubt:Isn't the electric field an harmonic oscilator in this case? As it varies by cos x? </p>
<p>EDIT: Thanx for going through all the effort of  writing out that long paragraph to clear my doubts though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Mathematically, none of these are defined.</p>
<p>But the process of integrating e^it as adding together a bunch of tiny e^it dt contributions can be visually understood as walking around a circle. So we know the integral is bounded by that circle, the same way integrating cos or sin is going to be bounded by [-1,1].</p>
<p>What Feynman is saying is that any justification for the terms becoming sufficiently smaller in the limit (either by decaying slowly enough or a having a higher frequency) will mean they tend to cancel out towards some value near zero. This is true for cos or sin as well. The idea is simply that the ups and downs of sin and cos, or the rotation of that complex number, will tend to cancel themselves out in the end, so they can be neglected if you have a good reason to assume that value is going to be zero.</p>

<p>This question is a bit weird. I would say in this context we should just say the charges on the plate are moving like harmonic oscillators. The field is just responding to that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically its that as both sin x and cos x are between [-1,1], as we go to infinity, we <em>could</em> say that the value averages as 0?</p>
<p>Thanx for clearing my doubt! </p>
<p>As for the harmonic oscilator, I was under the illusion that any value that varies as a sine or cosine wave is a harmonic oscilator. </p>
<p>Anyway, thanx a lot for clearing my doubt. I really appreciate it! </p></div>		</li>
