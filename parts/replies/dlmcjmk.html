			<div class="markdown"><p>In any type of power generation, you need power to make power. </p>
<p>With large wind turbines you'll need enough to pitch the blades to capture energy and thus spin. Apart from that you'll need energy to power the various instruments and systems that are required for operation. It's not necessarily a motor that spins it. The wind solely does that, but if wind speeds are low the turbine looses money if it is on stand by mode. </p>
<p>After reaching a certain rpm mark, you'll start making net positive energy and make money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The generator needs a minimum speed to start at, but I don't think anything attempts to propel the blade. It doesn't need your help, and you couldn't stop it if you tried. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can stop it, and it is done regularly when wind-speeds are too high. If the turbine spins too quickly it can literally explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure they have a way of stopping them.. like brakes, or rotation of the blades to make them catch more or less wind</p></div>		</li>
