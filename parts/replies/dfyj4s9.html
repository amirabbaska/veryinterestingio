			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Prevalent&quot; is a sliding scale. While the sequence may not be as widespread as some would believe, it shows up enough to be significant. You could measure ratios of tons of different attributes of organisms and come up with many different answers, but among the slew of results, the Fibonacci sequence would be in there multiple times. Enough to suggest a trend, at least.</p>
<p>The comment chalks it up to human pareidolia, and that is true to an extent. However, if research began to show another number - ANY number - that showed up in nature with the frequency that the Fibonacci sequence does, that would be deemed significant. The only difference here is that we have the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio to explain <em>why</em> we see this pattern.</p></div>		</li>
