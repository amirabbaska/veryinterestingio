<p>You should never want &quot;hate&quot; speech to be forbidden.  Who is decide what is hateful and what is not?  </p>
<p>Religion is nonsense.  Hateful or the beginning of an expression of an idea?</p>
<p>Islam is nonsense.  Hateful or the beginning of an expression of an idea?</p>
<p>The best response to hateful speech is additional speech - to illustrate what such speech is hateful, harmful, and should not be adopted by good people.  </p>

<p>&quot;...and child pornography.&quot;</p>

<p>Child pornograph, obviously, isn't speech - it's tangible evidence of a prior crime (e.g. statutory rape, sexual assault, etc) that cannot be created without victimizing a human, underage, person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By the very nature of protest generally, participants can very quickly enter the realm of hate speech or fighting words which, if not suppressed quickly, can lead to injury or loss of life. &quot;</p>

<p>What a horrible rationale.  By your logic, an outspoken critic of, say, the president of the USA could be jailed under the rationale that said person may &quot;quickly enter the realm of hate speech or fighting words which, if not suppressed quickly [by imprisonment] can lead to injury or loss of life&quot;.</p>
<p>It is unconstitutional to confine someone on the belief that said person <em>might</em> do something illegal in the future.  </p>
<p>Likewise, so called, &quot;free speech zones&quot; are unconstitutional, bullshit, and a threat to liberty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outspoken criticism, in and of itself, would not be grounds for imprisonment, obviously.  The degree to which such criticism incites, to whom it is directed, and the context in which it is uttered are all incredibly important factors.  Spouting off on Twitter to no one in particular would not be worthy of imprisonment.  Getting on a bullhorn and directing a heretofore peaceful crowd to pick up rocks and throw them at police officers might be, especially if the crowd follows through with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>Now, attending a protest and being immediately confined into a &quot;free speech zone&quot; because you <strong>might</strong> call for violence is bullshit, unconstitutional, and wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true- Drawings, hentai, and other things have been held to be 'child porn', when they (being fucking drawings! (ha- a pun!)) have indeed been &quot;created without victimizing a human, underage, person.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>What laws against hate speech are you referring to here? You refer to fighting words as a distinct concept, so I am not sure what prohibitions against hate speech you are referencing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought from the context that you were talking specifically about US law. I don't know of any hate speech laws in the US. </p></div>		</li>
