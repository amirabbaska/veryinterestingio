			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the specific chemical and how strongly basic it is:  it could irritate your throat on the way down, and not being as water soluble as the salt, it might not wash down off the throat lining as well, either.  In addition, a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkaloid" target="_blank">alkaloids</a> (morphine, quinine, etc) tend to be bitter as the free base, so the hydrochloride is just more palatable.</p>
<p>But once you've swallowed it, the hydrochloric acid in your stomach would get you right back to the neutralized form anyway, so your system would treat it the same after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can take some freebase chemicals and they do work.</p>
<p>For example, cocaine can be consumed as either a salt or a freebase.</p>
<p>The salt is what you chop into lines and snort. </p>
<p>Freebase is crack, which you can smoke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not all drugs are basic, some are an acid and must be neutralized with a base instead of an acid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are these indicated via some suffix that is analogous to the usage of -HCl? (E.g. are there drugs named AcidicMolecule-NaOH or similar?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they're generally named like a salt. E.g. valproic acid -&gt; sodium valproate. There may be other schemes. IANAPBAC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drug names don't follow standard chemical, <a href="https://iupac.org/what-we-do/nomenclature/" target="_blank">IUPAC</a> nomenclature, but here &quot;hydrochloride,&quot; as a word following the drug name, means a molecule of hydrogen chloride has been incorporated.  Specifically, the H^+ ion has transferred from the HCl to the amine, and the Cl^- that's left remains as the counter-ion, forming a salt: a positive ion-negative ion pair.</p>
<p>In the case of a drug neutralized with NaOH as you suggest, there would be no OH^- counter-ion hanging around, as it would combine with the acidic H^+ from the drug and just form more water.  So for the name, you would just have the name of the positive ion attached:  &quot;Sodium&quot; if you used sodium hydroxide.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin" target="_blank">Penicillin</a>, for instance, is acidic, having a carboxylic acid as part of its structure, so it is neutralized to form the potassium salt, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/penicillin-v-potassium.html" target="_blank">Penicillin V Potassium</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also seen drugs that followed a &quot;BasicMolecule-HCl&quot; naming scheme, but I was curious about how it would work in the other direction: what if an acidic drug was neutralized with a base? I just couldn't remember having ever seen a base used as a suffix. :-)</p></div>		</li>
