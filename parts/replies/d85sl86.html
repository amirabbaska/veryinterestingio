			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's a substantially larger number of nucleons, that'll make it harder to make almost by definition.</p>
<p>Increased stability means it'd probably be easier to detect <em>if we made it</em>, but that doesn't make it any easier to make (especially because the elements around it are drastically more unstable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the number of neutron rises non-linearly, so you can't just bang two ions of element 63 together, or 92 and 34, or similar - you just don't get enough neutrons. </p>
<p>Another strategy would be to start with element 94 or something and piling on with neutron-heavy ions, like Li-7 - but the intermediate products would be very unstable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magic numbers are to nuclei what noble gases are to atoms. Noble gases are very non-reactive because they have full outer electron shells.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons inside a nucleus live in discrete shells as well. Magic numbers are nuclear shell closures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are already lots of potential uses for short lived elements.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-industry.aspx" target="_blank">In industry</a></p>
<ul>
<li>flow tracing and mixing measurements in rotary kilns, blast furnaces, cellulose digesters, etc.</li>
<li>sterilization for medical supplies, bulk commodities</li>
<li>food preservation</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/radioisotopes-research/radioisotopes-in-medicine.aspx" target="_blank">In medicine</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnostic procedures including radioimaging need radioactive materials with short decay times so they don't remain in the body too long.</li>
<li>As a source for radiotherapy used to treat cancer and other conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull5-1/05105002426.pdf" target="_blank">Other uses</a></p>
<ul>
<li>detecting and locating leaks in water pipes and under-dam seepage</li>
<li>investigation of reaction mechanisms eg. copper-64 used to study the mechanism of browning in fruit.</li>
<li>tracer to monitor dispersal of cloud-seeding agents.</li>
<li>&quot;Activation analysis&quot;. An extremely sensitive analytical technique where samples are exposed to radiation from a short-lived isotope, which forms radioisotopes of the element(s) to be detected. These then decay, producing characteristic radiation that can be detected. Uses include quantitation of strontium in bone, impurities in metals, and in forensics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these are just some uses of <em>known</em> short lived isotopes. Any new element(s) stable for seconds or longer could potentially be used to improve any of the myriad applications we already have, or could be suitable for who knows how much else.</p>
<p>And as others have said, we'd learn a lot about nuclear physics even if these island-of stability elements were as useless as the millisecond-stable new ones discovered recently. Current theories disagree on the location of this &quot;island&quot; and how stable these elements will be. Any successful synthesis would immediately scrap some theories and inform others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To combine a number of answers and hopefully get to your question:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knowledge - Just because the more we know the more we have to work with and can make work for us. Many times we don't know what will be useful until many years later. Science and technology are littered with such examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience - Making these particles gives us insight on how to do these things. They are not always easy. The first computers were as large as rooms and weaker than our cell phones. But, through new technology <em>and</em> manufacturing, we can now make them much, much better than we used to. And perhaps it will bring a new method instead of the same old.</p>
</li>
<li>Theory - Science is (when done properly) about making observations, testing them, and making solid theories to explain them and doing it again to see if it still holds. Quantum Mechanics is some of the strangest physics. Note, it is not wrong, just strange to us. One of the ways to test the theories and make them better (or new ones) is to push the boundaries of the Theory. Super heavy sub atomic particles, Higgs, and heavy elements. All of these are examples. By understanding these better, we can make a Theory that better explains all the regular stuff too. And can do cool stuff, like semiconductors and perhaps effective quantum computers. </li>
