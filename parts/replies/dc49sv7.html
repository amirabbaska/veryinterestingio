			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great as far as it goes, but it isn't the whole story of why cars &quot;flutter&quot; primarily when one window is down. The whubbing/fluttering happens at a particular frequency picked out by the resonant properties of the car cabin itself.  You can test this by, for example, partitioning the car with plastic sheeting and foam core supports.  That changes the resonant frequency of the cabin without affecting the shape of the car body.</p></div>		</li>
