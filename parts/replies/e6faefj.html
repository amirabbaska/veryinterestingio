			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. If you've ever felt paper in thank you notes, you'd notice that it's sturdier, and isn't limp. This is heavier paper, in terms of the pound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It matters when determining what you can do with the paper. Water color paper is usually around 120-150 lbs because you need really thick paper to absorb all that moisture without falling apart. But if you're doing origami, you're going to want really thin paper as you can't fold thicker paper much. So paper weight gives you an idea of whether or not it's going to be suitable for your specific project. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its sturdier and also better for when using a lot of ink in your print. Like the basic 20lb paper is got for text docs but if you try to print something with a lot of ink like a full page flyer or picture it would get all sloppy and wrinkled but if you printed the same thing on a heavier paper it would look much better. </p></div>		</li>
