			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as far as I know, the scene seems pretty accurate, with them having a set of &quot;signatures&quot; of relative abundances of impurities and isotopes associated with each manufacturing facility within the US, and then checking against them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I went to a session at APS by the guys that were in charge of organizing this. Very interesting talk, all about the situations in which this approach fails. (Sadly, it's long enough ago I remember very few details.) We have a book, essentially, containing signatures of almost all bomb-capable nuclear material produced in the world, precise enough to accurately determine exactly when and where any material used to make a bomb comes from. Unfortunately, there is significant trade across poorly-secured borders that would make it difficult to say what group was responsible for the weapon if, for example, we found that the nuclear material came from a former Soviet republic. (A number of former Soviet republics &quot;lost&quot; nuclear material in exchange for payments from unnamed organizations in Africa and the Middle East.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must be pretty sensitive and taken incredibly seriously too. I have to carry papers around after radio active treatments. Even after tiny amounts like 10 micro-curies I get pulled to the side at boarders or airports up to 3 months later. I asked the airport guys if they know I'm radioactive when I go through the screening line and he said &quot;we know radioactive iodine 131 is in the parking lot-before you get into the airport.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then you could thwart that by obtaining and using material from multiple sources?</p>
<p>EDIT: Obviously you would have to deal with the difficulties of actually <em>getting</em> material from more than 1 place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we'd probably be able to figure out most nation-states refinement techniques. We're probably aware of most, if not all, nuclear-capable countries refinement operations. We figured out Iran's centrifuge's and enough to put a virus into their air gap protected systems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this... In OP's case we'd be able to collect soil and air samples directly at the site of the blast. </p>
<p>For tests like DPRK, we rely on samples of air from flyovers and the CTBTO's network of stationary gas and particle samplers to do any sort of analysis, which makes it a lot more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a long time the US monitored the reactor loading, operational period, fuel re-arrangement and unloading using IR signatures and other externally visible signs of operations on foreign government reactors. Based on a model of the fuel rod geometry, type of fuel and presumed fuel rod rotation, they could predict the isotope mix that would be produced in the fuel. There may be other sensors that could also be used. I used to work with a US Navy radiation physicist. He told the story of the cruiser he was on passing within a few miles of a fast attack submarine where he knew one of the senior officers. Using the instruments they had on board the cruiser, he could tell the sailors had loaded their nuclear tipped torpedoes such that pairs of warheads were side by side (regulations call for them to loaded alternating so adjacent torpedoes had only tails next to tips). Remote sensing could tell from the neutron energies how close the warheads were and how many were adjacent. In any event, all this is to say, at one point the US had databases of all batches of nuclear fuel generated from reactors. However, countries like NK, Iran, Pakistan etc have been building their plutonium generating reactors underground. Sometimes we don't even know they're there. In those cases, it becomes more difficult to gather the history on the reactor to build a signature on the fuel it produces</p></div>		</li>

<p>We assume they mostly researched HEU and in the case of NK, a defector even said that they completely switched to HEU for bomb cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not implausible that neutrons could pass through such a distance of water and be detectable miles away? Neutron emissions are significantly attenuated through even a foot of water so surely you’d be hard pressed to detect anything even if you were right over the sub.</p>
<p>Also, what’s to stop a nation state doping it’s fissile material to give the wrong signature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron have a relatively short range especially in water, so you wouldn't detect any neutron comming from a submarine. </p>
<p>You can detect neutrino from a nuclear power-point but neutrino are very unlikely to be stopped by matter (that's why they cran travel long range) therefore it's very unlikely to trap them in your detector.  Most likely you won't get any usable information from it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they have such a great degree of sensitivity how come other countries don't detect our nuclear submarines that are patrolling the ocean.  They go to a great deal of trouble to be quiet with anechoic coating, damping reactor sound, special engine screws, even mounting stuff on rubber washers all so they can't be heard in the ocean.</p>
<p>In fact, I thought it was a great deal of pride that they are like &quot; black holes&quot; in the ocean and have rarely been detected even by our own advanced systems.</p>
<p>Is all of that just unnecessary because they can detect nuclear material from far away? A ballistic submarine would have even more and larger amounts of nuclear material. </p>
<p>I'm not saying you are wrong or I don't believe you.  I just don't understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or is the op just referring to nuclear torpedoes (which I hope aren't still in use)? For a regular nuclear submarine, if you could detect any atoms and other nuclear bric-a-brac, then wouldn't that mean the reactor is not in a good state?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't really understand either though in the story the fast attack was on the surfacE and they knew exactly where to point the sensor. His point was they could get a lot of data from the neutron emissions from the locality of the warheads to each other, even with the background of the fast attack reactor, which itself had a complete different neutron energy signature</p></div>		</li>
