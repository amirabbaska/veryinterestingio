			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle, yes. But at the end of the day it's more important how much you eat than what. It you're having a calorie deficit over a longer time period you're not going to have big glycogen reserves anyway, no matter what kind of diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the keto diet for weight loss mainly because I'm just never hungry. It kills my cravings for snacks and booze. 99% of the time I cheat just to get a healthy amount of calories in a day. When I first started making a few keto recipes a day to test the waters, I didn't even realize I was only eating around 800 calories until I started seriously tracking my calories. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One of my favorite nutrition &quot;studies&quot; is the nutrionist who went on a twinkies diet and lost weight,  just to prove that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>But if you're still taking in heaps of calories from fat you can still be storing away fat even while you burn fat for energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Thats why in some keto groups the recommendation is to reduce fat macros after fat adaptation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what causes your body to break down muscle before fat when you're in a starvation state if it should just be breaking down fat during a calorie deficit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During periods of reduced caloric intake, the body must compensate for this lack of energy.</p>
<p>It does so by breaking down fats in adipose tissue and proteins in muscle tissue to be used in synthesizing glucose which is used for energy (this process is called gluconeogenesis).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are you saying one should make sure they are consuming extra protein if on a calorie deficit to ensure muscle tissue is not used?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't actually convert fats directly into glucose. Not just in the liver but in any part of your body. Your adipose tissue breaks your fat reserves and releases them into the blood stream. Other parts of your body can use them directly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. Your body is generally sparing of protein; it doesn't tear down muscles if calories are plentiful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body requires a certain amount of fats to function correctly. After that your body will begin to break down fat as a source of energy. Our bodies are designed to preserve a certain amount of muscle as well as fat in order to keep our organs functioning properly. Once fats, keystones, etc have been exhausted, it will begin to take energy from the muscles. It takes quite some time before your body will target muscle over fat if you are well nourished.</p></div>		</li>
