<p>the padding in Football adds to the violence and danger of the sport</p>

<p>In much the same way, modern boxing gloves protect the fighters' faces from superficial trauma but they allow them to throw a superhuman number (with superhuman force) of blows to their opponent's head.  Without gloves, boxers would suffer <em>considerably</em> less brain damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>had a boxer tell me once that gloves actually make the sport way more dangerous, because with bare knuckle fighters don't go for head shots as often because of the risk of breaking bones in their hands, and that boxing gloves really just like getting hit in the face with weights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. If you've ever actually landed a square punch on somebody, you'll know it <em>hurts</em>. It's not like punching a slab of meat. Bone is solid and the head is no exception. Boxers have suffered much more long lasting damage with in introduction of padded gloves, as backwards as that sounds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always thought that if they wanted to make football safer, lose the helmets and pads. </p>
<p>Of course the NFL will never do that because they can't have the actual faces of the players replace the team logo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know they used to play without helmets right? Once the forward pass was introduced there were several instances of death on the field from head trauma. There is no easy answer here. </p></div>		</li>
