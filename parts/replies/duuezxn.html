			<div class="markdown"><p>Brushing your teeth does also destroy the natural acid protection of your teeth. Drinking orange juice (sour things in general) directly afterwards is very aggressive on your teeth then, it actually dissolves them a little. This is why it is recommended to wait up to half an hour after brushing your teeth before you eat something again.</p></div>		</li>
