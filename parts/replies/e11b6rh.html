			<div class="markdown"><p>Came to comment to say exactly this. For Europeans all Thai or Japanese people may look the same. For them all European-looking people look very much alike.</p>
<p>However if you stay in Asian country for a long time you begin to see they ARE different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one of the classical Russian films there was a deleted scene: two main characters wait for the elevator. It arrives and inside there are two Japanese men. Identical like twins. They walk out and one tells the other &quot;God, those Russians are hard to tell from each other&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My colleagues were on a trip to China and they were constantly confused with each other. One of them is dark skinned, black hair dark eyes. He other light skinned, blonde hair, blue eyes. Still they couldnâ€™t properly tell them apart.</p>
<p>It seems the features one culture looks for in a face is different than what another culture looks for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. When I first moved to Japan I had a hell of a time telling some people apart. Years later the same people I look at and think, &quot;How did get you two mixed up?&quot; It's seriously something you learn.</p>
<p>I know I need more black people in my life because I'm still not great telling them apart a lot of the time. </p></div>		</li>
