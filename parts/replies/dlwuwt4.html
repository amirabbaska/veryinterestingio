			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sorry for the goof I've since corrected it. Unfortunately, many high level officers in government still get to keep their positions unless a scandal breaks. Typically, the sexual kind. Rarely do high level officials get fired for abysmal mistakes compared to ones in the corporate world. Bureaucracy wins and pitfalls sure but in this case, it's a huge pitfall.</p></div>		</li>
