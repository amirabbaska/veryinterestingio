			<div class="markdown"><p>Well one of the features of the universe is that it's surprisingly flat - that is, there is about the same amount of matter regardless of which way we look. That is the biggest clue we have that the universe underwent cosmic inflation in the first fractions of a second that it existed. Besides that, the cosmological horizon isn't a physical barrier; it's just as far as we can see because it's as far as light has been able to travel to us so far. There's more stuff beyond the horizon, and we keep refining how flat space-time is with more and more precise measurements and experiments, but we know right now that the minimum size for the universe is about 14 trillion light years (remember, the part we can see is only 93 billion light years) across, and it may be much larger than that.</p></div>		</li>
