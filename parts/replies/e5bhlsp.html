			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're interested, <a href="http://www.curiouscook.com/site/on-food-and-cooking.html" target="_blank">this book</a> has been considered the very foundation of the subject for decades and has been used as a textbook by food science courses in many universities. It explores common kitchen ingredients and procedures from a biology, chemistry and physics standpoint to tell you the whys and the hows  of cooking, sometimes debunking common myths (eg that searing &quot;seals in the juices&quot; of meat). While it is rooted in hard science and doesn't frown upon mentioning chemical and biological terms, that's the point after all, I think the book is quite accessible; the author, Harold McGee, is primarily a writer: even though he has some STEM background and definitely became an authority in this field, his Ph.D. was on the romantic poetry of John Keats.</p>
<p>All the book is remarkable and the chapter on meats will definitely help you make better BBQs (among other things), I know it helped me, but the first two chapters on eggs and milk and what you can do with them are truly fascinating to me: two things that looks so commonplace are in fact a marvel of nature when you learn what's inside them and how they work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, amazing. Thank you so much! I'll be sure to pick that book up. I'm just a hobbyist cook but I really love doing it even if I can't earn a living at it. Always good to learn expertise even if it's a home hobby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to that, there is also things like genoise (whisk whole eggs, flour for structure), and pate a bomb (I'm sure there is some accents in there, but don't know the keyboard shortcuts for them, whisk egg yolks, stabilize with boiling sugar, same as italian meringue but with yolks)</p></div>		</li>
