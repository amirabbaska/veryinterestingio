For people who were born blind and who will never be able to see, it would be their default way of perceiving the world, but for someone who has had all their sensory organs in order for their whole lives, this experiment could turn out amazing. It makes sense that their brains would be, perhaps temporarily, somewhat altered so that other senses could take over for vision. I wonder if you'll start seeing the world partially as it actually is, because you're used to seeing certain things when certain sounds are abound, for instance. </p></div>		</li>
