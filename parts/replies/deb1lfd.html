			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. But with numbers comes strength. Everybody is in that cave sleeping. If the wolves show up they are going to be outnumbered, and fighting in a disadvantaged position. Everybody would wake up and fight the wolves. Primitive humans likely went to sleep with the knowledge they may be called to fight, this would leave them well prepared to spring into action upon waking. I'm sure you know what I mean if you've ever slept in an uneasy state- you carry those directives with you.</p>
<p>Wolves aren't stupid, either. And they are pretty cowardice. We are not their preferred target, too likely to result in them dying -that's most predators, they'd rather go for something smaller, less dangerous if they can. They would be much more likely to attack the person/people who are out strolling through the woods where they can pick you off, and use their speed to their advantage, vs in an enclosed, fortified area. And since there would be plenty of easier targets chances are likely quite low they would attack the homestead.</p>
<p>Plus, who knows modern people utilize night watch guards when in dangerous situations. It's not unreasonable to think the cavemen would post up at the entrance with a spear</p></div>		</li>
