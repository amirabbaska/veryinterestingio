			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful and clear explanation of emotional strength. Nicely done. </p>
<p>For people who can't understand how emotions relate to understanding--an as a way to bring it back to biology--author Steven Stosny has <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/anger-in-the-age-entitlement/201408/are-we-being-ruled-our-toddler-brains" target="_blank">written brilliantly</a> about this. </p>
<p>The short answer is: the oldest, instinctual parts of our brains are the ones that drive responses like fear and anger and rejection. It acts a lot faster than the more recently developed and sophisticated part, that handles making up narratives (i.e., complex understanding). His writing refers to these as Toddler Brain and Adult Brain.</p>
<p>The super quick summary is: people are programmed to respond emotionally first via Toddler Brain--and then Adult Brain steps in to provide the justification. Hence, emotional strength and resilience are necessary to be able to handle challenging new ideas. </p>
<p>Just to take it a step further: this is why, even as a PhD scientist, I am immensely mistrustful of people who cling strongly to the identity as &quot;rational&quot;. Typically these people aren't capable of dealing with strong emotion and are simply trying downplay the importance of emotion. In reality, though, they're just as strongly emotion-driving as anyone else. The idea of &quot;rationality&quot; is used as a power play to avoid confronting what is emotionally upsetting to them--to disown their own fragility. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that reply and addendum with further reading. As a layperson I completely agree with your evaluation of the &quot;rational&quot; persona, and in my experience it seems people who devalue emotions are often struggling with something profound themselves.</p>
<p>Finding emotional &quot;balance&quot; of sorts is a challenge even in the best of circumstances, as many of us aren't lucky enough to have been blessed with an ideal, supportive environment growing up where we would learn to explore the full range of human feelings, stumble, fall and rise up again with the help and security of stable and supportive loved ones, ingredients that really seem to provide people with great tools for dealing with the world of complex emotions as they grow older. The best we can do is learn as we go and keep exposing ourselves to things that train our fight-or-flight response to calm itself in the face of new experiences.</p>
<p>Going into middle-age, I'm really learning the importance of our emotional selves, the pitfalls and the benefits of the deep, myriads of layers of our brain and how our thoughts and feelings work together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Emotional balance is important, sure, but my beliefs are more important to me, and they have a different process.</p>
<p>If I believe someone else believes something that leads to a bad place, and I think they're trying to convince me, I don't want to get tricked, so I only listen skeptically.  If they use terminology of arguments I've already heard and rejected, I stop listening.  If they use fresh arguments, I seek any logical flaws.</p>
<p>If it passes these initial tests, I actually examine my own beliefs.  In discussions with people I trust, I skip the full logical examination unless I hear something odd.</p>
<p>It's like factoring numbers in math.  Two out of every three integers is divisible by 2 or 3, so it would be silly not to check those first before dividing by eleven or seven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A true ELI5 response that makes killer points without sacrificing truth! I agree 100%. It seems that, over and over again, so much of the dysfunction we see in people can be traced back to root causes of persistent inner pain, trauma, and fear. Very few people just want to watch the world burn. It seems to me that most 'bad actors' are just lost souls trying to find a way to cope. Some cope by lashing out at others. Some cope by latching onto illusions that give them comfort whether it's drugs or deeply flawed, self-serving belief systems.</p>
<p>Being brave, being willing to face your pain and your fears (to exercise your emotions, as you put it) is often the only way you can move through these destructive behaviors and find peace. Ultimately, this is the only way I could ever move beyond my clinical depression. I didn't realize it until this comment though that the same tools I developed to face fear and allow myself to feel bad feelings are identical to the tools I used extensively to eventually liberate myself from many other broken belief systems I had adopted. Basically, like peace, it seemed the path to knowledge often had more to do with being brave than it did with being smart.</p>
<p>I want to echo a point you made though, about basically being patient with these people, just because I think that's so important. It would be easy to call these people emotionally/psychologically 'weak', but I've come to see that as very arrogant and wrong response. I don't think my emotional strength is a sign I'm better than others. Because I know I still led a fairly privileged life. Growing up, I had solid parenting, people weren't abusing me, I wasn't the victim of horrific violence, never had a friend murdered in front of me, I basically felt safe, I basically felt loved, etc. It's true that some people are more resilient than others, but some people, especially when they are young, can accumulate emotional debt so fast that we can't reasonably expect them to find a way to accumulate the tools necessary to process their grief, bitterness, and pain in a healthy way. Even as adults, when the trauma is long past, and even when they know it's time to move past it and this is what is holding them back, it can take a looooong time to unwind all the difficult knots and get better. It's easy to get impatient when we superficially see such self-destructive beliefs and behavior. But it also seems that the more you get to know people the more there is going on underneath the hood than meets the eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Being emotionally strong!= being better than others. If you're familiar with Buddhism at all, a good way to remember it is the further one gets on the emotional journey, the more <em>humble</em> one actually becomes. Because as you understand and face your own emotions you develop and strengthen your <em>empathy</em> and thus understand your fellow man as well, and this leads to less of a &quot;Me vs you&quot; or &quot;me above you&quot; mentality and more of a &quot;we are one.&quot;      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that you can change peoples beliefs, it just takes a certain approach. The response, I believe, is fear based, and just like overcoming any fear, it takes repeated exposure and an environment that is safe. It is much easier to change someone's beliefs if it is done in a way that is nonjudgemental, nonconfrontational, and provides them a way in which they won't be criticised and will save face than if you come at them in a way that is challenging.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is if the person is alone. If there is a large audience, [like on Reddit] is there a good approach for hateful ideology i.e. frank Nazi ideology, or something that originated from Stormfront and is pretty much a treatise on why this or that race/culture must be destroyed or imprisoned/forcibly removed?  It seems that if this is being broadcast to 12 olds through 22 years old [a large part of the audience] and that age range does not like reading a calm, cool, and collected, several-paragraphs-long reply that does not have a TLDR at the bottom or top.  It seems to me that this needs to be something that does not spare the feelings of the Nazi/Stormfronter.  </p></div>		</li>
