<p>An inconsequential technical point: the velocity distribution is normal (what I'd call a bell curve). The distribution of speeds is a polynomial times a gaussian, so I'm not sure if we should call that a bell curve or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dumb question; totally natural for people who don't do physics every day. </p>
<p>The velocity of a gas molecule defines what direction it's going in and how fast. The speed of a gas molecule just defines the how fast part. </p>
<p>Why does this matter for how we describe gases?</p>
<p>In the ideal gas model (without gravity), all of the molecules are moving around randomly. There are a bunch going left, some others going right, some going down, etc. And if you start counting up how many are going all the different directions and graph it, you find that on average all the movements in different directions cancel out; there's just as many going away from you as toward you, on average. Note that implicitly there for a velocity, if you take a guy going right and a guy going left and add the two velocities together, they partially (or completely) cancel. So what you get out of your counting is a distribution of velocities that turns out to be a gaussian (normal distribution, bell curve) centered on 0 velocity (no net flow of gas, on average).</p>
<p>Do the same thing for the speeds and you get a slightly different answer. If what we're counting up and averaging is how fast each molecule is going then <strong>there's no cancellation anymore</strong>. If the one guy is going left at 10 mph and the other going right at 10 mph, the average of the speed is 10 mph (not 0, like it would be for the velocity) because we don't care about the direction for speeds. So then you do the same process as before and you get a shape which is not the standard gaussian (normal distribution, bell curve), but is similar. It's a quadratic polynomial times a gaussian. The average speed is not 0, it's something else that depends on the temperature.</p></div>		</li>
