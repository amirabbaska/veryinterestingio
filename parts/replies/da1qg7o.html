			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you can see quite a few people here haven't been through quakes like this. </p>
<p>I live in Chch too, was here for the Sept &amp; Feb and now Nov quakes. Have a much better appreciation for 'magnitude, depth, distance' when it comes to earthquakes now (not to mention what sort of land you're standing on after having seen liquefaction take place first hand). I think the vertical acceleration was really high due to being so close to the city. Something like 2.2g into concrete structures... I get the feeling most buildings are designed to sway, not bounce...</p>
<p>Everyone can talk about massive earthquakes &amp; what not (admittedly it IS what OP is asking), but the right &amp; depth place for a relatively small quake can be much more devastating than a much larger quake that's deeper. </p>
<p>People look at to Haiti for the devastation caused, but their building codes are not really on par to what we have here in NZ. A relatively small 6.3, but shallow, nails most of the CBD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comparing the NZ and Haiti earthquakes really shows the importance of building codes, as well as demonstrating that it's incredibly hard to guess how damaging a quake will be just from size alone.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vertical acceleration from the  6.3 Chch earthquake was especially intense because of the local geology - the waves hit the hard rock of the surrounding volcanics, and when reflecting back created a positive interference of waves near the city which amplified the damage done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think there's a similar explanation for the more severe damage and shaking in the CBD/port are in the recent Wellington quake from reflections off the hills around the harbour? Or is that more to do with the port being built on reclaimed land?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly does ye're city prepare for these earthquakes? Do ye have regular EQ emergency drills in work or in schools? Or are there just general guidelines like take cover under a table? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are building codes, IIRC buildings a supposed to let theirr inhabitants survive up to a 9.0 quake. There are also drills at schools and workplaces, usually hunkering under the table until it ends, then going to a marked area outside in an open area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, best way to prepare is to ensure that most of your buildings will be standing at the end of it (e.g. good building codes and practices). That's where the vast majority of casualties came from, is building collapses (Except in the Sept 2010 earthquake, 1 guy died from a heart attack I believe, but that was probably going to happen anyway).</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's just the usual: Get under a solid desk or similar, wait it out. For us there's also the risk of a tsunami, so get the radio on ASAP and tune in. Problem is we really has a radio these days? We have some stations on the TV, but if the power goes out and telecommunications drop like it's done previously, you could have a problem. Emergency kits are necessary I guess.</p>
<p>Oh and keep lots of food and water on stock. You could be out of power and sewage / water for a while (some places in Christchurch were without either for a few weeks)</p></div>		</li>
