			<div class="markdown"><p>The key is to make them fall asleep in the noisy environment, if you're used to the noise when you fall asleep, that same type of noise will not alarm you while you're sleeping. If you fall asleep in dead silence, pretty anything can make you wake up.</p>
<p>This applies to adults as well, then of course it's changing a bit from person to person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to say though because our son is a bit weird with sleeping. We have a noise machine for him and he has slept like a champ since he was a month old. </p>
<p>We one had lightning hit less than a mile away, whole house shook and he didn't even stir. </p>
<p>However he was napping once at my parents and a neighbor shut a car door pretty loud and that woke him up. I think he sleeps heavier at night than naps, but it's still odd. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has to do with which phase of the sleep cycle they are in.  Babies cycle faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the volume of the noise, if it's a noise that they're not used to it may way also wake them up. </p>
<p>And with the lightning, it could just be that he was in the deepest state of sleeping when it struck, and perhaps while napping in the day he doesn't ever reach that state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did exactly this. Our newborn slept in a crib in the middle of the living room, and we watched TV shows at full volume while she slept. Left the blinds open for full light and everything.</p>
<p>Two years later and she now sleeps through anything. I can literally walk into her room in the night and shine a torch on her to see if she's okay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the same thing apply with how bright it is? Because my younger brother can fall asleep no matter what. Meanwhile I can't have so much as a candle lit in the room across the hallway or i can't sleep.</p></div>		</li>
