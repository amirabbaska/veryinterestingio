			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right about HIV not having a chance of being airborne. To me that’s the one silver lining of HIV—it’s an extremely frail virus and only survives literally seconds after being exposed to air. So the chances of becoming infected with it in any other way besides sex or using infected needles are almost non-existent. And those are things one has control over.</p>
<p>Even coming into contact with HIV infected blood is not that risky—not that I’m advising anyone to not take precautions—but I once read an HIV expert say that the only way you could potentially contract HIV by touching infected blood is that you would have to have an open wound of some kind and the infected blood would need to come directly out of someone’s body and right into the open wound in a very small window of time. </p>
<p>But if you just touch blood, it’s almost certain that the virus is already dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% correct. There's a lot of disinformation on this thread. Handling bushmeat does not strike me as a likely transmisison vector. Bestiality occurs in every country in rural areas, even Europe and the US. It isn't a racist implication to suggest this was a <em>possible</em> transmission vector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s true. I feel like people are probably just really uncomfortable and grossed out over the idea that it was initially contracted that way, but hey, as you said, it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bushmeat strikes the scientists who researched this as reasonable, why do you think they are untrustworthy on this matter?</p>
<p>The fact of the issue is, the penetrating partner is <em>massively less likely</em> to receive aids than the penetrated partner. So unless you think some guy in Africa was convincing a monkey to cum in his butt, eating and being exposed to uncooked blood has a significantly larger probability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question.  If it can’t exist in the open air, why doesnt surgically opening a person for a few minutes or hours cure them?
Edit: or something like cycling their blood through some kind of air chamber before re-placing it in the body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Opening&quot; a person on that scale would kill them, as would removing their blood and treating it in such a way.</p>
<p>More fundamentally, viruses don't exist only in the bloodstream. They infect cells (which is how most of them deal their damage), so &quot;disinfecting&quot; the blood wouldn't help. HIV in particular can hide for years in cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because surgery doesn't expose all your blood to the air. If it did, you would absolutely die - and in fact even if you did that, established HIV infection hides out in long-lived white blood cells that aren't actively circulating.</p></div>		</li>
