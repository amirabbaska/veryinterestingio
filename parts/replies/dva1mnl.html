			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the missile, it may first acquire the target by radar so the system knows where to point the missile, but the missile is IR guided.  Most MANPADS have IFF built into them; if you're being interrogated the aircraft will let you know.  If you're being interrogated in enemy territory, it's usually a bad sign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not often at all... It's a huge waste of fuel. The GE engines were much more efficient than the Pratt &amp; Whitney, but you could still go 'bingo' pretty quickly in zone 5 afterburner. I'd say Mach 1.85 was my fastest run, and things happen very quickly. The faster you go, the lower your situational awareness and slower reaction time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you ever see any action? Also have you had the chance to fly any other fighter aircraft, and if so how do they compare to the Tomcat? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Maintenance Officer I would sometimes remove external stores from an aircraft that had not flown for long periods of time and had extensive maintenance performed so the Functional Check Flight pilot would not have to deal with them if something went wrong. We would have unofficial speed record runs during the engine portion of the check flight. On the F/A-18A the highest mach number we ever achieved was 1.76. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These days even in combat the tanks are rarely jettisoned. They are not inexpensive and there are not a huge number of spares kept on hand to do this as routine. The more common scenario is getting rid of the tanks when there is a mechanical problem with the aircraft or engine. Before modern digital cockpit displays showing what was loaded on each storage/weapon station in real time the pilots would notate on an index card on their kneeboard the load. In the heat of expending weapons occasionally the pilots would get confused and drop the tanks instead of or along with their munitions. You cant see the weapons stations from the cockpit of an A-4 Skyhawk.</p></div>		</li>
