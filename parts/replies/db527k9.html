			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you're looking with doesn't it? Perhaps it's the massive changes in sedimentary rocks because of massive changes in sedimentation as a result of humans seizing control of the world's rivers, lakes, and streams? Or perhaps it's the sudden abundance of chicken, cat, and cow fossils replacing animals like the woolly mammoth, giant sloth, and bison? Or maybe it's the tiny spherules of carbon embedded in the rock, a permanent smudge, like the spherules of carbon that tell us of the coal burning set off by asteroid impact some 66 million years ago? Those spherules are still here so I suspect the spherules from our incessant coal burning will still be here 65 million years from now if anyone is looking for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you would find very large layers of cobblestone, asphalt, concrete and other materials, which are not naturally occuring. You would probably find traces of plastics in sediments too. Also ice cores study would help, but who know if we would even have ice for those evidence to exist at the first place. But probably all those methods we use today for finding about climate and geology in history would be helpful to find about our destructive nature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not on a scale of millions of years I'm afraid. The oldest is in ice cores is a few 100k years old IIRC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on age of ice. In Antarctica there is high probability of 1,5 Ma old ice, therefore there could be drilled 1,5 Ma ice core.</p></div>		</li>
