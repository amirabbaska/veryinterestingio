That's not to say it can keep pace with consumption, but it means that 2/5 of what has been accessible until now is not the same as 2/5 of what will have been accessible by the time we consume those other 1.5 trillion barrels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the cool thing about biodiesel is that it is carbon neutral, and the problem with fossil fuel is that it is not. for instance, my aquaculture farm is looking at the possibility of growing algae for use as a fuel alternative. It turns out, algae is a very good material to make butanol out of, which can replace gasoline completely. The real positive, is that algae takes carbon from the atmosphere when it grows. When the gasoline produced from the algae is burned, it releases the carbon back into the atmosphere, without adding any more than what was present before the algae grew (so its carbon neutral), fossil fuels however release carbon that has been stored in the earth for millions of years, adding to the carbon in our atmosphere. this is the basic principal of climate change. In an ideal future, the climate is stabilized and we burn carbon neutral biodiesel, and keep the fossil fuel in storage, never to be used.</p></div>		</li>

If I understood your question, yes, anything that runs on those could also run on sufficiently refined oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean as a 'rainy day' source of energy, yes, in a way that will happen.</p>
<p>If you were following energy policy in the early 2000s you may recall the peak oil concept which suggested we would hit the max possible production capability of oil at some point and then that production would slowly drop off and we would have a pretty dark time ahead as we adjusted to the steeply higher prices for, well, just about everything. Fortunately the consensus is we will not really have this scenario because there is so much oil.</p>
<p>Take a look at this graph (search for 'oil cost curve' for more like it from other sources - this one just looked good to me but there are many more like it) <a href="https://exernomics.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ayres-future-oil-prices-fig-6.jpg" target="_blank">https://exernomics.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/ayres-future-oil-prices-fig-6.jpg</a></p>
<p>As alternate fuels hit the market they cause a drop in the price of oil. Anything above that price is not economical to produce so it stays on the ground for the time being. So you can think of anything on this chart which is above the current price of ~$50 as the 'rainy day' pool. It is technologically feasible to recover and it is not economical right now, but if something were to disrupt the energy balance and push demand for energy higher then these sources could become economical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it also depends on pricing too. If there's $100,000 worth of oil in the ground which would cost $100,001 to extract? To an oil company, there's nothing there. But if the price of oil doubles, there's something there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For those who might think this means we have lots left because we've been using oil for a hundred years, read a little about <a href="http://www.albartlett.org/articles/art_forgotten_fundamentals_part_4.html" target="_blank">population growth</a>, keeping in mind that consumption grows with population.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has less to do with population growth and more to do with infrastructure growth. More and more parts of the world are consuming fossil fuels. Either way, your point that most of that 1 trillion was consumed in the last couple of decades is the point of concern, and we continue to consume more barrels of oil per day every year.</p></div>		</li>

Even if we assume orders of magnitude reduction in oil use and significant technological improvement, the brute fact of exponential growth (about 7% per year) calculates total oil to be nowhere near enough in the next few decades. I.E. Due to population growth of oil consumers (people and businesses) the required oil production is nearing its maximum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hopefully cars won't even need conventional fuel for much longer. It'll most likely be a very long phase that will take decades (especially in developing countries), but I'm sure eventually all car companies will offer cheap electric models and therefore discontinue petrol/diesel ones. Electric vehicles will eventually dominate the roads, and from there on things will only get more efficient.</p>
<p>In the distant future it might even become illegal to drive anything with a conventional engine &gt;_&lt;</p></div>		</li>
