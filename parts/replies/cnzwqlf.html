<p>We have successfully eradicated Smallpox in humans and Rinderpest in livestock and have a handful of other diseases that we as a race are attempting to eradicate. </p>
<p>I also believe (but am not 100% sure) that there are plans to start the eradication of MMR in the foreseeable future. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are also allergy shots, meant to reduce the severity of your allergic symptoms by exposing you all year long to the stuff you're allergic to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>germ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is 'germ' a meaningful term these days? It feels like a pre-miscoropic term to describe viruses and bacteria. Is it still a valuable word for anyone under 70, or is it strictly a hold-over from days when conditions weren't well defined?</p>
<p>*edit: For example, my mom might say &quot;germ&quot;, but I'd more likely say &quot;bacterial infection&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use the term germ when I'm talking about an unspecified infectious agent, like becteria, virus, fungus or microscopic parasites. Vaccines protect against both viruses and bacteria so typing germ saves a hassle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it is still &quot;germ theory&quot; so it is still useful as an all encompassing term.</p></div>		</li>
