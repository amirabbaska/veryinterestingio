			<div class="markdown"><p>I interviewed for a project manager job on the NOAA GOES-R weather sat. I got to see the overall block diagram for the data/comm system. They were going to have 3 ground stations and what surprised me was that they would send the data down to the ground computers, then uplink for rebroadcast to the other ground stations. So besides being a weather sat, the satellites were also built as their own communication satellites.</p></div>		</li>
