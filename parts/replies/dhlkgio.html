			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be interesting to see an accurate breakdown.</p>
<p>On its face, the net gain of tax revenue by red states looks hypocritical. An accurate breakdown, and perhaps a comparison with some factors omitted, might be enlightening.</p>
<p>I live in the bluest state of all, and we definitely send more to DC than we get back.  We have our share of defense contractors, a local landscape supply company now resides in a building once used by the company that makes Patriot missiles.  For years there was a turned metal nosecone on the counter near the cash register that had gotten left behind.</p>
<p>I don't begrudge tax money to other states with populations in need of a hand.  But don't cut the hell out of every helpful program at the local level to keep taxes abnormally low and rely on federal handouts to keep people from starving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state" target="_blank">This wikipedia page</a> breaks down retirement and other (non-retirement spending).  There's a similar one for income (unfortunately it doesn't break out retirement taxes).  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is flat-out wrong.  Urban and even suburban areas have the highest densities of &quot;families.&quot;  <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/polls/2004-08-25-female-vote_x.htm" target="_blank">The real issue here is that urban spouses are more likely to work outside the home and be more familiar with &quot;bread and butter&quot; issues</a>.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While California is &quot;red&quot; even if LA and SF are nuked, California republicans are too sane to have elected someone like Jeff sessions as senator. </p>
<p>For example, my city's mayor is a gay Hispanic immigrant republican. I doubt that would fly in red Mississippi. </p></div>		</li>
