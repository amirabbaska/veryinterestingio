			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. However, real world emulators are often not perfect compared to native hardware. Has it been proven that theoretically a perfect emulator could always exist for any software running on any hardware? Or perhaps there's a kind of &quot;incompleteness theorem&quot; equivalence saying that for any emulator, there may be a sequence that the emulator may not be able to emulate perfectly?</p></div>		</li>
