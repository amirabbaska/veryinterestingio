			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. However I am on Strattera, which is actually <em>not</em> a stimulant, but a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) and I actually get a tremendous benefit with respect to focus and follow - thru. So it's more complex than just dopamine. That said, I've also been on stimulants like Adderall and Strattera doesn't even come close to the effectiveness and &quot;kick in the ass&quot; those medications have in terms of motivation and work ethic. But everyone is different. Having said all of this, the side effects of Strattera suck and I have found stimulants don't have many, provided you're healthy and eat right. They do tend to make it harder to eat for some people. Being a stimulant, they can also tax your heart. Many doctors now have patients get EKGs prior to prescribing stimulants. However assuming you're healthy their side effect profile is usually pretty good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the pharmacological definition, no. Functionally - eh. Increasing the amount of the stimulant available yes, but it doesn't in and of itself stimulate the relevant receptors when the body hasn't done so. </p>
<p>Stimulant enhancer would be more functionally accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a stimulant because it doesn’t stimulate the receptors, the dopamine stimulates the receptors. All this does is doesn’t allow your body to go through reuptake with the dopamine leaving more dopamine in the synapse for your receptors to use again. </p>
<p>So by definition it is not a stimulant.</p>
<p>Psilocybin is a stimulant because it stimulates the seratonin receptors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The typical ones associated with many medications, like dry-mouth and occasional fatigue. I don't have any abdominal/eating/digestion side effects, so that's good. However by far the worst is the sexual side effects. I still am super horny (like I normally am), but it's much more difficult to get and maintain an erection. Not only that, but sometimes orgasm is just downright painful. Apparently, norepinephrine affects the prostate, so some people have this as a side effect. For obvious reasons, being a 30 yo healthy male with painful sex is not something I really look forward to, and I am taking myself off of Strattera soon. But Google 'painful sex on Strattera', and it's definitely a known reported SE. Some people say it gets better with time. I don't know. It's a shame because like I said, the drug does work. But the side effects, probably not worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating.  As someone with ADHD Undifferentiated (still don't know the explanation but was told it was sort of the opposite of hyperactive,  I'm curious if this natural state of having low dopamine makes activities such as video games which play heavily on reward centers that much more potent or if there is a connection there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Notice a tendency to play extreme/intense games or listen to intense/extreme music?</p>
<p>Similar to procrastinating writing a paper until the last night, more drastic scenarios and more intense inputs tend to reach deeper into our reserves and pull adrenaline and dopamine out in response.  The situation becomes more fight-or-flight.</p>
<p>Low dopamine also tends to make you feel sluggish, slightly bummed, and mildly irritable.  Rewards/achievements unlock dopamine, which is a rewarding feeling.  </p>
<p>The sense of winning that comes with accomplishment is something we (and people in general) is sorely needed in life generally and a helpful way to get out of a funk.  On Saturdays, my worst days, I often resort to cleaning or laundry because they require almost no concentrative ability.  </p>
<p>Video games can lead to similar reward feelings as accomplishment, but can be offst by realizing what was neglected during the time dedicated to them.  I love/hate video games for that reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with ADHD Primarily Inattentive (what you probably have if it isn’t hyperactive), yes, there is very much a strong connection. People with ADHD are also at a much higher risk of addiction.</p></div>		</li>
