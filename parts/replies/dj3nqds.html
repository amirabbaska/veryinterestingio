			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the cell walls are destroyed by ice crystals forming inside the cell and rupturing them. A single amylase enzyme is far smaller than a cell so it doesn't get pierced. For the same reason why you can drill a hole in a giant block of sandstone but if you try to drill loose sand the sand will get pushed out of the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the amylase will be destroyed in the freeze thaw because the formation of ice crystals can disrupt protein folding and cause the proteins to become denatured. This is why most enzymes are store in glycerol, so they won't freeze when placed in a -20 Â°C freezer. Most of the amylase will likely survive a single freeze thaw and be there to break down the starches, but those poor cell membranes are much more easily disrupted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that the cell wall is destroyed by the ice that's forming inside of it, like a glass jar full of water cracking inside a freezer. </p>
<p>Amylase is just a single protein. Much smaller then the cell walls that it would sit inside. It doesn't contain water that can break it up when it freezes. If it's not denatured, then it should keep working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the cell walls are made out of molecules and can be ripped apart and Amylase <em>is</em> a molecule and cannot as easily be ripped apart by mechanical processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Allergies are mostly responses to foreign proteins and freezing will not denature the banana proteins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I thought I'd add:
When ice crystals form, they tend to form in a way that leaves little space for diffused molecules, and as a result the water tends to push anything that isn't itself away from the center of the crystals. This includes the enzymes and starches involved in our reaction. If these molecules are closer to each other, they'll react more readily. As a result of the freezing/defrosting, nutrients will tend to concentrate together for a little bit, speeding up the ripening process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly but most enzymes require sufficient water to do their jobs. There is probably a sweet spot during defrosting where it is warm enough for the reaction to occur and it is still a bit more concentrated. </p></div>		</li>
