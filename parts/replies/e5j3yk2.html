			<div class="markdown"><p>Weren't swept wings already in widespread use in transonic fighters at the time (F-86, MiG-15), with the F-104 (which was more recent though meant for a different role) being the aircraft with a new unique design?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do! Although they are a trapezoid, the mean aerodynamic chord (basically the average between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is still swept backwards achieving the same effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically they are &quot;swept&quot;, or accomplish the same effect. The leading edges of their wings and the camber are still angled backwards steeply. Compared to a swept wing, the back of the wing is extended back to form a delta wing or a trapezoid either of which confer a number of aerodynamic and mechanical advantages.</p>
<p>Note that the F-104 actually came out after a number of swept wing fighters were introduced.</p></div>		</li>
