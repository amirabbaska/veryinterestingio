			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit more to this, it's not just that the smaller atoms are less stable and more radioactive, it's that their modes of radioactive decay involve the release of much more beta and gamma rays than uranium gives off.  Those beta and gamma rays require FAR more shielding than alpha rays require.</p>
<p>The storage methods for used nuclear fuel rods have to take both the shielding against beta and gamma rays into account, as well as the other issue with such radioactive material: heat generation.  If you've seen or read <em>The Martian</em>, you've got the basics: radioactive decay can give off heat.  Used nuclear fuel rods have so much radioactive material concentrated in them that they require constant, direct cooling for <em>years</em> before they can even be stored in just the air.  Without that cooling, the rods can melt themselves with their own heat and risk releasing all that highly radioactive material into the environment.</p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to add that there is a third issue with the products of uranium fission: they can be more chemically toxic than unused uranium fuel is.  The chemical behavior of some fission products makes them more toxic, or makes them bioaccumulate in the body in specific areas (and they will then radioactively decay there and expose those specific areas, too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it's a lot of heat from a storage point of view but it's not a lot of heat from a power generation point of view.
Additionally you'd have the problem of using mixed fuels with uncertainty in over how much power could be drawn from each rod making the reactor would be difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Not all of it is waste though, IIRC once it's cooled down a bit it's reprocessed and usable uranium is extracted along with other useful isotopes of other elements for medical uses and the like.</p>
<p>Many years ago I visited Sellafield and even got a bus tour of the facility. Fascinating stuff, it's locked down tight now though I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spent fuel pool heat loads rapidly drop to less than 5 MW thermal after a refuel outage, and continue to drop over time. </p>
<p>To utilize that heat you would need a pressure vessel, and now we are talking about ASME code boilers, emergency cooling systems, etc, all to get maybe 1 MW of electricity at best. It's not worthwhile. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, turbines get spun by fluid flowing through them--could be air in the case of your car's engine, could be steam in the case of the turbines used in electricity generating power plants, or it could be the liquid water flowing through a hydroelectric dam, but fluid has to flow.  These pools, if they have flowing water (I don't actually know anything about that engineering end of things), have to pump that water using external power supplies.  And the rods aren't hot enough to create sufficient steam to drive turbines--or else they'd still be in the reactors doing exactly that.  Maybe you could get some convection currents going from the warm water flowing into the cool water farther from the rods, but I'd be very surprised if you get anything more than small turbine turning potential from that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not quite true. It only takes a 3-4 months before the decay heat has decreased to the point where fuel damage would not occur under air cooling. It's just much easier to wait a few years for decay heat to decrease further before movement to dry cask storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true for BWR fuel. For pwr fuel the NRC studies say it will take 11 months. </p>
<p>Pwr fuel has drastically higher power densities, but smaller cores, compare to BWR plants. This also means the fuel rods have a higher initial decay heat per bundle and a longer time until that heat per bundle is low enough to allow for air cooling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do store spent fuel rods in water, usually on site at the power station until it is safe to ship out and store in a cave somewhere in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>As for why we don't use it for more power, it's called spent for a reason. It doesn't generate enough heat to be useful in an energy generating process (someone more knowledgeable should elaborate here).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is actually an <em>excellent</em> shielding material for beta and gamma rays.  I don't know what the /r/askscience opinion on XKCD's &quot;What If?&quot; series is, but there was an edition of that series that <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/" target="_blank">covers the subject of spent fuel pools</a> quite well, at least for the uninitiated.</p>
<p>And yeah, I suppose we could hook up thermocouples to generate electricity from the latent heat given off, but I have absolutely no idea how A) productive/efficient they'd be, or B) how well they'd stand up to those radiation doses (to get any useful heat they'd probably have to be pretty close--close enough that the water shielding effect is low).  I don't think the heat is high enough to create steam and drive turbines the way reactors typically generate power.</p>
<p>Water is such a good shield against radiation, though, that I've heard that a tour of duty in a nuclear powered submarine exposes you to less radiation than simply living on the surface at a regular desk job would give you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect there are.  I mean, you mostly can't run a fission reactor with uranium you take out of the ground because it's not radioactive enough.  You have to enrich it (concentrate it) to raise the amount of U235 in the mix.   </p></div>		</li>
