			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the big front wheel would flex quite a bit as you were going down the road which made them more comfortable to ride.  Once modern pneumatic (air filled) tires were invented it became possible to build a modern bike that wouldn't karate chop you in the taint every time you went over a little bump and they quickly took over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They mostly didn't have brakes, largely because of this.  It was apparently pretty common to go down big hills with your feet slung over the handlebars so that if you lost it you'd go off feet first rather than eating shit. It's not for nothing that the first modern bikes were referred to as safety bicycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think this is the bigger answer - a variety of drives had been used on bicycles since the addition of pedals (initially people just pushed them with their feet), but they didn't really become popular. The invention of the pneumatic bike tire ended penny-farthings within just a few years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth mentioning that this is a very specific style of bicycle (called a Penny Farthing). <strong>Most</strong> bikes were <strong>not</strong> like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and penny farthings can go damn fast.</p>
<p>A town I lived in (Oamaru, New Zealand) has an annual penny farthing race. It's lunacy how fast they can go considering how long ago they were designed.</p>
<p>They're slow to start but once moving they're howling and the rider is a long way from the ground.</p></div>		</li>
