			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it depends on the velocity! If you sprayed it into the sun at 80% the speed of light, my guess is it would obliterate the sun. We could do the calculation if we are curious. But there <strong>is</strong> a velocity where the kinetic energy added would overwhelm the binding energy of the star, and blast it apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you somehow spread it out enough that it didn't just turn into a sun: The water you put in the sun will ionize and dissociate into hydrogen and oxygen, while increasing the gravitational pressure on the core, and therefore the rate of fusion, making the sun brighter. The more mass you add, the more you increase pressure and the rate of fusion continues to increase. </p>
<p>I'm personally not sure what adding that much oxygen will do, that's out of my depth sadly. </p>
<p>EDIT - To clarify: I realize the oxygen will fuse and I'm familiar with typical stellar fusion, but I'm not sure what would happen in this case with such a large percentage in a relatively young, small star in main sequence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen also undergoes fusion. Any element lighter than iron does. In most stars there are layers of different reactions that take place during different parts of the stars life. Depending on the mass of the star heavy elements up to iron are created. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I noted above I'm aware, I just didn't want to speculate on when the oxygen would fuse, I'm not sure myself whether 2 solar masses is enough to kick off heavier elements fusing. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not all of them. Stars below 8 solar masses or so only produce elements up to carbon (with some oxygen) through normal fusion reactions. There's also a grey area around the 8-10 solar mass range where carbon fusion still occurs, but without reaching iron, which can leave behind an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf#Stars_with_medium_to_high_mass" target="_blank">oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf</a> if the star isn't massive enough to experience core collapse and form a neutron star.</p>
<p>Very low-mass stars also never fuse anything more than hydrogen, although none of these have evolved naturally into white dwarfs yet (although helium white dwarfs like this do form in mass-transfer binary systems).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would based on what I know about stellar mass/luminosity and mass/lifetime relationships. </p>
<p>A star that's 2 solar masses is about 10 times as bright as the sun, and lasts about 1/5th the age (~2Gy vs ~10Gy).</p>
<p>Like I've said above, I'm not sure how the Oxygen will affect it, because I suspect it's still not going to be hot enough to burn it, so for quite some time it'll be an inert &quot;filler&quot; element, but I don't think there exists any main sequence stars with such a large percentage of oxygen vs hydrogen/helium.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring any gravitational effects a large mass of anything being put on a collision course with the sun would cause, the sun is not a &quot;fire&quot;, but nuclear fusion. It's not combining elements with oxygen to ignite a fire that produces the sun's heat but fusing atoms together. Water, or any other chemical that has fire retardant properties would not affect nuclear fusion by its fire extinguishing properties. The sun's primary fuel is hydrogen. The composition of molecules which make up water are hydrogen and oxygen. You would be adding more fuel for the sun to use.</p></div>		</li>
