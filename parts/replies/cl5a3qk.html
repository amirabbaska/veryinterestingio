			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the movement of water through the vasculature of all plants is not due to any &quot;pushing&quot; force, but rather due to a a negative change in vapor pressure as water evaporates from's the plant's green tissues, coupled with capillary action as water is effectively &quot;pulled&quot; into the plant's vasculature at the roots as.
Osmotic pressure is the phenomenon of water movement across permeable membranes to establish equal concentration of solutes.  I don't believe its involved here...</p></div>		</li>
