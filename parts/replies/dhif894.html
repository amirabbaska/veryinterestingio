<p>So how comes that intelligents children have high level of emotions and lost them when they becomes adults? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning to <em>control emotions</em>, that is more precisely to control emotional behaviour is nothing special, it's an integral part of becoming an adult.</p>
<p>Intelligence has stong genetic components, so by logic many highly intelligent adults were highly intelligent kids and adolescents. Well, you know kids: They are a pain in the ass when you are a freak. Highly intellligent kids often are kind of freaky, especially when they live their lives in an average environment - in contrast to elite schools for example, which produce more outspoken highly intellligent adults.</p>
<p>As a result, many highly intelligent kids manage to develope a sort of camouflage for (emotional) protection. This may stamp their behavioural patterns resulting in a decreased general expressiveness, especially in emotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, but decrease in expressiveness does not mean that they do not feel less the emotions, it just means that they are better at controlling how they are expressed. Emotions are still present and probably even stronger.
And when that find a way to express it to create, this becomes a masterpiece :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a looot of emotional adults. It's really not something everybody learns to control. Although typically this usually leads to bad impulse control and often they get in trouble with friends/family/society for their outbursts, so I guess that does show they're not doing very well at the being an adult thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes more sense.
I was considered intellectually gifted, as was my brother. We both have explosive emotions. He handles it more inwardly and I outwardly. </p></div>		</li>
