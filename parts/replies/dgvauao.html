			<div class="markdown"><p>So I just got a report from experian. Says my credit inquiries were pulled from Capitol One in Utah, Onemain in Texas, CMS Id proofing in Baltimore, First national bank of Omaha in Nebraska. All of of these were from back in 2015 and I have never banked with any of these companies. </p>
<p>is this a red flag or normal stuff </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My credit has been destroyed for more than 20 years. I just didn't/don't care much. </p>
<p>I KNOW someone else has used my name, and every time i try to get my reports I am told they can't provide them. I can't answer the security questions. &quot;What bank is your loan from in 2012?&quot; And I answer none of the above. Failed.  This happens for all 3 credit bureaus.  A car I never owned, loans I have never had, addresses I have never lived. </p>
<p>Problem is I never get past that step. They make it to hard to even get my own information and I have never used it in any way. </p>
<p>I'm 40 and have never had a credit card or a car loan. I pay cash for things. Every time I make an attempt I am put off.
Why should I really care?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To what end? I haven't used it in 40 years. I don't rely plan on getting a loan or anything in the future.  Maybe stomp on an ex who used the information?  That seems petty. </p>
<p>I wouldn't mind getting a car or a credit card, but I have lived without them so long. It just doesn't matter.  Other than minor medical bills I have never used my credit for anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the credit issuer doesn't know that? If they had any idea that it wasn't you who owned them money, they wouldn't have loaned the money in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
