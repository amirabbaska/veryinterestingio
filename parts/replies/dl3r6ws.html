			<div class="markdown"><p>What would you listen for? ... the reason you find bats at lamp posts is due to the insects being attracted to the light which draws in the bats</p>
<hr />
<p>Bats use a perceptual system called echolocation that allows them to produce high pitch sounds that bounce off nearby objects and living things. Humans can't normally hear these sounds , unless they're slowed down</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I could very faintly hear bats when i was stood in a garden with them flying around me. I men its a very high pitch sound that without listening for you wouldn't notice but i could still hear it in the wild per say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bats have calls used for echolocation, and more general calls for communication, etc. The former is very hard to hear with human ears; the latter is usually audible and often annoying. You might have heard a form of the latter.</p>
<p>Also, like everything in the world of sounds, the call used for echolocation has a spectrum of wavelengths/frequencies. The lower end of this call is at 15-20 kHz, which humans can technically hear if the intensity is high enough. Practically, however, the peak intensity for bats is usually above 25 kHz, so unless you were in a very quiet environment (which the wild isn't), it will be almost impossible to hear it. Adults tend to lose hearing in the high frequencies to make things worse.</p>
<p>Whispering bats do have echolocation calls in the audible range. However, they live in the tropics. Unless you were specifically in such regions, chances are that you were hearing something else and mistaking it for a bat call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, so I've lived in America most of my life, the majority being in southern states of NC,TN and KY. We have bats everywhere and especially in caves which are available to the public. Now I'm not stating that bats fly around lamps or street lights because they enjoy it, I'm saying they do the exact reason you said. Bugs=food. And if you can see the food, there's no sense in not using your very working eyes. </p>
<p>As far as the sound being inaudible to human ears, that's just not true (at least for the species that live here) there is a very clear and distinct &quot;click&quot; which is the echolocation wave being protected from the bat.</p></div>		</li>
