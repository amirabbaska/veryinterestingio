<p>Are there any with innocuous household uses?</p>

<p>The answer is &quot;yes, if you own a jacuzzi adding acid to it is a normal part of pool maintenance, because pools and jacuzzis need to maintain a particular ph balance&quot;</p>
<p>These pool chemicals could damage the deck surrounding the jacuzzi if it's made of something like wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bisulfate is granulated acid and is not the only acid used in pools and tubs, its used in small private tubs. Comercial pools and spas use concentrated acid like muriatic or hydrocloric. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muriatic and hydrochloric are the same chemical HCI. He is obviously a small residental person. You dont add muriatic acid to hot tubs because the volume of water is low and the HCI will settle at the lowest point wearing away at the tub in one area over time. Thats why you premix dry acid to avoid the issue.</p>
<p>Commerical properties also pump CO2 into the pool to lower pH and keeo chlorine in its effective santizing range without irritating the swimmers.</p></div>		</li>
