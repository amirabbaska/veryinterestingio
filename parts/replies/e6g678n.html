			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the electrons IN lightning come from the earth's surface over time.</p>
<p>However, the Earth as a whole has significant negative charge from solar winds and cosmic rays.  Once a beta particle hits something in a vacuum, the whole body stays negative indefinitely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not from cosmic rays.  Clouds tend to start with electrically neutral water droplets and pump electrons downward and leave the top positively charged.  The mechanism is not actually well-understood.  The bottom becomes intensely negative, but, oddly, may not just arc to the positive topside despite being much closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have the flow direction backwards. You're right that &quot;normal&quot; lightning is negative, but in the case of negative lightning the electrons flow from the ground into the cloud, so the surface would end up with <em>less</em> electrons. See <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9hyqkm/when_a_lightning_bolt_strikes_the_ground_what/e6g5cq1/" target="_blank">this comment</a> for an explanation of why &quot;current flow&quot; is defined as opposite direction to the electrons themselves, and <a href="http://www.weatherimagery.com/blog/positive-negative-lightning/" target="_blank">this site</a> for the positive vs negative lightning general info and diagram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.  The cloud bottom has an excess of electrons.  The high local electric field does make the ground nearby more positive.  Leaders may form from either side.  In the end though, you have an arc, electrons flow cloud-to-ground, depleting the negative charge on the cloud and adding a negative charge to the earth's surface- but it does not stay local to the strike point, the negative charge conducts across the entire earth almost instantly.</p></div>		</li>
