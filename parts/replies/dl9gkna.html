			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually he used his own blood. </p>
<p>Also, he had doctors constantly test him and setup special treatment plans so he wouldn't get caught. I believe he used EPO as well </p>
<p>He also left right before he was supposed to get tested in one case because it was a surprise test and he knew he would fail </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly his Web of lies came crashing down when Floyd Landis told the truth to the drug associations and it spiralled from there. If he wasn't such an a hole to certain people they might have been less likely to tell people but he did wrong by Floyd due to not putting him on a team and Floyd decided his best option was to talk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you can get prescribed EPO which will raise RBC levels. Otherwise you could get donor blood, but that would be very expensive and wouldn't be done without you being on the brink of death (or having a large bribe handy).</p></div>		</li>
