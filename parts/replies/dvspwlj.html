			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh Lord. It is such a travesty. I don't think there is any one solution, but rather a whole bunch of interlocking changes that need to occur: people need to stop viewing dogs and cats as disposable objects; we need to get over our fetish with &quot;purebred&quot; dogs and cats (mixed breed dogs are just as lovable, smart, and beautiful); people need to realize that dogs from shelters are NOT more likely to have behavioral problems than dogs from pet stores or breeders--the data simply don't support the stereotype. I wish that everyone wanting to bring a pet into their home would adopt, rather than shop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please elaborate on the data regarding behavioural problems? We adopted a rescue as our first dog and, although we're 100% committed to working through her behavioural issues, the impact on our quality of life has put us off of rescuing and made us consider a puppy for our next dog. Even if you can direct me to resources or places where I could further research, that would be much appreciated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bless your hearts for committing to a rescue dog with &quot;issues.&quot; (I have a behaviorally challenged dog, too, and it definitely impacts your QOL.) Adopting a puppy, as opposed to an older dog, allows you to control the critical socialization period and can set you and the dog up for success. But you can still adopt a puppy from a shelter, rather than purchase a puppy from a pet store or breeder--and so still make a difference in the life of a homeless animal. (I know, the older dogs in shelters are MORE in need of homes, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing a puppy.) Of course, even by the age or 8 to 10 weeks, puppies will already have had experiences that may impact later behavior. But puppies in shelters no more likely to have had a hard beginning than purchased dogs. Frank McMillan published an interesting research article suggesting that puppies from pet stores were statistically more likely to have behavioral problems such as anxiety when they get older, probably because the environment in puppy mills is so bad. Here is a link to McMillan's article: <a href="http://www.journalvetbehavior.com/article/S1558-7878(17)30010-2/abstract" target="_blank">http://www.journalvetbehavior.com/article/S1558-7878(17)30010-2/abstract</a></p></div>		</li>
