			<div class="markdown"><p>I always found the whole &quot;Well, humans are inconsistent and wrong all the time, so GÃ¶del's theorem does not even begin to apply in the first place.&quot; thing to be a bit of a forceful counterargument to Penrose's claim.</p>
<p>You could argue that the randomness of stimuli we receive during our lives, and the inherent &quot;fuzziness&quot; of neurochemistry, means that you need a probabilistic Turing machine, but that does not imply quantum. A regular old Turing machine with a random component in its input would do just fine. </p></div>		</li>
