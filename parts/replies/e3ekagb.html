			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is not a correct biological understanding of the word breathing as relates to &quot;species that produce oxygen&quot;, most commonly those species called plants.  In the lexicon of biology,  the word breathing refers to the &quot;sum total of the physical and chemical processes in an organism by which oxygen is conveyed to tissues and cells&quot;.  Plants produce oxygen via photosynthesis in one area of plant cells (chloroplast) then use excess oxygen produced to carryout respiration (energy production) in another area of the plant cell (mitochondria).  The 'breathing' process is thus the initial step of transporting oxygen where it is in high concentration in the cell to where it is lower....from chloroplast to mitochondria.</p>
