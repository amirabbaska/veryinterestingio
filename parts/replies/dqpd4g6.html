<p>lithium can be processed out of seawater. Prices would go through the roof</p>

<p>Does this get any more cost-effective if it's combined with existing desalination plants? Figure they're already doing a big chunk of the work to concentrate the salts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, desalination produces brine as one of the waste products, so starting with any higher concentration than the seawater average of 0.2ppm would be nice! The most straightforward way to extract lithium then is using dialysis, with a superconducting membrane specifically designed for pulling lithium ions through.</p>
<p>Even then, plain seawater extraction is still going to be crazy expensive compared to all the other options (salt mines, concentrated brine pools, mineral springs, geothermal water, undersea geothermal vents). We won't have to seriously consider it for a looooong time.</p></div>		</li>
