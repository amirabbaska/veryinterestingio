			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct.</p>
<p>DC is safer than AC for several reasons;</p>
<p>First is that DC is measured at peak voltage, while AC is measured at something called the root-mean-square voltage, which is roughly 70% of the peak voltage. 120 volts DC is 120 volts at peak voltage, 120 volts AC is about 170 volts at peak voltage.</p>
<p>Additionally, AC will set up capacitive effects in your body which dramatically increases the danger of it.</p>
<p>Combine these two effects and 70 volts AC is roughly as dangerous as 120 volts DC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned yet, and goes back to the beginning is that AC can be generated in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphase_system" target="_blank">polyphase</a> (3 phases) where as DC is single (1) phase.</p>
<p>This is important because, back during the industrial revolution, raw power of these motors was more important than precise control of speed. Coupled with the fact that AC motors were (still are) cheaper to manufacture, have fewer moving parts (last much longer), usually didn't lose a percentage of the current supplied to produce the necessary magnetic field and, were smaller than DC motors of comparable torque, the AC motor  won out.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>AC induction motors always are the better choice (IMHO). As already stated DC motors always require commutators, which means brushes. And brushes mean brush fire (? sorry, I only know the German term &quot;Bürstenfeuer&quot;; I hope that translates literally), which in turn means electromagnetic interference.</p>
<p>There are of course BLDC motors, but the whole term &quot;brush less DC&quot; is totally wrong. Brushless motors are, of course, always AC motors and the difference is that instead of a contact commutator you have some electronics that switches the direction of the currents. What's commonly referred to as &quot;BLDC&quot; technically are permanent magnet synchronous AC motors. The downside of those is, that they require permanent magnets. True free wheeling is not possible for these kinds of motors, since the eddie currents their magnets create cause some losses; so in &quot;idle&quot; you always need that synchronously rotating magnetic field.</p>
<p>Now AC induction motors do not use permanent magnets. Instead they rely on the magnetic field created in the induction coil rotor, if that rotates faster or slower than the rotating magnetic field. When 3 phase electricity was invented that meant that adjusting the speed of the motor either involved variable gear or discrete switched of the stator coil configuration, because true variable speed control would have required altering the frequency of the power supply. But these days we have high efficiency power electronics. And when you connect an AC motor to a 3 phase electricity supply through a variable speed control there's actually a AC→DC conversion step happening in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motors are still pretty important.  In a lot of climates where air conditioning is used mid-sized to large buildings have large motors for the compressors and fans.  3 phase motors are more efficient particularly at larger sizes.</p>
<p>Of course in a lot of manufacturing and industrial uses, motors are very important, from motors to move material (like conveyor belts) to machines that roll/press/drill materials.</p>
<p>Basically, lots of people and businesses would have a very hard time switching to DC.  They'd install big DC to AC converters for the majority of the loads in the building.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They only thing I can think of that you may be referring is that it's easier to break an AC short circuit than DC.</p>
<p>If you have something that is arcing, with AC the voltage passes through zero on it's 60 Hz cycle. It may self-extinguish. With DC, if there's arc, either power has to be cut, or the 2 things moved far enough apart to break the arc.</p>
<p>Some AC circuit breakers will also have a DC rating, but it will be for a lower voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EE here: this is true.  Not just breakers, but everyday power switches.  A switch with an AC power rating will switch DC, but at a much lower voltage and current rating.  </p>
<p>DC tends to pit contacts pretty quickly, even weld them.  Partly because the arc doesn't self-commutate when breaking.  But also, many apps just connect the DC source to a brushed motor or a capacitor bank.  That can cause VERY high surges during connection that pit the connection.  </p>
<p>There are plenty of reliable high-current DC switches, but they're more expensive to construct and are often tailored specifically for the load and the voltage.  A battery drill has nice ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important point to add on to this good explanation is <em>why</em> being able to change voltage is important.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that a higher voltage results in less power lost in the power lines.  So less energy is wasted in getting the electricity to your house.  The math is actually pretty simple.  Power lost is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power Loss = (Electrical Current)^2 * (Resistance in Power Lines)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you step up voltage via a transformer, you trade electrical current for higher voltage.  This is why long distance transmission lines high insanely high voltages, to keep the current low and minimize loss.</p>
<p>The voltage is lowered before it gets to your house, because lower voltage is safer to handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>An important point to add on this good important point to add is that in addition to being able to transfer at a lower loss with higher voltages, the power lines can have less diameter with AC than with DC. I think it's about a third or something less conductive material that you need to transfer the same amount of energy.</del></p>
<p>I forgot the reason why though :)</p>
<p>edit: may be (partly) bullshit, i'll check back with my source to have them explain it to me again :)))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick note: only AC can use transformers. DC has to use power electronics, either rated for the power throughput or with lots and lots of DC buck/boost or SEPIC circuits in parallel. Transformers are cheap. Take a piece of iron and wrap two wires around it. There's your transformer. Power electronics are far more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well.... there's a couple more examples where AC is better.</p>
<p>Even with lower prices for industrial-grade solid state rectifiers and inverters, AC is cheaper at medium transmission distances (~200 miles, give or take) because line loss+transformer loss is still less than what you lose by rectifying to and inverting from DC.</p>
<p>Second, AC motors of practical application sizes (ie, bigger than a toy) are more compact, cheaper and safer.  The fan at home?  The air conditioner?  The pumps providing water pressure to the neighbourhood?  All AC.  Permanent magnet DC motors are too bulky and too weak to provide these services.  Meanwhile, variable speed DC drives (shunt wound or series) can - and eventually will - suffer cataclysmic runaway when the field control current fails.  At this point there's no back EMF to prevent the motor from drawing infinite current and it speeds up to infinity (or as close as it can get before self-destructing and taking out the room/building).</p>
<p>Finally, with the advent of cheap variable frequency drives, AC motors can do what DC motors used to be able to - ie, rotate at variable speeds.  So over the past 20 years this has effectively killed the DC drive for industrial purposes with very, very few exceptions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Search for &quot;runaway&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, and just to be perfectly clear:</p>
<p>The motor doesn't actually draw infinite current when the field fails.  It simply tries to (or as near-infinite as it can get given the resistance of the input cable and the fact that it will blow up LONG before it hits infinity).  But it will draw amps until it blows up.</p></div>		</li>
