			<div class="markdown"><p>Having excess ADEK is extremely hard however, unless you are eating raw polar bear livers for a meal every other day, you can take high doses of ADEK and never have issues with it. </p>
<p>While its strictly correct that you can build toxicity, its rare and hard to do, requiring some serious dietary imbalance for a long period of time.</p>
<p>For example vitamin D, the RDA is about 600IU per day, and supplementation will have about 200-300IU. </p>
<p>Yet you can safely take up to between 5000 to 10.000IU per day for years without toxicity. </p>
<p>Theres even record of safe usage of up to 100.000IU of vitamin D in a single dose orally (once every 4 months though, not a daily base :D). </p>
<p>Why am i saying this? well for various reasons, but mostly for 2, first its misleading, second people being afraid of ADEK's toxicity might affect behaviour into avoiding it, causing serious issues. </p>
<p>Edit: another thing worth mentioning: watch vitamin K intake if you are on anti-coagulants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it is the fact people don't like veggies and fresh fruit can be hard to come by.</p>
<p>It actually makes sense that vitamin deficiency could track with obesity; if the body feels unsatisfied with the nutrients it has gotten from an amount of food, and the desired nutrient is only gotten through food, the only simple response is to keep the feeling of hunger going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canned and frozen veggies... not as good nor as vitamin-rich as fresh ones, but the difference is the average person can afford them. That doesn't apply as much to fruit. I recently, at the grocery store, weighed a tomato, and it turns out a regular ol' tomato costs three bucks.</p>
<p>I can get three cheeseburgers with that money. For fuck's sake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is factually incorrect. Most Americans are deficient in Vitamin D due to lack of an exposure. This is something inexpensive to test with bloodwork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work overnights and believe I had a vitamin D deficiency that I finally realized and I started taking a multi vitamin and vitamin D on a daily basis and my condition improved severely. I work a job that requires a lot of strenuous exercise and I eat easily 5k calories a day, often more. I was getting really bad symptoms but it seems to have been basically eliminated but I wanted to know if you had any idea if there was anything else I could do to help with this besides what I'm doing now.  </p>
<p>The pill of vitamin d is 5000 iu by the way and I only take one a day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had vitamin D problems as well. Pain in the bones was the most obvious. When I started with vitamin D it really helped. I did a three month test, stopping altoghether and measuring the blood levels every other week. It was interesting to see it drop 10-20 points every two weeks. I started at 150, stopped when it was at 80, with pains returning. Now I'm back to 120. </p>
<p>You can read the vitamin D solution book from Holic. It explains a lot about how it works. You take 5k iu. I take 4k at the moment, but go back to 3k next spring. Sun is the only alternative to pills. Holick explains that sun is not bad if you know how much you can get. Plus skin cancer from sun light is almost never the bad kind of skin cancer. The only catch is that you need to take care of it, let it remove, otherwise it can turn bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could use blueblockers (I'm biased toward carbonshade.com). They effectively simulate being in darkness and are typically used 1-4 hours before going to sleep.</p>
<p>However, I'm not that familiar with the best protocols for night-shift work so take a look at caloriesproper.com and see what you can find there.</p></div>		</li>
