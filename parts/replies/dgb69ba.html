			<div class="markdown"><p>In the glass example, when the excited electron relaxes into the ground state, the emitted photon could be projected in any direction, correct? (Rather than being projected in the opposite direction to the incident light, the emitted photon could penetrate into the glass)</p>
<p>If that's the case, these excitation/relaxation processes repeat until the energy is insufficient (lost through phonons) to excite the electrons deeper within the glass. At that point, did the glass essentially convert the UV light to blue light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, re-emitted photons are projected in every direction. Consider that a blue object appears blue no matter what angle you look at it from. Also note that the photons are generally not ALL exactly one wavelength when re-emitted, but a distribution of wavelengths that are mostly within a couple of ranges. The exception to this would be lasers, which essentially generate photons of only a specific wavelength.</p>
<p>Generally, if light that strikes a material is energetic enough to overcome the bandgap, it will happen within the first few nanometers of the material. (It's an exponential decay with respect to depth). It's not really a matter of it happening &quot;deeper&quot; within the material. For example, gold that is stretched to an atomically thin film will allow light to pass through it almost unhindered, but anything thicker than that blocks essentially 100% of light.</p>
<p>As for converting UV light to blue light, as far as I know the mechanics you describe more or less make sense (aside from the depth aspect). The actual colour that ends up being emitted depends on the bandgap. LEDs make use of this by forcing electrons to jump down in energy levels (by introducing a difference in electric potential, ie. Voltage) in the range of a specific wavelength to create a specific colour. Different colour LEDs need to use different materials with different bandgaps. That's why blue LEDs are more expensive, (it's not an arbitrary marketing thing like some people believe)</p>
<p>Back to the depth concept, the colour &quot;conversion&quot; happens at the surface. If you look at glass up close or at an angle, the surfaces appear visible but the medium itself seems as clear as the air around it, and then on the other side there is some visibility of the material's surface again. I haven't learned this specifically (and may be wrong) but it's an extension of the interaction happening at the surface. Once the light is reduced enough in energy, it passes right through.</p></div>		</li>
