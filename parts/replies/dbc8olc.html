			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a partial frontal impact with a closing velocity of 170 mph. One of the drivers was suspected to have lost consciousness before impact. He died essentially on impact while the two people he hit barely survived. </p>
<p>As you said. The amount of kinetic energy involved with such a accident is unfathomable and if makes little difference. Whether you're tense or not matters like a fart in a wind storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. It's not just the strength of the pelvis it's the pliancy. Like hitting a hard solid rubber ball: it deforms a lot before it breaks. Really hard, even with a sledge hammer, EVEN for a construction worker :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;common injury&quot;? You realize that the trauma criteria was studied and intrusion/impact had such a low sensitivity and specificity that it's laughable, but they kept it in because 'that's what we've always done.' The only criteria with any merit to it is ejection, and that's still only a 40% sensitivity/specificity. </p>
<p>And if we're going off anecdote alone, I've seen zero patients with a broken pelvis secondary to a car crash, no matter the impact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are you worried? I'm sure you're right that, in many case, the impact force is so high that relaxed vs. tense won't make a difference but how does that make this thread &quot;worry&quot; you?</p></div>		</li>
