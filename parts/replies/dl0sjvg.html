			<div class="markdown"><p>You had to walk in only to get the interest transactions printed in your passbook. The interest still accrued even if you didn't go in every month. So if you went in every three months they'd just print the missing three interest payments and a new account total. Ah, the old days. I seem to recall my savings account as a kid had something like a 5% interest rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first savings account when I was a kid had a handwritten passbook and even better, the teller would manually compute my interest payments and write them in.  Crazy days.  I still had a passbook for a savings account up until the mid-2000s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i wasn't calling you a liar, i was just making a comment. i had a passbook savings account in illinois in the 60's-70's, and that little red book made me feel like a big shot.</p>
<p>there's a short history on branch-banking rules/laws through the years in illinois <a href="https://www.idfpr.com/Banks/CBT/STATS/BR-HIST.ASP" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
