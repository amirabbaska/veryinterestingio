There is a color-changing wood putty made my Elmer's that fits this description: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elmers-E913-Carpenters-8-Ounce-Natural/dp/B00K25F1WK/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1502615096&sr=1-1&keywords=color+change+wood+putty" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Elmers-E913-Carpenters-8-Ounce-Natural/dp/B00K25F1WK/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1502615096&sr=1-1&keywords=color+change+wood+putty</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wiki page above links to something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichardt%27s_dye" target="_blank">Reichardt's dye</a>, which looks to be a good explanation, but I couldn't find anything on its industrial use in glue or paint. Another dye candidate could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH_indicator" target="_blank">pH indicator</a>, which changes in structure and color based on the pH of its surroundings (not the polarity, to contrast with Reichardt's dye).</p></div>		</li>
