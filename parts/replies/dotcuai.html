			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a candy factory, their are also categories for food flavors, they have (artificial, identical, natural) also with a higher price increase on each level. So most of the time they use a mixture of these, and also they mix flavors to give it a more real flavor, i.e. (90%orange+10%lemon) and they add some ascorbic acid for a realistic taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important side note: what we often describe as taste,  is actually flavour. (Taste is only sweet , sour , unami , salty and bitter !) . Our brains use a lot of different informations to determine the flavour like taste ,odours , temperature , food structure and consistency etc ...
When we try to generate artificial flavours it's to hard to get all of these right , so artificial flavour never taste like the real thing. Though it might be easier for some then for others</p></div>		</li>
