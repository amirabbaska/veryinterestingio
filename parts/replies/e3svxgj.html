			<div class="markdown"><p>So thereâ€™s nothing preventing one from making a display that uses, say, orange teal and purple as the pixel colors? Of course the color mixing algorithm would have to change, but is it true to say that you could pick any three colors and produce the rest? Is there a requirement that they must be approx. equidistant on the color wheel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would require more power to render the same brightness if you didn't use red/green/blue. You also could potentially run into a problem where you create 'gaps' in your color spectrum because your chosen colors are too far away from one another.</p>
<p>But otherwise, what you're describing is more or less possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color wheel is not useful here. Instead you could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space#CIE_xy_chromaticity_diagram_and_the_CIE_xyY_color_space" target="_blank">CIE xy chromaticity diagram</a>.</p>
<p>The xy chromaticity diagram is very easy to use for aditive colors. The colors you get from mixing dofferent colors are simply all the colors in between your primary colors. For example <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_by_spigget.png" target="_blank">sRGB color gamut here</a> has the red, green and blue at the corners of the triangle and all the colors inside can be made with computer display.</p>
<p>So if you used orange, teal and purple you could make the colors <a href="https://i.imgur.com/prjibSQ.png" target="_blank">as shown here (in black triangle)</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I understand that wiki article, the CIE diagram is designed based on human perception. So if we had orange, teal and purple cones instead, then would the whole diagram be color shifted, or would it be cropped to the black triangle you showed?  In other words, is there any physical reason light has the RGB primary colors or is it al physiological?</p></div>		</li>
