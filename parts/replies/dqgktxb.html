			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying. The part where you said that in a vacuum all quantum fields are in their lowest energy states really cleared things up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always wondered, is this theory/perspective at the forefront of our research when it comes to trying to explain what happened before the big bang? It seems like there could be an explanation in there about how “something came from nothing”.</p>
<p>EDIT: I realize that part of this question doesn’t make sense because the theory says that there really isn’t “nothing” there. But I still feel like the theory could help to explain how the big bang occurred. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may wish to - if you're not already aware of it and/or read it - look into Lawrence Krauss' <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Universe-Nothing-There-Something-Rather/dp/1451624468" target="_blank">A Universe from Nothing - Why there is something instead of nothing</a>. This might help and it's an intriguing read regardless. I've also seen multiple youtube videos of Krauss presenting this.</p>
<p>However, a point for folks to keep in mind is what a physicist calls 'nothing' may not be what they call 'nothing'.</p>
<p>Oh, and spoiler - it's cuz 'nothing' is unstable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've listened to Krauss' lectures on this, which I love, and what I get from it is that there is no such thing as nothing. But he insists that it is nothing since there are no actual physical objects there. I guess it's to help his arguments against religion, which I agree with him on, it's just that I find it odd that he's not proclaiming that &quot;There is no such thing as nothing.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's a cost of space simply existing? If yes, and also if the Universe is infinite, would that hypothetically mean that the Universe has infinite energy? Would it even make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe is infinite in some meaningful way that doesn't simply mean empty nothingness past some boundary, then it would have infinite energy in any case. The observable universe, on the other hand, is finite by virtue of the fact that we can only observe such parts of the universe as have been able to send photons to us since the universe became transparent to electromagnetic radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter one way or the other, as vacuum energy is not accessible by any means. If we consider vacuum energy to be the baseline energy of empty space, we can't extract energy from it because we don't have a lower-energy location to pull into. PBS SpaceTime did a bit on this a few weeks ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a possibility that’s been considered, although we don’t even need an infinite universe for there to be potentially infinite vacuum energy...but that statement isn’t even necessarily meaningful. And the value of vacuum energy is hotly contested. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Rh898Yr5YZ8" target="_blank">this video</a> for more info, as I am most certainly not an expert. </p></div>		</li>
