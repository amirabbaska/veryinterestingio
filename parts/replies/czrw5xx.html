			<div class="markdown"><p>Every pluck is a chance to damage the papilla. Usually you'll get a white or hair-colored bulb on the end, but if you see red (blood) bulb on the root, likely you've done the necessary damage to not grow hair out of that follicle again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome, so I just have to keep plucking the middle of my eyebrows over and over again? Is there a way to induce damaging the papilla? </p>
<p>I have a few places on my body where I'd be happy if hair never grew there again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no, if plucked properly studies are showing it actually might help regrow thicker hair. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but this seems to be regeneration of already existing follicles.</p>
<p>I.e. unless you're genetically predisposed for growing more hair around the area you're plucking, you're not going to see increased growth (unless there is already damage in the area).</p></div>		</li>
