<p>Inflammation is necessary to repair tissue in a timely manner. But inflammation can cause pain and damage other organs, namely, the inflamed tissue (would you rather squeeze an under filled water balloon or an overfilled water balloon.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, inflammation is the process that proceeds and triggers healing. But it's more complex. Inflammation can go over board, like what happens in many disease states or in allergic reactions. In those cases, it's inflammation that results in death of the organism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooh TRPV. Never get to talk much about those on reddit. Definitely in the presence of the ol' inflammatory soup - a spicy soup at that - some of the TRPV have lowered thresholds to temperature thus the person is more likely to experience a warm/hot sensation. </p>
<p>I think OP was more talking about the skin being actually warmer (likely due to vadodilation) but now I think about it, the whole experience is a combination of both effects, plus some kind of central sensitisation kinda thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as TRPV1 is a nociceptor then any inflammation, including UV damage, would increase activity of these receptors. But I agree with your approach and interpretation of the OP question in that vasodialation and blood circulation play a bigger role in heat. As you clearly know TRP groups are also thermoreceptors so there is a holistic interaction ongoing, but attributing heat to circulation would be the primary - TRPs would just be the mechanic of how the signal is being transmitted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP's questions refers to the actual temperature of your burnt (inflamed: calor, rubor, tumor, dolor) skin rather than the sensation of warmth. When there is inflammation, tissue gets hot, red, swollen, and painful. Imagine stubbing your toe or having strep throat or burning yourself on the stove. This is just a burn on large patches of your skin. If you put a thermometer on burnt and nonburnt skin, the burnt akin is actually putting off more heat. Now, TRPV is just how you feel warmth. Take a normal nonburnt finger and touch some nonburnt skin to assess the temperature, and then use the same finger to touch some burnt akin and find out how much warmer that skin is. </p>
<p>Further, you are probably right that burnt skin still experiences hotness and pain even when there is no more burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitiligo, if I recall correctly, is likely caused by autoimmune imbalance within a certain areal. The skin looses most of its defense against uva/uvb so patients do tend to get skin cancer at a higher rate. Thus I'd refrain from using sunburns to &quot;alter&quot; your immune system locally.</p>
<p>It may work. Immune balance is a complicated matter with lots of different transmitter and celllines. Consult your dermatologist. There are some cases of repeated uva-exposure to stress the immune system locally sometimes resulting in a rebalanced state. But not all patients have success. </p></div>		</li>
