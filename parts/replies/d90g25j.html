			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not commonly used though, because obsidian is very brittle, and there's a not so small chance of it breaking during surgery if the surgeon is disturbed, especially if the blade has a very fine tip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I read somewhere before that surgeon's tools were actually pretty commonly edged with obsidian. I read it when Guild Wars 1 was pretty new, and obsidian was one of the rarest things you could find, so it was... jeeze, over 10 years ago. Is that information just not accurate anymore, or was it never accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. But with the increasing use of robotics in surgery, why not have the surgeon use the absolutely steady motion of a robot to make such highly ideal cuts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they are not FDA approved for use in surgery.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily illegal to use, but if it breaks you're wide open to get sued. If a drill bur breaks inside of you (very common), you're less likely to get sued because the consent you sign acknowledged that risk, but lawyers can make a big deal about the obsidian knife not being approved by the FDA and everyone gets their panties in a wad. </p>
<p>Also a lot of institutions would not allow it</p></div>		</li>
