			<p>They actually are used by some surgeons. They cut cleaner and allow for minimal tissue damage and less scarring. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are no surgeons that use them. No hospital would allow it. It's nigh impossible to find a broken off piece in a wound and it would cause a ton of damage if not removed.</p>		</li>

			<p>One of my archaeology profs, a lithics expert, actually did have this done. His surgeon was greatly interested in archaeology and they basically decided after some discussion to do some of his surgery with an obsidian blade. The surgery was on both of his wrists, so one wrist used the obsidian and the other was surgical steel -- there's no scar on the wrist that used obsidian. So obviously not a common occurrence, but there's an example for you!</p>		</li>

			<p>Read the linked article and saw the pictures of the holes in the skull. Gasped when reading your comment that lithics professor wanted to try the hole in skull surgery for science. Sigh of relief at &quot;wrists&quot;. Whew. What a rollercoaster. </p>		</li>

			<p>From the very article you cited:<br><br>&gt;  Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration-approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied, meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use.<br><br>So that explains while they are a rarity.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>They're not commonly used though, because obsidian is very brittle, and there's a not so small chance of it breaking during surgery if the surgeon is disturbed, especially if the blade has a very fine tip.</p>		</li>

			<p>I thought I read somewhere before that surgeon's tools were actually pretty commonly edged with obsidian. I read it when Guild Wars 1 was pretty new, and obsidian was one of the rarest things you could find, so it was... jeeze, over 10 years ago. Is that information just not accurate anymore, or was it never accurate?</p>		</li>

I've linked to the appropriate comment, but there's lots of other interesting stuff, including facts South American weapons that used obsidian, in the thread as a whole.<br><br>There are actually hella reddit posts about obsidian if you have a google.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lol. Ask for source normally, you get anecdotes. Ask for anecdotes, get articles.<br><br><br>There was a thread somewhere where a surgeon weighed in on obsidian scalpels. Apparently, they're really brittle and can't stand much lateral pressure (twisting/changing direction of cut). They're also more expensive than normal scalpels.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is, but the knives are not for everyone. Like you can imagine molecule-thin glass would be, obsidian  knives are very delicate and could snap off if twisted in the wrong direction. </p>		</li>

			<p>For sure. But with the increasing use of robotics in surgery, why not have the surgeon use the absolutely steady motion of a robot to make such highly ideal cuts</p>		</li>

			<p>Part of why Obsidian is so sharp is that it is fragile and easy to break. When used for surgery, Obsidian blades would leave lots of microscopic, jagged pieces in the patient. No es bueno.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because they are not FDA approved for use in surgery.<br><br>It's not necessarily illegal to use, but if it breaks you're wide open to get sued. If a drill bur breaks inside of you (very common), you're less likely to get sued because the consent you sign acknowledged that risk, but lawyers can make a big deal about the obsidian knife not being approved by the FDA and everyone gets their panties in a wad. <br><br>Also a lot of institutions would not allow it</p>		</li>

			<p>They <em>sometimes</em> are, but generally aren't because obsidian is very brittle, meaning you're at risk of the edge breaking off inside the patient.</p>		</li>

			<p>There is not much of an advantage than a cosmetic one. It does not make much sense to go and find someone who can make you obsidian blades and pay him good money only to have a 1mm smaller scar. <br><br>And from what I read that advantage is not even guaranteed since scaring is effected by other factors as well. <br><br></p>		</li>
