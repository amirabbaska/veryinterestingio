<p>Yes it does. The Schrodinger equation can be written in a form that reduces to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation when <del>h</del> goes to zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nor from quantum statistics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, yes it does. Both Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics behave like Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics in the high temperature limit. You can alternatively think of the high temperature limit as the low thermal de Broglie wavelength limit, which corresponds to <del>h</del> going to zero.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(a) I suppose you are referring to Bohm's quantum potential (A).</p>
<p>Personally, I am a fan of Bohm, but your comment is overstated, since the behaviour of A in the limit h -&gt; 0 is undefined (Ballentine, Chapter 14, for anyone who wants to read up on this subject).</p>
<p>(b) The OP was not referring to physics in the limit of high temperatures, so your comments, while correct, are tangential to OP's remark.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, I'm not. You just make an ansatz that the Schrodinger wavefunction is of the form exp[iS/<del>h</del>] and plug it in to the Schrodinger equation. What results will be the Hamilton-Jacobi equation where S is Hamilton's principal function in the limit where <del>h</del> goes to zero. Nothing to do with Bohm.</p>

<p>The classical limit is the classical limit. You are the one who brought up identical particle statistics. Contrary to what you said, both the BE and FD distributions <em>do</em> approach the classical MB distribution in the classical limit.</p></div>		</li>
