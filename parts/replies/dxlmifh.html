			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, so maybe a single photon of non-ionizing radiation doesn't have enough energy to free an electron; but imagine you hit a molecule with a frequency that it has sharp resonance. If you continued to resonate this molecule with non-ionizing radiation for a long enough time, would it ionize?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case you mean the radiation of a photon has 1/x th of the ionization energy so you use x photons to get there then no. This is the classic approach which the photoelectric effect has disproven. Intensity of radiation/number of photons has no effect as long as the energy of a single photon is not sufficient for ionization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is this? Does the electron just &quot;fall back&quot; to a lower energy level by emitting a photon as soon as possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can ionize stuff by heating it up, which is what you described. </p></div>		</li>
