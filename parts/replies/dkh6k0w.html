			<div class="markdown"><p>Keplers third law tells us that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the major axis of the elliptical orbit (the diameter, if it's a circle).  If the Earth were dropped toward the Sun, its orbit would be a very narrow ellipse (basically, a straight line) with a major axis equal to half of the diameter of the Earth's nearly circular orbit.  Thus, the time to get to the Sun would be half of the new orbital period = (1/2 year)*(1/2)^(3/2) = 0.176 year, about 64.5 days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone explain how a proton can absorb an electron and become a neutron. As far as I've been told, electrons and protons do not consist of the same core particles (electrons aren't composed of quarks) so how can it possibly be absorbed without the electron just getting... lodged in there.</p>
<p>Or does the electron crashing into the proton somehow transform a quark. If so, what became 'absorbed' from the electron?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are getting there)
The electron is not absorbed by the proton, instead it <em>interacts</em> with the proton (via the weak interaction) and becomes a neutrino, while the proton turns into a neutron.</p>
<p>e + n –&gt; p + v</p>
<p>To be super precise the electron does not interact with the full proton but with one of its quark. One up quark (with charge 2/3) turns into a down quark (charge -1/3).</p>
<p>e + q_t –&gt; q_b + v</p>
