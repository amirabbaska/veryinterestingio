<p>After all, receptors work <del>purely</del> mostly on 3D structure. If 2 different molecules have the same shape (in the active area), they'd activate the same receptor.</p>
<p>As for testing: We still don't know all receptors there are. So we can't possibly test all interactions simply by looking at shape. Best we can do is look for similarities with known compounds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's one of a couple tests we can use.  Sometimes the chirality shows up on methods like NMR (Research version of the medical MRI machine) because it results in different inter-molecular interactions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>organic halogens or organic sulphur compounds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really, or at least not in a way comparable to substances like the lead and mercury compounds included in your first example. In pharmaceuticals, halogens (especially fluorine, but also chlorine) are frequent substituents due to, among other things, their influence on lipophilicity, binding affinity, and selectivity for targets. In fact, C-F bonds are often entirely biologically inert and can sometimes inhibit metabolic pathways that result in toxic metabolites in nonfluorinated analogs of the parent molecule. And sulfur is also a common heteroatom behind oxygen and nitrogen that's used in rational drug design. </p>
<p>You could argue that the molecules are still toxic, which is obviously true depending on dosage. But in most cases the acute toxicity arises from biological activity independent of the substituents themselves, which isn't the case with e.g. organomercury compounds where the toxicity is intrinsically tied to the metal. There are obviously exceptions to halogens and sulfur not being directly responsible—and you could surely intentionally design a novel compound in which they are—but saying their presence alone is a strong indicator of toxicity is inaccurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I knew that C-F bonds are mostly biologically inert but I thought that that would also cause problems with buildup in your liver so I'm surprised to hear that they're frequently used in pharmaceuticals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they're really common and exist within a huge variety of drug classes from antivirals to antipsychotics to anesthetics.</p>
<p>It's easier for many halogenated drugs to be retained in the body for longer due to their increased lipophilicity and tissue distribution as well as impaired metabolism particularly in fluorinated compounds, but there's no consistent toxic buildup the way you thought. </p>
<p>Generally if fluorine is being subbed in specifically to make a substance harder to metabolize, whether to increase the duration of effects or prevent toxic metabolites, the fluorine is located at the site of attack for (typically) cytochromes P450 as they're unable to effectively break the stronger C-F bond. The excretion process is separate from and not necessarily dependent on the metabolic breakdown in the liver, though drugs are often metabolized into more hydrophilic daughter compounds that are easier to filter out renally.</p>
<p>For increased lipophilicity and thus better duration and/or absorption in many cases, a single fluorine doesn't do very much compared to the heavier halogens. So you'll often see things such as trifluoromethyl groups hanging off aromatic rings like with Prozac over single fluorine substituents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on u/ediblebatteries -</p>
<p>Think of a compound with a carbon-metal bond, or an organic compound that binds to a metal through a heteroatom.</p>
<p>The first thing to worry about is setting yourself on fire. Some organometallics - typically the low molecular weight alkyl derivatives - are outright pyrophoric. A syringe of diethyl zinc makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmkBH-ncG1Y" target="_blank">a nice little flamethrower</a>. After the organic bits have combusted, you're left with an aerosol of metal or metal oxides that you probably don't want to inhale. Inhaling zinc oxide is not good, but the situation is worse if you're dealing with a more toxic metal.</p>
<p>So now let's worry about the metal exposure. The metals that your body does need, it needs in small amounts or they become toxic. The rest are toxic, albeit in very different (yet frequently low) amounts. Nonpolar oragnometallic complexes can very efficiently penetrate your body's natural barriers and cause a massive exposure.</p>
<p>There are things like nickel tetracarbonyl. Nickel is toxic in its own right, but most of the time you are exposed to it as the solid or some sort of dissolved ionic species that you ingest. Your body can tolerate a certain amount. Ni(CO)4 is a volatile nonpolar liquid, not some trace element in a tomato. You can easily inhale it because it's volatile, and it can move across membranes because its nonpolar. Now you've got a large nickel exposure that is completely different than an ingestion. And the four CO ligands that just left are now molecules of carbon monoxide floating around in your bloodstream.</p>
<p>Then there are things like dimethylmercury, which penetrates things like gloves, skin, and the blood-brain barrier. To make matters worse, methylmercury is probably the most toxic mercury derivative. It's more or less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn#Accident_and_death" target="_blank">nightmare fuel</a>.</p></div>		</li>
