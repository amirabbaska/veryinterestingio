			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, water has a high thermal conductivity compared to air, but not compared to many metals. That's why these CPU cooling enthusiasts sometimes have the wrong idea, trying to get the water as close as possible to the tiny CPU. It is sometimes better to have a copper heat spreader and then cool that, because you can get more water going past it due to its larger surface area.</p>
<p>Edited to add: someone below asked about using a liquid metal instead of water, which wouldn't really work that well, but there do exist more exotic cooling methods that do work extremely well. One example is heat pipes, which can be thousands of times more thermally conductive than even copper.</p>
<p>Edit 2: when I say liquid metal cooling, I'm specifically talking about CPUs. Liquid metal cooling is used in some extremely specific cases, mainly nuclear reactors (as mentioned below)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadly speaking, you <em>do</em> want the water as close as possible to the CPU (block thickness), but you also need the appropriate surface area for effective cooling (fins).</p>
<p>Heat exchanger design is something I do on a regular basis.  There is definitely a fine balance in designing the most effective (smallest/cheapest and best performing) heat exchanger.  Obviously there is a practical limit on how thin the metal wall can be sitting against the CPU.  Likewise, there is a practical limit on how dense you would like your fin-fan area to be, since this increases pressure drop quickly.  More pressure drop means a better heat transfer coefficient, but a more powerful pump is required (larger flow).  It often boils (heh) down to a balance of material cost (CAPEX) vs power cost (OPEX)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying anything you said is wrong here but people in the pc community  will take what you are saying out of context. People in the pc community seem to think that having a copper plate between the die of the cpu and the heat exchanger will improve cooling performance. They believe that this copper plate spreads heat better or faster than the base of the heat exchanger, which is also a copper plate. More surface area increases heat transfer (generally) but an ihs doesn't do anything that the base of a waterblock doesnt already do and requires an extra layer of thermal interface material, thus lowering heat transfer. (assuming all else is equal) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Convective cooling is much more effective than pure conduction though. That's why high-end cooling systems use either forced convection (pumping water around) or evaporative cooling (vapor chambers and heatpipes). It's much more effective than just a big chunk of metal, even if the heat conductivity of the metal is somewhat higher than that of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure the person you're replying to wasn't proposing getting rid of the convective cooling altogether, if that's what your comment is about. It's kind of hard to make sense of it.</p>
<p>All active cooling in computers happens in two stages:</p>
<p>Stage 1 has the goal of moving the heat away from the CPU as quickly as possible (keeping it below a critical temp), and providing move surface area for the heat to dissipate from. Metal heatsinks are great at this, and more metal means more heat capacity and often more surface area.</p>
<p>Stage 2 is removing heat from the system entirely. Fans blowing air over the heat sink can do this, though water cooling is better as it helps keep the whole heat sink/CPU system down at reasonable levels even when taking into account temperature spikes.</p>
<p>Saying convective cooling is &quot;better&quot; than conductive cooling missed the point of the post you're replying to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the design. But generally yes. Two phase &gt; convection &gt; conduction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um. Maybe there are refrigerants that prove me wrong but I think conductive heat transfer is always preferable over convective. The problem with conduction is that you still need to move heat out of the heat sink. As opposed to convective where typically you're able to move heat out of the system in its entirety. It's pretty hard to beat the thermal conductivity of metals. </p>
<p>The difference being that having someone remove and attach heatsinks periodically works better than a convective system. But doing so is not desirable for obvious reasons. Removing heat from an element favors conduction. Getting heat out of a system favors convection which is independent of thermal conductivity. </p>
<p>So if you had a heated element. It will cool down faster if you attached a copper heat sink at 0degC compared to blowing 0degC of air on it. But eventually the heat sink would no longer be 0degC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GSNZv6r.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is what it looks like. That's a water cooling block for a graphics card; the GPU chip on the card generates most of the heat. It sits right beneath that area in the middle with the fins. The heat is conducted from the silicon into the metal, and then up into those fins, which increase the surface area in contact with the water that gets pumped through.</p>
<p>There's also a small amount of thermal paste applied between the silicon chip and the metal block, but that's only to fill out tiny surface irregularities so there aren't pockets of air impeding the heat transfer. The thermal paste conducts heat much better than air, but considerably worse than either silicon, metal, or water, so you apply only a thin layer of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's even better, and if you add another layer of metal to create a seperate channel for a different liquid to flow through, you've created a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P8RTLP/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B071P8RTLP&amp;pd_rd_wg=poM0U&amp;pd_rd_r=TBBQTQRDDHZT6Q48NQPQ&amp;pd_rd_w=Smt5J" target="_blank">counterflow chiller</a>.  It lets you use cold water flowing through one pipe to rapidly cool down liquid in the other pipe without mixing the two.</p>
<p>I own <a href="https://www.northernbrewer.com/therminator" target="_blank">this one</a> and it can bring ten gallons of boiling wort (unfermented beer) down to room temperature in about five minutes.</p>
