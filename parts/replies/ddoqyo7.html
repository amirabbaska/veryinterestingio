			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans can passively harness the weak force this way, and we actually can manipulate the weak force actively. That's what the particle accelerators do. By shooting protons at the nucleus of an atom, you're pretty much manipulating the weak force and every hit is the interaction of weak force, and it is guaranteed to generate a bunch of electrons and neutrinos. If there's a way to intercept neutrinos easily, you can use particle accelerator to transmit crystal clear data across the galaxy right through stars, planets and dust cloud. But the thing is that, neutrinos rarely interact with anything else except via weak interaction. Nonetheless, neutrino-based communication has been archieved so far at the FermiLab at speed of 1 bit per 10 seconds across about 1000km of distance! This is no small feat. It proves that neutrinos oscillate and this netted them a Nobel Prize!</p></div>		</li>
