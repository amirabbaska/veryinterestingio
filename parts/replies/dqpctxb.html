			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;ways to extract it efficiently&quot; is the core of the issue.  When people say &quot;we only have X years of proven reserves of commodity Y&quot; that has a very specific meaning: as I recall a proven reserve is an area demonstrated to contain the commodity in a form which is economical to extract (ie. Sale price is higher than costing extraction). </p>
<p>Decades ago no-one would have considered sucking the oil out of sand when you could just make a hole in the ground in an oil field and get liquid oil out.  As time goes by two things happen: new extraction techniques make it easier/cheaper to extract, and lowering supply increases the price meaning it's now economical to extract from somewhere that previously wasn't.</p>
<p>These combine to mean the end of today's &quot;proven reserves&quot; is not the point at which the world has run out.  That's not even counting new techniques for finding reserves we didn't know were present before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what specifically you are trying to create through alchemy.</p>
<p>Technically nuclear fission is atomic-transmutation, it converts heavier elements into lighter elements, right down to iron naturally, lighter is possible but takes more energy to create than you get out of the process, so you have to start pumping energy in which is really not cost effective.</p>
<p>Effective nuclear fusion would be required for creating heavier elements, and likely would be required to even make fission-created lighter elements economically viable, since the energy required is frankly ridiculous and I simply don't see it as ever being a viable thing without essentially free energy, and fusion is the closest thing to that that we currently know of (obviously  it's not actually <em>free</em>, but a hell of a lot closer than any other source we know of).</p>
<p>So the answer is &quot;Not before Fusion&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Investors have been investing a lot of resources into making that more practical for 45 years, ever since the 1973 crisis, and commercial extraction of oil from sands on a large scale began a decade before that</p></div>		</li>
