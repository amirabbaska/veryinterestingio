<p>That's not what happened at Fukushima.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster#T.C5.8Dhoku_earthquake" target="_blank">The reactors shut down immediately,</a> fission stopped before the ground stopped shaking.  Unfortunately, fission produces short lived daughter elements that have short half lives, therefore decay extremely quickly.  Even after the emergency shutdown, the fuel needs water cooling for <em>weeks</em> before the fuel rods are cool enough not to melt.</p>
<p>Even once they take spent fuel from the reactor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spent_fuel_pool" target="_blank">it generates heat for 4-6 years and has to be kept under water.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants won't explode, hence the term &quot;Meltdown&quot; which is what happened at Chernobyl. Nuclear reactors work on generating lots of heat to power turbines with steam (heat from reaction generates steam which turns a turbine which generates electricity).</p>
<p>In the event of a direct hit, the worst case is that the cooling fails, which eventually causes all the water in the reactor to boil off, which causes the rods/reactor to overheat and melt. With Chernobyl it melted through the floor into a giant <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/chernobyls-hot-mess-the-elephants-foot-is-still-lethal" target="_blank">Elephant's foot</a> of radioactivity that would kill you with in a very short amount of time. The risk isn't an explosion, but releasing a lot of HIGHLY radioactive material.</p></div>		</li>
