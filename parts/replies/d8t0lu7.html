			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish there were errors bars on these numbers. I studied chemistry and have run most of these measurements at one point or another.</p>
<p>Measuring sodium was notoriously unreliable. Working with sugars was just super messy and tedious. And the results were often poorly reproducible when double checked with an alternative method. Heck, even something as basic as a bomb calorimeter had surprising variations.</p>
<p>We were required to measure with 1% accuracy, and labs often claim better than that. Funnily enough though, I have seen plenty of samples, where the lab results were wildly different from what we could measure, and everybody swore that their results were absolutely correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't get paid anything, I was doing a year in industry in the middle of my degree. They bought me a monthly bus pass for my trouble haha!</p>
<p>It was public sector though and it wasn't well paid. I think someone else was being paid Â£19k and she'd been there a while. I don't think she had a degree though, she'd got into the lab business decades ago when a degree wasn't necessary and by the time they were necessary had more experience.</p>
<p>My degree is in biology but one person there had one in photography so I'm pretty sure it didn't matter what you had. </p></div>		</li>
