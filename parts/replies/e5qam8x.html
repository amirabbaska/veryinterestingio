			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a massive reach from the data. Lower CRP and WCC count does not necessarily mean impaired immunity in any meaningful sense, and in fact could be read the other way around - infections progress to a more severe stage in lower muscle mass patients requiring and causing higher levels of CRP/WCC. High CRP and WCC is strongly associated with mortality in infection, so it doesn't seem clear to me that high levels should be seen as a good thing, even if they are high for a purpose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't seem to be able to get that abstract to see if the study design mitigates this at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That abstract seems <strong>highly</strong> questionable to me, as CRP and WBC are extremely nonspecific blood tests that can be elevated or suppressed for a lot of different reasons. Having a slightly lower WBC does not tell you anything about whether your immune system is stronger or weaker.</p>
<p>In order to prove that excess skeletal muscle mass suppresses immune system function, you would have to show evidence of increased infectious disease incidence, prevalence, or mortality in very muscular individuals. To my knowledge, there is no high quality evidence in humans that supports this.</p>
<p>Obesity correlates with a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974637" target="_blank">significantly increased risk</a> of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27385315" target="_blank">death from influenza</a>. Obesity is correlated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28069657" target="_blank">severe soft tissue infections</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26518067" target="_blank">urinary tract infections</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29677586" target="_blank">sepsis mortality</a>.</p>
<p>Only non-influenza pneumonia appears to be less severe in obese patients, a finding known as the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24722122" target="_blank">obesity survival paradox</a>.</p>
<p>So from a MD standpoint it seems highly implausible that obesity would be protective against infectious disease, or that lean muscle mass would confer susceptibility to infectious disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what /u/SkamGnal said. The original hypotheses were evolutionary biology hypotheses around fitness (in the evolutionary biology sense) which assumed the characteristics were at least partially heritable and the published results were, to some degree, supportive of this hypothesis. Also, I believe it is a more widely accepted fact that these muscular characteristic traits are heritable than that they have a relationship to the immune system so &quot;naturally fit or muscular bodies&quot; was designed to build upon that common understanding on the way to talking about a more contentious issue.</p></div>		</li>
