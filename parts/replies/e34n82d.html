<p>When a nuke goes off, it gives off a LOT of light. There's so much that it can pass right through your skin. Bones, being more dense, are harder for the light to penetrate, so the light that hits your bones never reaches your eyes, but you can see the light that went through your skin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not... really.</p>
<p>You see the light, period. Where it has been may have changed the nature of the light, in terms of component wavelengths or polarity.</p>
<p>WRT seeing your bones through your skin, you can do this with a bright enough flashlight... it's really not that exotic of a phenomenon, a nuke blast is just much much brighter than a flashlight held to the opposite side of your hand.</p></div>		</li>
