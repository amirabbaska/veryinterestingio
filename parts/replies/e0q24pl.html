			<div class="markdown"><p>Epinephrine is used of acute allergic reactions because it is a powerful vasoconstrictor that quick reduces the swelling that causes airways to close up when someone is in anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>Epinephrine is just a synthetic adrenaline. When you jack off, among all those wonderful endorphins you release to make your orgasm feel so damn good, you also release a bit of adrenaline which magically unstuffs your sinuses. Good stuff!</p>
<p>So, when you get all teary eyed and stuffed up because of all the beautiful plant sex going on, whip it out and wank til you can’t wank no more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if you are jacking off while the plants are blowing their loads in your nose and eyes, what kind of sex act is that? It is certainly more than a threesome, and it isn’t beastiality. I guess my best guess would be infinitum-phyto-philia: aka, masturbating when your allergies are acting up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. But you surely know that the nose and mouth are connected by a canal. And Vicks contains some chemical compounds that make the swelling go away temporarily. By sucking on it, these compounds enter the nose through that canal and then the swelling goes away.</p></div>		</li>
