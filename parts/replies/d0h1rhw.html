			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask something dumb about lasers? I used to be a stupid kid. I'd look into lasers all the time, and not even just the pointers. I was fascinated by them and bought a pretty strong purple laser for like $30 off Amazon a while back. I shined it right into my eye for about 10 seconds and I went blind for like 5 minutes. Why are lasers so feared in that regard? For reference, I currently have 20/20 vision. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Would you really say they are &quot;focused&quot; ? It's already a narrow coherent ray of photons. I'd say the eye's lens might <em>bend</em> them, but they don't really focus them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you were old enough to be able to buy something on Amazon but still shined a laser in your eye for 10 seconds? I'm genuinely curious what you were thinking. Were you just okay with potentially blinding yourself for life for the sake of experiment? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lasers have a lot of energy, and they will partially give off that energy when they pass through your eye. Resulting in heating and eventually burning. This is pretty much the same concept as with sunlight. The reason why you went blind for a couple of minutes is probably because your cones became over-saturated. The laser itself probably wasn't powerful enough to do long term damage with 10 seconds of exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, lasers with wavelength &lt;1.3 um or so can get focused by the lens. So many lasers (especially IR lasers around 1um since you have no blink reflex there) can get focused to a very small point and damage that way.</p></div>		</li>
