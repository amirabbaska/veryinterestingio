			<div class="markdown"><p>That whole episode got the basic physics wrong, however. A black hole has exactly as much gravity as the star that created it, so there's no reason that the collapsed star would suddenly consume the neighboring star, never mind the planet in question. If the sun somehow turned into a black hole, it wouldn't affect the Earth's orbit at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wait, so we would just start orbiting a black hole instead? If the gravity is the same, do black holes never get bigger? How are the current black holes so huge then?</p>

<p>Sorry if it is a multitude of dumb questions on top of each other, I've just never heard of the black hole gravity thing before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They only get bigger if things fall into them, so no, not really. No different than how a star or planet gets bigger.</p>
<p>Black holes are big because they were once giant stars whose cores became so dense (due to millenia of nuclear fusion) that it collapsed into a black hole. Any resulting black hole is still much smaller than the star it was originally formed from, but has the same amount of mass, and thus, gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Black holes are just an area of incredibly dense matter. And don't worry about asking questions, that's how everyone learns! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer the first one! At the center of galaxies lie black holes! We’re just rotating around them. It’s essentially objects so massive lights can’t escape, and have weird proprieties. But still stuff can orbit around them given enough momentum and a correct trajectory to avoid “falling in” it. For as much massive as they are their mass is still finite, so is their gravitational pull. Strong yeah, but finite.</p>
<p>Let me add: it could be possible (if not very likely) that eventually everything will end up in black holes. It’s just happening veeeery slowly and will probably take billions of years to get there. So enjoy the dance! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The thing about a black hole is, it's going to be a smaller volume than the star that created it - so, in theory you can get closer to it and thus experience bigger tidal forces and a bigger gravitational pull.</p>
<p>It's at these distances where the 'light can't escape', 'you get stretched out to spaghetti because of the big difference between the gravity at your feet and your head' etc would happen.</p>
<p>From the same distance though, it's no different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I figured the only way a black hole would start sucking in the planet is if another massive object merged with their star.</p>
<p>And that's what they did, but they used a binary star system - something the planet would have already been orbiting just fine.  So they still wouldn't be sucked in towards it.</p>
<p>If it had been a rogue star, then maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A star neighboring a blackhole is still spewing gas out which might eventually fall into the black hole. That's how a star will lose it's mass into a black hole and get consumed. Regarding the planets and any other objects, the only mechanism that a black hole sucks things in is through gravitational waves (objects will lose their kinetic energy by propagating gravitational waves) and eventually get too close to get shredded by tidal forces. Then the shredded material might lose it's kinetic energy due to friction and convert kinetic energy to heat (which becomes visible and well call it accretion disk) and eventually fall in.<br />
Sci-fi usually gets this concept wrong and assumes a black hole sucks things in the way the water goes down the drain.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the penultimate episode/finale of S10 of Doctor Who takes place in a colony ship slowly coming out of black hole- when the ship got to the edge of the black hole, they sent some people to the other end, and eventually a society develops at the bottom after the elevator gets stuck from the kids of those people while the protagonists are still talking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a continuity error in that episode in regards to the video feed. They see time as frozen on the video feed, but tilt the camera in real time. It has been about ten years since I watched it but I'm sure I noticed that.</p></div>		</li>
