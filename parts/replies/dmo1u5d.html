<p>The biggest factor is pressure difference. And atmospheric pressure just doesn't have enough gradient at any given level to make it worse right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the hurricane causes the pressure difference, not the other way around.  The hurricane gathers energy from the environment, mostly warmer sea waters, from which it can generate large storms and lower internal pressures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind speed increases as the pressure gradient increases, that's true. However so does the amount of energy dissipated due to friction. The pressure gradient can only ever get so large because at that point the wind speeds are so high (~200mph+ over warm sea surfaces)  that so much energy is being lost to friction that the storm can no longer lower the pressure further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A hurricane is essentially a heat engine - warm water from the sea surface evaporates, rises into the hurricane/tropical cyclone, condenses and releases latent heat (energy). This excess energy often manifests as an increase in organisation of the system and an increase in wind speed. Hurricanes dissipate energy mainly through friction from the wind interacting with the surface in the boundary layer.</p>
<p>So essentially, the rate at which a hurricane can gain energy is proportional to the evaporation rate of water in to the hurricane, and the rate at which a hurricane loses energy is proportional to the wind speed (to first order).</p>
<p>The rate of evaporation is controlled by the sea surface temperature/ocean heat content along with the wind speed (faster wind=more evaporation). Evaporation rate increases with increasing wind speed linearly, however energy dissipated through friction does not, so at some point we reach an equilibrium - and the exact point of this equilibrium is controlled by the sea surface temperatures.</p>
<p>The storms that we occasionally see like Patricia, Haiyan, etc are likely all to be pretty close to this equilibrium, though I don't think an exact figure has been given for the exact value of this &quot;cap&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
