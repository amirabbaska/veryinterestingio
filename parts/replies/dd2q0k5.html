			<div class="markdown"><p>Children can hear 20khz, sometimes 22khz. It slowly rolls off with age. Once you hit age 20, most people can no longer hear above 15-17khz. For example, I'm 22 but I can't hear above 16khz.</p>
<p>You're not losing your hearing faster than anyone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda random though. I (36) have a fair dose of tinnitus and pretty lousy hearing these days. My little brother is 32, has been to <em>way</em> more metal concerts than I have, and can still hear flyback transformers and those creepy noise generators people put outside stores to deter teenagers and/or fruit bats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loss of hearing at high frequency is unavoidabe into adulthood.  The  part of the ear that responds to sound is like a long coil that gradually gets thinner and thinner at the tip.  The thinnest part rrsponds to high frequency.  Exposure to loud noises breaks off the thinnest part leaving you with lower freqs only. Just be smart about hearing protection and you will hear fine for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have extremely loud ringing at times, but the weird thing is I can still hear the quietest sounds at the same time. For example, when loud ringing is present, I can still hear a soft finger tap on my desk, etc. Bizarre!</p></div>		</li>
