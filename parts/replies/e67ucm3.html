			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not the entire story though, you still feel cold even if you are not sweaty, and the reason is the wind is dislodging that fine layer of warm air on your body kept like that by your body heat (usually captured by body hair)....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, air is a pretty good insulator. That's why double pane windows work to keep cold from seeping in through glass windows (or actually the heat inside escaping). There is a layer of air between the glass working to insulate your house.</p>
<p>And so your body warms up the air around you, and it can't get far. But then the wind blows it away and there is new air to warm up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most dual pane windows use Argon between the panes, not air. Argon’s thermal conductivity is much less than air, so you get something like 6x better insulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, this explains how the double-walled vacuum sealed water bottles insulate so well. Is there anything special about the air in between the two walls? Or is it just trapped air?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you want the science words to google:</p>
<ul>
<li>forced convection (what it's called when you're cooling/heating something with a moving fluid, especially look at what a <em>heat transfer coefficent (HTC)</em> is)</li>
<li>hydraulic/thermal boundary layer (BL) (the region in which the heat transfer effect occurs. The <em>Dittus-Boetler</em> correlation is a famous correlation between BLs and HTCs)</li>
<li>Laminar vs Turbulent BLs</li>
</ul>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to learn more, any intro to/fundamentals of heat transfer textbook worth its salt will have at least a chapter on forced convection. You can usually find free PDFs of good textbooks around the interwebs if you know where to look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can not believe this answer is bueried down here. Forced convection is the answer here. It leads to a better heat transfer (air - skin). So if the air-temperature is colder than your skin wind makes it feel even colder. It's the other way round when the air is hotter than your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the main reason, yes.</p>
<p>A secondary reason is that even when it's warm, the air is still likely at a lower temperature than your skin, so even without evaporation you'd get cooled down by increased airflow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually makes sense a lot. I thought that it has to do something with sweat because we always feel the temperature of liquids with more intensity. Say, when we go to a swimming pool, eventho the temp of the water is 28°C, we still feel like it is cold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because water is much better conductor of heat. The temperature of air or water isn't the temperature you feel, you actually just feel the temperature of your skin. Since air isn't a very good conductor of heat, it doesn't feel as cold as water. If you stick your warm hand in a pool, the water will cool it down much faster than air at the same temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Stick your hand in your freezer. It’s cold, but not as cold as sticking your hand in 32F water. Same temperature, higher delta Q (heat energy). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, water transfers heat something like 20x more efficiently than air.</p>
<p>But even without water, the effect is still noticeable with enough wind, as long as it's cooler than your body. I have a motorcycle, and without a windproof jacket, anything below 75F (24C) is uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Conversely, when it's more than 95 or so out (35C), it doesn't matter how fast you go. At 100+mph, it's still like riding in a furnace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've ridden up to 115F in Vegas during the summer. Once you get past a certain point it feels like you're in a blast furnace while moving, and you're actually cooler when you stop and your sweat doesn't evaporate instantly. The relief is incredible.</p></div>		</li>
