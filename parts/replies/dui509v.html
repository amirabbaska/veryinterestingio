			<div class="markdown"><p>When TV was invented, they synced the scan rate for the picture to the frequency of the local power grid, because it was easy or something.</p>
<p>This meant that television in countries with 60hz mains scanned at 60hz, and television in countries with 50hz mains scanned at 50hz.</p>
<p>Because television signals need to continue to be compatible with existing televisions, this didn't change even as the technical requirements driving these limitations went away.</p>
<p>So, television produced in the US scans at 60hz (technically 59.94 because they slowed the frame rate in the 50s when they added color, and even today when the technical reasons they reduced the framerate aren't valid anymore, we're still stuck with it and all the complications involved in counting a non-integer number of frames in a second), and television produced in Europe scans at 50hz. Thanks to modern broadcasting standards it's possible that you're watching the native 60hz and it looks a little smoother, but it's also possible that you're watching that 60hz converted to 50hz, which is not an artifact-free process.</p>
<p>Welcome to the difficulties introduced when you have widely-deployed technologies in continuous use alongside a century of technological development that should have made them obsolete. God help us when the internet is a hundred years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! For the 99.9% of people watching on modern TVs, not an issue at all. It's just that widely deployed standards have to be <em>extremely</em> conservative about what they change because often times, badly designed equipment makes bad assumptions about their input, which will be exposed when you change the things that are being assumed. The number of people watching TV in 50hz regions numbers in the <em>billions</em>. Or whatever your weird British word is for 10^9. It's that number. It's a big number no matter what you call it. And that's a lot of opportunities for things to go wrong if you change something as fundamental as the frame rate.</p>
<p>American television hasn't even rounded its frame rate off to an even 60 fps, even though the technical reasons the frame rate was slowed to 59.94 haven't existed since analog television went off the air...</p></div>		</li>
