			<div class="markdown"><p>Does life really have a purpose though? Things exist, and we do too, except we are alive. There is no purpose to existence. Evolution's only goal is to survive. Beyond that there is no other motive.</p>
<p>Now we can no longer look for a purpose, but make one, for our own existence. That's what I think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something deeply profound and beautiful I think you're missing here, although I agree with everything you said.</p>
<p>Our purpose is TO BE the ones who create purpose, from nothing.</p>
<p>The same way a tree's &quot;purpose&quot; (if you could call it that) encompasses all of its abilities and potentials: grow and survive, photosynthesize, fruit, try to spread it's seeds, be shelter to small animals, shade to a tired man, food for the fungi once it falls etc...then we must find our &quot;purpose&quot; or niche in the grand scheme of nature by first looking at our abilities/potentials also. And we may be the very first living beings on Earth that has ever had the ability to catalyze purpose/meaning from nothing.</p>
<p>We may be the only species to ever walk the Earth that can lift the veil of reality and peer into the cogs and bolts underneath, breathlessly marvelling at its beauty and design.</p>
<p>Intelligent species like us, if they exist, wherever they exist, are like eyes of the universe opening up on itself, to be amazed at its own beauty. We're here to be exactly what nature has made us be: the ones who wonder at it all, and ask the big questions, for the fun of finding answers. So the universe can laugh, play, stare at its own beauty, and discover itself, through us. As we are it, and it is us.</p>
<p>And the universe made us creatures who can alchemically grant meaning or purpose to whatever we want, and as long as we have such ability, or any ability for that matter, it is our DESTINY to use it.</p>
<p>And with destiny, you have your purpose:</p>
<p>To be the ones who create purpose, from nothing. :)</p>
<p>Peace and love friend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this is truly a breathtaking post! I love reddit for these moments. </p>
<p>Just another question then, is it really our destiny to use any ability if we possess one? Isn't that us making sense of it? Must an ability necessarily be used? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I’m wrong, but what you argued sounds a lot like existentialism one the sense that we create our own purpose. </p>
<p>Although I agree with your sentiment up till this point, saying that we are TO BE the ones who create purpose is a bit of a stretch. WE don’t have to have a purpose. This is the point of the evolution. We live to live - nothing more. </p>
<p>This is a completely subjective perspective. I just love discussing this subject. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep exactly. </p>
<p>Here’s a thought experiment to help reinforce what this person is (so eloquently) saying.</p>
<p>Imagine you were to draw our solar system on a piece of paper. The sun and our neighboring planets. The you give someone the following instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>circle the location of <em>love</em> in this solar system</li>
<li>circle the location of <em>meaning</em> in this solar system</li>
<li>circle the location of <em>joy</em> in this solar system</li>
</ul>
<p>You wouldn’t circle empty space, you wouldn’t circle a random desolate moon, or the planet Mercury. You would circle the earth. Where life is. The planet that is bustling with love, meaning, and joy and so much more.</p>
<p>Does the universe itself care? Yes it does. Life is the part of the the universe that cares. </p></div>		</li>
