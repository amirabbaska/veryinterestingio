The astronauts and cosmonauts will be basically laying on their backs during launch and reentry.  The Gs that they feel will be like gravity just got a lot heavier and pressing them down on their backs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you imagine an enormous sphere of water hovering in front of you, the force against you entering it is going to oppose whatever direction you enter it from. So yes, if you drove a car into it some direction, your car is going to have acceleration in the opposite direction and thus slow down and you are going to feel the same acceleration because you're linked to the vehicle by your seat belt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure what you are trying to say.</p>
<p>Are you trying to point out that friction isn't a fundamental force. And that when dealing with friction from fluids it is really because fluids resist compression and that is where the force is coming from?</p>
<p>Because in mechanics and aerodynamics, nobody really cares about that. And just discusses friction as an actual force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's right, it's not friction.</p>
<p>The ELI5 is that the air can't get out of the way fast enough. It's like the resistive force in a piston. It is <em>not</em> friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you're going almost straight down, rather than at a shallow angle, like you usually go for. So instead of bleeding off most of your speed slowly in the thinner upper atmosphere, you hit the lower (denser) atmosphere still going pretty darn fast, and you decelerate in just a few minutes. The deceleration occurs over less time, so you experience more force. Belly flopping is a good metaphor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Its hard to imagine, but spacecraft &quot;take their time&quot; while at hyper sonic speeds....</p>
<p>Fuck its kinda hard to ELI5 rocket science.</p>
<p>Easiest way to imagine it is having your car coast to a stop (shallow angle through lower pressure parts to lose speed slowly) vs slamming the brakes on (descend through atmosphere at harsh angle losing speed quickly.)</p>
<p>Little friction vs lots of friction.</p>
<p>Fortunately for our cosmonauts, <a href="https://youtu.be/nVOb3RzS5t4?t=106" target="_blank">they didn't get to experience the less than ideal form of deceleration</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is like diving into a pool. Except instead of water it is the atmosphere of Earth. It is sudden because there is a sudden layer of gas there.</p>
<p>Generally spacecraft orbit the Earth at about 17,500 mph. That is also how fast they are going when they hit the atmosphere. Friction force of a fluid is F= 1/2<em>density of air </em> velocity of object^2 * coefficient of friction. Since the velocity of the spacecraft is so high, it is a huge force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it’s still not friction that’s slowing down the spacecraft, it’s compressing the air in front of it which heats up the air. The kinetic energy is being changed into mechanical energy and then heat, reducing the kinetic energy the spacecraft has. </p></div>		</li>
