			<div class="markdown"><p>I wash with hot and rinse with cold. Then I let the cold water run over me for a little bit. I work outside all day and it helps cool me down so much better than just drinking lots of water and putting on a bunch of fans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ANAD but Cold showers stimulate blood flow (as your body attempts to bring heat to the places where the cold water was). Cold showers are definitely my &quot;let's make sure I wake up&quot; technique. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say length of shower would have a lot to do with the effect. Physiologically, the body kind of does the opposite as you said. Exposure to cold causes blood vessels to constrict in peripheral (outermost) tissues to protect core body temperature by preventing as much blood as possible from being exposed to cold. So, quick cold shower burst would cause wakefulness, but full-length cold shower causes bodily stress and defense mechanisms. What I've been doing for years, right or wrong, is a pretty hot shower, then I spike the water to cold just before I turn it off. The perfectly balanced benefit of both comfort and adrenaline. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Cold showers, on the other hand, put the brain on an alert state, thus &quot;waking&quot; or &quot;energizing&quot; -as you said- the body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my knowledge i could only explain the blood circulation bit: Cold temperatures causes blood to move to your organs and extremities to keep them warm, aiding in good blood circulation.</p>
