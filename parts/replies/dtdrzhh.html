<p>Is there measurable loss to sound travel caused by an AVERAGE wind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Measurable? Absolutely. Ultrasonic wind sensors are a thing. </p>
<p>You've probably seen anemometers that measure wind speed with a set of spinning cups. The faster the wind, the faster the spin. Ultrasonic wind sensors have no moving parts, just a speaker plus a microphone. The speaker emits a peep that the microphone listens for. The air in between them carries the sound, and if the air in between them is moving then the sound gets carried along faster downwind and is slowed down when it's traveling upwind. An ultrasonic wind sensor measures how much slower or faster that peep of sound travels, and is able to figure out the speed (and direction) of the air around it.</p>
<p>Now as to whether YOU would be able to hear a difference, I don't know.</p>
<p>If you're listening to something and there is wind, then it is like being at the top of an escalator and the sound is walking towards you from the bottom. If it's an up-escalator the sound gets to you faster, if it's a down-escalator it gets to you slower. Wind works like an escalator for sound, speeding its trip or slowing it down. And the longer the sound has to travel, the more steps it takes and the more tired and quiet it will be when it gets to you. </p>
<p>Sound is usually pretty fast compared to wind. If wind is like an escalator, it's a very very very slow one. It does not save sound very much travel time. If a sound was going to take 750 steps to get to you, then riding the wind escalator might save it one or two steps. Going against the wind might cost sound one or two steps. It won't be much more tired when it gets to you, so it won't be much softer or louder. You'd have to be an ultrasonic wind sensor to hear the difference. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Your intuition serves you well. One common design is a microphone+speaker (a transducer, technically) at four points, say a north/south and an east/west pair. So you get a north/south vector and an east/west vector, and you combine them for direction and speed. There's also a three-transducer design out there. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Someone is going to argue that a speaker is the moving part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wind would make it so that you can get a the noise from further away if you're down wind but the noise will be audible from less distance if you're up wind. (Assuming the sound you're emitting is being emmited evenly in all directions)</p>
<p>The sound we hear is the particles in and around our ear vibrating to the frequency of whatever caused the sound and that vibration wave rippling through the invisible particles of our air. The wind would t literally &quot;blow the sound&quot; but it will blow the particles that are vibrating to bring you the sound.</p>
<p>You will also hear it faster down wind and slower up wind</p>
<p>I would imagine that in a stream or current of water this would work the same but to a much stronger extent </p></div>		</li>
