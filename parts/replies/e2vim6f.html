			<div class="markdown"><p>Light always spreads out proportional to the square of the distance from the source (unless its a laser).</p>
<p>If you have a torch at the end of a dark field pointed at you, you can just about see it, and it's not very bright. If you go and poke the torch in your eye, it's very bright.</p>
<p>Edit: if it were a laser dinosaur then different rules may apply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has to.  Its one of those strange properties of being both a particle and a wave.  We assume it will behave partically, and be straight, because thats what light does....but then the photon goes all schrodingger on us and ends up in two places at once.  Then the wave properties have to get involed, and then of a sudden we must follow the rules of the inverse square.</p>
<p>Its a funny place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to go with yes. Because the original original question included a “telescope powerful enough”. Telescopes are measured not just in their ability to magnify but mostly in their ability to gather light, which, as WeRegretToInform points out, tends to spread out.  The aperture of such a telescope wide enough to gather sufficient photons, might itself be measurable in light years.</p>
<p>This question seems to me to be more about the speed of light than telescope hardware though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is technically correct. While telescopes as we know them currently wouldn't gather enough photons, we're not exactly playing by the rules since we're assuming OP can teleport this distance, anyway. So we can imagine having a telescope of this capacity for the thought experiment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah too many of these responses are like &quot;well let me extrapolate today's technology and understanding of science and engineering and apply it to this hypothetical question (that is clearly posed as a thought experiment about the speed of light and not an actual design requirements spec) - so no you can't do it&quot;.</p>
<p>if you had asked humans a thousand years ago if we could observe the universe at the scale and detail that we take for granted right now, you'd get all these same kinds of &quot;haha no way you can scale medieval technology to be able to do that&quot;.</p>
<p>a thousand years ago you might have had your head cut off for suggesting you could build a giant rocket to carry a huge floating telescope with &quot;computation machines&quot; in it into space outside our atmosphere and communicate with it via &quot;magical invisible wireless information waves&quot;, and yet hubble is old and boring now.</p>
<p>even now there are so many tricks used to back calculate artifacts out of astronomical imaging, ways of increasing optical imaging resolution that don't just involve &quot;MAKE THE TELESCOPE BIGGER&quot;. none of these common techniques used now were even a figment of the imagination a few centuries ago.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the tech needed to build something like this would still categorize it as a telescope at this point. </p>
<p>Because at a certain distance I believe it would be impossible to see it without either some sort of special visualization tech on top of its ability to capture and magnify the light it can see, or basically be so large that its not a telescope, or be so advanced that it's no longer telescopic and instead its create a window or bending space/time so you can see into the past in present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then again, the argument from the fact that there are interfering light sources - which are going to become even more of a problem when you have a larger lens - does make this potentially wrong still. Unless there were some way to filter out the photons you actually wanted from the photons you did not, but doing so accurately enough to actually pick out the photons you &quot;want&quot; seems like it would be difficult. Perhaps not impossible, but likely so.</p></div>		</li>
