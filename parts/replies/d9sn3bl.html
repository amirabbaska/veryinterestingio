			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a really dumb question, but do they grow their own shells? That has always confused me. Their shells look so aquatic. I know other land animals like turtles grow shells too, but snails are the only land animal I can think of that look like the shells at the beach. </p>
<p>Also, what do they eat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snails do grow their own shells. They add small layers at the opening as the snail body gets bigger. It's the same for both terrestrial and aquatic snails. They need calcium in their diet to make strong shells, which they can get from plants. Aquatic snails eat algae and sometimes need calcium supplements in their tank if the water is too soft. Terrestrial snails eat plants,  some of which are grown in gardens (vegetables, ornamentals, etc), so they are often regarded as pests. But I think snails are cute and should be allowed to live! :)</p>
<p>Edit: there are predatory species of snails (land, freshwater, and marine), that will eat other invertebrates. But the common land snails you can find everywhere are herbivorous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. At first I was like &quot;does no one understand snails?&quot; Seems obvious to me. But then I read this and realised I just kinda assumed snail shells were just....always around. Snails are born and they just cruise around looking for empty shells till they find one then that's their base. Whelp. Shit. </p></div>		</li>
