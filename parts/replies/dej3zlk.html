			<div class="markdown"><p>These aren't magnetic directions, they're flight axis! </p>
<p>Prograde / Retrograde increases and decreases your velocity respectively, and lifting the orbit on the other side as a side effect. </p>
<p>Normal / Anti-normal are perpendicular to the orbit. This'll change the orbit inclination, or &quot;direction&quot; -- you use this to match planes with another body you'd like to transfer to.</p>
<p>Radial / anti-radial are are simply pointing towards or away from the object you're orbiting.</p>
<p>Hope that cleared up the difference between these flight axis and magnetic poles!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those directions are relative to your target and the body you're orbiting lol.  I would think that a compass would probably point towards or away from the nearest star, depending upon its sunspot cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coolmagnetman.com/magspace.htm" target="_blank">http://www.coolmagnetman.com/magspace.htm</a></p>
<p>I guess it would depend upon that, or the composition of the planets near you.  If one's made of molten iron, your compass might point toward or away from it instead of a star.  idk I'm not an expert at this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the ISS, the compass was correctly pointing towards Earth's magnetic North. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not really enough distance away from earth for it to be interesting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is still an interesting experiment they have shown, good video. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you navigate in space, you have to create a new useful coordinate system. To get to the Moon, Apollo used a reference to the stars to determine spacecraft attitude. They'd use numbers for pitch, yaw, and roll to plug into the computer instead of cardinal direction names. They defined points where they called it 0 degrees, so you could think of that as North. It was most likely near the north star.</p>
<p>But since they were going only a short distance, the stars don't appear to move. If you could to navigate throughout our galaxy, you'd need a different reference system since on that scale, you'd be passing through fields of those same stars and their positions would shift noticeably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting here is that with each increase in scale you need new anchoring points, right? Is there a point at which the nearest anchoring object would be too far or too obscured to use? Basically the distance at which you would basically be &quot;lost in the fog&quot; and couldn't navigate back using the current techniques?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. Unless you found yourself many billions of light years away. We have pretty <a href="http://gizmodo.com/new-3d-map-of-the-universe-features-a-whopping-1-2-mill-1783688322" target="_blank">good maps</a> going pretty far out and there are some pretty large-scale landmarks you can use. </p>
<p>You'd have to do some work to account for time and whatnot, but you could probably get enough of an idea to get to a point where landmarks would be more familiar. </p></div>		</li>
