			<div class="markdown"><p>Kelvin is used in physics with 0K representing absolute zero, and is basically C+273.15.</p>
<p>Fahrenheit uses comparatively strange measurement points whilst Celsius used the freezing point (0C) and the boiling point (100C) of water, and as a result requires multiplication <em>and</em> addition to convert between the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kelvin measures how much heat there is in a substance (a little roughly). The idea is that 0K is absolute zero and as the value rises, things get hotter. Degrees C is &quot;just&quot; Kelvin raised up to a useful scale for humans (actually, the definition goes the other way round but that's by the by for this discussion). So an interval of 1 degree C is the same as an interval of 1 Kelvin, it's just that 0C=~250K so the starting point is different.</p>
<p>Farenheit is pretty much arbitrary. It's similar to feet and inches vs. metric system. Feet and inches were great when we didn't have accurate measurements, and it was useful that the number of inches in a foot divides by 2 3 and 4. But actually it is quite easy to have an intuitive feel for metres and centimetres if you grow up with them, and they are more useful for accurate measurements so why not just abolish imperial.</p></div>		</li>
