<p>As it is, though, we know a lot more about outer space than the interior of our own planet. So many of the reasons for space exploration apply, including getting a better understanding of how our solar system evolved and what might have helped give rise to life. We could use these kinds of probes on other planets, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't we just dump the radioactive materials in space? Like lets say build a big spaceship then launch the thing towards the sun and let it burn?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need to drill down that far if you drill the holes into a subducting continental plate, like off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The movement of the plate will slowly carry the waste way down into the mantle. It would take about 10 million years before any of the disposate reappeared in inland volcanos, by which time essentially all the radioactivity would have decayed, if there are any humans around to care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;J radiation&quot; is very unlikely, eye tissue is not easily targeted, as they are just regular animal cells, the rods and cones are actually brain tissue, as they grow out of the developing brain.</p>

<p>And detonating a big big megaton bomb in the core would probably do nothing. That stuff is already very energy dense, with a high density and thus high momentum. The inner core is crushed solid by gravity, radioactive and hot and floats in fluid rock rich in metals that power the geodynamo - at least that's the theory. A detonation would move things a bit, but the resulting shock wave would disperse its energy very fast. (Though the wave would travel far, because dense materials are good pressure wave conductors.)</p>
