<p>As it is, though, we know a lot more about outer space than the interior of our own planet. So many of the reasons for space exploration apply, including getting a better understanding of how our solar system evolved and what might have helped give rise to life. We could use these kinds of probes on other planets, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can't we just dump the radioactive materials in space? Like lets say build a big spaceship then launch the thing towards the sun and let it burn?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need to drill down that far if you drill the holes into a subducting continental plate, like off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The movement of the plate will slowly carry the waste way down into the mantle. It would take about 10 million years before any of the disposate reappeared in inland volcanos, by which time essentially all the radioactivity would have decayed, if there are any humans around to care.</p></div>		</li>
