			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, &quot;no kill&quot; isn't even necessarily true depending on where you are.  The closest NK shelter to me operates slightly differently than you discribe.  They have a network of foster folks and they take in 90% of the animals they are given.  But each one goes through a vet check and if they are too sick to adopt they are put down.  And if a dog that is taken in and found to have aggressive tendencies is put on a &quot;list&quot; and kept for a period of time before it is put down as it is not adoptable or too dangerous to be adopted out.  (Source: Wife worked there.  By the end of her time there we had three dogs, three cats, and two guinea pigs at home.)  </p>
<p>Now I know the immediate reaction is, &quot;Well then that is a kill shelter.&quot;  They call themselves a NK shelter and technicially they are right.  They do not kill for no reason at all.  They will keep a docile, healthy dog until it finds a home or needs to be put down due to complications of old age.  (When it would have probably been put down anyway by a loving owner.)  So by definition of NK in this state, they are NK.  </p>
<p>My take, if you have the means to take care of a pet, adopt a pet.  Preferably an adult as puppies and kittens won't have any trouble being adopted.  (The local shelter can barely keep puppies and kittens around as they are adopted as fast as they come in.)  </p>
<p>And finally, in the wise words of Bob Barker: &quot;Have your pets, spayed or neutered.&quot;  Seriously.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The NK around here will take in an animal and care for it but if it's not adopted by a certain time is sent to the pound where after a couple weeks is put down. They have no issues putting the animal down, as long as they aren't the ones pushing the plunger on the needle they are a NK</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the simple reason that in many people's opinion there's no such thing as a &quot;no kill&quot; shelter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, there are a few true &quot;no-kill&quot; shelters.</p>
<p>There are basically 3 types of shelters.  The standard animal control/animal shelter that has a high kill rate and no funds to take care of animals.  They typically either kill the animals or transfer them to other shelters.</p>
<p>Then there is your <em>restricted access</em> no kill shelter.  These are the fancy shelters that have great dogs and love to tout that they don't have the facilities to even put dogs to sleep.  Yeah, because they only take in adoptable dogs and let the other shelters do their dirty work.  They turn away dogs with medical and discipline problems, mostly.</p>
<p>There are a small amount of <em>open access</em> no kill shelters.  They take in any and all dogs, rehabilitate them, and treat them before adopting them out.  To keep the open access no kill designation, they must kill less than like 2% of the animals they take in.</p>
<p>So, yes, it's technically a kill shelter, but sometimes it is medically necessary to put the animals down, no matter what.  I can't say you are a monster for putting down a dog with stage 4 cancer that can't walk.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are these open access NK shelters able to operate? Do people adopt that many animals? Or do they turn away dogs after the shelter is full?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really sure.  I know the one in my area that I have family members volunteer for and have donated to in the past takes in A LOT of animals.  They claim to not turn any way, but they have aggressive adoption drives, foster animals out, and they partner with petco/petsmart to provide their adoption services as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like people recommend no-kill shelters because they have cuter animals. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, thank you for this information and for shining some light on the subject. </p></div>		</li>
