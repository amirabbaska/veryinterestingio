			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct in terms of river input to ocean salts, however this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the oceans always keep the salt that has been brought to them by the rivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>isn't true, which turns out to be a vital factor for ocean salinity over time. For the most part, ocean salinity has been stable for several million years. This tells us that along with the river input (and it turns out a few other inputs), there are also outputs to the system, keeping it all in balance. </p>
<p>Think of the global oceans more as a sort of way-station for salts, which eventually get passed on to the seafloor rock or the sediments which cover the rock throughout much of the ocean basins. This may happen either directly by coming out of solution and settling to the seafloor; by various chemical reactions which take place in the oceanic crust (most notably at hydrothermal vents) and pore space in the sediments; or indirectly, through biological uptake in organisms which die and settle to the seafloor. </p>
<p>The various different dissolved ions which make up ocean salt vary considerably in the average residence time they spend in the oceans, from years to millions of years, but all will ultimately get passed on to the seafloor and/or sediments below. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One major way the oceans lose salinity that you haven't mentioned: pockets of seawater get closed off from the main ocean, their water evaporates, leaving large salt deposits behind that get buried under later sediments and incorporated into the crust.  The water goes back into the main ocean, making it more dilute.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean and Black Seas are almost isolated today; the Caspian Sea is probably the best example, though in the present day it's getting enough river flow that its salinity is fairly low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. Once a decent amount of continental crust had been formed, the formation of evaporite deposits which remained on land is thought to have significantly reduced the salinity of the oceans. </p></div>		</li>

With the only addition being that rivers can be fed from other sources, such as glacial melt, or underground aquifers </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All fresh-water flowing into the ocean comes from precipitation. Some of it is frozen into glaciers or seeps underground into aquifers before flowing to the ocean but fresh-water always ultimately comes from precipitation. The addition is uneccessary so long as we take &quot;rain&quot; to mean precipitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there were no outputs to the system, then yes, that's what it would mean. Ocean salts are eventually lost to the seafloor though. The system is in balance this way so that ocean salinity remains constant. </p></div>		</li>
