While reading your comment, I figured there's another thing to rowing. An Oar has a length of about 3m. And the rowers are sitting close enough so that if two rowers are completely out of sync(phase difference of half a wavelength), the oars will collide while rowing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space limitations may be the main realistic concern, but even if you had a boat built to leave space for alternating rowing it still wouldn't work as well.  The rowing stroke isn't divided evenly in time.  Think of it in two parts -- the drive (pushing w/ legs and pulling w/ oar) and the recovery (compressing your body back up while the boat moves under you).  If memory serves, it was about a 1 count for the drive and a 3 count for recovery. If you have two alternating teams, team A will finish in 1 count but only be part way ready for their next drive when team B finishes their drive.  You'd get out of sync.    </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the same line of thinking, you have to deal with hundreds of pounds of mass shifting around.  For a 4-man boat, you have 600+ pounds of person moving back and forth.  Even if you had a setup where the stroke was timed to permit alternating teams, you now have a bunch of mass moving in opposite directions.  I don't have time to simulate it right now, but it is probably less efficient, and on top of that it will be harder to keep the boat level.  Those things do not permit much of a roll in either direction before your oars will get out of balance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And when they collide the other ends where the rower holds on is liable to smack the rower in front of them in the back, or the rower who's oar it is in the face/arm/chest.</p>
