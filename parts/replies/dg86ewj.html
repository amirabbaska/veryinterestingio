			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a more precise answer, but the top comment is closer to the explanation you should give a 5 year old. Plus, lots of examples. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top example is awful advice and partially the reason people have an issue. I mean it is commonly (albeit incorrectly) &quot;it was me/her/him&quot; to the question &quot;who did this?&quot; Thus breaking the device. </p>
<p>You should absolutely use the substitution method, but only after you employ this rule first:</p>
<p>&quot;Who&quot; (does the verb) to &quot;whom&quot;? </p>
<p>Which is to also say:
The object of the verb -&gt; whom
Subject if the verb -&gt; who</p>
<p>Much easier to remember and even a five year old can check easily if their usage is correct or not.</p>
<p>Whom ate the sandwich? Wrong
The sandwich ate whom? Correct.</p>
<p>Finally, if you aren't sure, default to who, you'll sound pretentious using whom incorrectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To those with no knowledge of english grammar, the top comment is easier to retain in mind. This answer is excellent too though. </p>
<p>Feel like the top answer should add this greater explanation of the grammar pov to their answer to make it whole. </p></div>		</li>
