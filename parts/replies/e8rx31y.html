			<div class="markdown"><p>I have wondered for a long time if I have this. If someone is speaking with the tv on in the same room or someone else talking, all I hear is a jumble of words. It is almost physically painful to strain hard enough to hear them. I have to use subtitles to make sense of the tv too and I can never seem to decipher song lyrics.</p>
<p>I absolutely hate talking on the phone because I really struggle to make out what people are saying. I avoid clubs and noisy bars because it is almost impossible for me to decipher what people are saying to me. And I really struggle when my kid is talking to me as we walk down a busy street. I constantly have to ask her to repeat herself, but she hears me fine despite all the traffic noise.</p>
<p>Yet I have sharp enough hearing to hear a pin drop on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>Does this sound like what you have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds exactly like what I go through. Along with the comment that replied to you from /u/Bones_and_Tomes about taking an extra moment to process what I've heard. Sometimes even asking, &quot;What?&quot; momentarily followed by, &quot;Oh.&quot; I often have to ask someone to repeat themselves several times despite them speaking clear as day. Which I feel bad about because I hate repeating myself.</p>
<p>The only upside to having auditory dyslexia may be mishearing hilarious phrases and lyrics. In fact I created an /r/AskReddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/38amxu/what_misheard_lyric_to_a_song_do_you/" target="_blank">about misheard lyrics</a> a while back and commented with quite a few of my own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, dyslexic here, where I work I have to take down personal information. Someone spelling out their name initially sounds incomprehensible to me, like I have no ducking clue what they’ve said for about 6 seconds, then all of a sudden the information is perfectly formed in my head, I think it’s something to do with working memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be. I was fine but then I developed a neurological issue and part of the testing involved memory tests. They found issues with executive memory (which I think is the same as working memory) and I also now have to watch tv with subtitles on. Went to ENT a few months ago because I thought it might be deafness, but they couldn't find anything and did suggest it's auditory processing. </p>
<p>My condition is in remission now and my brain will hopefully recover. I'm already noticing I don't need subtitles as much anymore and my short term memory is improving too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s interesting, have you been doing exercises to improve it? I just spoke to my mum(she carries out dyslexia assessments) and she said it’s perfectly possible to asses blind people, some of tests you have to change but others can remain the same and that you also have to be aware other aspects of their brain may be more developed than in others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If something is said to me when I'm not expecting communication, it sounds like Charlie Brown's teacher.</p></div>		</li>
