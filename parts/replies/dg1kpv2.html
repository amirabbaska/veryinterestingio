			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a catch: those rates only apply for treatments that are needed to keep the mouth healthy and free of pain, NOT for cosmetic issues.</p>
<p>The individual dentist gets to decide which is which. And is also allowed to do the cosmetic work for you at full private rates, so they don't have a big incentive to bend the rules for you.</p></div>		</li>
