			<div class="markdown"><p>The early flights on a Sunday morning from Las Vegas will always have people who miss.  Period.</p>
<p>One other thing, on some leisure routes (Las Vegas on a weekend, for example) it really can work to the airline's advantage to overbook, even if they have to take a volunteer, if they know that they're likely to get a volunteer.  Think about it.  Fares can be all over the place.  Now, imagine Mr. Businesspassenger had to book last-minute.  The flight is now overbooked.  Because the plane was so full, only the most expensive fare classes are available.  Mr. Businesspassenger had to pay $1,000 to get on that plane, but it's his company paying for it so he can get to that meeting scheduled last-minute.</p>
<p>Ok, so time to go.  And wouldn't you know it, they're overbooked.  They need a volunteer to take a different flight.  Thankfully, there are lots of tourists out of Miami about to go home.  The agent offers $200 in flight vouchers for a future flight.  Well, Joe Tourist enjoyed his vacation and would love to go on another one soon, so of course he'll volunteer to take another flight in 6 hours!  Heck, he only paid $250 for his ticket in the first place!  So the airline paid $200 to take a passenger that was worth $750 more to them than the passenger who volunteered.  That's more profit.  Airline is happy.  Joe gets a voucher.  Joe is happy.  Mr. Businesspassenger is able to get to his meeting.  He's happy.</p>
<p>Ok, one last thing to consider: not all vouchers actually get redeemed.  From what I heard, only about 40% of vouchers actually do.  So that $200 voucher is more like $80 to the airlines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is definitely an indented feature.  And it is not just fares, it is frequent flier status.  Mr. Businessperson will pay $200 more for most of his flight, so he can keep all of his miles on the same airline and all but guarantee someone else will get booted so he can make his last minute flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>at my airline I've heard 30% or so, but the point stands. Also, the only real expense to the airline is the incremental increase in fuel burn. Sure, there's the missed opportunity cost of selling the seat that this person will now be using a voucher for, but the airlines would rather take the $600/800 whatever to sell the last seat on today's flight, and dish out compensation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a fully refundable ticket / rebook able ticket you can buy them - they are
Normally the 2-3 most expansive booking classes and tend to cost more in economy then a cheap buisness class ticket. So no one buys them actually. </p>
<p>The cheapest fares are non refundable, non endorsable, and non rebookable - meaning of you don't get on the flight you won't get your money back - except fees and airport taxes (at least in Europe) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And thus, the airlines are making more money by both selling non-refundable tickets and by overbooking.  I get that it <em>can</em> lower the overall ticket prices, but making money both ways certainly feels scummy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're non refundable but most airlines most of the time will rebook you at either reduced or no cost if you miss your flight. </p>
<p>My friend actually encountered that situation when he needed to change his flight. He called ahead to change his flight, and they wanted to charge him a rebooking fee. So he didn't. After his flight had left, he called and they rebooked him for free.</p>
<p>Very odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, why not make it non-refundable AND oversell for more profit? People who cannot make it will still not be able to make it and thus cancel.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I see that you mentioned this below! My bad!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a college town, and what I'm always surprised by is that they overbook those small planes that carry like 20 people. It's very unlikely for people to not show on small planes, yet once two people couldn't get on the plane due to overbooking. Does anyone know if there regulation for overbooking? And if there is, does it limit them based on the amount of seats on a plane?</p></div>		</li>
