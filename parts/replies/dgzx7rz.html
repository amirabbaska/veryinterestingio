			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that parody is legal and protected under the first amendment... so if someone did make &quot;dahvengers&quot; as a parody and didn't copy the entire script of the avengers to do it, they could still get away with it.  Although companies will frequently threaten lawsuits and sometimes actually sue in order to cause financial burdens for the people that made the parody. </p>
<p>This is essentially how bad parody movies get away with a lot of things they do... think scary movie and naked gun, etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make very similar movies as long as the characters are different and the branding isn't identical. </p>
<p>There's an entire studio devoted to doing this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum?wprov=sfla1</a></p>
<p>You can't copyright ideas, so you could do a nearly identical plot and premise so long as the details are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a zombie podcast for a few years and we actually reviewed <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0tFaQYSFLuE" target="_blank">Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies</a>. There are certain people who enjoy this sort of &quot;so bad it's good,&quot; movie, but I'm fairly confident their business model relies on people accidentally watching these movies because they just weren't paying enough attention. Although, seeing half the cast rocking obviously glued on beards was fairly hilarious.</p></div>		</li>
