			<p>Nope, I only have a high school education and I make close to 7 figures a year. The opportunities are always there, but they take more hard work than most people are willing to do.</p>		</li>

			<p>relatively to 40 or 50 years ago, much more work, that's why more people are &quot;poor&quot;.<br><br>And your story doesn't invalidate what is being talked about here. Not everybody is willing to work as hard as you did, and accusing an entire generation of being lazy won't really explain anything at all. You could not rationally explain why a specific generation just became lazy like that.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Not everybody is willing to work as hard as you did&quot;<br>this is my point, I'm not accusing a generation of laziness, I'm 38 and I didn't start working towards this until I was 29, so you can't say it was easier when I started. When I was in my 20's the same excuse was being thrown around that &quot;it used to be easier&quot; and it was rubbish then as well. <br><br>Nobody ever got rich from working 9 to 5. The reason my parents had more money to save for a house deposit is that they had less to spend it on. No cable, no internet, no mobile phones, international flights were too expensive so we went camping, less distractions in general. Success has to be earned, nobody is entitled to it, 40 years ago there was just nothing else to do but chase your goals.</p>		</li>
