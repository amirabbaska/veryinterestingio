			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I just included the abstract in my research for her.</p>
<p>Apparently the boy's mom is particularly concerned about all the dangerous chemicals in vaccines. I've been looking for a list of these chemicals with the reasons they're safe, but I'm coming up short.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on where I could find something like this?</p>
<p>Again, thank you so much for the help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;dangerous chemicals&quot; she is referring to thimerosal (which contains ethylmercury), its use in childhood vaccines was discontinued in 2001 in the US.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a CDC document which is a good summary on the issue. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one of the most infuriating responses I've seen when that gets pointed out is &quot;see?  If it took so long to realize that was harmful think about what else is in there they may not realize yet.&quot;</p>
<p>This of course ignores the far greater chance of illness from skipping the vaccine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing that needs to be pointed out is that elements (like mercury) change their properties when part of a different molecule. Pure sodium reacts violently with water, pure chlorine is a deadly gas, while sodium chloride (sodium plus chlorine equal parts) is table salt, which we need to eat to live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC document also outlines the differences between ethylmercury  (found un thimerosal) and methylmercury (not found in thimerosal). A lot of people think that they are the same but they truly aren't.</p>
<p>The bioavailability of methylmercury is far greater, which makes it toxic at a much lower dose than ethylmercury.</p></div>		</li>
