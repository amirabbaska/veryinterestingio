			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn't fall faster than your organs. If it did, that would mean gravity was selecting which parts of your body to pull on. (and your body would separate into organs and skeleton pieces) The feeling comes because you no longer need to support your internal organs. Walking around on the ground gravity pulls down on your entire body. Your internal organs are squishy and not rigidly attached to your skeletal system. They are suspended by soft tissues. When in free fall, or close to it, the tension in those tissues is reduced as gravity is accelerating both your skeleton and your organs at the same rate. Your body monitors the tension in the supportive tissues to figure out if you are falling or not. When the tension drops you get that gross feeling in your stomach and several reflexive actions kick in. These include a rush of adrenalin, the extension of the legs, rotating your arms backwards. These reflexes are there to try to orient and prepare your body for the eventual contact with the ground.
For those talking about skydiving, you do get the same feeling for the first few second of flight, until you stop accelerating. Both the physics and first hand experience back this up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The force accelerating you down isn't gravity, it's the rollercoaster car. The car acts on your outer body, so inertia means your internal organs will &quot;fall&quot; at a different speed for some time. It's just like his water bottle metaphor, or the &quot;outwards&quot; pull when you turn in a car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Somewhat ironically, that's how most parents explain things to their children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not weightlessness.  It's rapid acceleration. Weightlessness doesn't really feel like anything</p>
<p>This is a good example of misinformation spreading on reddit.  That entire response is egregiously wrong; that's not what free-fall or floating in space feels like.  It's so blatantly wrong I'm tempted to think SwaggedyAndy did it on purpose to see how everyone will upvote and believe anything.  </p>
<p>Now everyone is misinformed and stupidity spreads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, being in space feels just like normal except there isn't anything holding you down on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You tend to become aware of the various fluids sloshing around (stomach, bladder, etc) and have to be careful when turning your head as it can cause extreme vertigo and motion sickness. </p>
<p>Gravity does more than hold you to the ground, it also holds your bodies humors in the correct orientation. The feeling of weightlessness does not &quot;feel just like normal&quot; but actually a quite bizarre feeling that you're constantly having to adjust to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is wrong. In vacuums, everything should fall at the same speed. Gravity isn't selective. I think it's more of a momentum thing. In a car, you go up and then down when going over bump. Your slimy insides continue up when your body is going down until momentum changes and/or your body's innards are pulled down. </p>
<p>[Edit] For instance, in SwaggedyAndy's example, if you dropped the water bottle the water wouldn't go to the top of the bottle. But if you swung your arm down, it would. </p></div>		</li>
