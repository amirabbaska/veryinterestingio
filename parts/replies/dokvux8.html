			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea behind cryptocurrency is that it is decentralized and (depending on the currency) anonymous to an extent. </p>
<p>In a cryptocurrency transaction, your &quot;ID&quot; is essentially a bunch of random numbers. It forces governments to take extra steps to identify which numbers belong to which person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bitcoin and others like it are the future of currency.  Bitcoin is actually programmed for governments to tax.   But at the moment the U.S. recognizes it as a commodity and only taxes you based on capital gains when you realize profits in fiat.  The decentralized properties of Bitcoin are extremely valuable to countries with failing monetary systems right now.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is fiat currency. Things have value because we mostly agree that they do. Gold is seen as valuable because a lot of people think it is valuable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term fiat currency is reserved for currencies that were created by goverments or law. That's where the latin name comes from. So no, not everything is fiat currency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure I agree here. Fiat currency (say $10) has no intrinsic worth. I’m pretty sure that notes in the past had gold within them, basically now it’s an “IOU”.</p>
<p>With gold, it holds a value. There is a finite amount of gold and as such it has a value. A piece of paper with $10 does not.</p>
<p>I’m by no means an expert and have never studied economics etc, I’ve just been reading a bit recently. That’s my 2c (pun intended)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. A fiat currency is, definitionally, a currency that has value solely because some authority says it has value. A currency that is linked to a commodity is therefore not fiat, since the value of that currency is directly linked to the value of that commodity. As it rises and falls, so should the currency. When Sterling was linked to the price of sterling silver, you could always, in principle, go to the Bank of England and exchange your pound for silver. </p>
<p>Parent is also correct in the sense that I am not aware of any national currency that is still commodity backed, unless that commodity is another currency or basket or currencies. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is interesting in the sense that the argument can be made that it <em>is</em>linked to a commodity: a set of mathematically interesting numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold doesn't really have any intrinsic value, though. Sure, it has useful physical properties, but if a giant gold seam were discovered tomorrow, the value of gold would decrease. This has happened before: when Musa I made his pilgrimage to Mecca, he gave out so much gold that its value tanked for a decade.</p></div>		</li>
