			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I disagree with your wording. Natural hair colour/skin tone are genetic traits which then go on to be influenced by the environment. It's hard to think of many examples but I'm pretty sure for most people (so barring illness/extreme circumstances or whatever), eye colour remains 100% genetic, I could be wrong though. </p></div>		</li>
