<p>Now (not only)the whales will travel to the krill area in the summer and use some tricks to trap krill and will eat about 2 ton of krill every day building up fat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should also be noted that krill as a food source are extremely rich.  Krill eat not just plankton but oil-rich algae scraped off the green lawns growing on the underside of pack ice.  Whales and other blubber producing northern species then consume the oil rich krill, which they turn into the blubber that sustains them thru the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combined with that, they're huge neutrally buoyant marine creatures with very few predators, which is just about the most energy efficient lifestyle possible.  We constantly spend calories just standing upright, they don't even need to <em>breathe</em> more than once or twice per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could end up being a means to sequester carbon.  </p>
<p>One of the problems with iron fertilization of the oceans is that only Diatomes sink to the bottom of the ocean.  The other types of plankton from a bloom will just rot on the surface and release most of the CO2 back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If instead krill eat the plankton, overpopulate, starve, mostly die off and sink, then repeat, we have now created a ridiculously massive CO2 sink that costs almost nothing (seriously, iron II sulfate costs like pennies on the kilo). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both krill and algae have been suggested as a 'soylent' in the not too distant future. It can all be mechanically separated out, flavoured etc. and packaged into nice little blocks. One part of me thinks it's a bit manky, but the other part of me can see the logic.</p></div>		</li>
