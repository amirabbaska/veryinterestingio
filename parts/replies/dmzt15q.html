			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the time you don't. That's why companies like Apple have so much cash overseas that they don't want to bring over - they're trying to avoid the tax that comes with bringing cash into the United States. </p>
<p>The company instead tends to try and spend the money rather than just transfer it over to the US company to avoid losing more. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Easier repatriation of profits is one of their biggest goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which would be awesome, no? Do you really think it would be bad if companies brought back to the US trillions of dollars. </p>
<p>Also, FYI, everyone loves to hate on big oil companies, but companies like Exxon Mobil actually repatriate their international profits, and only keep overseas the money necessary for OPEX/CAPEX of future projects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The money is still passing through the US entity. So, you negotiate an agreement with your Irish parent company to lower your licensing fees, to account for increased expenses in the US.</p>
<p>You still pay no taxes (it's deductible as an expense).</p>
<p>Keep in mind corporate salaries and bonuses are also deductible expenses.</p>
<p>And, amusingly, nothing prevents the parent company in Ireland from loaning money to the US entity (with interest!) for R&amp;D, or to build a new campus in Cupertino ;)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty much irrelevant, because those salaries and bonuses are subject to other forms of income and payroll taxes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a tax accountant, I have to remind you that you are missing Effectively connected income from your example. Foriegn entities can still be taxed on income generated in the US. There are some tax treated​ that works around this but Ireland does not have a treaty like that. Internet companies may be able to get around this but most companies will end up paying the max 35 corporate tax rate regardless in this situation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And yet almost none of them do.
20% of the most profitable companies based in the U.S. pay nothing in U.S. taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that isn't because of the foriegn tax issue. There are many ways to lower tax rates depending on your industry. The easiest one being taking section 179 depreciation or other non cash expenses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly this is a brilliant ELI5 answer for why Apple has billlions of dollars in it's European savings accounts that it wants to bring back to the US. Just replace record with iPhone and you can get a super simplistic explanation of how Apple Ireland, Apple Global and Apple American all pay each other fees and profits to minimise taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this example doesn’t apply to Apple at all. Apple has billions in foreign bank accounts because it legitimately earns most of its money in other countries. The US, unlike every other country, has a global tax system, which means that Apple would have to pay a second US tax on already-taxed foreign-earned income. </p>
<p>Apple’s American sales are properly attributed to the US entity (which owns substantially all of their intellectual property) and is taxed appropriately. </p>
<p>This is, however, a brilliant answer as to how some pharmaceutical companies cheat on their US tax bill. </p></div>		</li>
