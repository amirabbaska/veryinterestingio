			<div class="markdown"><p>It always feels like someone covered my tongue in gel if I drink anything with artificial sweeteners. To the point I've been able to tell before I knew it had the sweetener in it. Corn syrup and sugar doesn't do it. I don't think baked goods does it but I'm not 100% sure if I've tried baked goods with sweeteners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a fun experiment;</p>
<p>For one week drink nothing but diet beverages, water and unsweetened beverages.<br />
After that week, how does the diet taste? (It loses the odd taste and also the odd mouthfeel)</p>
<p>How does a regularly sweetened beverage taste? (It gains the odd mouthfeel and tastes way too sweet)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be interesting! I feel like it needs to be a blind study though, just to make sure.</p>
<p>I'm in process of getting rid of all sweetened drinks anyways. Hot tea and water for me. And maybe a fruit smoothie at night, which I know is high in sugar but I don't eat a lot of fruit otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strongly disagree. I drink diet now, as a way to reduce caloric intake, but months later the aftertaste is still there and sugar sweetened drinks taste heavenly. The sole exception is coke no sugar, but, that has never had a foul aftertaste to me, and, it’s only good when it comes from McDonald’s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean am I tasting only artificial sweeteners when I know it's an artificial sweetener? I'm not sure. I know I've tasted some things, found them to be oddly bitter and gel feeling then looked at the label to see an artificial sweetener.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fine with an aftertaste as long as it doesn't taste like absolute shit. I'll never understand why anyone chooses to eat or drink anything with aspartame in it. It's so fucking disgusting.</p></div>		</li>
