			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC this is also one of the reasons why $1 coins never really caught on in the US, despite multiple attempts by the Treasury to introduce them - almost none of the infrastructure is set up to handle them. </p>
<p>I do remember some vending machines around one of those times that had been updated to take the $1 coins, and had labels indicating that they did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost of the machinery to hand out dollar coins as change is substantially less than the cost to ensure that the machine hands out dollar bills, but only one at a time.</p>
<p>There's also a hidden economic benefit, in that tourists are more likely to spend dollar coins on miscellaneous crap because coins &quot;have no value&quot;. It's a small benefit, but meaningful to a small business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually have to add new programming to the machine to recognize new bills. Coins are usually measured by weight, and if they are magnetic. If the coin changes substantially, they reprogram the machine for that too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Agreed. An article from last year after Australia changed its $5 note and how it didn't work in vending machines, pokie machines and self checkouts.</p></div>		</li>
