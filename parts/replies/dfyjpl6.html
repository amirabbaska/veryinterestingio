			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for the minor issue that that theory requires inanimate objects to spontaneously predict the future with no clear inputs or signals. I'd say that's a rather far cry from &quot;really was no difference&quot; and would suggest that you were just not including some rather crucial choices of math to check against. But I don't know, what do you mean by &quot;all the standard equations&quot;? I would include &quot;causal statistics equations/models&quot; as &quot;standard&quot; in most science fields, and though I haven't taken the hours to think through this with respect to that, I suspect it won't end as well.</p></div>		</li>
