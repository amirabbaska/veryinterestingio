So the thrust will increase according to Newton's law. So why is the focus only on increasing flow velocity? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The exhaust velocity is - effectively - the same as the specific impulse.  So higher exhaust velocity means a better rocket.  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_impulse" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_impulse</a> )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, other way around. Up until Mach 0.8, gas flow is treated as subsonic and is more or less incompressible. From Mach 0.8 to Mach 1, the flow starts to change in compressibility, and the exact properties are a bit muddled but this is called the &quot;transonic&quot; region to reflect that the gas isn't incompressible anymore, but not exactly compressible either (depending on what you need it for, the point at which flow is no longer incompressible varies, but Mach 0.8 is a common starting point).</p>
<p>Above Mach 1, the flow is now compressible, which makes sense if you think about it. The speed of sound represents the fastest speed at which the air can move, so when something is traveling at subsonic speeds, the air can move faster than the object, so the object pushes the air out of the way, and this disruption moves faster than the object itself, so the air pushes other air out of the way and so on. Because the air can push itself out of the way faster than the object is moving, the density never increases, and the flow is incompressible.</p>
<p>When an object is moving faster than sound, the air can no longer move out of the way fast enough, but since the object is still plowing through the air, something has to give. The result is that the air compresses, resulting in non-uniform density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To amplify what Solo said: Incompressible flow isn't <em>really</em> incompressible. <em>All</em> fluids are compressible, in different amounts. &quot;Incompressible flow&quot; really means flow in which the density is so <em>close</em> to constant that you can just assume incompressibility without affecting your answers significantly.</p>
<p>Air can be considered incompressible up to around Mach 0.5; beyond that, the density variations start to become significant. If you tried to treat Mach 1 flow as incompressible, you'd get wildly inaccurate results.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I know what you meant by this, but a variable nozzle would actually be a holy grail of rocket propulsion, but not for the reasons you're talking about.  When the flow passes through the <em>throat</em>, the narrowest point, it's at Mach 1.  After that the rocket engine adopts a bell shape that we're all used to seeing, to accelerate the flow.  The larger the bell, the lower the exhaust pressure.  However, if you imagine firing low-pressure air into a high-pressure environment, you'll see that you're losing efficiency due to the atmosphere pushing back.  Likewise, if your exit pressure is too high, the exhaust will fly out to the side and you'll be losing valuable thrust.  That's why rocket engines that fire at sea level often have much less pronounced bells than ones that fire in vaccum (Like engine on the Apollo CSM).  However, these nozzles are optimized for basically one exit pressure, and are losing efficiency when the pressure is higher or lower.</p>
<p>A variable geometry nozzle would be fantastic because you would be able to maintain peak efficiency the whole way, and would be able to use the same engine, and possibly not have to throw it in the ocean when you're done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that must be why rockets have that particular noise that they make--nothing like a jet engine. It's like a constant sonic boom. I used to live near White Sands Missile Range when I was a kid and every once in a while we would go see public launches. It's something you can only hear if you are there, it doesn't come across well in a recording. </p></div>		</li>
