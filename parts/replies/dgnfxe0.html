			<div class="markdown"><p>Tardigrades are somewhat of a fallacy. They can survive in extreme conditions, but are not really &quot;alive&quot; while dormant, they are just waiting for better conditions. If you sent a bunch of tardigrades to anywhere else in the solar system, they would just be in hibernation until they died: no reproduction or thriving of any sort. At least, probably, you can never know for certain if some bacteria would be able to hitch a ride on a spacecraft and reach somewhere suitable for their growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you get what Im saying though. Say they sifted down into some spot just un extreme enough become undormant. Say there was a heat plume in the eye of the polar Saturn hurricane that had just the right amount of Methane. Perhaps 100 miles down into the atmosphere conditions are just right? Im just pointing out that gas giant planets could theoretically be giant petri dishes? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe theoretically, but it's probably either too hot or at too high of a pressure for life as we know it sustain itself inside a gas giant. I don't think that trying to sustain life inside a gas would be that easy either. </p>
<p>I was more thinking that somehow an organism could end up inside  one of the watery moons' oceans, and find an energy source there. Still very unlikely, but you never know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, while something like a tardigrade might not immediately die, it's not going to really find plant and microbial life to feed on.  It's going to be far from a nutrient-rich environment like a petri-dish.</p></div>		</li>

All life on earth are water based so it's practically impissible for any earth living organizim to thrive in a place that doesn't contain water in liquid state</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, most tardigrades reproduce by sexual reproduction, so it takes two, technically. But it doesn't matter because tardigrades have neither photosynthesis nor chemosynthesis abilities. If a few hitched a ride to Europa, they would be in hibernation permanently or starve to death because there would be nothing for them to eat.</p>
<p>What would need to happen for catastrophic contamination would be for an chemosynthesis-capable microbe that's able to survive zero pressure and very high and low temperature for months or years, <em>then</em> somehow travel into the oceans of a watery moon and survive the crazy conditions of that journey, and finally find a suitable energy source and reproduce. </p></div>		</li>
