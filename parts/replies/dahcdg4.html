<p>Communism is a form of utopia, a perfect human society. However true communism is doomed to fail 100% of the time due to human nature. If society was populated by robots then communism would function perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair this point has be refuted time and time again. Furthermore, Marx and Engels made a very clear distinction between Utopian and scientific Socialism, so right now you're talking from a point of ignorance rather than research and analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True communism calls for all property and the means of production to be owned by the state.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, this has never been the case. I mean, I get this is ELI5, but that doesn't justify giving what is classified as a completely wrong answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The flaw that will always destroy communism happens when people realise that video game testers, dog walkers, supermodel masseurs, and food critics get the same compensation as ditch diggers, sewage truck workers, hot tar roofers, and morticians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't necessarily true; please see the Labor Theory of Value for more information on this, for one, and for two you also have to take into account that Communism would do away with many of the &quot;jobs&quot; you mentioned (e.g. Supermodel), two, automate, reduce labor time required for or otherwise reduce the workload of other jobs (e.g. mortician, sewage truck worker), and three, that the compensation in Communism isn't money, so therefor the &quot;compensation&quot; any person would get would be contextual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In communism you are unable to use compensation as an incentive to balance the job market. You can only rely on altruism or lack of self-interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/4halhj/a_common_criticism_of_socialism_is_that_few_would/" target="_blank">This post from /r/socialism_101 counters this point</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A society relying on a lack of self-interest from the vast majority of citizens in order to function is doomed to failure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then why hasn't Capitalism failed? It's entire basis is based on the exploitation of the proletariat class, extracting surplus value from the laborers. If society based around self-interest then it certainly wouldn't be Capitalist, as Capitalism only caters to the self interest of an extreme minority of individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The further you move left the less power compensation has and the more that society must rely on altruism and lack of self-interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, you're entirely removing other factors at hand, such as personal interests, responsibility to the community, the want/need for a clean and functioning living environment and so on. Besides, within Communism and Socialism the people actually doing the labor for the less-desirable tasks would actually earn what their labor is worth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism uses supply and demand to balance the job market with the available labour pool. The balance provided by supply and demand can be manipulated towards the left with certain tools such as unions, minimum wage and labour laws. However, without the balance provided by those socialist tools, monopolies will inevitably form and laissez faire capitalism will fail. Monopolies are as certain to doom laissez faire capitalism as self-interest is to doom communism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't necessarily disagree with this, but it must be noted that regulatory policies are not necessarily Socialist; while Socialists may back them in a Capitalist context and framework, they don't actually achieve Socialism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As in most things the answer to a healthy society lies somewhere in the middle. Just how far left or right of centre your perfect society lies depends on your view of your fellow man. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe man to be fundamentally good then you are more likely to be on the right side. The right side generally calls for less government, less state ownership and more control of goods in the hands of the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also wrong; the right wing calls for more control and restriction. While regulations may be the state using force to further control businesses, businesses more often that not, if deregulated, would expand and be more controlling as it is in the interest of profit. This is without taking into account how Fascism and Feudalism also fall onto the right-wing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You trust that your fellow man will use part of those goods to benefit society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except that, in the aforementioned cases, the power and wealth rests within the hands of a few individuals, and it is propagated as righteous behavior to make money off of the work of others rather than your own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a less trusting view of your fellow man you are likely to the left somewhere. You prefer the government to be larger and have more control of goods in order for those goods to be redistributed by the government to benefit society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except that's the exact opposite of the left wing; the far left advocates for the abolition of class, money and the state. Socialists advocate for democratic control of the means of production by the working class. Both of these insinuate the exact opposite of what you've stated.</p>
<p>I hope I've cleared up the misconceptions you've had here. Don't take it personally on any level; I just didn't want wrong information being spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But communism isn't about state ownership of private property or the means of production, its about the workers collectively and democratically owning them. And under communism, as proposed by Marx, there would be no state as it would have &quot;withered away&quot; from disuse under revolutionary socialism, as the state exists only to propagate capitalism and protect it from its own contradictions.</p>
<p>And &quot;human nature&quot; is an odd way to deny the theory. Feudalism and the divine right of kings was seen as the natural order at its time. Aristotle even believed that it was natural for people to be born into slavery. Humans are amazing and can adapt to most any situation. If you told Emperor Charlemagne that one day the world would be run by burghers in a republic and he would have though you mad. Or Venetian.</p></div>		</li>

<p>actually it calls for democratic ownership of the means of production and other <em>private property</em> which is not to be confused with personal property. Private property is capital which produces more capital, i.e. a factory. Personal property is anything you own by virtue of use, i.e. your house. </p></div>		</li>
