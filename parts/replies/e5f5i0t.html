			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically it's a tradition that started spontaneously but that is now seen as very important by some.</p>
<p>The connection between &quot;let's watch people play a game&quot; and &quot;I must express loyalty to my country&quot; seems random and disconnected to me. I wonder why it caught on in some sports but not others?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be that it stuck in the sports that are considered “America’s games” like baseball and football because it’s on brand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also this america-ism that is a little bit trying too hard to have an identity and make up for the fact the country is not what some claim it to be.  Fake it till you think you make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn’t say they are that disconnected. Sports, tribalism, combat, pride are all interconnected. Our desire to compete is perhaps an evolutionary advantage in developing skills to fight individuals and rival groups. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it’s a particularly American thing to do. Most sports in most countries do not do that.</p>
<p>Tribalism in sports is important, but is more usually directed towards particular team allegiance. I’d say that playing the US anthem before a game where two US teams are playing isn’t really tribalism at all, as if anything, it unites the whole crowd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the reason it’s televised and the players all stand around for it is actually a paid ad by the US Army. </p>

<p>Basically, the NFL convinced the Department of Defense to pay for this display of “patriotism” and sold it as a recruitment tool.</p></div>		</li>
