			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried hard to hold onto it.  Hats, hoodies, Rogaine, etc... all just made me look for conspicuous and drew more attention to it.  Look at Enrique Iglesias, dude never removes his beanie or hat.  Then when I shaved it off, it was weird but that set me free.  I owned the bald look.  Some of my friends have never even seen me with hair and can't imagine me with it.  Even my gf has never seen me with hair.</p>
<p>Don't wear the halo, once it gets bad, just shave it and you will be free of any confidence issues.  People will actually think you're not bald and are just shaving your hair for the look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar situation but opposite lol.  26, receding hairline.  Everyone on my dad's side of the family has the thickest hair. I'm told the gene comes from your mom's dad. Which would make more sense as he was bald.</p>
<p>Genes are so fascinating.  I often wonder what I pull from my Mother's side and what I pulled from my father's side.  </p></div>		</li>
