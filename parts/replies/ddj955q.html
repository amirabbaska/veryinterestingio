<p>No...just...no. You've not answered the question at all. You've simply provided a summary of some challenges that all 24/7 information services face. </p>
<p>To use an analogy, suppose that OP had asked <em>Why is the restaurant down the street from me losing money?</em> And the answer was <em>Well, there are many costs associated with running a restaurant.</em> While this is true, it doesn't answer the question. Clearly, some restaurants show a profit. So...why don't all restaurants make money?</p>
<p>Similarly, the challenges that you've outlined aren't specific to Twitter - at all. Many companies - such as Facebook, Reddit, Recipes.com, Yahoo, etc, etc - face the same challenges. Some of these companies make money. Others don't. </p>
<p>But they all maintain a service 24/7, they all have competitors, they all need to keep the hardware running. This is actually one of the easier aspects of running the business. It's fairly simple to predict traffic, it's fairly simple to plan for disaster recovery and it's fairly simple to design an architecture which allows for extra performance during peak times. </p>
<p>The reason Twitter loses money is because they spend more than they make. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5t09p7/eli5why_are_twitter_recording_such_huge_quarterly/ddj9i5a/" target="_blank">Here's a better answer, which provides a breakdown of Twitter's financials.</a> The real question is <em>Why does Twitter decide to spend more money than it makes?</em> It's a question of business strategy, not the expense of maintaining infrastructure. </p></div>		</li>
