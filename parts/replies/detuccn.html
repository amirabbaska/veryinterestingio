			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to make an addition,</p>
<p>Lots of people know rural people are poor today but they don't know <em>why</em>. Rural life has never been wealthy but rural communities used to be economically independent until the post-war period. What changed?</p>
<p>Every community that wants to survive needs to have a primary income source. In a mining town, this could be the mine. In a city, this could be manufacturing, tourism, government administration, or finance capital. These industries form the bedrock of the economy and provide a <em>raison d'etre</em> for a community; the secondary industries (services, retail, housing, etc) are built on the money created by the primary industry. This is why, in a mining boom town, once the mine runs dry, the town almost always dies: no money comes in, and as workers in the primary industry move seeking work, the secondary industries their wage supports also go under.</p>
<p>In rural communities, the primary industry is (and always has been) farming. The food produced by a farmer is sold to cities, and the money enters the rural community and allows it to stay alive. In the old days (before the 2nd war) most farms were &quot;peasant&quot; farms; farms owned and opporated by a family, that lives off their produce and enjoyed a modestly middle-class lifestyle with the income they made selling what they didn't consume. </p>
<p>After the war, changes in technology and the international organization of trade changed that. Technologically, farming is more efficient than ever before; one farmer can cultivate huge tracts of land and create bigger crops due to a greater use of machines, more advanced fertilizers, better pesticides and generic engineering. While this means more food than ever before, it also means the price of food has plummeted. While a farmer in the past maybe only had to sell 100 units to break even, now he has to sell 1000 or 10000 (these numbers are obviously just for the sake of argument). </p>
<p>With wide open trade, farmers have access to a larger market, but they are also competing with <em>way</em> more firms; Joe nobody with his 100 unit output is now competing with Agricorp, who has millions of units and a transportation infrastructure to match.</p>
<p>The result is that farmers are squeezed: on one hand, they need to produce massively more produce to stay alive; on the other hand, its harder than ever to reach the market and sell in the quantity needed, and the cost of actually running a farm is more expensive than ever. </p>
<p>The result is that family farming is dying. Most farmers cant keep up so they bankrupt and sell the farm. </p>
<p>This is killing rural communities. It used to be that farms would be passed on through generations. That is no longer the case. These people don't just disappear; they either try to remain in the community and work (intensifying the economic issue as the small secondary industries can't provide them all with work) or they move out of the community (literally taking their wealth and labour power out). </p>
<p>This is why rural communities are ripe for gentrification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also true of the much larger economies.</p>
<p>The British economy is increasingly a &quot;service&quot; based economy, I.E. those secondary sectors. </p>
<p>Which is why large tracts of the country are increasingly impoverished while the only real hotspots of wealth are with the upper middle-class cities where finance and niche academia/tech work is found.</p>
<p>Not wanting to get too political but I think if people who opposed Brexit/Trump in Britain and the US respectively were honest and wanted answers, they'd see why the less well-off strata's of western society are in revolt at the ballot box.</p>
<p>All these people see are their communities in horrendous decline, and then the wealth-off incomers/neighbours complain about the smell of shit coming from fields.</p>
<p>It smacks of a complete disconnect and disregard for what is economic life-&amp;-death concerns of these declining communities. And because this is a global phenomenon there's nowhere really for these less-well off people to go. </p>
<p>Didn't expect a topic about gentrification to get me onto this stuff, but yeah. If you;re middle-class or up, and you actually wanted to know why the lower classes don't just not care about your priorities, but despise them, it's this.
You may dislike the smell of shit, but they have to wade through it just to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but what can be objectively be done about this? Because the way it's put, it's essentially capitalism doing what capitalism does and if it follows it's course, familiar farming is just going to disappear.</p>
<p>As a society, should we put an effort in trying to maintain this lifestyle, or should we just accept it's fated to end and work towards giving these people other things to work on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing has literally been happening for 200 years and will continue for years to come. Advances in technology will continue, and there's no point in yelling into the wind.</p>
<p>You are right in saying that a rural community or small town needs a primary source of income. However, the 21th century economy simply has much less need of rural/small town economies than the 19th century economy. Urbanization will continue. Governments should base policy on helping people both urban and rural transition into the new economy, not trying to turn back the clock. It helps no one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yeah this is a legacy that stretches back to the earliest accumulation in 17th C England. Nowhere in my post did I say we need to turn back the clock, I'm just sketching out the history that has created this situation.</p>
<p>The reason is because a lot of people down thread are saying stupid shit like &quot;oh well if they sold their house than that's just business, there is nothing unfair about that, quit bitching&quot;. That view is ignorant of the macroeconomic trend that drives this exchange of wealth; can something be said to be a truly fair exchange when your only choices are &quot;sell and move, or starve&quot;? </p>
<p>Losing a community is hard. Anybody who has moved far from their home permanently knows the value of community. And while I understand that this is the March of history or whatever, I don't think it's exactly <em>fair</em> or is something to celebrate. This communities are dying and the reality is is that once they go, they don't come back. We are losing something through gentrification, and with rural gentrification, it's the death of a whole lifestyle, not just a city block. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me help all you confused people going on about these villagers just giving up their inherited houses and cashing in like a bunch of disloyal high roller ass clowns:</p>
<p>They're poor. </p>
<p>Old house needs a new roof and windows? You're poor. You can't fix the house you inherited. </p>
<p>Your household had four adults (young couple/parents) and now two of them died? You're poor. Any money trickling in, no matter how small, died with the parents did. </p>
<p>Your job options and income potential limited by the village? You're fucking poor. Instead of trying to raise your kids with no money, you move back to the city to SURVIVE after allowing your parents the dignity to live out their lives in their home. </p>
<p>TL;DR - FUCKING. POOR. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. What's more there are very poor/nonexistent public transport services in the region. If you don't have a car, it's very difficult to live an ordinary life. When supermarkets started doing deliveries things changed a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you look at it on a micro level like this, gentrification isn't a bad thing at all. It makes sense and that's why it happens so often.</p>
<p>When you look at it on a macro level, however, what you see is cultures and traditions and even economic capital that the rest of the country/world needs (farming) eroding in favor of people who have money.</p>
<p>Gentrification makes sense from a very individualistic capitalist viewpoint, and thus I don't think it's fair to necessarily call the rich buyers evil; they're looking out for their own interests and desires. But at the same time, they're failing to see the bigger picture and so when you have a bunch of different rich buyers coming in, they're destroying what was once there and uprooting people who have called a place home for a significant amount of time and so people then view that collective as &quot;evil.&quot;</p>
<p>This is why gentrification is such a hot button issue. Neoliberals and people who support the &quot;free market&quot; and a more traditional form of capitalism don't really see too much of an issue with gentrification for exactly the reason you point out. Progressives, those who focus their attention on the marginalized, and those who look at things from a big picture POV don't support gentrification because it negatively effects certain populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is happening to my village near Wales. They opened the development envelope and suddenly it's executive houses. It's become upper middle class, the school is doing well but it's pushed out many people who are local and who want to live in the area.</p>
<p>Plymouth is being gentrified now with the development at the bottom of town. I can see it all becoming Starbucks and nandos because that's what appeals. We are only just become an ethnic city and the really good cheap foreign good shops at the bottom of town will be closed up to make way for the norm and the boulevard to the flats by the marina. Plymouth does need development but it will only be 25% affordable housing and they will just be snapped up and rented out along with the ghastly student tower blocks. The locals get pushed to the new expensive developments outside  of town such as shitford and i wouldn't touch a new build with a barge pole..Lots of problems..I love the rough local ends of town </p></div>		</li>
