			<div class="markdown"><p>side question: from my understanding, when a human gains in physical volume through excessive caloric consumption, angiogenesis occurs to support increased tissue mass.</p>
<p>if a human loses significant volume at a reasonably slow pace, it often seems that thir skin will contract to contain their smaller volume, without creating ”flab”. what happens to the now extraneous vasculature? is there a well behaved process of angiolysis? (i'm not sure if this word is correct or applicable.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if I’m completely on the wrong track, but I think I understand what you’re asking. You are right that getting fat means that angiogenesis is required to support all that extra tissue, and in surgery it is an absolute pain to cut through all that fat and find lots and lots of small bleeders just spread throughout the fat :(
All those small vessels and capillaries, as far as I’m aware, do not just disappear even if you lose weight; from experience you will tend to just keep those few extra vessels which, in the scale of things, is not a big deal as it’s usually just really really small capillaries and what not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks!</p>
<p>so, to use the vernacular, when you get fat, only smaller vessels are created (nothing major, so the distance between major arteries and major veins increases, they don't grow more major branches)</p>
<p>and when you get thin, they just stick around?</p>
<p>so would a formerly fat person bleed more during surgery?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are we not allowed to say a person is fat now? I need an update to my PC list of words I can use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i was having difficulty beating my vocabulary into submission late last evening, and in retrospect, <del>probably</del> should have used ”disproportionat increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue volume and supporting structures”, as i was inquiring about a very specific thing.</p>
<p>saying ”blubber” or some such inadequately describes <em>which</em> fat's angiogenesis i'm interested in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that explication. My good friend and co worker lost his leg in a motorcycle accident.  He lost all but 7 ot 8 inches of his leg. Along the same thought, when you do lose a leg, do they round the end of the bone?  Seeing as you will be putting your weight on the stump which is in a prosthetic. I would think that it could be painful to have what is left of the bone jabbing you inside the stump. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use a giant file (think like a HUGE nail filer) and round the bone edges off. But it’s usually the tissue that fills out the stump that ultimately provides most of the cushioning for prosthetics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a rule, bone is never left open to air for many reasons; depending on where the amputation is every attempt is made to cover the bone up with tissue from around it. In leg amputations this usually means leaving flaps of skin to create a “fish mouth” closure, with toes we often cut off the toe and then use dressings to let the wound heal from bottom up to cover the exposed bone.</p></div>		</li>
