			<div class="markdown"><p>As a herpetologist I can assure you this is almost always human related. People can excite snake feeding responses just by opening the cage. Snakes are very easily conditioned to this sort of feeding response. Combined with high heat, improper diet or husbandry, and dangling dead prey near them, anything can happen. Especially if they strike and miss and inadvertently tag themselves. That's the only time I've ever seen it happen. Like others have mentioned this can also happen after handling them. In the wild they have very specific hunting strategies that all but prevents this from happening. In a small enclosed glass cage however...shit happens. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Now they're like a goofy dog chasing its tail. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a happy snake owner (Colombian Red Tail Boa), I can confirm my snake is a dork, lazy hunter, and usually happy go lucky. </p>
<p>So long as he keeps fed, he never bites at me, is fun to hold, and chills out in his hide (home) all day. </p>
<p>Mine only gets all energetic when he knows that I'm about to feed him. I've been nipped once, but I learned what I did wrong and since then haven't been hurt. </p>
<p>Heck the little guy hangs out around my shoulders and neck, lap, or just on my arm/hand when I'm handling him. </p>
<p>Not all snakes are the same, just like ANY animal they all have personalities, and characteristics that you need to respect. I'm just making sure that more people understand not all animals are like the TV makes them out to be.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reptile brains are literally r-brains, and I'm fairly convinced they have but three slots for other organisms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Threat.</li>
<li>Food.</li>
<li>Neither food nor threat.</li>
</ol>
<p>A &quot;tame&quot; reptile is one that has become accustomed to people above a certain size as &quot;neither food nor threat&quot;. You're not small enough to eat, and while you're large enough to harm or kill it, they recognize via conditioning that you're unlikely to do so.</p>
<p>Do snakes have &quot;personalities&quot;? I guess. A &quot;tame&quot; snake is capable of recognizing people as a not-food-not-threat in a way that a wild snake isn't. But does it have a personality in the way that a dog does? No.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I got a red tail boa! Except mine isn't so little (~7 feet long), and instead of chilling she has to keep moving. I sometimes let her roam around the &quot;safe&quot; area of the living room.</p>
<p>My ball python on the other hand is super lazy and can stay in spot for a cool while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, media portrais reptiles as coldblooded killer monsters. When everyones favorite cats and dogs are no less brutal. My husky was killing lemmings dozens at a time, same with my cats killing all they see.
I also keep a juvenile monitor lizard. This animal is extremely intelligent and active, potty and target trained, recognizes keeper and have been shown abilities to solve puzzles and count to 6 (dogs can only count to 5 I believe). Not sure about snakes species, but monitors and tegus are extremely smart animals. </p></div>		</li>
