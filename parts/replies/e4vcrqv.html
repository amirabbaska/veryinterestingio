<p>Finally there is usually a way to disconnect from your anchor in an emergency although this means severing the cable and losing your anchor.</p>

<p>I'm going to guess that, like everything that attaches to a boat, anchors are approximately 25-100x more expensive than I think they are, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother once threw in an anchor from our pontoon boat without noticing it wasnt actually tied to the boat. Without even thinking i dove in, grabbed the rope, and swam the anchor up to the boat. That was the last time i saw the pair of glasses i forgot i was wearing.
Ps. Anchors are hard to swim with, i dont recommend trying it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E: In other words, you either need a ship just as big to go fishing with their anchor, or you need a special-purpose recovery vessel as described above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they get the anchor back when it's not an emergency? They can't just pull it up can they? Otherwise that would mean it wouldn't be stuck and could just drag along the ocean floor, right? So how do they &quot;unhook&quot; it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anchor is designed so that when you pull horizontally on it, it digs into the ground and creates more resistance to moving. This is part of the value of the heavy anchor chain - if at least some of the chain is lying flat on the bottom, the boat will act to pull the anchor horizontally.</p>
<p>However, anchors are designed to be easy to pull straight up. So to retrieve the anchor, the boat pulls in the chain. As it gets shorter, the angle from the anchor to the boat gets more and more vertical (and the boat gets pulled directly over the anchor) and then when the chain is too short to reach the bottom, it brings the anchor straight up with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the days of sailing ships, if you needed to navigate a ship upriver or between narrow sandbars and couldn't make sail safely, one way to do that was to put the anchor (chain attached) in a rowboat; row it upstream to the end of its chain; dump it overboard; winch the ship up to the anchor and repeat.</p>
<p>It took <em>forever</em> and was hell on the guys rowing the boat and turning the winch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They just pull it. A lot of the force keeping it still is the chain length on the sea bottom more than the anchor digging in the mud. As for the anchor, the angle locks it in place so pulling it straight up is nothing. </p></div>		</li>
