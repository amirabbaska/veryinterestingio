			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your use of meiosis and mitosis to try and elaborate, but I think you miss the point I asked. What I'm wondering is what conditions could have made the phenomenon of sexual reproduction favourable? It was fine when the single celled organism was dividing on its own but then a genetic mutation occured or spontaneous event that in way or another could've lead to the earliest mechanism of sexual reproduction, now what coild those have been and what were the conditions that allowed them to be the norm? Also you raise two very interesting questions which I'm also quite interested to know now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah.  Yeah, there's a lot of good ideas floated for that, but the truth is we really don't know.  Sex is extremely costly, both in terms of time and effort spent on mating and each participant only passes on half their genes to the offspring, and yet it is nearly universal, particularly among animals (the bdelloid rotifers being a notable exception).</p></div>		</li>
