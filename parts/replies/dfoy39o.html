			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a study about birds along a highway that were being struck by cars as they flew. They were unable to properly gauge the speed of the cars. </p>
<p>Eventually it stopped happening as much, the study found that the birds were growing slightly smaller wings that allowed them to bank quick enough to avoid the cars, while birds with slightly longer ones would still not be able to bank away fast enough.</p>

<p>Either they themselves or their natural predators, anyways.</p>
<p>Prey are <em>usually</em> faster than their predators over a long distance (otherwise they would have all been eaten), but not from a stand-still when the predator has ambushed them.  So if they think they're being ambushed, their first instinct is to dodge sideways across the path of the predator to force it to overshoot.</p>
<p>If they run straight away from the predator, the predator will catch them as they're accelerating from stop.  If they run away to the side, the predator may be able to adjust its path and still end up on their tail.  By crossing in front of the predator, the predator commits to the forward motion and overshoots if the prey timed it right.</p>
<p>...but the prey animals are not programmed for car speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, while cats can defy some physics laws, thats pretty much it - all the animals have no information about any science. Plus all the animals have different kind of sight than humans, so that does it stuff too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, cars move faster than a lot of animals can really understand, which is why birds don't fly away until the last second. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with birdstrikes on aircraft. Apparently birds do it by distance rather than speed, as there's an upper limit to how fast birds of prey can fly. Turns out airliners are a bit faster so this no longer works and they turn too late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^^ This is the answer. Prey animals instinctually cut perpendicular to predators to throw off their momentum by forcing them to change direction suddenly. The prey animals are often smaller and lighter so the change in direction costs the predator more speed than the prey and allows the prey to open up their lead. </p>
<p>Rabbits are good about this. They will run straight for a bit to get the pursuit directed that way then cut across the path of the predator. </p>
<p>Unfortunately cars aren't predators and drivers either don't see them or attempt to avoid them by turning away, which ends up steering right into them as they run across the road. </p></div>		</li>
