			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great information.  I posted a comment down below that I wonder if you could answer: Where then do the withdrawal symptoms come from?</p>
<p>I became highly addicted to caffeine in college and, unbeknownst to me at the time, I went through pretry severe withdrawal symptoms that summer: sweats nausea, mood swings, headache, etc.  Could you speak to the neurochemical/biological reason for that?</p></div>		</li>
