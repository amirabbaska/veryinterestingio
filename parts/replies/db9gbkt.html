			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not even that the fly is seeing things in slow motion. It reacts faster because there is no thought process involved. It's simply reacting to inputs like &quot;suddenly dark&quot; or &quot;air current shifting&quot; And it seems faster than you because well it is tiny and only needs to move 2 inches to get clear of your hand. Also since it weighs about nothing there not much inertia to overcome. You could move those 2 inches much faster than the fly ever could. But you can't accelerate as fast as it can due to more mass. We only perceive these animals as horribly fast because we tend to only perceive their crazy acceleration. But in terms of speed...a fly reaches about 2 mph. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is a step by step guide:</p>
<p>Step One
Understand their weakness:
One of the interesting things about flies is that when they take off from a surface, they fly straight upwards for just a moment before they can go any other direction. This leaves them particularly vulnerable for the first few inches of flight time before they orient themselves and become nearly impossible to kill. The trick is to catch them during this weak moment.</p>
<p>Step Two
Setting the trap:
Let’s just say a fly lands on your leg. Position your hands, palms facing each other about 3 to 4 inches apart, as though you were about to clap. Very slowly, move your hands in this position towards the fly until they are about 3 to 4 inches above the fly, which should be centered between the palms of your hands. If you don’t move slow enough getting to this point, you will scare the fly away, but don’t be discouraged, it does take practice, and if you wait long enough, it’ll be back.</p>
<p>Step Three
The Coup de Grâce:
Once you’ve got your hands in position (make sure hands aren’t too far apart or to far from the fly, otherwise it will escape your trap), clap your hands once firmly. When you open them you should have a dead fly on your hands, pun intended. After a little practice, you’ll rarely miss.</p></div>		</li>

Its why swatters have holes in them.</p></div>		</li>
