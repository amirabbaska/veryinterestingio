			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally you want to find sets of identical (monozygotic) twins who were separated at birth and raised in different families. </p>
<p>If these twins still have a high coincidence of obesity or autism, that suggests a genetic component rather than something that was passed from the parents in a non-genetic way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also try comparing identical and fraternal twins.  Both types of twins have the same level of environmental similarity with their twin, but identical twins have more genetic similarity.  So if there is, eg, a genetic component to autism, you'd expect identical twins to be more similar than fraternal twins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This IS an important thing to keep in mind for something like this.</p>
<p>A good example of falsely equating family history with genetics was in the early 1900's United States. There was an outbreak of a disease that was seemingly communicable but usually isolated itself to families, even if other families shared the same space the disease could spread between family members but wouldn't affect the other groups. It was proposed (partly because of the emerging popularity of genetics) that this was due to a genetic vulnerability; and that theory gained a lot of traction. The answer however that the disease was an advanced form of malnutrition caused by degerming corn, so families usually got it together based on a shared diet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm. Does this necessarily follow? For instance, what if I said: &quot;It is known that obesity has a genetic factor, as people with a family history of obesity have a higher chance of having obese children.&quot; I would expect to get wrecked with a statement like that, even though the second half of the statement is true.</p>

<p>Wasn't it proven reasonably recently that obesity does have an epigenetic component?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first considerations include this; for example parents who are drinking too much tend to raise children who drink. But it works the other way too, like parents who drink tend to be prone to alcohol overconsumption for some genetic reason and this reason can pass to the children, or perhaps a virus or a microbe that lives somewhere in or on the parent goes to the child. Doctors usually can tell whether something is strongly or weakly affected by genetics and the percentages mentioned show that there is a pretty strong genetic factor (and that the environmental factor is important as well).</p>
<p>That said, I would be interested to see what kind of children do autistic parents <em>tend</em> to raise (or depressive parents or parents with OCD).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're talking about the so-called &quot;Refrigerator Mother&quot; hypothesis. It's not completely implausible, I suppose, but by now it has really been thoroughly debunked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prematurity is a well known risk factor for autism as is damage to the brain. Maybe that's a factor? Often one twin has more difficulty getting oxygen than the other, this can cause brain damage. </p>
