			<div class="markdown"><p>The first considerations include this; for example parents who are drinking too much tend to raise children who drink. But it works the other way too, like parents who drink tend to be prone to alcohol overconsumption for some genetic reason and this reason can pass to the children, or perhaps a virus or a microbe that lives somewhere in or on the parent goes to the child. Doctors usually can tell whether something is strongly or weakly affected by genetics and the percentages mentioned show that there is a pretty strong genetic factor (and that the environmental factor is important as well).</p>
<p>That said, I would be interested to see what kind of children do autistic parents <em>tend</em> to raise (or depressive parents or parents with OCD).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're talking about the so-called &quot;Refrigerator Mother&quot; hypothesis. It's not completely implausible, I suppose, but by now it has really been thoroughly debunked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prematurity is a well known risk factor for autism as is damage to the brain. Maybe that's a factor? Often one twin has more difficulty getting oxygen than the other, this can cause brain damage. </p>
