<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore the analytics data is also used to optimize automated campaign optimization through automated bidding or machine learning supported bidding. Why bidding? Because in many networks you need to bid a price to show an ad to a user in real time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you can basically be sure, that they're not selling any data. Their business model is to create the best possible tracking solution to get the most accurate data and then use that to sell you (the advertiser) the possibility to target your Ads as good as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah this line of reasoning I have no problem buying heh into - companies will do what makes the most business sense and giving away their own valuable proprietary data doesn't. </p>
<p>I'd be very interested to learn more about the specific queries that companies are running against Facebook's and Google's data like you mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;show me the average shopping cart amount in USD per marketing channel&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have any other examples or know where I could read up more on those and wouldn't mind sharing, I'm very curious.</p>
<p>Or maybe some example of what the companies who specialize in market analysis are doing, the kind of queries they're running, and the kind of trends they're able to glean from those queries.  I read Martin Lindstrom's Brandwashed and found it kind of fascinating (besides disturbing and creepy) and would be interested in hearing more examples especially based on Facebook and Google's data.  </p>
<p>I wonder if there is any open source marketing analysis being currently done, that'd be really cool if there were?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's open. Just get Google Analytics running on a website of yours, then use AdWords and Facebook Ads to drive valuable traffic to your site. You can then use their APIs to basically create reports. Next step if you're really good, you can use their APIs not only to read data for analysing and optimising manually, but also use their API to programatically steer your campaigns. Merkel and Performics do things like that.</p></div>		</li>
