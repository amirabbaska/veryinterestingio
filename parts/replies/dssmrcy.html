<p>LED strobing is based on current, nothing more</p>
<p>and there aint no auto LEDs on AC anywhere ever</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yah that’s what I said. </p>
<p>A constant DC signal through an LED will not cause strobing. PWM current (which in practice isn’t DC but behaves more like half wave rectified AC) will cause strobing as there are points of 0 current. </p></div>		</li>
