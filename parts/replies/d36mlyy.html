			<div class="markdown"><p>By that point, the civilization which may reach it, would likely already have the needed technology to travel between stars. The purpose may not be to extract the material, but to make use of it. A black dwarf could well have the needed materials to create a ringworld or dyson sphere - transform the entirety of the solar mass into an object for use, rather than extracting and removing it from the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh. Black dwarfs, like white dwarfs, are made out of electron degenerate matter, mostly made out of carbon and oxygen, not heavy elements. Stars that collapse into white dwarfs (instead of neutron stars or black holes) dont usually even ever produce any elements heavier than carbon. Also the gravity on black dwarfs is really really strong. I honestly can not think of a worse place in the universe to mine materials. Besides its pretty irrelevant, by the time black dwarfs will exist, all stars will have died, so as far as we know life cannot exist anymore. Even if humans (or aliens) create a small pocket where they create energy via artificial fusion or fission to sustain life, all of those reserves would have depleted aswell by them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And besides, as long as there's mass, there's energy. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it says they are hypothetical, and its a shame we have no way of finding these. Only maybe as hyper-dense exoplanets of their previous binary partners. (But most likely the binary would have sent some material and kept it active enough that both are luminous in these cases)</p>
<p>The only way to know for sure is if one hits the earth I'm afraid.</p></div>		</li>
