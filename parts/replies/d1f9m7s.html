			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. This happens not only with signals like in beacons but with light itself, as well. So the faster the vessel travels towards us, the bluer it would look because the fequencies of the light would shift towards higher (i.e. bluer) energies.</p>
<p>This effect is also used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy#Motion_in_the_universe" target="_blank">absorption spectroscopy</a> to measure how fast stars travel towards (or away from) us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll have a stationary source &quot;O&quot; giving off a pulse every second that looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O &nbsp; &nbsp;  . &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; . &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; . &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also think about it emitting a wave that looks like  this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O &nbsp;  / &nbsp; \ &nbsp; / &nbsp; \ &nbsp; / &nbsp; \ &nbsp; / &nbsp; \ &nbsp; / &nbsp; \ &nbsp; / &nbsp; \ &nbsp; --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time, the source is moving in the same direction as the pulse/wave. The <em>timing</em> of each peak/pulse is the same, but as the source is moving forward, each peak/pulse shoots off from a little closer to the one before, so they're closer together:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; O-&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;  --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O-&gt; / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ &nbsp;  --&gt;</p>
<p>That's blue shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If the source moves away from the direction it's giving off the pulse/wave, this happens:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;-O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;-O &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; \  --&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's red shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's named blue or red shift because blue is the shortest wavelength of light human eyes are able to perceive, and red is the longest. But it actually compresses/lengthens the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation (everything from gamma rays to radio waves), even the ones you can't see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more obvious day-to-day example of Doppler shift (which red and blue shift are a part of) is the sound of an F1 car / train horn going up in pitch as it moves toward you, and down as it moves away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two kinds of red shifts: Doppler and cosmological (well there's more but these are the ones we are concerned about). Doppler red shift works just like the Doppler effect works when a car drives past: a source's velocity (relative to you) causes the distance between light emissions to be greater with each emission. To put it more clearly, the frequency of the light is <strong>not</strong> affected, but rather the frequency you receive the light.</p>
<p>Cosmological red shift is a result of space expansion. As the light is traveling to you (already left the beacon), space is expanding the light wave. This directly affects the wavelength of the EM wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question seems to be aimed at the relativistic effects rather than the standard red/blue shift.  At relativistic speeds, time dilation would occur relative to an observer on earth.  So if the beacon is tied to spacecraft time, it would be received at slower than one second, even if the spacecraft is moving towards earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relativity has no effect in this question.  The faster it goes away the lower the frequency is.  If the ship is blinking, the frequency of those blinks is lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so I get that time would be moving slower on the spaceship, but here's where it doesn't make sense... to the spaceship time is moving slower on the body it's orbiting too.  Now when the heck does the body being orbited leap forward in time to prove to the people on the spaceship that time was moving slower for them and faster for the people on earth??  </p></div>		</li>
