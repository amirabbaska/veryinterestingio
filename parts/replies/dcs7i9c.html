			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the deal with Ashkenazi Jews? Weren't they some highly isolated ethnic group that somehow wound up being smarter and more successful than most other minorities? Wouldn't this make a case for eugenics, then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. In the early 1900s, evidence showed that Ashkenazi Jews were much lower IQ than baseline whites. Now, evidence shows that they're the highest IQ ethnic group. What changed? It wasn't their genes, not in less than a century. It was other social  and environmental factors, which always dominate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source for Ashkenazi Jews having low IQs as measured in the 1900s?</p>
<p>I would argue that, due to Jews being persecuted for so long, mate selection and legitimate survival of the fittest caused intelligence and ability to problem solve for survival/reproduction purposes led to high IQ being selected for and passed down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My strongest non morality-based case against Eugenics is that it's goal is to reduce the biodiversity of a population by driving toward a common set of genetic factors, and reduction of biodiversity is indirectly but inherently harmful.</p>
<p>Part of &quot;natural selection&quot; is catastrophe which limits the population.  Unintentionally eliminating natural variations by artificially selecting for certain perceived strengths makes a population more susceptible to unknown threats.</p>
<p>Even if Ashkenazi Jews <em>are</em> smarter or more successful, they may also have unknown susceptibilities to various illnesses or conditions.  (in fact, a cursory google search indicates <a href="http://www.webmd.com/children/tc/ashkenazi-jewish-genetic-panel-ajgp-what-are-ashkenazi-jewish-genetic-diseases" target="_blank">this is true</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to this that preserving biodiversity is also important in nature and in our establishment of untouched parkland.  Catastrophe won't just threaten Humans.  It can also go after our food supply.</p>
<p>This is not some hippy-dippy feel good shit that we ought to be one with nature and that the loss of species is bad because nature is beautiful.  No.  Biodiversity is important because it supports human beings, and we are the only sentient life that we know of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are a tremendously successful ethnic group. But is it nature or is it nurture? How much of their success is due to a culture that highly values education and how much is due to a genetic endowment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetic endowement would give you the ability/insight to understand the value of education.  This would cause you to create a culture that values education.</p>
<p>Don't ever forget that Culture is a human made construct.</p>
<p>Ever hear of cultural appropriation?  This word exists because we actively work to change our culture to make it better.</p>
<p>Therefore having a culture that values education more could be an indicator of genes that cause higher intelligence.</p></div>		</li>
