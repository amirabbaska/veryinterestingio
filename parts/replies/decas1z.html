<p>How come if I look at an RGB light source (or any other made up of components for that matter) it looks white to me when looking at it, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The RGB components are so near to each other that our brain perceives their combination as one color.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but if I dart my eyes back and forth across it I can temporarily see the individual red green and blue components?</p>

<p>The quick movement of the eye is enough to increase the time lag of the different RGB components right before it hit your eye.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;time lag&quot; seems to refer to the delay between the component pulses output by the light, but this is entirely independent of what the eye is doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's referring to the way the R, G and B components are not displayed at the same time but in series.</p>
<p>e.g Some projectors alternate between displaying the R,G and B componnt</p></div>		</li>

<p>ELI15: a monitor displays pictures by turning on one LED at a time.  </p>
<p>R G B R G B R G B R G B R B</p>
<p>As it go across the screen, or scans across the screen, the point it's at is called the horizontal sync. After it finishes a row, it drops down and starts turn on each led in that row. As it goes down, row by row, that's called vsync. And that's why you can get screen tearing in games when you don't have vsync (Vertical synchronization) turned on. </p>
<p>Because only one light is technically ever on at any given moment, if you move your head back and forth you make the light spread out across your retina. </p>
<p>Here's an analogy, it's kinda like spraying someone with a hose mister. If you point it at one spot, they get soaked in that one spot, but if you were to shake the hose back and forth as you sprayed someone  they get a little bit of water all over. </p>
<p>The water in this case would be the photons of light, and your unfortunate friend is the back of your eyes. If your eye gets soaked in one spot with red green and blue, you see white. If however, you move your eye, then the red green and blue light will hit a different spot of your retina, and that's why you can see all the colors.</p>
<p>(There's more to it, like your eyes sensitivity to different colors, but hopefully that makes some more sense!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no source on this, but I think it is because those RGB lights are controlled by PWM signals. PWM is basically a signal that changes many times per second. Those signals are used for dimming a light source. </p>
<p>For example:
A red, green and blue LED are connected to a PWM signal. At 100% duty cycle all LEDs will always shine. But if we apply 50% duty cycle. The signal will alternate between full and zero many times. And all those LEDs might not shine all at the same time. So, when you move your eyes quickly, you can see when an individual color shines and when others dont.</p>
<p>Again, I have no sources on this,  but that is how I understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to hopefully answer the first question with my limited knowledge, I want to say that this happens because of the how slowly that RGB source is refreshing that light. Think of a refresh rate on a tv. Moving your eyes that quickly is causing your vision to refresh faster than that light source is and you can see the individual colors.</p></div>		</li>
