			<div class="markdown"><p>You might want to do some reading on dementia in dogs. They show signs a little more openly than a turtle might, but since they're domesticated and tend to live inside of homes, I'm not sure about your last question. Would turtles and whales die quicker because the physical and mental changes make them vulnerable to predators, and since dogs don't have any predators inside the home (hopefully), they're able to show all the symptoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to post something along these lines as a point of discussion. I think that if turtles and whales do get dementia, it probably leads to their death not long after ... animals have to stay pretty active to keep hunting / foraging for their daily meal, and also to escape predators. Unlike humans, who have family / friends / social networks that take care of them when they get dementia, prolonging the survival by some time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm not sure about turtles (plenty enough in captivity for us to study for dementia), I do agree that whales would likely die very quickly. One timing mistake means drowning underwater after all.</p></div>		</li>
