<p>Can you get an emulsion of oil and water?</p>
<p>I know you can oil and vinegar, which is how I make salad dressing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can! They're really the most common everyday type of emulsion. Most salad dressings are oil/water emulsions, like vinaigrette (what you make). Mayonnaise and hollandaise are also oil in water emulsions, and since I imagine you haven't seen a jar of mayonnaise that's separated into its base constituents you can see how this problem can get complicated. Emulsifiers are commonly used to help stabilize an emulsion like mayo, but I imagine for this post we're not considering those.</p>
<p>Emulsions can &quot;break&quot; in four different ways:<br />
Flocculation - the droplets attract each other and form larger agglomerates like a raspberry<br />
Coalescence - the droplets combine into larger single droplets<br />
Creaming - the droplets separate through buoyant forces<br />
Oswald Ripening - a thermodynamic process I don't understand well enough to explain easily</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but since they are already separated you could get a rough estimate using the densities, assuming constant pressure temp etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is temperature also a factor? I know alcohol and water separate when exposed to cold temperatures (due to different freezing points), but does this phenomenon occur with different substances as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>viscosity depends on temperature, so you certainly have it indirectly there. But I don't think that cover all temperature dependence, I have a feeling it will show up in other places too when you break it down.</p></div>		</li>
