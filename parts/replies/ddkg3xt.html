			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  I get so frustrated when I see new outlets completely butcher the conclusions of a scientific study for the sake of a catchy headline.  Buzzfeed and Vice are two of the biggest offenders in my book, but I've seen more reputable news outlets do it too.</p>
<p>It's irresponsible, and I've experienced the consequences firsthand:  I make a living as a research scientist for an organization that wants to create the world's first HIV/AIDS vaccine.  Very often when I tell people what I do for a living, they'll say something like &quot;Oh I saw an article/documentary about how we found a cure for AIDS!&quot; And I'll be like &quot;tell that to the 35 million people that still have it!&quot;  </p></div>		</li>
