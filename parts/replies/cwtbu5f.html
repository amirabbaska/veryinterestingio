			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the Canadian Arctic. I have no bloody idea where the lettuce/salad mixes I buy are grown/processed, but it's not somewhere one day away. I'll buy it and it's perfectly fresh and sometimes last a week or more. Expecting its being grown in Central America, I think there are aliens involved in preserving it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. Basic shrink wrap around a whole lettuce. But I have had instances of half cut lettuce lasting for weeks. </p>
<p>My fridge is extremely cold though, and I know that the Scottish climate can assist in preventing spores and bacterial growth due to how cold it is. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I shop at a supermarket in east Texas... no other choice.  I suspect there are a lot more days packed in here.  The organic produce (especially grapes) is often half rotting, which makes me think we're talking weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know!  I hate that so much.  I think it has more to do with people not buying it as much, though.    Our grocery store finally started carrying a bigger selection of organic produce and most of it is in horrible shape.  They apparently don't reduce the price, so it sits there.  And then we don't get as much organic produce because no one buys it, but no one buys it because they never get fresh produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Organic produce is not grown or processed / packaged with the same chemicals / gases that are able to prolong the life of the food, and thus do not last very long and go bad quicker.  </p>
<p>That's a very generalized explanation, though.</p></div>		</li>
