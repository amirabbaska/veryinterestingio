			<div class="markdown"><p>North American cyclones (hurricanes) originate over the Atlantic ocean from dust on the west coast of Africa.  They travel in a Westward direction, which is the prevailing weather pattern north of the equator, in the tropics.  Due to the rotation of the earth, they turn right and are caught in the Eastward (opposite) weather patter which prevails north of the tropics.   The Philippines get similar cyclones for the same reason.   Basically, being near the equator and near a large body of warm water is a recipe for hurricanes.</p></div>		</li>
