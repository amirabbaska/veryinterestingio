			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like the sun's gravity causes us to orbit it, earth's gravity holds the moon in orbit so it would remain there. Several seconds after the side of the earth in day went dark, the moon would go dark as well.</p>
<p>We would still see stars the same as usual but like the moon the other planets, asteroids, and meteors would go dark and be voids to us if they were in front of stars.</p>
<p>It would be darker because the only light the moon would ever reflect would be the light from the remaining light from electricity on earth. So it would be like a new moon night all the time. Interestingly enough this means that the side of the planet experiencing night would actually be fractionally lighter than day because of the reflected light off the moon.</p></div>		</li>
