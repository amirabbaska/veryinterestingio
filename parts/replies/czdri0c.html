			<p>Anger management problems? This shouldn't even be making you angry in the first place, I don't think management is the issue.</p>		</li>

			<p>I love it! The outdoors are great and the hunting is awesome. It is beautiful every time I look out the window and it is not as cold as people think. I mean, 20F in Alaska, for some reason, feels very different than 20F somewhere else, I believe it is because the air is very dry. <br><br>Never had Polar Bear before, and never heard ay stories. The only I've heard about polar bear is not to eat the liver cause they are toxic, but don't know much about polar bears.</p>		</li>
