			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! I also searched him up on Google scholar and I think I found another one of his papers (I don't know if you've seen it or not)!</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C36&q=earl+v+capps+nebraska&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&p=&u=%23p%3D1flzo1ABMloJ" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C36&q=earl+v+capps+nebraska&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&p=&u=%23p%3D1flzo1ABMloJ</a></p>
<p>It's from the same time period (1900) and is again focused on observational equipment for electromagnetic phenomena, which is the same sort of topic he covered in the thesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit i was wrong:
As I read it more now, he had a similar device as the image <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Zero-Center_Ammeter.JPG/800px-Zero-Center_Ammeter.JPG" target="_blank">here</a> but bigger and a sliding plate. So as the needle goes back and forth and you move the slide box, the needle will &quot;draw&quot; the sine wave in the plate. Really interesting.</p></div>		</li>
