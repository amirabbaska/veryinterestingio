			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it usually has slightly less mass, but the Point stands. If we compare the kinetic energy of the rounds (0.5<em>mass</em>velocity^2), you trade a little on the mass side for a great increase in the velocity that is squared. </p>
<p>Additionally, I believe the rounds themselves are constructed differently due to having very different goals. 9mm rounds generally have a thick body that is more prone to losing velocity in air, but also is more likely to stop in the target rather than passing on through. The 7.62 might pass right through the target which is just fine and dandy when the intent is to kill, but the 9mm is used to stop an assailant and having a round that is deadlier down the road doesn't help much. That round may be better at screwing the guy who is coming at you right now, and all the better if that means he rots in prison instead of dying in the street. Finally, much of that power of the 7.62 is for punching through body armor and other light defenses. While a 9mm can get a little bit, it is more liable to deform first.</p>
<p>Of course I am not an expert (yet), just an amateur who has fired firearms of these calibers. More experienced posters, feel free to correct any errors I made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>F=ma is better applied to the force from the powder charge required to accelerate the bullet. You're thinking of E=1/2mV^2 ie the muzzle energy beagling's talking about. That's what's going to thump whatever is downrange.</p></div>		</li>
