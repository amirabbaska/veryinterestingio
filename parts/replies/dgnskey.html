			<div class="markdown"><p>this actually really scares me when it happens when I am driving.  Especially since I make the effort not to be distracted in anyway while driving.  When I realise I don't recall a portion of the last minute or two on the road, it really freaks me out.  But at the same time, relieved nothing bad happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a Reflexive thing. its scary yes, but its simply because you don't actually remember the action. Sure your not 100% focused on driving, but that means there is nothing important or abnormal going on. When something does happen within your attention, you snap back into it immediately and react reflexively, which is about 90% what you would have done anyway. If it wasn't within your attention, then there is a decent chance you wouldn't have noticed it anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't worry about it. Your brain doesn't completely shut off from paying attention, but just doesn't really commit those portions to memory.<br />
If something crazy happened, like a near accident, then you would remember it.  </p>
<p>It's like watching TV and stopping a recording during the commercials. The commercials still played and you still watched them, but you only recorded the actual TV show.</p></div>		</li>
