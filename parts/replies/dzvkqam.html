			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much success with transdifferentiation. You get a major paper every few years saying it's possible, and then usually a rebuttal paper a year later. Far more likely to be successful will be stem cell programming, as the major transcription factors that specify for islet cells are pretty well studied. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's dozens of them. Pdx1, MafA, akt, sm7, are also a hot spots. It's more so a matter of who can get a viable combination going in an animal model that's efficient in higher organisms. </p></div>		</li>

<p>a single donor is unlikely to provide enough viable islets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do the islets regenerate after donation? Could they be banked by cryopreservation or something similar until enough has been donated to increase the odds of a successful transplant?</p>
<p>I have family who are diabetic and this is kind of fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Islets and beta cells show very poor regenerative potential, which is a large part of why diabetes is such a challenging disease. </p>
<p>I do not know much about cryopreservation of islets. My gut instinct says no, because the 3d morphology of the islets is key to their function in addition to cellular integrity, which would be greatly disrupted by cryopreservation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in islet transplantation research and your gut instinct is right. Islets are too sensitive to withstand the freezing medium and the thawing process, the recovery is so low that you're just wasting cells that are hard to get hold of anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately (and I say this as a T1DM), these donations will really not mean much until we deal with the autoimmune aspect of T1. Otherwise they'll just be killed off the exact same way as your original islet cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Same here T1D. Dr. Faustman is doing a lot of promising research about this using BCG which is an inexpensive, generic drug used for about 100 years in countries where tuberculosis rates are high. She found that when injected in mice, it reversed the autoimmune attack in the islet cells. Itâ€™s currently in phase II clinical trials here in the US.
