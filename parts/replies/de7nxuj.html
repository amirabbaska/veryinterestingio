			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting. Is the differences between indigenous and non-indigenous because of the location of the courts (i.e. In a different jurisdiction) or because indigenous people have additional protections under the law? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indigenous people in Australia are significantly over-represented in the criminal justice system - e.g. they make up approx 3% of the general population but approximately 1/4 of those in gaol. As a result, there are Indigenous Legal Aid not-for-profits federally funded throughout Australia - e.g. Aboriginal Legal Service in NSW/ACT, Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Service (CAALAS) in the NT and so on. Because Indigenous Australians are so over-represented and come from (generally) quite disadvantaged backgrounds, they have those additional protections under the law, and legal aid bodies specifically trained and focus on dealing with Indigenous-specific issues..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Queensland there is a similar safeguard in the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/ppara2000365/s420.html" target="_blank">Police Powers and Responsibilities Act</a>.</p>
<p>The safeguard here however is </p>
<p>(a) for questioning (Not just because a person is under arrest)</p>
<p>(b) Not actually a blanket requirement. It is only if the person is at a disadvantage... see the wording below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) Subsection (2) does not apply if, having regard to the person's level of education and understanding, a police officer reasonably suspects the person is not at a disadvantage in comparison with members of the Australian community generally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often times if I caution a person ('read them their rights'), and they indicate that they want to speak with a lawyer I will just let them know that the lawyers advice will be do not answer any questions or provide a version. To save both our time.</p>
<p>Side note, one thing that does amuse me a little is the blanket advice to not speak with police. There have been many times in my career when I have needed a person to provide a formal version so that I could finalise an investigation with no action/unfound the complaint. Without a version contrary to the other evidence the investigation would either stay open with them as a suspect, or they may be charged with the offence. This is fairly common, and not just a personal experience - have observed many other officers investigations the same. My point being that it is sometimes a good idea to speak.</p></div>		</li>
