			<div class="markdown"><p>They can deal with small issues like broken bones, infections etc. They have a board to fixate people on, I think it was shown in a walkthrough by Andre Kuipers. Surgery is not really possible, think of what would happen when you cut someone open when there's no gravity... Could be a good horror movie scene, blood would be spraying everywhere.
Research is being done on fully submerged surgery, where the cut is being made in a closed box filled with liquid. The liquid is continuously refreshed, so the surgeon can still see properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well,most of what comes to mind would be negative, but one bonus is that when you're in space, your body needs less plasma volume as a side-effect of not having to combat gravity to maintain blood pressure, so for transfusions, plasma would be much less of a necessity.  Blood volume in space is about 1/5 lower than on earth.</p>
<p>The other side of the above is that, if you have a weak heart, you're much less likely to have heart problems while you remain in space, because the heart has to significantly less work while you're there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People (mostly Russians) have been in space longer than that and not needed surgery or any other advanced medical care.  I imagine the risk of going to Mars is higher than being in a space station though.  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/content/one-year-crew/" target="_blank">NASA is currently preparing for a year-long mission to the ISS.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The coagulation cascade isn't influenced by that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you cut an arteria, clotting isn't helping you anymore, neither on earth nor in space. Then it's time to have medically skilled people very near.</p>
<p>Despite the benefit in space, that the little flying blood balls would definitely look fabulous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>James Irwin had a heart issue that came up during apollo 15, and what the head doctor said was this :</p>
<p>&quot;In truth, he's in an ICU. He's getting one hundred percent oxygen, he's being continuously monitored, and best of all, he's in zero g. Whatever strain his heart is under, well, we can't do better than zero g.&quot;</p>
<p>So I guess that you're already in more or less the best possible conditions in case something pops up. No idea how it would go for actual surgery type things needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, the issue went away during the flight back - keep in mind that it would take them days to get back to earth and the heart issues appeared during a pretty stressful moment of the mission, so he had time to recover, especially since he was in optimal conditions. He did, however, have a heart attack a few months after the mission, and he also went on to search for Noah's Ark in Turkey (no kidding).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what kind of heart trouble it is. Assuming he was generally in very good condition as astronauts tend to be, it may well have been a passing phenomenon, a minor clot or something, as opposed to weakness or damage to the heart itself, so once that's passed, he'd be fine to re-enter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As of 2014, most of the blood draws that take place in during space flight are for research purposes rather than immediate diagnostics and get sent back to Earth for analysis.  Laboratory equipment, while constantly advancing, is still pretty large or requires reagents/produces waste in quantities that are not conducive to the space environment.  </p>
<p>Per NASA's medical requirements, all astronauts have a pre-flight complete blood cell count with white cell differential, clinical chemistry analysis, C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, bone markers, iron studies, and a routine urinalysis.  This same profile is repeated as soon as the astronauts return from flight and any deviation from the pre-flight baseline is addressed and treated.</p>
<p>However, clinical diagnostics in space are making improvements, with NASA recently evaluating and selecting a miniaturized analyzer for use on the ISS to provide one of the most basic and essential labs, a white blood cell count.  This will be the first WBC analyzer to ever be used on a space vehicle.  Equipment that is currently onboard the ISS includes blood collection supplies, a fixed-angle centrifuge, a portable ultrasound, and the Abbott i-STAT, a handheld device that uses separate cartridges to measures a variety of constituents, primarily pertaining to clinical chemistry.</p>
<p>edit: And for what it's worth since you mentioned heart attacks, the i-STAT offers a cassette that measures cardiac troponin-I, the new gold standard in acute myocardial infarction.  Depending on if the ISS stocks that cassette, it could definitely be utilized.  Just a fun aside.  :)</p></div>		</li>
