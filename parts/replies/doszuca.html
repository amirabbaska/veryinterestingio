			<div class="markdown"><p>I got diagnosed with malnutrition at hospital when I had to have a blood transfusion due to anemia (poor diet due to food issues &amp; bad mental health meant I didn't cook etc either). I was super fucked up physically due to the lack of vitamins etc. I couldn't even go on a bush walk (my favourite activity) cause I was too exhausted to make it.
I feel for your missus!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the subject of omega-3's, worth noting you typically have to take in a lot more per day than you get in general consumer supplements - ~4g a day of high purity, non-oxidised omega 3 is typical in cardiometabolic intervention studies that actually show benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This and the particular type of Omega 3 matters as well.  If you are going this route, just ask your doctor a prescription.  Be aware it does have side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. DHA seems a lot more effective. I was involved (loosely) with a study of supplementation in patients with NAFLD, and beneficial effect was only associated with DHA enrichment, not EPA enrichment (the study used omacor, 4g per day).</p></div>		</li>
