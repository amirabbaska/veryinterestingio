			<div class="markdown"><p>Ashley P. here - neat thought. Interestingly, one of the biggest mammal extinctions might have been the one that gave us our shot at world domination: the K/Pg extinction that took out the big dinosaurs. Mammals don't come through unscathed: they seem to lose about half of their diversity. They take a pretty hit, but make it across the line and recover fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ashley Reynolds here! While at least some species of most of the major groups of mammals survived the end-Cretaceous extinction event, they were still pretty hard hit, especially in North America. Dietary specialists, like strict carnivores or herbivores, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gregory_Wilson4/publication/257985514_Mammals_across_the_KPg_boundary_in_northeastern_Montana_USA_dental_morphology_and_body-size_patterns_reveal_extinction_selectivity_and_immigrant-fueled_ecospace_filling/links/0c9605268b17ce925c000000/Mammals-across-the-K-Pg-boundary-in-northeastern-Montana-USA-dental-morphology-and-body-size-patterns-reveal-extinction-selectivity-and-immigrant-fueled-ecospace-filling.pdf" target="_blank">were particularly prone to going extinct</a>. It definitely wasn't on the scale of some of the other major extinctions, but nothing to scoff at!</p></div>		</li>
