			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe is spatially infinite, it was always so and can still have the predicted definite age. Imagine an x-y plane. It goes off to infinity in every direction. Now double the distance between every point. That's how an infinite universe expands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, but even if it's infinite, it still started with the Big Bang and spread from there. Kinda like even though it's infinite it's only been expanding a set amount of time right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No the age of the Universe affects how far you can see in the past, at what &quot;distance/time&quot; you could look. It doesn't have any influence on how big it is (stuff you cannot observe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way, I have a deflated balloon, and I draw two dots anywhere on this balloon. It would take an ant 1 second to crawl about an inch. Now I start inflating the balloon, as time increases, the time it would take the ant to travel from one dot to the other increases. And pairs of dots that were further apart to start with get much much further apart at the end. If we continue to inflate at a high enough rate and never stop, there are points on the balloon that the ant could <em>never</em> get to, because they keep getting further away faster than the ant can move.</p>
<p>The ant in our analogy is light, and the balloon is our expanding universe. The distance the ant could have traveled to us is less than the size of the balloon, aka the distance light could travel since the Big Bang is less than the size of the universe. Since light is the only information we have, we do not know how large the balloon/universe is, but we don't see any light from more than 14 billion years ago.</p>
<p>I hope that made a little sense about how age, distance, and total size do and do not relate to one another.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seeing such higher level of thinking really makes me jealous. I want to know as much as I can! (College needs to be cheaper..)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then I suggest watching PBS Space Time on YouTube. Go back to the early episodes and work your way forward. The math may go completely over your head, but I think you'll still find the thought experiments interesting. There are also lots of other good science YouTube channels that explain a lot of these concepts without all the advanced mathematics. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What courses available online dive into the math used for this subject/area? Has to exist somewhere.</p></div>		</li>
