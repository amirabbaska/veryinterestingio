			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the high sodium is one of the best parts. It makes you thirsty for liquids (water, juice, etc), right? I dunno, I always feel great when I'm sick and I have something with high sodium. Wait, maybe I'm thinking of a hangover. Okay I don't know </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just chicken specifically, but I wouldn't say any soup is as helpful. Creamy soups probably aren't great if you're feeling congested with a lot of mucus, high acid or high fat soups probably aren't great if you're sick to your stomach. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our stomachs produce different enzymes and whatnot to break down certain foods. Things like steak take much longer than something like watermelon. From what I remember, red meats and such can take upwards of three hours, versus watermelon's thirty minutes. Also, once you release enzymes to break down the protein, it slows down the process for the lighter food. So if you eat that watermelon right after a steak, it's like it just sits there fermenting as your stomach works to finish the steak</p></div>		</li>
