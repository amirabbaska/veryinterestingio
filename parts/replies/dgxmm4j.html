<blockquote>
<p>Researchers have suspected a link between sonar testing and whale deaths for nearly 20 years. In 2000, the U.S. Navy said its sonar exercises led six beaked whales to fatally beach themselves in the Bahamas, and stranded whales have died near sonar-testing sites in at least five other cases since then. It hasn't been clear how the sonar disorients the animals and causes such strandings, but some marine biologists suspect that the intense sound waves force whales to shoot to the surface, and they've found evidence that tiny nitrogen bubbles expand in the whales' tissues and damage vital organs (ScienceNOW, 9 October 2003). The same thing happens when scuba divers surface too quickly--a condition known as the bends. <strong>But a whale holds its breath when diving, preventing nitrogen buildup, so the theory didn't seem to hold water.</strong> A group led by marine biologist Peter Tyack of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts suspected that whales alter their diving behavior in some other way.</p>
<p>Whales make repeated shallow dives when trying to evade predators. The team wondered whether such behavior could be risky, especially because naval sonar--which is similar in frequency to the calls of the beaked whale's most feared adversary, the killer whale--could be forcing the whales to adopt a similar diving pattern. So the researchers mathematically analyzed dive behavior in Cuvier's beaked whales and in dolphins to test whether nitrogen bubbles could expand in whale tissue during repeated shallow dives. The team incorporated known physiological data into a model that charts how the bubble size might increase in the circulatory system, brain, muscles, and fat tissues when a whale dives repeatedly to between 30 and 80 meters for as long as 3 hours.</p>
<p>During normal diving behavior, scientists believe, the lungs of marine mammals collapse when they plunge past 72 meters in depth. That &quot;clever mechanism,&quot; Tyack says, prevents nitrogen from infiltrating the bloodstream. The team's model predicts that if the whales' lungs do not collapse during a long series of shallow dives, the increased pressure can cause nitrogen bubbles to diffuse into tissues, increasing the risk of bubble formation on ascent. Limiting the duration of sonar testing may prevent the animals from diving in these harmful patterns, the team concludes in the current issue of <em>Marine Mammal Science</em>.</p>
<p>Noting that diving behavior is extraordinarily difficult to study in live animals, marine biologist Terrie Williams of the University of California, Santa Cruz, calls the model &quot;extremely useful.&quot; As new research shores up gaps in the model's assumptions--with actual observations to corroborate the avoidance behavior, for example--scientists can try to home in on a safe length and level of sonar exercises, clarifying the murky waters surrounding this debate. &quot;Now it's a question of how quickly [decompression sickness] happens,&quot; she says. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2007/12/why-do-whales-get-bends" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's incredibly interesting both how they seem to have mechanisms to prevent illness and how those mechanisms can fail. It's so hard to study these guys in a real environment but it's clearly something that needs to be done--both for their preservation as we damage ocean life, and for understanding of these systems that could help humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deep sea diving whales are very hard to study for obvious reasons. We still don't know blue whale mating practices, for example.</p>
<p>Another part of the issue is where whales were once commonplace and kings of the oceans, they were all hunted to the brink and now are quite rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. I wonder how (and if) the biological / evolutionary mechanisms that whales and other mammalian marine life have evolved over millions of years to deal with these sort of issues can one day also be applied to humans, namely through improved scientific understanding and technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How is a whale holding its breath related to preventing nitrogen buildup?</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, nitrogen buildup is caused by nitrogen dissolving in the body tissues, at higher pressure. Holding its breath wouldn't prevent the pressure from rising, it would just compress the air in the whale's lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably has to do with limited exposure. If you're holding your breath there a finite about of nitrogen available you buildup in the tissues. While continuous breathing, scuba gear, provides a constant source of nitrogen laying to a increase in exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK much about whales but i do know about freediving which is basically what whales do, no? Human freedivers don't generally suffer from decompression sickness despite being able to dive to depths from which a scuba diver would have to make a controlled ascent. I'm to lazy to give you a full run down right now so i'm just gonna <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-free-divers-avoid-getting-the-bends" target="_blank">link you a decent description of why not</a> and <a href="http://www.skin-diver.com/departments/ScubaMed/FreedivingCauseDCS.asp?theID=626" target="_blank">one for the circumstances required for it TO happen</a>... in humans anyways. I assume, being mammals, that whales aren't that different in this respect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The partial pressure of nitrogen and other gases is the same as at the surface.So right now you are breathing a pressure of about 1 atmosphere. If you hold your breath and go down 10 meters, you still have 1 atmosphere of air in your lungs.
When scuba diving, you need the air delivered at high pressure to compensate for the higher pressure preventing your chest from expanding. (This is why you can breathe through a tube from the bottom of a pool). So in scuba gear at 10 meters you are breathing 2 atmospheres of air. You now have more nitrogen pressure in your lungs and the gas moves to an area of lower pressure (your blood stream). For each 10 meters you take in another atmosphere of air.</p>
<p>Do this long enough and the nitrogen pressure in your body will match at in your lungs. If you go to the surface slowly, your body will have time to diffuse the nitrogen back into your lungs to be exhaled. Surface too quickly and the nitrogen will not have enough time to diffuse and will form bubbles in you blood stream and tissues. The pain causes people to curl up their arms and legs -- thus the &quot;bends&quot;</p>
<p>So the whale takes in 1 atmosphere of air into its lungs and dives to 50 meters, it still only has one atmosphere of air in its lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was scuba diving once off Norfolk VA. While I was on the way up a pinging noise sounded like it was splitting my head in half. as I surfaced a Navy sub running on the surface was passing our boat.</p>
<p>I said to the dive master &quot;man that sonar was loud&quot;, he replied that it was just their depth finder, if it had been sonar it would've really hurt. I don't know if he was technically correct or not. I know it hurt like hell.</p>
<p>Now imagine being hit with something like that and youre an animal that's designed to hear things underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A navy submarine can ping its water so loudly that it will vaporize the water near the sonar suite. It can be used to basically liquefy the internal organs of hostile divers or... More nefariously, obliterate overboard sailors from sunken vessels.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A friend of mine was working up against the hull and wasn't correctly evacuated before a neighboring naval ship tested their sonar.  He described the noise as so ungodly loud that he believes it caused permanent sinus damage.  To be clear, my buddy was inside the ship and not in the water at the time.</p>
<p>It may be apocryphal, but I've heard that could actually kill someone who was that close in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, humans can get the bends even without scuba, just from holding their breath. So compressed gas is not explicitly for the bends. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Advanced freedivers conducting repetitive deep dives for long periods underwater, with little recovery time at the surface have developed decompression sickness from an accumulation of nitrogen in the body. History has revealed commercial freedivers (those making a living harvesting pearls, sponges, lobster, fish, etc.) doing breath-hold dives for several hours in a day, to depths of 60 to 90+ feet, for periods of two minutes or more per dive, have displayed signs and symptoms of decompression sickness. </p>
