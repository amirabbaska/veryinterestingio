			<div class="markdown"><p>A physiology teacher once expalined this to me in a way I thought was useful. Obviously paraphrasing but he said that the body is basically a really sore loser and reasonably so. If you dont fight of something its not like it will give you terms of surrender. So our immune system basically ensures that if something is trying to infect and kill you, either the infection get destroyed or the body destroys itself before anyone else can. Essentially it just stems from an evolutionary pressure that major overreacting generally saves more than even mild underreacting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only certain ones. The really common, nondescript 'flu like' symptoms are the most easily identifiable symptoms from your immune system. Your throat hurts while you have he flu or strep because it's killing your throat cells. In the case of the flu because of that your lungs get clogged with mucus, hence your deep chest cough. </p>
<p>Kinda depends I guess but I'm not an expert. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pathogens can definitely do a lot of damage on their own so I wouldn't say &quot;almost all&quot; really, but for any given infection probably at least a few symptoms are a result of the body's defense mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a physician.  That usually is not true.   Many viruses release substances that have very specific effects on the cells in our body to cause these symptoms.   The degree of specificity is actually quite amazing.  They often act on certain receptors in cells to cause symptoms.    </p>
<p>Many stomach bugs that cause diarrhea directly do this by releasing substances that affect the cell lining specifically causing those cells to not reabsorb fluid back into your body or to increase the amount of fluid released from your body into the GI tract.   It has nothing to due with an immune response.   This is advantageous to the bacteria because it makes it more likely you will pass it to another host.  </p>
<p>The same can be said about many viruses that cause colds.  If my memory serves correctly, the rhinovirus is a good example of this.   By making you produce copious amounts of mucous and sneezing, you are much more likely to pass it on.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems kind of like &quot;what came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot; We have evolved with these bacteria/viruses over a long period of time. The rhinovirus, while causing sneezing is a good example of your point, but the increased congestion and also mucous production is a byproduct of increased blood flow to that area in an attempt to provide adequate immune support. Also is there a survival advantage for the bacteria that causes your body not to reabsorb fluid by doing so? With c. Difficile a toxin is produced, which if allowed to build up can cause serious damage, so it is important not to give those patients anti-diarrheals. You are right that most of the symptoms from diseases are triggered by specific substrate/receptor interaction but I don't think that necessarily disproves my point as my arguments don't disprove yours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the molecules produced by infectious agents have a direct affect on the proteins in the body to cause these symptoms, I think it is clear what the primary cause is.   Find a professional level text book on the matter and study it.   I have a feeling you will agree with me afterwards.   </p>
<p>C. diff is a bit of an exception.   First it is almost entirely limited to people that have been exposed to antibiotics.   The use of imodium or other anti-motility agents in severe cases can increase the likelihood of toxic megacolon.   This isn't necessarily because of the build up of toxins as you put it.   </p>
<p>Imodium and other such agents are typically safe for other more common causes of diarrhea.  </p></div>		</li>
