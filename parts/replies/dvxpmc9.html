Tech noob here: so is each colour assigned a specific numeric value (converted into binary in its most basic form?) and this is probably a question that merits a lengthy, in depth answer but how exactly are computers &quot;taught&quot; to associate a specific colour with one value?

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what the &quot;color channels&quot; part of _whatdoido's comment refers to. A color is typically described by three colors, the amount of red, green, and blue, respectively. This isn't just for machine learning, either, uncompressed images on your computer are just collections of numbers, with red, green, and blue values for each pixel.</p>
<p>Generally, the computer has no conception of colors associated to these numbers. It just uses the numbers directly and learns that certain arrangements of numbers produce certain outputs. </p></div>		</li>
