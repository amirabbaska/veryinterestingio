			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good post!  What kind of studies are there on culture/subculture and attachment to certain genres?  I'm a brown kid from the burbs, as such Hip Hop and Reggae for example have zero emotional resonance with me.  How does that factor into musical tastes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, things like culture/subculture are really complex and it's hard to make accurate umbrella statements.  We can unpack your question into a few more-specific questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How does the culture you're immersed in affect music tastes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does your personal cultural attachment affect music tastes?</p>
</li>
<li>How does your desire to be perceived as a member of a culture affect music tastes?</li>
</ol>
<p>I answered 1 above - being immersed in music from a given culture gives you more sensitivity to its contents.  This tends to make you like it more - if you can understand the way it's trying to communicate emotion, you're more likely to like it - but it doesn't by any means imply that you <em>will</em> like it.  Conversely, if you're not exposed to a certain type of music all the time, you're less likely to be able to pick up on its emotional content.  These things are reinforced by social relationships - if your friends are all talking about how good a song is, it'll make you more likely to identify it as good.</p>
<p>2 is pretty complex too.  There's the surface level - &quot;I listen to this music because I want to fit in / want people to perceive me in a certain way.&quot;  That doesn't imply a personal enjoyment of the music, of course!  But your tastes do shift when you try to use music in this way, leading to personal enjoyment.  Additionally, there may be personality traits associated with music which you want to present in yourself.  Maybe you listen to metal because you like to think of yourself as a badass (or want to feel like one for the duration of a song), or you listen to indie rock to appear/feel sensitive.  This forms a feedback loop - someone listens to indie because of its cultural association to sensitivity, the music makes them feel sensitive, they personally associate indie with sensitivity even more, their peers notice this and do so as well.</p>
<p>3 is a new question to me, so I did a little research.  Reeves et al (2015) found that placing someone in a situation where they're very aware of social standing (e.g. by talking to them about class for a while) will make them more likely to show a preference for &quot;high brow&quot; music like classical.  They also found that musical tastes are a subconscious tool for promoting or avoiding stereotypes; that people sometimes reject music which stereotypes dictate they &quot;should like,&quot; because in their brain that music is associated with those stereotypes they find to be negative.  The converse is true too, however - people seeking to embrace a stereotype applied to them will often do so by embracing the music.</p>
<p>Obviously when you bring in things like subculture and race, stuff gets muddied very quickly, since culture and race are such complex subjects.  There is a lot to pick apart and it is hard to make any conclusive definitive statements... which is why this can be such a fascinating area of study!  Sorry to be so long-winded, this stuff just fascinates me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note I never really listened to music growing up and was always concerned when friends would repeat a whole rap song as I wondered when they had time to learn it. We'd often  hang out first thing in the morning until bed time.<br />
Anyways fast forward to high school. I end up growing my hair long. People assume I'm into metal. I give it a listen and surprise, I'm into metal. Every friend growing was rap and hip-hop. I'm not fond of those genres.<br />
So it's a crapshoot maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, &quot;it's a crapshoot&quot; definitely applies here.  It's very complex and impossible to predict all the time - you can only make educated guesses and &quot;most of the time&quot; statements.  It's like playing poker - if you have three kings, you'll probably win, but poker is a game of randomization and nothing is guaranteed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in a lot of cases of first genre love it's the type of music you first take the initiative of investing your time into. For them it was rap. For you it was metal.</p>

<p>They made time, and that's why it was meaningful to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered how investing time into genres effected music tastes. It’s weird for me because I’ve always really appreciated and enjoyed genres like classic rock, grunge, metal, blues, reggae. But the only genre that I’ve been able to read articles about and really invest myself into has been hip hop. What’s weird to me is that I enjoy rap just as much as these other genres but when it comes to other types of music I enjoy I don’t have nearly as much genre-knowledge outside of the music itself. The only other genre I could say I invested myself in was edm which I followed in middle school back when skrillex was big. Back then I used to follow a few indie edm labels pretty consistently but nowadays I’m completely out-of-the-loop when it comes to edm and the rave scene, despite it being the first genre I invested my own interest in. (Aside from stuff I heard from my parents) I guess I’m wondering why it’s easy to enjoy all types of music but still hard to learn about more than a couple genres?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. That makes me think of marching songs or football chants. Maybe simple tunes sung together helps raise testosterone and team bonding? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's well-demonstrated that group songs, particularly traditional ones that &quot;our team always sings,&quot; promote teamwork and organization.  I don't know of any research on things like simplicity (though since simple music is more universal/easier to relate to, I would guess that it performs better for bonding) or testosterone (but given the above-mentioned link to musical complexity, you may be on to something there).</p>
<p>Research is in order!  Propose a study!</p></div>		</li>
