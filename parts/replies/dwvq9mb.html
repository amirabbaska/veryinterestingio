<p>It will tell you how much light hits a surface in Lux that's lumens/m^2. You can see how much brightness varies. In direct sunlight it can be over 100k Lux, just from indirect sunlight in a room you can have over 500 lux, indoor lighting is only 20-30 lux, at night with street lights it's 1-3 lux, in moonlight even during a full moon it's less than 1 lux. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not sure if luminosity has a logarithmic unit, though.</p>

<p>In photography we talk of &quot;stops&quot;, or EVs (exposure values) which are base-2 logarithmic. The three sides of the &quot;exposure triangle&quot;—shutter speed, aperture size, and ISO gain/sensitivity—are all defined in terms of EVs so changing any of them by one &quot;step&quot; results in halving or doubling the amount of light.</p>
<p>In astronomy the luminosity of celestial objects is usually discussed in terms of apparent and absolute magnitudes, which for historical reasons are defined on a roughly base-2.5 log scale.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He is not talking about the units of measurement, but the <em>response</em> of the sensory organ.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I quoted him saying literally this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not sure if luminosity has a logarithmic unit, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I replied that yes, there are logarithmic units of luminosity used in some fields exactly because the response of the eye is logarithmic and luminosity differences found in nature span several orders of magnitude (eg. the difference of light levels between starlit night and bright daylight is roughly 20 stops, or a factor of one million). In photography it's really intuitive to think in terms of stops. In astronomy, the magnitude scale dates back to a one-to-seven scale of star brightnesses defined in the antiquity. Much later the scale was found to roughly correspond to log luminosity and was redefined in terms of logarithms (thus the weird base of ~ 2.516).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never quite understood this... if we perceive sound as approximately logarithmic, would you not need to square the intensity of the sound to perceive it as double? So if you had 4 speakers you'd need 16 to double the volume? Multiplying by 10 just adds one to a logarithm of base 10, which was increment 10 in decibels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiplying by ten doesnt double the value. It changes the dB value by ten. This means when you have a Sound with 30dB you need 10*10*10=1000 times the sound waves to get 30+10+10+10=60dB, so to perceive it twice as loud. You can check the Wikipedia article on dB (decibel). Hope that helps</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that the answer was poorly phrased.  A more accurate way to say it is that if going from 1 light to 2 in a room makes the perceived brightness go up by a certain amount, to make it go up by the same amount again you need 4 lights, 8, 16, 32... and so on.</p></div>		</li>
