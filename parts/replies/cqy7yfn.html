			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity is dynamic as you move through the atmosphere. There is a density term in the denominator that blows it up when starting from space.</p>
<p>Also specifically for this question the feather is starting at orbital speeds.</p>
<p>As for dropping the feather? I would love to see your calculations on that. There should be a point where the change in density and the acceleration/deceleration terms allow the feather to avoid reaching speeds or experiencing drag that would destroy it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's why the calculation would be fun, and why we need to know how &quot;high&quot; up to start.  Because terminal velocity would be, well, c, if there were no resistance.</p>
<p>There is a velocity at which an oxygen molecule will bind with the stuff in the feather.  If the terminal velocity can reach this velocity, then the feather will start to burn one atom at a time.</p>
<p>I think what this boils down to is &quot;how high must you drop the feather from for it to burn up in the atmosphere&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Only if you strapped a rocket to the feather. If you're just dropping it, terminal velocity from an arbitrarily large distance approaches the escape velocity, or about 11km/s for Earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're doing calculations anyway, could you replace the feather by a parachutist? Assume decaying orbit, large enough parachute to carry weight of spacesuit, etc. I'm wondering if one could survive, jumping from a space station where something went wrong.. assuming that space station was also in a stable orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is: unshielded, no a person could not survive reentry from orbit.</p>
<p>However NASA played with the design of an inflatable reentry shield designed for 2 people to lie down in back in the 60's. Due to larger crew sizes becoming the norm they ended up dropping it before proven but the physics was good. The general idea has beeen used for Mars rentry and orbital equipment recovery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Due to what? Could the parachute not slow down the descent more as the air got &quot;thicker&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a parachutist to have the same ballistic coefficient as a feather, the parachute would have to be approximately 500m in diameter.</p>
<p>And you'd need to figure out how to open it without any air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>For argument, we should assume that the feather has no lateral velocity relative to earth's atmosphere. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a really, really large assumption. An object in orbit generally has a couple MJ/kg potential energy relative to the surface, and a couple <em>dozen</em> MJ/kg of kinetic energy.  That's a very large portion of the feather's energy to just handwave away.</p></div>		</li>
