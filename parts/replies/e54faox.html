			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom after her 3rd surgery was all mixed up on random days. She would speak but the words were not strung together in a way that made sense.
We gave her paper and pen and she wrote out the same type of sentences but with perfect penmanship.
We then would ask her to read back what she wrote and she could tell it was nonsense.</p>
<p>It was obvious she was the most frustrated by this. And some days she could communicate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that article is really misleading. This doesn't challenge what we know about consciousness at all, because he still has all his brain regions, they're just smaller. It's not like they removed a region associated with consciousness and found out he was still conscious.</p></div>		</li>
