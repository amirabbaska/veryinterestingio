They're not very useful for human engineering, but they do occur naturally in various places, in particular inside large icy moons in the outer solar system.</p></div>		</li>

1) How large of an ice VI chunk would be necessary to take 20fl oz of Coke from room temperature (23C) to &quot;refreshingly cold&quot; (Officially 38F, or 3.333C)?<br />
2) How expensive would it be to make said chunk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be pedantic, but... wait, what am I saying. </p>
<p>With every intention of being pedantic, it depends on the temperature. Ice-VI can be anywhere from (roughly) -160 to +80°C. You could just as easily get some to heat your Coke as chill it.</p>
<p>I personally prefer the reliably chilly ice-II for my drinks, when I can get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obJQtDQRolE" target="_blank">the neighbor kid</a> to make me some. </p>
<p>(Disclaimer: this kid is not actually my neighbor.)</p>
<p>(Additional disclaimer: this may not be ice-II, but it's a good try.)</p></div>		</li>
