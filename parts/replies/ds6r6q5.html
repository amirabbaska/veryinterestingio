			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in regards to energy efficiency, .5G would be much easier to lift and erect things (even after human muscles atrophy, a crane would need less energy to lift the same object)</p>
<p>However, Titan only has a surface gravity of .13G and still keeps surface atmosphere at 1.5Bar. You've just gotta be OK with it being methane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Methane is okay, it's no more toxic than nitrogen. You just need a breathing apparatus to get enough oxygen, no need for a pressure suit.</p>
<p>Temperature would be more of a challenge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it is not really a deal breaker.  If we get to Titan, we've already mastered living in space.  Living in an un-breathable, hazardous atmosphere that has acceptable pressure seems comparatively easy.  Its cold enough that you'd need sealed habs anyhow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lack of atmosphere isn't because of gravity - mars lost most of it  and is still losing to the solar winds. It has no magnetic field to protect itself. The core is dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>0.5g would be plenty to hold an atmosphere (even an Earth-like one), depending on other conditions. For example, the surface gravity of Mars is barely 1/3 that of Earth, and Mars had a substantial atmosphere for millions of years. Really the <em>only</em> reason it no longer has an atmosphere is because geological activity largely stopped many millions of years ago. Having a magnetic field can help, but geological activity is by far the most important factor in atmosphere thickness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe geological activity is typically linked with a spinning iron core - which means a magnetic field, which protects the atmosphere from solar wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, geological activity is the motion of the tectonic plates; it's mostly caused by heat inside the planet, and the reason why it's important is because it actively releases gasses into the atmosphere. The Earth still has active geology, and so even though we lose millions of tons of atmosphere per year (due to various different mechanisms), it is replenished about as fast as it is lost.</p>
<p>Mars is very geological stable; very little is going on inside of the planet, and so its atmosphere is barely replenished at all.</p>
<p>This has nothing whatsoever to do with magnetic fields, which do provide some minor protection against losses due to the solar wind, but it isn't even close to perfect (and, in fact, there are certain mechanisms of atmosphere loss that are <em>caused</em> by having a magnetic field).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the thing - your <em>everything</em> from the cellular level on up has evolved over the course of millennia and one of the few constants has been that your stuff is designed to operate at 1 g.</p>
<p>So everything is lighter. So your blood and your urine are going to be less dense. Microscopic debris is now to dense to get flushed out when you pee and just collects and collects. Welcome to the magical 0.5 g future, we all have never ending kidney stones. Or what happens when you break an arm at 0.5 g? Will things still heal correctly?</p>
<p>You're worried about the macroscopic world. I'd worry more about the micro</p></div>		</li>
