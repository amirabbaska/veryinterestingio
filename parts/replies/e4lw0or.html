			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to say. I’m guessing that maybe a few people avoid the island (and Ambergris Caye, where San Pedro is) altogether because of it, but we only found about it from a local we befriended in Hopkins. It doesn’t seem to be known off the island. Then, when people do come to the islands, they may be MORE likely to do a water excursion, like snorkel or scuba, because that gets you away from the problem. Another thing, the entire island, especially the east side, has a stench of the rotting sea grass. After a day or two, I was used to it, but my GF is not. Still love it here though and originally was going to stay 4 nights, but extended to 7!  </p></div>		</li>
