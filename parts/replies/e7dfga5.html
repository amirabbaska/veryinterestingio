			<div class="markdown"><p>When I'm teaching someone English, I point out this because I think it's incredible what you can learn from how we talk. Everyone knows beef and pork and the like, but poultry is less common and noone calls it poisson (fish)</p>
<p>We can learn from that. What can we learn? We learn that beef and pork were high class foods, while fish was very much a lower class food and chicken was somewhere in the middle. We can learn that milk is an everyman thing, coffee was too but specific types of coffee weren't. </p>
<p>It's awesome. I think food names are the best, but many kids like the cupboard story</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost never French unless its supposed to sound fancy.</p>
<p>French makes up about 60% of our language, while German is only about 25%, but we actively SPEAK German words at an almost 70% frequency.</p>
<p>Nearly all our everyday &quot;layman's&quot; words are from the rougher German part, and this has led to English having pure synonyms (which is fairly rare in languages).</p>
<p>This is why we have 2 words for pig meat: Pork (French, the fancier, white meat from the breast), and Ham (German, the darker, &quot;common&quot; meat from the ass). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not German but Germanic, German is a language that developed from Germanic the same way English did but we call the German language German because it’s in the Germanic area of Europe.</p>
<p>German doesn’t look like a word anymore </p></div>		</li>
