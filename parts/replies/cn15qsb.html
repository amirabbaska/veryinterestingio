			<p>Sure unions have done stupid shit. My union did stupid shit. Unions don't make human beings infallible. We paid for our failure to police our own with laws like Taft-Hartley and Landrum-Griffin. Now we live with those laws and workers suffer for it. <br><br> GM makes cars in Korea because US trade policy allows it. Blaming unions is a popular canard but not even a non-union shop can compete with a $0.56 per hour wage. We honor the way Korea allows workers to be treated by refusing to consider the true cost of &quot;low prices&quot; assuming you can consider any major car company price low.     </p>		</li>

			<p>Try a minimum wage of about $4.60 - and auto workers make a lot more. To put this in perspective, <em>Hyundai</em> makes more than half their cars here - <em>because it's cheaper.</em><br><br>My largest grievance is the wage split. It's hard to have solidarity when the highest paid people are on a different wage schedule from you. <br><br>And let's not get started on the madness that is adjunct professorship.</p>		</li>
