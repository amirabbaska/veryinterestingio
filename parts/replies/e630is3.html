<p>quick google says Pat Sajak makes $15mil, so if they only work 40 weeks a year</p>

<p>It's even better than that, they bang out a week's worth of shows in one day, they are only working like 10 weeks a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because when it's all said and done, the network hires her, she works something closer to two months, they hire 50 people to support the work for those two months (~$2mil) and her shows pull in closer to $200mil for the year. She has talked about her salary negotiation, she tells them how much money she wants and tells them she is getting paid that much or the show is canceled. So they pay her, because it's rather clear they are pulling in $100+mil per year after paying for everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that makes sense.</p>
<p>It's like the people who call sports stars &quot;overpaid&quot; but really, how can they <em>not</em> be overpaid. If the league they're playing in brings in <em>billions</em> it's only fair the players get a good chunk of that. The leagues don't exist without the players, so the players need to be paid fairly. </p>
<p>Same with JJ... the show doesn't exist without her, and if it brings in that much money it's only right that she gets her fair share of it. </p>
<p>I guess the bigger question is <em>how the hell do enough people watch JJ to account for $200M</em>...? That's insane lmao to watch some staged trials for some extremely minor crimes. I guess there really is just nothing on TV during the day.</p></div>		</li>
