			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is you get the bloke who hit you to pay you cash so he doesn't have to claim on his insurance.  The insurer would only pay to have the damage to the car repaired - so the fraudster wouldn't really benefit unless he also had a bent mechanic on side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmm. The anti-corporation I can understand, even though I don't support it personally, but this plot so obviously includes and harms the other driver as well. You have to have a pretty callous disregard for other people to try this one. </p></div>		</li>

<p>this just looks like a driver failing to brake in time and hitting a driver who did brake in time</p>

<p>I'm that asshole who always tries to maintain 3-5 seconds between myself and the car in front of me -- even if I have to drive slow to do it (never in the fast lane, though).</p>
<p>This is why.</p></div>		</li>
