			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The motor muscles of your eye (the muscles that cause eye movement) tire just like any other muscle. However, they are almost entirely type I muscle fiber which is built to resist fatigue. Type I muscle fiber rarely hypertrophies and only does so very minimally after extreme stress and training. You can tire your eyes out rather quickly right now - keep your head still and look as far left as you can, find something at the limits of your vision that you can focus on and hold it for 5 seconds. Then do the same to the right. Then up, then down. By the time you do this for a minute or two you will feel fatigue - make sure that you are focusing on at the very limits of your vision. </p></div>		</li>

The finished effect is an unbelievably expressive form of dance that has a large focus on rapid eye movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changing what direction you're pointing your eyes allow one set of muscles to relax while another takes over, so I suspect it'd make them get less tired. Never tried spending more than 24 hours in a row out and about, though, so I can't say for sure. </p>
<p>As far as getting stronger, you might learn to use them more completely, but as far as actually growing more protein or storing extra glycogen, I don't see how there'd be room for that so I suspect not. For all I know, though, reading really does make you nearsighted and it happens for exactly this reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea that's bullshit. Near vs far sighted is to do with the constriction of the lens, where it incorrectly constricts and puts the focal point before or after your retina.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happening for a moment or two is quite normal, probably just a sign you're generally tired. </p>
<p>But I've had days where I spent hours at a time reading with clear double vision because doing so was easier than forcing both eyes to point at the same end of a line. Just to be clear, each set of letters (or whatever I was looking at) was still perfectly in focus, I was just doing the r/magiceye thing on something that wasn't a magic eye illusion.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an opthalmologist, so I can't say for sure, but that sounds like strabismus to me. </p>
<p>For me, the left eye would pull to the right most of the time, particularly when looking down or when I was tired. My opthalmologist corrected it surgically, by detaching the muscles on both sides of the eye, moving one back a few mm to loosen it and shortening the other one before reattaching it in the same place to tighten it.</p></div>		</li>
