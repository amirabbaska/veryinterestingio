<blockquote>

<p>On the main network, TenNineteen is correct: it is mathematically determined how many coins (Ether) exist.   But Ethereum is open source, so you could start your own Ethereum network with a whole new set of coins.  Call it BigmeecEthereum.   What stops you from doing that?  Nothing.  Except few would run it, and the value would be what people think it is worth -- almost nothing.   You can certainly do that as an exercise.</p>
<p>In fact, even within  the official Ethereum network, one of the first things they teach you how to do is create your own coin.   You can create a million MyCoins or BigCoins or whatever.   You can send them to friends.   What are they worth?  Whatever everyone says they are.   If you are Best Buy using Ethereum to track loyalty points, maybe a lot.   For a random person generating coins, probably nothing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where &quot;is&quot; the program or bitcoin located? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everywhere and nowhere.  On the computers of whoever decides to support the network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who does the programming?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial programming for the network was done by the Ethereum Foundation, and they started the official network.   The programming for the contracts are done by anyone who wants to do one.   You can write a program to send me money for typing this answer (highly encouraged!).   There are companies doing the programming every day, attempting things from real estate to gold-backed currency to predictions markets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The creation of Bitcoin/Ethereum/any other crypto is determined by the mathematical algorithms governing the blockchain. This is cryptography in action. It's essentially impossible to create Bitcoin at will without mining a block, and to mine a block your computer has to guess one of the numbers in the algorithm until they get it right. There's no better way to do it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where &quot;is&quot; the program or bitcoin located?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On every single computer in the network. Bitcoin is just a giant list of transactions. When you want to move your money, you essentially broadcast to the network that you want the number next to your name to go down and the number next to someone else's to go up. This is authorized by cryptographic verification. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>There are a couple groups of developers but the code is open-sourced. I don't know the political particulars of what gets included in Bitcoin. In ethereum's case there's the Ethereum Foundation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the answers. That helps. One more question. </p>
<p>How does the money hold value? I mean I could create my own currency right now and it wouldn't have any value because there is not enough of it to go around. When the code of bitcoin or ether is created, is ONE set amount produced at mass, at one time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One question I always had about this: contracts are bi-directional.  If I &quot;sign&quot; an irrevocable Ethereum contract to transfer from my account to your account every other week for X weeks... what does that get me beyond just giving you a lump sum up front?  Can't you still just walk, not upholding your end, and I'm still mathematically doomed to slowly give you everything anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The contracts can be as complex as you wish, so you can have a trusted third party involved.   The example I gave is a bit useless, but with imagination you can come up with better examples.   One idea is as a retirement plan -- collect from you for 40 years, pay you back over 30.  </p>
<p>A more likely use is for Internet of Things micro transactions.   Imagine AirBnB where the door keeps track of transactions, no owner involvement.   When the customer leaves, it notifies your cleaning service to come clean up and pays them.   The code on the door changes for each customer, in real time, as payments come in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes Bitcoin &quot;increasingly unsuitable&quot; for transferring value ?  Five-year old readers should note, a lot of trash talking goes on between Bitcoin and Ethereum supporters.</p>
<p>I'll get my trash-talking out of the way first: Ethereum promises a lot but doesn't deliver all that much right now.  The banks and other incumbent financial institutions do like Ethereum (and encourage trash-talking of Bitcoin) because Ethereum is a &quot;faux-disruptive&quot; technology.  If Ethereum does have a future it's one in which banks play an intimate role.  Bitcoin is actually disruptive, so the banks don't like it.</p>
<p>To use a virtual currency to transfer value you need a few things: wallet software, an exchange, and other parties willing to give or receive payments in the virtual currency.</p>
<p>An exchange allows you to sell regular currency (eg. USD) in exchange for the virtual currency, and vice-versa.  Exchanges are essential, you can't do much without them.</p>
<p>Exchanges use a website to interact with their customers.  The customer transfers their regular currency to or from the exchange via a normal bank account.</p>
<p>The bank account is the exchanges' Achilles heel.  If banks don't like the virtual currency they can refuse to operate bank accounts for exchanges.  Bitcoin does presently suffer from this problem.  But that's pretty much the only significant problem.</p>
<p>Customers need exchanges in lots of countries, preferably more than one exchange in each country; more competition means more liquidity, a smaller buy-sell spread, and better overall resilience.</p>
<p>To transfer value you don't actually have to hold virtual-currency for long periods.  You can exchange your regular currency for money in a virtual currency, transfer the virtual money, then the recipient can exchange the virtual currency for their regular currency.  You can do all this within a short time-period, to limit exposure to a fluctuating exchange rate.</p>
<p>But it's certainly convenient to be able to hold the virtual currency for longish periods, so ideally you want the exchange rate (vs regular currencies like the USD) to be reasonably stable over time.</p>
<p>Right now one bitcoin will cost you $1100 USD and if you already have one bitcoin you can sell it for the same figure.  If you're curious about how exchange rates for Bitcoin or Ethereum have behaved over the last few years you can google it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Based on your response, I think you know the answer to this.   Since it is off-topic, I will leave it to interested readers to google 'bitcoin block size debate' or 'bitcoin transaction speed problems' or something similar; it has little to do with Ethereum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd put this in the &quot;theoretical problem&quot; category, rather than &quot;real problem.&quot; Leaving aside technicalities, if it was a real problem we'd see some impact on volumes or the exchange rate, but Bitcoin worldwide is going gangbusters by any measure.</p>
<p>The lack of exchanges in my country is a real problem.  We have none now, since banks in this country began refusing to operate bank accounts for Bitcoin exchange companies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the primary issue with Bitcoin is that it is not scalable. You can only have 1 MB of transactions per 10 minutes no matter how many people are mining or using Bitcoin, and at the time of writing, we are using about 95% of that cap.</p></div>		</li>
