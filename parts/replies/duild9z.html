Latest I saw, a review paper showed the effect in a bunch of different papers, with a lot of lingering questions.  It's super interesting and thought provoking, but I stay away from it now for personal reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, to my knowledge, no study regarding humans and pheromone sensing has been repeatable. <strong>The general scientific consensus is no, humans cannot sense pheromones.</strong>  Evidence for pheromone detection seems to be circumstantial at best. And you're right about the vomeronasal organ, which is essential for pheromone detection. We ain't got it.</p>
<p>Additionally, testosterone and estrogen are not released from your body - metabolites of these in other animals are used for pheromone signaling.</p>
<p>However, I think there may be some validity to men being more attracted to women who are ovulating due to appearance (changes in skin tone, etc), but not at the level of hormones that influence these changes in appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that since a vomeronasal organ is not consistently found in humans (although it has been seen by some researchers), there is no &quot;pheromone-like&quot; response in humans is not borne out by research.</p>
<p>For one thing, cells which are in the vomeronasal organ in other primates are still present in humans, but migrate. This has been reported here <a href="http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4535952" target="_blank">http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4535952</a> and in several other studies. </p>
<p>Furthermore, humans exhibit clear sexually dimorphic responses to sex-hormone derived compounds secreted axially, and they exhibit these responses when exposed to very small &quot;pheromone-like&quot; concentrations. See these references:</p>

<p>Given this and other very clear and compelling evidence that humans exhibit pheromone responses, why are there still regular denials that this is the case? I believe the answer to this is that even after all this time, people are reluctant to admit that we are animals subject to the same chemical influences other animals are subject to.</p></div>		</li>
