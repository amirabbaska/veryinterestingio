			<div class="markdown"><p>Another keratoconus patient here, also from rubbing my eyes as a kid due to allergies. Not fun, don't recommend it. Not to mention the surgery to try and prevent its' progression (epi-off corneal crosslinking in my case) is the most painful experience I've ever gone through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had horrible allergies growing up - every spring I’d rub my eyes till they were raw to the touch.  Then a couple years ago, tried for lasik only to find I practically have no cornea left. I sure wish I knew there would be long term damage back then, but this is the first I’m hearing about it.  I’m definitely asking about this during my next eye appt. </p></div>		</li>
