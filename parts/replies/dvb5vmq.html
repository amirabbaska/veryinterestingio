			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually have a suite of ecological traits that make us peculiarly susceptible to STIs.  We: </p>
<p>-Copulate for non-reproductive purposes</p>
<p>-Copulate frequently compared to many species</p>
<p>-Copulate asynchronously (that is, we don't have a season in which everyone pairs off, and then stops mating for the next six months.  Instead, we just wander around mating with whomever will have us.)</p>
<p>-Copulate using various orifices, exposing our genitals to viruses and bacteria that would otherwise perhaps remain isolated in other body areas</p>
<p>-Copulate with multiple partners in our lives (for some of us, copulate with multiple partners in a week, and for an even smaller group of us, multiple partners in a day!)</p>
<p>-We migrate across the globe, spreading pathogens between groups</p>
<p>-There are not at all infrequent reports of humans copulating with animals, which is great way to find a brand new STI.</p>
<p>As a species, we're almost optimized for getting and spreading STIs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never before been more inclined to stop &quot;copulating&quot; and never been more pleased that I'm monogamous. Thanks for this list.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would these three though not also assist with our resilience?</p></div>		</li>
