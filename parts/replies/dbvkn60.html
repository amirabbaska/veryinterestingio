			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the second point, when online retailers (such as Amazon) let you buy things without re-entering your card details, they're running the transaction without the security code, and the card processors usually charge a slightly higher fee for this because of the increased fraud risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect (because it would make sense) that online merchants are allowed to reuse the credit card without you entering the code again as long as the merchandise is being sent to the same address as before. If you try sending something to a different address, Amazon.com will ask you to re-enter the code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because AMEX likes to be different. They also only have 15 numbers on the front of most of their cards instead of the normal 16. It still is actually a 16 digit number for the card, they leave off the first digit (I think, something like that). All 16 are in the strip on the back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just checked all my AMEX cards and on the signature panel all but one have the 15 digit card number plus some other random 3 digit number.<br />
One of the cards just got renewed a few weeks ago and it no longer has the card number on the back, just a 3 digit number. 4 digit CVV is still on front.<br />
Could be an AMEX Australia thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amex numbers are 15 digits, full stop. No hidden missing numbers. </p>
<p>Yes, I've confirmed this with a magnetic strip reader. Although track data is different than the CVV code. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They're in a different spot than the main credit card number, so if you get a picture of the credit card you still can't use it because you don't have the security code.</p>

<p>Discover now has cards with all numbers on one side. Fun stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is surprisingly common on higher end cards. My $30-50k limit cards often have this less secure design while my $2k limit cards never do.</p>
<p>I think at some point they decide the customer is valuable enough to take a slightly higher risk to make a cooler looking card.</p></div>		</li>
