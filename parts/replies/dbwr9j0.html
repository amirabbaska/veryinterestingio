			<div class="markdown"><p>This is way beyond ELI5, but we know the operational mechanisms of a Tesla coil.  There are primary and secondary coils.  The primary coil is the short, sometimes horizontal coil at the base.  This is wired to a capacitor bank.  The secondary coil is the tall vertical coil, usually wrapped around a pipe.  This coil is usually attached to the sphere or torus called a top load.  The primary coil has low inductance and high capacitance from the capacitor bank.  The secondary has high inductance and low capacitance.  The top load forms a small value capacitor with the earth.  These two together oscillate when energized with a pulse.  Similar to a bell or gong ringing when struck.  The primary cap/coil combo is connected to some power source through a switching mechanism of some source.  The easiest way to do this (and the only way to do this back in Tesla's day) is by a spark gap.  Power from the utility company, goes through a step up transformer, then to a spark gap.  When the voltage goes over the breakdown voltage of the air gap between the spark gap electrodes, an arc allows a burst of energy into the primary coil.  This repeats 60 times a second (or 180 with 3 phase power).  You can also use modern high voltage high power transistors to switch the electricity going into the coil at its resonant frequency (at this point you can add PWM to the switching to have the coil play music).</p>
<p>The reason we don't transmit power over the air is the inverse square law.  As you double the distance away from the transmitter the power in a given area decreases by 4.  So lets start with an initial transmitter of 1024 w/m^2 at 1 m distance from the transmitter.  This is enough energy to run a 1000w par can (silver can light at a big concert) or a small power tool.  At 2 meters there are now 256w/m^2.  This is about the energy a modern LCD TV uses.  At 4 meters we're down to 64 w/m^2 so you can run an incandescent light bulb off the energy passing through 1mx1m of space.  At 8 meters you're down to 16w/m^2 so you're left with a CFL bulb.  By 16 meters, you've got 4w/m^2 or a small led bulb.</p>
<p>This is why the wireless chargers all operate over very short range.  The receive coil in your phone is 1mm or less from the transmit coil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can transmit electricity through the air. But it's like that old alchemist goal of turning lead into gold. Science has advanced enough that we can do it but it turns out it's expensive and inefficient under most circumstances. </p></div>		</li>
