<p>Essentially, it's because there is no mechanism to get resources and healing cells up to the crown of your teeth.</p>

<p>But why can't we do that medically rather than the drastic action of root canals and fillings and tooth removal. Can't we inject the resources or something ?</p></div>		</li>

<p>it aids a shark, it doesn't necessarily mean it would aid a human</p>
<p>sharks bite their preys first, when they're still alive, that means he will have to bite hard and the prey will struggle and put a lot of strain on the shark teeth, so they are very likely to be damaged over time</p>
<p>humans and primates in general will not jump mouth first at their prey, they have hands and stuff, their preys aren't covered in scales and they also eat plants and fuits, so teeth don't have to work nearly as much, and periodic replacement isn't necessary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals don't really brush their teeth though, and some foods tend to have a naturally high amount of sugar. I imagine rotten teeth were a thing long before sugary drinks were invented, and oral health is directly linked to heart health.</p>
<p>It'd be immensely beneficial if we shed our teeth periodically, right? We wouldn't starve, like sharks without their teeth, but we'd certainly be able to live longer, healthier lives and produce more offspring as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's any evolutionary pressure for that though. By the time your teeth fall out or get bad enough that they can't serve you any more (50-70 years old) you've already long since passed your prime and passed along your genes already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's a good point. Sharks would be losing their teeth the second they begin to hunt for meals, so there would certainly be some evolutionary pressure there.</p>
<p>Sucks though. Would have been a nice feature for humans to have. Along with functional tails.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With the invention of toothpaste, yeah. But back in our founding father's days, it was a common procedure for the wealthy to just pull all of their teeth and get dentures, to save the agony of many years of tooth aches (and potentially deadly infections that come with them).</p>
<p>Basic bodily sanitation (washing your hands, taking showers every day, using soap, toilets, etc), basic tooth cleaning, and, obviously, vaccines probably has more to do with increasing humanity's life expectancy than any other medical invention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an oversimplification though. Our elders have and had influence on our survival. For this specific genetic trait there was just not enough evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p>With enough time and pressure healthy well eating elders that support the community could have been a decisive advantage. But that was not the case. There were other more pressing differences or just not enough selective pressure or not enough time with it. </p></div>		</li>
