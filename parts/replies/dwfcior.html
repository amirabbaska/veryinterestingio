			<div class="markdown"><p>And it gets even better: Some programs like emacs and vim (even though neither assigns undo to strg+z) implement an undo tree instead of a list, meaning every time you edit something after an Undo they create a new branch or path. Because you later can switch between these branches this means not only can you go back, but you can recover what you undid after you already edited your document again, while with a list you can only redo as long as you haven't edited anything after undoing.</p>
<p>You can kinda think of these like alternate timelines for your document between which you can switch.</p></div>		</li>
