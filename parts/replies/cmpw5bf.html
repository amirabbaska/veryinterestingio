			<div class="markdown"><p>To find the angular size of something far away, we can just use the small angle approximation that θ=size/distance (the angle is in radians when the units of size and distance are the same). The resolution of a telescope can be approximated by the Rayleigh Criterion, θ=1.22*wavelength/Diameter (again, the unit of the angle is radians when the lengths are in the same unit). By comparing the two for a given size instrument at a given wavelength of light, it's pretty straightforward to see how close you have to be to resolve something. Or, how big a telescope you need to resolve something however far away.</p></div>		</li>
