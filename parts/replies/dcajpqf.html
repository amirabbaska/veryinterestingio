<p>People literally spend more time asking on this subreddit than just googling and reading the first couple articles that comes up. They've forgotten this sub was originally made for questions with answers that are harder to find, not ones that are thoroughly documented on multiple different web sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5m4mzf" target="_blank">I did this same thing</a> the other day. A friend and I were discussing this very topic so I went to ELI5 and picked the first question I saw, googled it, and posted the response. Like I said in the post, took 30 seconds including formatting. Probably less time than OP took to type up the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, genuine curiosity and enthusiasm. I cared enough to look it up, for my sake and for OP, because I didn't want to move on and inevitably forget the post.</p>
<p>I'm glad the question was asked, even if it has been asked before, because all too often I forget my sense of wonder. If I have the mind to ask the question, I lack the conviction to find an answer.</p>
<p>It's also been several years since I had my anatomy and biology classes and was frankly embarrassed that I couldn't recall the answer on my own, even though it doesn't relate to my field of study.</p>
<p>Also, I like your name. I'd only just seen the movie for the first time two weeks ago and, having been convinced that it was a sappy stuffy romance, was overjoyed that I'd gotten the wrong impression :)</p></div>		</li>
