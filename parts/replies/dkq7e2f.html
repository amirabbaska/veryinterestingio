			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they already have external GPU Housings that you would use like a docking station for a laptop. so you can have a thin lightweight laptop that you get home and plug in via a thunderbolt 3 connector and then you have a full Desktop grade GPU to run your games and such off your laptop to a monitor, Check out the Razer Core... I think Asus has one as well.</p></div>		</li>
