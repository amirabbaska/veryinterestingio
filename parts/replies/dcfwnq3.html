			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to the soil, it can become hydrophobic.  There are a lot of elements that can cause hydrophobia, but basically it's organic matter (compost, burnt matter after a bushfire, etc).  As it decomposes, &quot;waxy&quot; skins (partially decomposed plant bits) can form around individual dry sand and soil grains, and these essentially scotchguard the soil, so the water runs off and through rather than being absorbed, or pools on the top.</p>
<p>Wettening agents help break these down, you can also supersaturate the soil (easier in pots, just put them in a bucket or tub and keep them in there until the bubbles stop.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No physics knowledge here, but watering really dry soil is an issue that I can address. </p>
<p>Mix a couple drops of dish-washing detergent into a gallon of water, and then water your plants. The soil will be much less hydrophobic afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The detergent (I use blue Dawn) lowers the surface tension, allowing the water to be absorbed by the soil particles. A 0.5 to 128 concentration is what I use, but only when needed. I'll get hydrophobic soil in a container maybe once or twice a year. </p>
<p>The better solution is to increase the amount of organic material in the soil when potting.</p></div>		</li>
