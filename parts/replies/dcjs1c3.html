			<div class="markdown"><p>they can't. it would be a death blow to the entire thing. Anyone else could immediately want the same deal and if you could get everything from the EU except the freedom of movement just by leaving, other countries might follow suit as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree but it's obvious from May's speech today that she will try to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement. The EU has FTAs with a bunch of countries without free movement of people (full list here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/agreements/index_en.htm#_europe" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/agreements/index_en.htm#_europe</a>, look out for 'FTA' next to a country's name)</p>
<p>The thing with FTAs (and the reason that the EU allows them without free movement of people) is that they're not as straightforward as the single market and negotiations normally centre on market size, so as the UK population is so much smaller than the wider EU we might have to give the EU free trade access for a certain amount of years before they return the favour (Switzerland recently had to make a similar concession for an FTA with China due to dwarfed market sizes).</p>
<p>Of course it's also important to note that FTAs with the EU take years to negotiate, I think a free trade deal with Canada clocked 8 years of negotiation, so unless we're looking for a long transitional period (which May has ruled out), we'll likely go to WTO rules and try to come back to an FTA later.</p></div>		</li>
