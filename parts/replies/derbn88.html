			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermal depolymerization is interesting, but right now it's not economical. TD takes a ridiculous amount of energy. There have been a few companies hat have tried to commercialize it, but even when they were using high-yield stock (mostly chicken offal), which they got for nearly free, they just barely made a profit during the height of oil prices (when gas was hitting $5 a gallon in the U.S). </p>
<p>If we're going to do TD, it needs to be used in conjunction with waste management, and for the foreseeable future it's just going to be an energy sink.</p></div>		</li>
