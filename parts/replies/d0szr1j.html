<p>Thickness is irrelevant, it could be paper thin but over a light year in length. Obviously hypothetical.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It's just a probability thought experiment. The probability of hitting the nucleus of a lead atom is so low the neutrino could pass through a solid layer of lead for an entire light year without hitting one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scale of these numbers is insane, phew! But I think if we're talking about the probability of a neutrino &quot;hitting&quot; the nucleus from head on, it's better to consider the <em>cross section</em> of the atom rather than the entire volume. In that case, it becomes something like a billion times more likely for the neutrino to make an impact, perhaps once per day? (Super rough guesstimate, and still surprisingly unlikely!) So while considering scale is helpful, thatalone doesn't quite explain how seldom neutrinos react with other matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's only if 100 billion neutrinos were passing through the cross section of an atom per second, but in reality it is significantly less. I didn't do the math but I'm guessing a neutrino hits an atom in your entire body even less than once a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, with cross-sections and neutrinos, let me know if I have this right:</p>
<p>Neutrinos can only interact via the weak force, which means that to interact with a particle, the neutrino's weak-force cross section has to overlap with the particle's.</p>
<p>However, the weak force is so small scale, a single proton or neutron is essentially transparent, and the interaction must involve a constituent quark. So the odds of an impact are small.</p>
<p>With that, though, how do photons interact with anything? They're uncharged, and don't (I think?) have weak interactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons are just light, i.e. electromagnetic waves. Instead of considerng photons as discrete particles with a definite &quot;size&quot; passing through the atoms, imagine them as waves carrying information about the electromagnetic force. I don't know much particle physics, so that's the best explanation I can offer...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for the sake of argument, though - say you've been kinda loosey-goosey with the nausea meds and there's a lot of bismuth in your tum tum.  You get enough neutrinos hitting that motherfucker and <em>BAM</em> you've got a Polonium situation on your hands. </p>
<p>Okay, I guess I see your point. Still really big numbers. </p></div>		</li>
