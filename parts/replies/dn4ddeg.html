			<div class="markdown"><p>It is typically called MLI, Or multi layer insulation. I have a sample here that has 7 layers of the foil, which I believe is a Kapton base with a very thin (atomic thin) layer of gold on one side and aluminum on the other. In between each of these layers is a plastic mesh that keeps the Kapton layers from touching directly. </p>
<p>This makes it equally hard for heat to get in or get out. Typically a spacecraft is designed to run cold, because of it runs hot, things go bad quickly, and in space, nobody can fix your air conditioner. </p>
<p>So your cold spacecraft will have heaters spread around inside it, so that it can warm itself if it needs to. </p>
<p>The MLI serves to make the spacecraft temperature drastically less sensitive to what is happening outside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to bother you but I was wondering how you came across a sample of MLI? My daughter is just entering the age of being interested in space and with the recent plunge of Cassini, she noticed what colors satellites are and configurations. (Pre/post launch pictures).  I Thought it might be interesting to handle some of the MLI.  Thank you in advance for any information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kapton was once used to wrap wire on aircraft. It's been linked to several fires on board aircraft including the downing of Swissair 111.  Once it lights up (and there's some evidence that when it cracks with age, it can cause arcing) it acts as an fire accelerant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because in a vacuum, you can't rely on conduction or convection--there's just nothing there to transfer the heat to. Radiation is the only way to go. And seeing as radiation is the least effective method of transferring heat, it happens slowly, far too slowly to shed what the sun gives you unless you are prepared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation can be a very effective method of transferring heat, but only at high temperatures.  Radiated heat scales with the fourth power of the temperature (in Kelvin) so something very hot like the filament in an incandescent lightbulb can radiate enormous amounts of heat despite its tiny size.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for satellites, getting them hot enough to lose heat effectively via radiation would also mean frying their electronics.  At the temperatures they need to operate at, radiation doesn't work well at all as a means of keeping cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how room temperature air 'feels' way warmer than room temperature water? It's because air is much less dense. There are fewer atoms floating around in the air to collide into your body and 'steal' some of your body's atoms' heat energy.</p>
<p>Well, in a vacuum there are no atoms floating around at all to bump into so it's difficult to shed heat via convection loss - you have to make do with radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Thermos (aka, &quot;vacuum flask&quot;) works by surrounding your coffee with a thin layer of vacuum: by pumping the air out from between the inner walls of the flask, there is less matter surrounding it to directly conduct away the heat. In space, everything is essentially inside a Thermos. Heat can't dissipate by conduction because there is no air around it. Instead, it has to radiate away.</p></div>		</li>
