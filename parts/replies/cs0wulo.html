			<div class="markdown"><p>Current has much more to do with the shock outcome than voltage.  Lower voltages (like 120v) can kill you just as easily as 480v or higher if there's enough current and it really doesn't take much.</p>
<p>Tiny currents (like &lt;5mA, that is five one thousandths of one amp) through the body probably won't do you any harm but as the current goes up, so does the likelihood of death.   In particular, as the current rises, the likelihood of you being able to voluntarily let go of what's shocking you <em>decreases</em> because of what is known as the 'freezing effect'. Reaching into my old classroom notes, here's a little table of outcomes:</p>
<p><strong>1 second duration, hand-to-foot pathway</strong> (so probably crossing the heart)</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Current</th>
<th>Outcome</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;1mA</td>
<td>not felt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1mA</td>
<td>slight tingle sensation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5mA</td>
<td>A slight shock.  Not painful but disturbing.  Will probably be able to let go.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6-30mA</td>
<td>Painful shock, possible loss of muscle control.  Entering the freezing current range so may not be able to let go.  Hopefully the jolting of your body will throw you free...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>50-150mA</td>
<td>Extreme pain, severe muscle contractions.  Possible respiratory arrest.  Obviously death is possible at this point.  <strong>This is still only around one tenth of one amp</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1A-4&frac12;A</td>
<td>Heart stops pumping.  Nerves are irreparably damaged, muscle contractions are extreme.  Death is <em>likely</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;10A</td>
<td>Cardiac arrest is almost certain.  Fourth degree electrical burns (4th degree is <em>inside</em> the body beneath the skin, i.e. to muscles, organs and other structures.  Death is <em>probable</em></td>
</tr>

<p>10A is about the current your microwave draws (1100W @ 120V = 9.16A).  That's all it takes.</p>

<p>There are other tables of shock impact that have slight variations but the gist is always the same, the amount of current required to do serious fucking damage to the body is <em>really</em> small if it follows a pathway that crosses the heart.  Specific circumstances, your general health, etc will also play a role.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a case of some idiot that killed himself with a 9V battery. He jabbed the probes of a multimeter into his thumbs to measure the resistance across his body without skin in the way. It turns out that resistance is essentially zero (once you get past skin, the body is just a bag of salt water) and the current from the multimeter was enough to stop his heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here would be my question then:</p>
<p>How do I apply this in my day to day?
Seems that most electrical installations are labeled in Volts, and if I knew my resistance I could get current from Ohm's Law... but I don't.  How am I supposed to speculate on what sources might give me a lethal dose of current?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simplistic formula is P=U<em>I and U=R</em>I and I=U/R and P=(U^2)/R where U=voltage R=resistance and I=current but it's safe to assume that any power outlet in your house is lethal, there is no such thing as safe current without an earth fault device that limits the fault current to 30mA, a fuse protects from a fire hazard and is not a proper personnel safety device on it's own.</p></div>		</li>
