			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a small office. If all the work that comes in can be handled by the staff working there, there is no need to hire any more, and the existing workers will simply gain experience. If instead the staff gets overworked and some of them quit, on the next round of hiring there will be more workers coming on to prevent this in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i see where you're coming from, but that analogy sort of hinges on the idea that to build muscle, you have fewer, larger fiber overall. Rather than what's actually happening where all the fiber grow congruently. So to speak, your office is experiencing too much work load, so each employee gets an assistant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protein synthesis is just the process your body uses to make protein molecules from amino acids using instructions from your genetics. Thickening and strengthening of muscle fibers comes from microtears to the structure of the muscle which are then repaired and fortified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protein synthesis occurs constantly. This is because protein degradation occurs constantly. Oxidation, stress, cosmic radiation, all these things tear apart protein and the body replaces it. The combination is protein turn-over rate, which in a healthy person most of the time is going to be about even. Protein synthesis is stepped up heavily after an injury though, whether a destructive one (a strain, for instance) or productive one (the eustress of exercise).</p></div>		</li>
