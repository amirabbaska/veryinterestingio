			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, very true.  I think that, given the losses, which were known to everyone; the decision was that in this case, they could look past the racial problems (from germany's point of view) to have a reserve of willing sailors.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>The whole duality of the Nazis, in this regard, does make for some rather interesting reading.  Sadly, beyond a few writings like Raeder, and some snippits from Doenitz, it's not really widely talked about or discussed.  Personally, I think that's a shame, but I think I understand the reasoning, if only from a historical point of view. Namely, I suspect that it's glossed over, or even not mentioned, because we've come to believe the Nazis were pure evil.  I'm not pro-nazi by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't help but think that there should be more mention of this.  Like I said, if only to show the curious duality in this regard.</p></div>		</li>
