<p>But if you can figure out autonomous cars, you'll probably be able to make orders of magnitude more money than you would with trains. </p>
<p>How many active train locomotives are there in the world? I don't know, but I imagine it's probably somewhere in the hundreds of thousands. Which is a decent market, but there's likely over a billion automobiles, so that's a whole lot more potential sales. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In particular, there's a huge desire to automate tractor-trailers (or big rigs, or eighteen wheelers, whatever you call it).  For long portions of the drive, they're driving on interstate highways, from warehouse to warehouse, which tend to be near major highways themselves.  We could really reduce the cost of goods by having these trucks be able to run 24/7 without worrying about the attention spans / needs of sleep of drivers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the transportation industry (for moving heavy loads) makes up a significant percentage of our workforce, which is considered part of the 'skilled labor'.  As such, they have immense political power.  The US congress recently passed laws to pave the way for automonous passenger vehicle testing to take place (which over-rode individual states' say in the matter); however if my memory serves me correctly, the bill does not allow for 'heavy-load / tractor-trailer' automated vehicles in the same manner.</p>
<p>There's also the practical concerns about automating tractor-trailers.  Obviously the risk involved in a crash with heavier vehicles is larger.  They're slower to stop.  They're harder to move if disabled.  Yada yada yada.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like the right answer. The number of people that would be out of jobs is massive  Thus their massive political power will likely do everything they can to stop automation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue of automating tractor trailers is interesting. There are specific rules about how long truck drivers are allowed to drive, like they can't drive for more than 11 consecutive hours, they have a maximum driving window of 14 hours (so if a driver drives for 9 hours and takes a 4 hour break, they can only drive for one more hour before they have to stop), and a driver can't drive more than 70 hours in an 8 day period. That means in an 8 day period, there are 122 hours where a driver has to be off duty.</p>
<p>And a truck that isn't moving is a truck that isn't making money.</p>
<p>So if they can automate the highway portion of long-haul drives while only requiring a driver to be in active control while off the city and to passively monitor the system while on the highway, the truck can be moving a lot more.</p>
<p>Even if the system still requires human supervision, if you assume the driver will sleep 8 hours per day and stop for food, etc. for two hours each day, the truck can then be moving 112 hours per week. But instead of actively driving, the driver can read a book or watch a movie or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that what you said applies to <em>freight</em> trains. Light rail and subways have different economics - it turns out that the cost of paying a driver can be a majority of the per-mile operating expenses. So for light rail in particular, automating the trains will let you run many trips that wouldn't be economical to run with a driver (for example, late night trips which get very few passengers). Vancouver's SkyTrain is an example of a system that can afford to run with high frequency day and night because the trains are fully automated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does seem like the most intuitive answer. The automation technology is there, it's just too expensive to be worth it to replace a few jobs, unlike say truck drivers which is the #1 most common job in many states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Size of market' is one big point, but you also have to factor that by 'amount you save' too.</p>
<p>So multiply 'size of market' by 'amount you save' and you get some good indications.</p>
<p>Take taxis and long-haul trucks. The salaries there per trip are a huge portion of the cost of the trip. With a train, it's much smaller proportionally, because you have 100s of passengers, as opposed to 1/2 in a taxi.</p>
<p>So, the cost reductions are much lower, especially to warrant a retrofit. Newer systems like the Copenhagen Metro seem to make sense because you can design it that way from the start, and because salaries are so high in Denmark, especially night salaries. The metro runs 24hours since it goes to the airport.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, likely not. However it's not so much about the impact on them as much as it is about the impact they have on the industry. Someone that can smell a failed brake system as they walk a train is far more affordable than rigging sensors on every axle to monitor brake temperatures. Especially with equipment that has been in use for decades. Remember, with rail equipment, the engines wear out quickest, and they can last for half a century or more. Getting a rail system fully automated is a very steep challenge for a lot of reasons outside of these.</p>
<p>Here in the US, the problem is what is asked for versus the timeline given to get it done, and nowhere near enough money to do so. Add the regulations that generally make things more expensive in the long run than they need to be, and here we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR- farm equipment is not &quot;totally automated&quot;, but automation has exponentially reduced operator workload </p>
<p>Weelllll, sort of.
I know Case and John Deere have been working on fully autonomous tractors, but for the most part, the &quot;totally automated&quot; you're referring to is autosteer. Basically, you manually run the boundary of your field, and then set a line across it- this is done by starting across the field, marking your &quot;A&quot; point, driving on a few more feet, and then marking your &quot;B&quot; point; the computer draws a straight line between the two and extrapolates that ad infinitum, and repeats it across your set swath width (the width of the ground your implement covers). When you engage autosteer after setting your line, the tractor will follow that line until you either disengage autosteer, manually turn the wheel, or sit still for something like 30 seconds. It will only follow the line, so at the end of your row, you have to manually make the turn to the next line and engage autosteer again.
Besides the autosteer, the monitor can automatically control rates for certain operations, such as your seed population when planting, or your application rate for applying fertilizer or spraying chemical. This is done by calculating constant dispersion rates against variables such as speed, and the monitor calculate and adjust on the fly, so as you slow down it will back down the speed of the implement to match the ground speed of the tractor, and vice-versa. However, the operator is still needed to run the machine, monitor operations, and watch the terrain so autosteer doesn't drive you into a ditch or hole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a PBS show about some bad train crashes in the US, all of which would have been prevented by automation. The conductor either wasn't paying attention or thought he was on a different part of the track and sped up when going into a sharp turn, which derailed the train and killed some people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that’s not correct for most trains in Germany. The train conductor still operates them manually. I am a regular train rider, especially on smaller trains and I am usually sitting close to the conductor’s stand and I can always see them operate the train manually?</p>
<p>What particular trains are you thinking of?</p></div>		</li>
