			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Someone will complete/correct with the specifics, but basically the full life support system was not ready by 1967,  and the oxygen only atmosphere was deemed safe enough. It wasn’t, though.</p>
<p>Edit : This is offtopic as f, but who cares : It's not like nobody knew either. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/SEJVfrx" target="_blank">This famous picture</a> of the Apollo 1 crew was made as a parody of the official crew picture. They're mockingly praying around a model of the Apollo capsule as a way to express concern towards the many electrical gremlins and the amount of flammable material of the Block 1 version of the spacecraft.
NASA politics, bureaucratic inertia and the political urge to beat the Russians to the Moon meant their concerns were ignored, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Internal politics and heavy bureaucracy have plagued NASA for a long time, and the Challenger disaster is also a direct consequence of this. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I subscribe to r/space and find it invaluable to remember that for all the wonder and advancements, there have been so many casualties caused by design issues, politics, lack of funding... Lost lives, but also abandoned projects, and also proposed missions where our reach exceeded our grasp.</p>
<p>Rereading the initial proposals for the shuttle recently, with weekly launches projected... Always aiming high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not offtopic, it was super interesting to read. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. At the time they didn't have the technology for the complex atmosphere reconditioning systems we use today, and under estimated the need for them for space travel.</p>
<p>In the mind of a 1950's engineer, weight is your biggest problem. I don't remember the exact number, but each pound you move into space requires hundreds of pounds of fuel, and each pound of fuel requires hundreds of pounds of fuel, .....</p>
<p>So if you can shave off a few hundred pounds by just breathing some of your fuel oxygen you are packing anyway, and is at 100%, it seemed a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>We knew the danger of pure oxygen, but not the risk of electrical malfunctions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The spacecraft had no means of carrying nitrogen to the moon, because they didn't need it for breathing. The operational atmosphere of straight oxygen at 3 psi supports life just as well as 20% oxygen at 15 psi (i.e., ordinary atmospheric air). The problem arose in ground testing, where the cabin pressure was 15 psi because there was no way to maintain a negative pressure differential in it.<br />
The problem was compounded by shoddy workmanship in the command module: it was a piece of shit. Badly routed wiring, potential shorts, loose fasteners, even a forgotten socket wrench...the entire first shipment of command modules was condemned and not one of them was ever flown manned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just take the oxygen percentage of the atmosphere and multiply that by air pressure at sea level? ~15*~.2=3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Using PV = nRT, you can calculate what pressure oxygen provides to the system using the temp, volume, and how much of it there is. Alternatively, if you know what % of the system it is in mols/atoms and the pressure  of the system, you can do what you've done.</p>
<p>What matters here is the contact oxygen has with flammable stuff. The more contact, the more chances for fire. The pressure oxygen brings to the system is due to it hitting the walls of the system with some force. As the pressure goes up, the amount of hits and the amount of force in each hit goes up. Thus, more chances to burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you’re saying is we can breathe normally if as the atmospheric pressure goes down, the oxygen concentration goes up???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. All your lungs really care about is the partial pressure of oxygen -- that's the amount of pressure that's being exerted <em>specifically by oxygen molecules</em>, and that determines how much oxygen gets into your blood.<br />
Your body uses only a very small amount of nitrogen. You swallow air when you eat; most of the nitrogen in it just trucks right on through and out the other end. I'd expect the space crew would fart less than on Earth.</p></div>		</li>
