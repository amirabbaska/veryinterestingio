			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I mentioned that in a later reply. Flying faster means more flights per day for the aircraft, so more revenue for the airline.</p>
<p>Passengers usually buy the cheapest ticket, not necessarily the fastest, so it's more about operational efficiency for the airline. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Faster also means burning more fuel, which can be a big portion of the cost to make a flight. It's a balancing act. Concords are/were much faster but also burned way more fuel per distance traveled, and partly for that reason they are not economically viable anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if you're exiting the atmosphere and trying to orbit the Earth, and then only because you're trying to go much <em>faster</em> than the Earth, and the atmosphere, are rotating. It's why rockets are easier to launch near the equator, you already have some of that circular velocity.</p>
<p>For an airplane, you start on the Earth (moving at the same rotational speed), and fly through the atmosphere that is rotating with the Earth, so it doesn't really do anything directly. A hot air balloon couldn't travel West just by going straight up and down again (ignoring local wind).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.
Going higher than 32-33.000 feet actually reduces your true airspeed. Higher ground speeds can be achieved with favourable winds but in general cruising altitudes are chosen in favour of fuel economy. Fan jets operate most efficient at high rpm and low temperatures found at high altitudes.
The low air density is actually a negative impact reducing engine efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that guy has no idea what he is talking about. Commercial airplanes are limited in speed to how close they are to match 1. With higher altitude you have lower speed of sound which means mach 0.8 at 30k ft is slower than mach 0.8 at 5k ft</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, you're not wrong, but these two concepts are not mutually exclusive, in fact they are closely related. The performance of an aircraft in regards to efficiency is defined by a thrust-required (TR) curve and finding the free-stream velocity (TAS) at which the TR is a minimum at a given altitude for a given engine. </p>
<p>This ties into your engine (more importantly your compressor) efficiency. The ideal altitude at which your engine is most efficient is which where it is able to produce peak power with minimum air density at near idle. The most efficient altitude  is where the turbofan is able to produce peak power with near idle and the most efficient free-stream velocity is where the aircraft's L/D is at a maximum.</p>
<p>Finding the balance between these two performance characteristics is where the the maximum efficiency in performance would lie, hence why I said that u/stoplightrave was partially correct by saying that ~33k ft is where turbofans are the most efficient. However, as stated that's only half the equation.</p>
<p>If you're still unconvinced <a href="https://imgur.com/9kgClYP" target="_blank">here</a> is an example TR curve at sea level. You can see how the most efficient free-stream is defined in the curve as the max L/D ratio for the given airfoil.</p>

<p>Edit: I will say my comment was probably a little <em>too</em> vague. I meant that you want to have the maximum velocity at which you are able to achieve with minimum thrust. This is largely in part due to the air density (altitude) as air resistance drastically decreases meaning thrust required drastically decreases and most turbofans are pretty good at compressing air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, you are still wrong. Maximum efficiency of a turbofan happens at the altitude you designed it to be most efficient. We design them to be efficient at 30k ft because of fuel consumption which is the biggest cost of operating an airplane. The L/D graph you linked makes no sense to this discussion considering that your L/D changes during flight as you see fit, at your targeted altitude your L/D is gonna always be the lowest (L=W) achievable by your airplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It does. Thinner air = less oxygen =less combustion =less thrust</p>
<p>But, thinner air ALSO = less drag = faster speed = more volume of air being forced into engines = more oxygen = more thrust </p>
<p>Its a balancing act which of those wins out. But generally less drag = faster, even if it means less oxygen for your engines. There is a sweet spot where the opposite starts becoming true. So planes fly at a specific altitude to maximise a complicated speed/fuel economy/profit equation </p></div>		</li>
