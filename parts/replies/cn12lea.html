			<p>What has Obama done that puts more money in the pockets of the middle class?  I am very middle class and the only thing that has changed that Obama was the cause of was that my health insurance premiums doubled.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good canned answer.<br><br>Increasing the minimum wage is bringing more money into the fluid economy.<br><br>My health care premiums decreased 25% under the ACA, allowing me to spend more money, again increasing the flow of money through the economy.  There are millions others who have the same story.<br><br>That is two things he has done.  I could name a dozen others, but I have to go to bed for the evening- in the apartment  I was able to afford, becUse of the job I got, two months after Obama was sworn into office, because increased investor confidence.</p>		</li>

<li>The minimum wage hasn't increased since Bush was POTUS.  So no, Obama hasn't done a damn thing about minimum wage.  Not that it would fix anything anyway in the long term.<br>2.  The ACA doesn't benefit people who make a decent wage (yet still middle class).  My healthcare premiums are going from $312/month to $766/month starting January 1.<br>3.  Obama had nothing to do with investor confidence rising.  It was because of the bank bailouts that took place before Obama took office.</li>

			<p>I doubt that they doubled. Please provide evidence that a similar rate of cover now costs you twice as much. For most people, it stayed the same or went down after subsidies. Also he extended tax cuts for the middle-class and poor by ending them for the wealthy. He had to fight Republicans to get this done. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, there was that middle class tax cut, payroll tax cut, increasing the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, etc.</p>		</li>
