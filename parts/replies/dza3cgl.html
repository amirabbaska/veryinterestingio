			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep adding: </p>
<p>This is a phenomenon large land animals deal with, too! Many large mammals mostly stand while sleeping despite needing to lie down for REM sleep. Lying down is difficult on blood flow for those big guys, though. Some of these animals have adapted by reducing the amount of sleep they need. I recently read that giraffes in zoos will sleep as little as 5 minutes a day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That didn't affect dinosaurs or affected them marginally, they became so massive because they had hollow bones and were relatively light despite their size. Insects did grow huge with more oxygen because they breath through their skin and didn't had lungs, so it was more effective for them to be bigger as a whole despite that making them waste more energy due to the increased weight. Lungs are more specialized, so they can take more oxygen despite not being as massive, leaving space to other organs.</p></div>		</li>
