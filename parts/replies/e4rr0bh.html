			<div class="markdown"><p>Another small thing in older homes (not that old though) is pipes... when cast iron pipes hold stagnant water for long periods of time, they rust out like crazy and eventually leak at the joints (or other sections if given the time). And it only takes a little bacteria infested rusty water to mess up a lot of things fast.</p>
<p>This doesn't happen in occupied homes because the water flows through the pipes (either hot or cold. Bacteria prefers room temperature water) and prevents a type of bacteria that causes rust, from building up.</p></div>		</li>
