			<div class="markdown"><p>In Britain, they are a common sight in any properly maintained garden pond in the countryside (along with a lot of other interesting creatures).</p>
<p>And they are incredible. Having said that, many species of tarantula can survive underwater, for surprising amounts of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did some quick research on them and I can see why. That hair must hold some air under water. Are you speaking from experience about seeing them in person? Wikipedia said they can bite and pierce the skin. Are they really that much of a threat to humans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some spiders (particularly young ones) will stick their butt in the air and release a silken thread.  A gentle wind is enough to lift them off the ground.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin recorded thousands of these &quot;ballooning&quot; spiders landing on his ship when they were 100 km off the coast of S. America. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like they have an instinct to find the highest thing they can, then when they find it and feel a bit of wind, they fire a web in the air and float off.</p></div>		</li>
