<p>Car adverts aren't to make you go out and buy a car that very same day. They're placed to make you aware that the Volkswagen Jetta is a thing. So that when you decide it is time for a new car, the Jetta might come to mind before the Chevrolet Malibu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Car ads are there to comfort you in your purchase. After spending that much money, you might have second thoughts. You might think you should have gotten some other brand. And next time you buy a car, you might!</p>
<p>The ad is there to make you like your car and reinforce your loyalty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually makes a lot of sense. I've heard that car advertising costs more than the revenue it generates for the manufacturer and I've always wondered why they even bother with it then. But this puts the final piece of the puzzle in place if it's true.</p></div>		</li>
