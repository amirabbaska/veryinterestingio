			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a common misconception that red, yellow, and blue are primary colors. There are two sets of commonly used primary colors, and those are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cyan, magenta, and yellow for thinks like paint (where mixing in more and more colors makes them darker)</p>
</li>
<li>Red, blue, and green for lights, where adding more in makes them lighter. </li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, if you mix together cyan, magenta, and yellow paint you end up with black. If you shine a red, green, and blue light at a spot on a wall, the color of the light on the wall will be white. Mixing together the three in different amounts lets you make most colors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. More like a dark grey-brown.  This is why the primary colors for printing are CMY<strong>K</strong>, with &quot;K&quot; representing black ink.  I frequently paint using a CMYK palette and combine CMY frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Cyan, yellow, and magenta are the primary colors of pigment, the secondary colors of light. Red, green, and blue are the primary colors of light, the secondary colors of pigment. This &quot;approximation&quot; is as inaccurate as saying orange, purple, and green are the primary colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's right, it might sound pedantic, but there's a significant difference between red/magenta and blue/cyan, both visually and conceptually. Magenta is the colour you get from adding red and blue, and cyan is the colour you get from adding blue and green. You will not make black if you mix red, blue, and yellow paint together, you will make a brownish colour, and one of the definitions of subtractive primary colours is that you get black by mixing them together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the colour Newton meant by 'blue' in his spectrum was actually cyan, with Indigo indicating the darker colour we would usually call 'blue' now. The colours of the rainbow made so much more sense to me once I read that, as I had always wondered why he seemed to have two 'purples'. His 'making up the numbers' colour was orange, as it doesn't really have any particular significance but he wanted 7 colours for spiritual/pattern reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being taught the RYB system as early as first grade.</p>
<p>I learned RGB shortly after, and then CYMK. Come to think of it, before I learned RGB (because I'm a computer nerd) and CYMK (because I'm a computer nerd), I thought that RYB were indeed the primary colours. I can see how someone less interested in art and/or computers might be confused.</p>
<p><em>Lies in the textbooks!</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, primary colors in general are somewhat arbitrary. You can pick and choose whatever three colors you like. The choice of primaries will dictate the gamut (set of colors that can be produced by the primaries). And normally, you'd like the gamut to be as large as possible, of course, which makes some primaries better than others.</p></div>		</li>
