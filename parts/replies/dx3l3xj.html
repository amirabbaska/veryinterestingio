There is some evidence that limited doses of caffeine (pill or gum form) can stave off the effects of fatigue for a few hours, and if time allows, a 30 minute to 60 minute nap has been shown to delay tiredness and cognitive depletion. However, the very best thing to do is be proactive and engage in good sleep hygiene habits.</p></div>		</li>
