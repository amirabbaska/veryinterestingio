			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In highschool I memorized 111 digits of pi. I could spit them out as fast as Eminem raps. Someone once said &quot;how do we know that you aren't just saying random digits?&quot;</p>
<p>I said that if they were random digits that would be a million times better. I can't come up with random digits a tenth as fast as I can recite pi. Almost anyone can memorize pi to ~100 digits. How many people can quickly generate random digits?</p>
<p>To this day I consider anyone who can say random digits quickly to be a genius.</p></div>		</li>
