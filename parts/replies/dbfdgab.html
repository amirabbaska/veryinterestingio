			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! This is fascinating. Do you have any happier stories about this technology? I remember a Radiolab episode where they covered this technology but I haven't been paying attention to further developments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radiolab episode was about Transcranial direct current stimulation, not TMS.  Direct current involves zapping the brain through the skull with a battery, TMS induces/suppresses current in the brain with a magnetic field.  Both are awesome!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happiest story is a patient who had chronic neuropathic pain and the disease complex regional pain syndrome. She had pain relief for up to 6 months following 5 sessions of paired potentiating stimulation to motor cortex. Super cool for her and us!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>As an example of something unexpected and crazy in my lab, we abolished the ability to produce fluent speech for 3 hours with a train of inhibitory stimulation designed to create a sustained virtual lesion in the frontal cortex. This was done to a participant and needless to say they were highly concerned afterwards and we had to change our protocol to avoid this outcome in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing. Given that the aim of the experiment was to simulate a lesion, I suppose that the unexpected and crazy part of the outcome was the fact that the effect lasted for 3 hours rather than the effect itself, and you were expecting the effect to only last as long as the magnetic field was being applied. Because the fact it lasted so long is very interesting. The reason I ask is because I'm interested in &quot;deep&quot; TMS for chronic pain and one of my doubts about it is whether the effect will be lasting or merely transient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the sequence, the region, and the individual, TMS effects can easily last longer than the time of application. Typically, a few minutes to a few hours. It's not my area of study, so I wouldn't be surprised if some subtle effects lasted weeks, but to my knowledge, no TMS effects have been shown to be permanent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my work is actually with chronic pain, we found that the effect lasted quite a long time if you pair potentiating stimulation patterns as opposed to a singular pattern of 10hz for example. Also repeated days of treatment seem to increase the durability of he effect as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, what is the &quot;ethical&quot; stance on building research on top of other research that was done unethically, but in a scientifically sound manner?  Is it the sort of thing where nobody will touch it with a 50 foot pole because the original research was unethically conducted and they're too afraid of the social/political implications, or is it a viable starting point where further <em>ethically</em> conducted study can be done and some good can be garnered from the original situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a psychologist but I am a medical researcher who uses animals in my research;</p>
<p>There have been studies done on animals that I would not be able to 'get through' the ethics board at my institution however these studies are valuable in backing up the scientific validity of my research. Ethics boards are not there to vilify or judge research that's already been done, they are simply there to protect the participants of the studies in the institution. The ethics board may ask for additional protections for participants, in my research I had to provide additional pain relief beyond what I thought was necessary but to please the ethics board it was done. The ethics board couldn't care less that my resultant pain relief strategy for my mice was even more liberal than pain relief given to human patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of important things were discovered through terrible means. My thought is as long as the fruit of the poisonous tree is used to better humankind then I'm all for it. Although great care should be taken to avoid inadvertently encouraging the original terrible means that were employed.</p></div>		</li>
