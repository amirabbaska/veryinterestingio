			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't want to get into too much detail between the size of the neocortex and maximal group size in the top-level comment, due to this being ELI5, but this is primarily known due to research performed by anthropologist Robin Dunbar, leading to a conclusion that, for humans, is called Dunbar's Number - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number</a></p>
<p>In short, they found that neocortical size was a statistically significant predictor of primate group size in a wide variety of matters.  The number for humans is about 150-250, the highest amongst all primates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a TIL post a while back that was actually an interesting thought for the process. One attribute humans have that many other species do not that people don't really account for is our sweat. Sweat evolved as an efficient tool of heat evaporation and was the biggest thing that lead to our loss of all covering body hair. Sweat allowed us to have more endurance while chasing animals, being able to run longer by having an efficient means of releasing internal heat. Now, we weren't usually the fastest animal, but if we followed an animal long enough, we could kill them via exhaustion. That's not always easy, and the humans with more tracking ability and though processes were the best at this. We'd already evolved from species with extra capacity to be in groups at this point, but what really skyrocketed us was the need to have extremely thorough tracking knowledge.</p>
<p>Sure other effects compounded with this, but our need to track because of our ability to sweat is one of the large differentiations early on when we became more 'human like' in the evolutionary train.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now, the estimated capacity of a human brain's personal connections is between 100 and 250. 150 is a commonly referenced nominal value. This limit is called Dunbar's number (see Wikipedia, I'm on mobile though so I won't link).</p>
<p>This means that you can develop a stable social relationship with about 150 people before you start losing those relationships. It's not a cap on the names or faces you remember.</p>
<p>Dunbar theorizes that this number is directly related to our neocortex's capabilities. Larger neocortex = more social relationships.</p>
<p>Oftentimes corporations try to constrain business units/locations to around 150-200 workers. This way everyone can know almost everyone well and function efficiently. Of course there are many reasons for and against expanding past this number, but it is a factor to consider.</p>
<p>In early evolutionary stages our neocortex was smaller, so this number was lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;we are not the 'superior species' on Earth, we are merely the current apex predator&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apex: the top or highest of something<br />
superior: further above or out; higher in position</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come again?</p>
<p>As long as humans live here, we will <em>always</em> be the dominant (native) species on Earth.  We control the world to a degree that no other animal can even <em>conceive</em> of, much less challenge us for.  WE ARE EXPLORING OTHER PLANETS FOR FUCK'S SAKE.</p>
<p>And yes, a species intelligent enough to make chainsaws is superior to a species that just has chainsaws and nothing else.  Don't be ridiculous.  You're essentially arguing that the word &quot;superior&quot; doesn't have a definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this so highly upvoted?  It over-extrapolates from a single, very specific hypothesis to supposedly explain why humans evolved the intelligence they currently possess.  Mountains of cognitive scientists, evolutionary biologists, and psychologists have broader, more developed theories about these things.</p></div>		</li>
