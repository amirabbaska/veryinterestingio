<p>Cold air with AC on will also work mostly because the AC function acts as a dehumidifier</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: when using the cold AC air to defrost (in summers, as hot air would make you uncomfortable), blow it at your feet. This way the cool and dry air is heated up by your and your co-passenger's bodies before it hits the windshield as hot and dry air. </p></div>		</li>
