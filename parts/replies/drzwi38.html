<p>We have one too, and this is spot on. Automatic transmission, power steering so strong you can turn with your left pinky, and the suspension would let you run over a body. These cars are dangerously comfortable to drive, no warning signals at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear you but honestly it makes me want to go too sleep forever, I would be the one to do the deed and I wouldn't choose a painless option. I know many people who have made the change to automatic for this very reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question though, I'm ok in a manual but never really understood what you're supposed to do in stop and go traffic. Seems to me below 1st gear speed there's no &quot;right&quot; procedure - if you go too slow you can even stall in first, but if you ride the clutch doesn't that murder it?</p></div>		</li>

You can still slip off the road, but you get less warning before it actually happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Meaning it's not as much of a difference as it used to be. If controlling traction is the goal of feathering your clutch, the car does that now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit : I'm a jerk it's good to learn to drive, I agree. If you're slipping off the road it's not the and or traction controls fault you're just driving too fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, but that's the same reason people here in North America choose manual transmissions. It doesn't address the question why they're more common in Europe.</p></div>		</li>
