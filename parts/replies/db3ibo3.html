			<div class="markdown"><p>You forget our brains have ways of avoiding self-harming by excess of strength. They are called tiredness and pain, and if you wonder why they exist and make you miserable when exercising, think about this.</p>
<p>Our muscles are strong. They can usually be stronger than our body is able to stand, only pain stops us from tearing ourselves apart. When you fold your arm, your muscles are contracting and applying pressure on your bones and articulations. If you try to lift more weight than your body is prepared to lift, it will hurt and you will stop.</p>
<p>If it didn't hurt you wouldn't know when to stop and you'd break some bone. There is people who are born without the ability to feel pain and it happens all the time to them. They have to learn how not to hurt themselves barely by trying and failing. When we are hysterical (such as enormous fear or rush), our body is filled with some hormones that, among other things, make us forget about pain.</p>
<p>It's a surviving mechanism, but also a dangerous one. When facing a lion in the wild, you don't want to die, so you take out everything you got, even at the price of hurting yourself in order to survive. Watching your kid being crushed can be another example of this.</p>
<p>None of the people that accomplished those &quot;supernatural&quot; tasks when extremely stressed did them without hurting themselves. I even remember reading one of them broke her spine lifting a car...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to actually put a name on this, there are things called Golgi Tendon Organs in your tendons, which are responsible for this. They detect how much force your muscle is producing, and if it's too much, they send inhibitory impulses to the motor neurons being used to contract the agonist muscle (i.e. The muscles you're using to move the car). Other comments have mentioned how new weightlifters gain strength primarily via neurological adaptations at first, and decreased GTO sensitivity is one of the adaptations that occurs (alongside decreased agonist/antagonist coactivation and altered motor unit recruitment patterns). </p>
<p>Also, your point about these stories being exaggerated is spot on. When autoinhibition goes out the window, we get considerably stronger, but we don't suddenly become the hulk. A 90lb girl could receive enough epinephrine to kill a clydesdale and she still isn't going to be lifting a car overhead.</p>
<p>Also, here's a brief scholarly source that touches on what Golgi Tendon Organs are and how they work.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, this was presumably one of those circumstances in which it was possible to get some leverage to achieve that movement of a fraction of an inch, but that doesn't make for as compelling a headline. </p></div>		</li>
