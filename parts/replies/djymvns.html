			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, it's pretty incredible that our bodies are efficient enough to only put out the heat of a single 50W lightbulb.</p>
<p>Above and beyond basic locomotion (moving a large mass semi-constantly with lots of actuating joints), digestion (converting 2000 kCal of organic compounds into ATP, glycogen, adipose tissue, and other useful compounds), and the many assorted autonomic functions - it also houses a ludicrous parallel processing super-computer.</p>
<p>Nature is seemingly pretty damn good at energy conservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, and this isn't to downplay how incredible the human body is, incandescent lightbulbs are also one of the most inefficient things we use. They're essentially dedicated heaters that produce some visible light on the side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but the efficient comment in human bodies has nothing to do with whether an incandescent bulb is efficient, though.  An incandescent bulb is inefficient at <em>putting out light</em> but that's not what we do.  </p>
<p>Maybe a better comparison is that 50w is around what a laptop uses ... and they aren't as intelligent and people and don't even move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but my PC uses up to 1500W and is only a fraction as powerful. An incandescent lightbulb is just a handy point of reference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also computer microprocessors.  A CPU is something approaching 99.9% efficient in turning electrical energy into heat, with some flipping of bits as almost an afterthought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nature does not &quot;optimize&quot;. Just dropping this PSA here because far too many people misunderstand natural selection and evolution.</p>
<p>These processes work only incidentally. Traits in offspring carry on to future generations if the individual survives and reproduces, but there's no law of nature that says the trait in question has to provide any survival benefit (or any benefit at all) to the individual. Ergo natural life forms are not and can never be &quot;perfect&quot; because nature enacts change in organisms semi-randomly and because highly evolved organisms are not subject to the processes of natural selection that earlier in in the evolutionary timeline would have selected for useful traits.</p>
<p>That is, the more highly evolved a species gets, the more likely it is that newborn individuals of that species will acquire, keep, and spread <em>detrimental</em> traits. &quot;Nature&quot; is a bit of a pendulum in this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder about that 50W value. The value I have in my head about &quot;how much power does the brain use?&quot; is 40W. Which is amazing by itself, considering what it is and does. But that would only let 10W for ... everything else. Seems off.</p>
<p>Still the point sure is true: Our bodies and brains are amazing feats of ... randomized evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty close. I design air conditioning systems. As part of the routine calculations we do to determine how to size an air conditioner, we take into account the heat generation of a human. It's a well studied subject with lots of published data in ASHRAE. A human in a normal work environment expends approximately 400 btuh which is about 100 Watts of heat. </p>
<p>It takes a lot of energy to cool the people load in a theater, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He wasn't talking about energy usage, he was talking about heat ouput. A 50W lightbulb isn't energy efficient when compared to organic systems (or even LEDs). So, more of the 50W of power that goes into it becomes ambient heat.</p>
<p>If you divide 2000 kCal (converted into joules) by the seconds in a day, the human body is a 96.85 W machine. That means that we can accomplish all we do for less than two lightbulbs of energy input, and we're about twice as efficient at using that energy without it becoming waste heat/entropy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/experiments-and-observations-in-a-heated-room-1774/" target="_blank">Charles Blagden ran a series of experiments from 1774-1775</a> to test the limits of what dry air temperatures a human can survive. He reportedly withstood temperatures up to 260 degrees Farenheit. It was these experiments that led to him recognizing the role of perspiration in thermoregulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. With swamp, coolers the air loses heat in order to evaporate the water in the cooler, when we sweat, the heat that is used to evaporate the water comes from our skin (and the underlying blood vessels). </p>
<p>One interesting thing about using water evaporation to cool our bodies is that this process only works as long as the air can carry the water vapour. When the air is saturated with water vapour, like on a very humid day, then no amount of sweating will cool you down since the water your body is excreting will not evaporate if the air will not accept the water vapour. </p>
<p>That's why a dry heat is much more comfortable than a humid heat.</p></div>		</li>
