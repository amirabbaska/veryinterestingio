			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I always thought it was just lower octane. Like I can't find anything under 95 where I live and when I saw high 80s in the US I assumed that their &quot;super duper extra premium&quot; was just lower than what we got locally.</p>
<p>Though, they also pay about 1/4 of the price we pay for gas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>US's 87 is equivalent to EU's 91.1, and US's 91 is equivalent to EU's 95.3</p>
<p>The US uses an average between RON (research octane number) and MON (motor octane number), which is referred to as the AKI (anti-knock index). The MON number is more real world under load, while RON is under lab conditions. The EU just uses RON. The MON number is between 8 and 12 below RON. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US uses a system called AKI to rate its fuel octane.  It's a combination of the RON test and the MON test.  To keep it simple they measure roughly the same thing (how hard it is to ignite fuel) but at different engine speeds / different air/fuel conditions.  </p>
<p>87 octane US is roughly 91 octane EU or RON</p>
<p>91 octane US is roughly 95 RON</p>
<p>93 octane US is roughly 98 RON</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different measuring system (itâ€™s America after all; we gotta use different units for everything lol).</p>
<p>We are in the same ballpark as Australia, our 87 AKI is like their 91 RON.</p></div>		</li>
