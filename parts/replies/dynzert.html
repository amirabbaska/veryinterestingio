			<div class="markdown"><p>That may have been where it's started, but it's definitely a cultural taste preference at this point. Many east Asians refuse to drink cold water, regardless of cleanliness. Personally I think it has more to do with the prevalence of tea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An Thai lady on our cleaning staff was <em>thrilled</em> beyond belief when we installed new water coolers with a hot water tap.  That's all I ever see her drink..  and she always puts a paper towel over her cup when she sets it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned to like warm and hot water (living in Asia) because you can drink more of it faster when it's around body temperature. Drinking more water actually does make you feel good. So--I started associating lukewarm water with that glow of a healthy body, and now crave water when that feeling is gone. </p>
<p>Warm water, folks. It's a win win. </p></div>		</li>
