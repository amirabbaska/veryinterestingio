			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, we can measure degradation rates and extrapolate. So, if after 10 years it’s 0.1% degraded, we might estimate it will take 10,000 years to fully degrade (its typically not linear, but that’s the general idea)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't help that we discard plastics in exactly the way that it Won't degrade typically.  We don't bury it quite deep enough to properly sequester it as far as carbon is concerned, but if we wanted it to break down, the best bet would actually be to not bury it at all. The unfortunate truth is that this turns out to be a bad idea, as the process of breaking down plastics has a bad habit of releasing methane and ethylene, greenhouse gasses. </p>

<p>As much as we're taught that it's horrible to landfill such things, the best thing for so many plastics out there might be to NOT let it degrade at all, but to bury it. Sequester the carbon, and all that. The trick is making sure it actually GETS buried, rather than ending up in a water source, and given the proximity of most major population centers to water, that... might be tricky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are also forgetting about micro-plastics. </p>
<p>They are already contaminating our ecosystems, our food chains and food supplies and our bodies. </p>
<p>Even if we went extinct tomorrow a future intelligent species on Earth would be able to detect a geological layer in the ground with micro plastics in them and make their own analysis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that sequestering carbon via plastic only makes any sense if you've stopped taking carbon out of the ground and burning it first, and then stopped taking carbon out of the ground and using it to make new plastic.  Recycling works a lot better, to the extent that it's practical.  Incineration of old plastic may be more practical, and beats taking new fossil carbon out of the ground and burning it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you could just burn the plastic. Some places do that. For many plastics, this releases a lot of toxic gases.</p>
<p>The accelerated degradation I'm talking about is a research tool, really -- takes place in well controlled confined environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How? In order to do that, even if it was possible, we'd first have to collect all of it. And we're only just getting started in properly separating trash in order to recycle it.</p></div>		</li>
