			<div class="markdown"><p>They 100% do and its so important to remember. Evolution is the result of generations of breeding choices, and it is not something predecided. </p>
<p>Just the idea of that completely misses the point. Its too common of a misconception that our bodies can pick and choose what we are adapted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully, the approach to teaching evolution has changed in the last few decades, because the simplistic/backwards way it was presented in my early science classes set us up for misunderstanding. It was almost as if the teachers <em>themselves</em> didn’t understand it. Evolution lessons were basically a retrofitted/reworded explanation of intelligent design. (e.g. The giraffe couldn’t reach the leaves on the tall trees, so it slowly, through the generations, grew a long neck). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. </p>
<p>It always irks me when things are said that imply the human body is mistaken or just hasnt fixed something yet, as if it is working on it andis part of some grand plan. Meanwhile, its not something anybody has any control over. It's a simple result of cause and effect through the process of people with certain traits breeding and passing them on. We learn this in biology class. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pet peeve of mine too, how easily people confuse evolution with intelligent design. It is an insidious little side effect of the way human minds work, forcing a cause and effect relationship. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't like using the term evolution because it scares skeptics off.</p>
<p>I like to just say: &quot;The people who didn't have this trait died off because _<strong>__</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>They seem to accept that a lot easier.</p></div>		</li>
