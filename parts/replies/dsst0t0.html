			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I clarify a bit? Na-22 is not what is commonly reffered to as “naturally occuring”. It´s cosmigenic with halflife of 2.6yrs, trace amount in natural sodium.
The rad. sources (your professor likely used) are industrially produced.
You are 100% right that there are nat. occuring beta+ emitters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely isn't - they are produced in accelerators, in minuscule amounts, and have a pretty short half-life. Thing is you do need minuscule amounts; more and it would kill you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PET scanners don't use naturally occurring radioactive material, but they do use it. Most PET scanners use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fludeoxyglucose_\(18F\)" target="_blank">fludeoxyglucose</a>, which is like glucose, but has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine-18" target="_blank">fluorine-18</a> (which emits positrons) integrated into it, which is itself made in a particle accelerator. How exactly the short half-life is dealt with I have no idea, but they must somehow.</p></div>		</li>
