			<div class="markdown"><p>There's additional considerations and that's the sheer population density of the cities themselves. LA is far less dense in general and the area is huge where having a car is almost a necessity. SF works without a car only within city limits but once you start trying to go beyond that it becomes extremely inconvenient.</p>
<p>Why I'm skeptical about HSR in CA isn't because I don't like HSR--don't get me wrong, I ride it in Japan and China all the time, it's great, but the fact that I can go from HSR to subway system in Osaka and Tokyo and still get anywhere I want makes it wonderful. If I took the HSR down to LA from SF, I'd have to get a car in the end to go anywhere I really wanted to.</p>
<p>Personally I'd rather see the money thrown at a real subway system. Anything we have in the US is pretty ridiculous and the NYC Subway feels like a 3rd world system compared to most other systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no point. Flying is faster. The train only makes sense if there are stops in between and between LA and Vegas there isn't much of anything.
In Japan for example, the bullet train stops every 30 minutes or so in large cities, the country is very dense. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In Europe you can go from city center to city center and arrive at your departure station literally 2 minutes before your train leaves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Carbon footprint?</p>
<p>It’s gotta take less energy (and release less carbon) to go horizontally from LA to Vegas than go horizontally AND fight gravity the whole way...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A high speed rail would make sense in the West coast and would beat flying and driving. Driving (and buses) is problematic because of traffic. Flying takes a long time when you factor getting to the airport, security, the flight, delays, etc. Not to mention flying is becoming more burdensome and expensive for consumers (pay for checked bags, pay for carry on, pay to sit with family). There is a high demand for routes between LA and Vegas, LA and San Francisco, etc. There is always talk about how people won't use these services, but LA metro lines have been meeting their ridership goals 10+ years ahead of schedule. People in California want a functional rail system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Texas, they have talked about doing high speed rail from Dallas to Austin and conceivably down to Houston. The major problem they seem to have here is that people are fiercely territorial about their property rights, and thus, the litigation surrounding imminent domain actions combined with a politics that thrives on &quot;the government is evil and is trying to socialize everything&quot; acts as a strong deterrent to investment or government action. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue in that situation is the rail would cut a lot of farmland in two and leave parts inaccessible and others time consuming to drive around to. Additionally, public transportation is less than stellar within the cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, and how are you going to find a path that is more efficient than the interstate, which is already there? I mentioned above that the most efficient route between those cities is already taken by the interstate. To be efficient, the train would have to run nearly parallel to it the whole way. </p></div>		</li>
