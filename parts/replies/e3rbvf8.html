			<div class="markdown"><p>but how can this mutation then spread?</p>
<p>when an egg is fertilized, both egg and sperm cell must have same number of chromosomes for the resulting fetus to be viable, right?</p>
<p>(isn't that why people with trisomy can't reproduce?)</p>
<p>so how can such a mutation be successful?</p>
<p>both male and female would have to have this same mutation for their offspring to be viable, and then their offspring would have to find another person with similar mutation for them to have children etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it is not a definite barrier to reproduction.  They have to line up but you can have 2 on one side, and one on the other.

<p>Fertility in people with Down's syndrome, for example, is decreased.  But it can and does happen that they have children.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I was really surprised to find that according to one source it is quite common:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robertsonian translocations (centric fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes) occur with a prevalence of âˆ¼1 in 1000 in the general population (Gardner and Sutherland, 1996).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure if this number is adjusted for survival. If it is, then this means that we have 7 million people walking among us with translocated chromosome pieces.</p>
<p>That is similar to the reported frequency of Down syndrome, the phenomenon that seems to be less restrictive to reproduction ability.</p>
<p>I can't get ahold of the quoted book right now (second edition of it, and001) is more frequently cited, what is the methodology of assessment of that statistics?</p></div>		</li>

<p>yes but then for this person to be able to have kids s/he'd have to meet someone else with the exact same mutation.</p>
<p>this would have to happen in multiple people at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
