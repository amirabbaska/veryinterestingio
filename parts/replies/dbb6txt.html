<p>Could we please make an exception for just this time? I'd like to learn more about this &quot;empty space.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You asked the right question!</p>
<p>First, you must understand that every elementary particle, the quarks, leptons, and bosons, aren't quite what you expect. You remember how I told you that they have definite mass and location, but not definite size? That's because these particles are really the result of an excitation in a relevant field.</p>
<p>What the hell does that mean? Well, you see, a field is an omnidirectional, ever-permeating region where a particular condition prevails. There's an electron field, and wherever there's an excitation in the electron field, there's an electron. Same with top fields, strange fields, tau fields, gluon fields, and higgs fields. If there's ever enough energy in one of them to cause an excitation, that results in the existence of a particle.</p>
<p>The excitation of the fields can be described as waves. This actually relates to how there's a duality and uncertainty with these particles. The fact that they're waves on this field of probability also introduces the capability for quantum tunneling. You often hear how photons and electrons show particle-wave duality, but if it were possible, isolated quarks would also show this duality. (However, that's not possible, but that's a lesson for another time)</p>
<p>Here's the thing about the wave functions though, they never reach a point that's just &quot;zero&quot;. When parts of the waves interfere, sometimes they reach a point where they manage to create an excitation. And thus, a virtual particle is born, and quickly gone.</p>
<p>Space is not ever completely empty. Though it's much thinner than our atmosphere, it is constantly seeing virtual particles spring into existence and vanishing. This may sound like matter from nothing, but it's a result of the energy in those ambient excitations giving rise to particles for brief moments.</p>
<p>These virtual particles even appear between the electron cloud and the nucleus, and in fact, within the particles in the nucleus itself. See, a proton only needs to meet 3 conditions.</p>
<p>1) 1 more valence Up quark than valence Down quark.<br />
2) a net charge of +1<br />
3) Colorlessness (that is to say, a property of the strong force, where each particle has a &quot;color&quot;. red, blue, green, anti-red, anti-blue, or anti-green.)</p>
<p>Due to that, any given proton can have more than the 3. The three we're familiar with, up, up, down, are the valence quarks. The proton is actually a massive tangle of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons binding those together. The valence quarks define which particle it becomes, but the rest (called virtual quarks), the quark-antiquark pairs forming mesons, and the gluons binding them all together, and their near speed of light movement are what gives the proton it's immense mass.</p>
<p>One more cool fact about virtual particles: they usually come in particle-antiparticle pairs, since this preserves the overall energy in the system (as antiparticles are negative excitations in the <em>same</em> field), and then mutually annihilate, but it's possible to boost them apart so that they become actual particles instead!</p></div>		</li>
