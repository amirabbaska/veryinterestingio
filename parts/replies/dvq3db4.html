			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd absolutely agree with you.  I have found that very dominant left or right hoofed horses have a hard time picking up the canter on the other lead much like people can't write well with their non-dominant hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if there are official studies on this, but domesticated animals in general seem to be more likely to develop a preference because their trainers/owners always use one side, or in species like dogs they might just copy their humans as they do with various other behaviors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an interesting study showing <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/animals-pets-cats-right-handed/#close" target="_blank">cats</a> have a dominant paw, and the authors postulated it was chromosomal, since females show a preference for the right side whilst males the left (which mirrors humans)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've certainly noticed that my cats tends to use one side first when testing something, walking, reaching... Etc we have a interactive food bowl so they have to pull food out and usually uses the same paw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed my dog definitely has a dominant side. He can only cock one leg to pee (right foot in the air), and since he walks on my left, he has to turn back around to pee on the trees/posts we pass on his left. </p>
<p>On the rare occasion where he walks past a tree on his right, he doesn't turn around to pee.</p>
<p>On that same note, he always picks up tricks faster using his left side first (eg. shake, hi-five and waving hello are all mostly left paw activities)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you a righty? I find my dog will usually use whichever paw is on the same side as the hand I use for shake/high five - I put my right hand out and say shake, he uses his left to shake. Now that I think of it, though, if I put something down for him he usually will stand on it with his right paw to keep it still while he chews or plays or whatever </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I train horses and most horse are what we consider left handed. It’s not exactly the same as right vs left handed tough. </p>
<p>First thing is that when you train a horse on the left side, you have to train on the right side and visa versa. It can’t automatically do/understand/deal with something trained on one side on the other side. </p>
<p>For instance if you desensitize a horse by throwing a rope on it’s back from the right side until it can cope with it, it can’t deal with the rope throw from the left side until you complete the same desensitize exercises on the left side. </p>
<p>In general these exercises are always easier from one preferable side and almost always this is the left side of the horse. </p>
<p>You can easily tell this with young untrained horses or even older badly trained horses (which unfortunately is a large group of horses) who don’t like you approaching them from the right and will turn their left side to you when you try. They will also try to really keep you, or any scary stuff, in their left eye.  This can cause all kinds of issues when riding, as the horse is not “confident” on it’s non-dominant side. </p>
<p>In horse-training (well, the kind I prefer), we try to address this to get a balanced horse. </p></div>		</li>
