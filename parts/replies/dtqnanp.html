			<div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons, first consoles have CPUs also and those need to be emulated, which isn't a task that works well for the way GPUs think. </p>
<p>Second because GPUs are set up kinda like mini-computers. They also have high speed cache and low speed RAM, so the same problem would apply even if you could convince your GPU to do the work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, so if the CPU architecture is the same on modern consoles I would think the internal registers would be the same.  Could you access the CPU registers directly if you were booting outside of the Windows environment?  I think there's a difference here in the memory configurations that I'm not understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic problem is knowledge: The stuff could probably run better, if you'd know all the details on both sides, but in most cases the people writing the emulators know only a fraction of what's possible from both sides, because they have to reverse engineer a lot of it, because it isn't documented, and even if it was, it would take a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>This is an interesting read on the general topic btw: <a href="https://de.dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/07/30/ubershaders/" target="_blank">https://de.dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/07/30/ubershaders/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. The CPU will both cache and prefetch code from the RAM, so that the CPU will be polling the RAM only on cache (or translation look-aside buffer) misses. I left out or glossed this detail by simply suggesting that the time cost most often wouldn't be worst case. </p></div>		</li>
