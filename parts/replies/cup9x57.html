			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to be the only parent level comment that actually addresses why the temperature goes up in the first place.  It's all about inflammation secondary to the immune response yall.  The body does not actively raise the temperature, it just does damage control after the fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of it this way: You need white blood cells to fight infection, which come from your blood. When you have a bad infection, you need more white blood cells to fight it off so your heart pumps faster to keep up with the demand. The faster heart beats causes your temperature to go up (just like when you run, your heart rate goes up and you get warmer)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big reason for a fever is to fight viruses (virii)..  When body temp goes up a bit, DNA replication plummets.  So it gives your immune response more time to rally the troops, while the virii spend time trying to dig out of the mud.</p></div>		</li>
