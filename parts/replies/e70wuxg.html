<p>Now if the hydrogen gas got hot enough from the exothermic reaction it could ignite but I don't think it would reach the flash point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size of the chunk - you can throw about a nickel-sized chunk (in terms of volume) into a beaker of water and it won't burst into flame if the water is room temp.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sodium and potassium always burst into flame, even when you use a tiny chunk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You eat very large amounts of both sodium and potassium daily, and then your kidneys throw all the extra into your pee to get rid of it.</p>
<p>The thing we presume is that because Li+ is fundamentally different from Na+ and K+ but has the same charge, it fits into sockets that aren't built for it and fundamentally changes them. Possibilities include changing the shapes of proteins by being too small, binding to something like an enzyme and refusing to let go which functionally deactivates it, messing with the electrical currents of neurons (which are created by shoving sodium ions around), and many more processes. And frankly, it is probably doing more than one of the things we suspect it does which makes it even harder to narrow down possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly, that description works for a <em>lot</em> of drugs. Not even just psychiatric drugs.</p></div>		</li>
