			<div class="markdown"><p>Like all hormonal medication, there are a host of side effects, often poorly researched, ranging from the mild to the severe.</p>
<p>I'm a little bitter about this one because Implanon, the brand of implant I had, has been implicated in triggering a chronic pelvic pain condition, which absolutely nobody warned me about and which I only learned of after going to a gynaecological pain specialist due to all the chronic pelvic pain I was having. He was like &quot;oh, you've got the implant. Ah. First thing's first, take that out&quot;. It wasn't that my previous doctors were lying to me or negligent - they honestly didn't know. It took about 18 months to two years for my hormones to sort themselves out, and seven years after becoming sexually active I am now just beginning to have pain-free sex.</p>
<p>Plus it does all sorts of crazy things to your mood, sex drive, periods (some women lose theirs, but mine started and didn't stop), etc. It's really fantastic for a lot of women but personally, it was fucking dreadful and I really can't recommend it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this. It was 'safe' and did prevent pregnancy, but I was one of the few who had bad side effects. Basically I had my period for three weeks a month instead of one for three months straight. Then I had it removed. It will affect everyone differently, but be aware this is possible. On the plus side, having it put in and taken out was simple and painless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that chronic pain condition also linked to progesterone only pills? I ask because after being on one continuously I have developed pelvic pain for over two months now even after stopping. My doctor doesn't know why I'm still getting tests done. </p></div>		</li>

She had really bad Periods before, now she only has one every once in a blue moon (maybe once a year). No pregnancies or awful side effects in any of the 5 years. </p>
<p>It is expensive up front, but it lasts a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The risks are similar to hormonal contraceptive in pill form (namely, increased risk of blood clots), with a slight risk of infection at the incision as its healing (like any cut) and potential allergy to metals and other components that might not be in an oral contraceptive.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Implanon and Nexplanon are progesterone-only contraceptives, in contrast to oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which contain both estrogen and progesterone. It is the estrogen which confers an increased risk of blood clots. For this reason, we use progesterone-only methods, like IUDs and implants, for those with increased risk of blood clotting, like people who smoke, have hypercoagulable disorders, have a previous history of clotting, etc. The progesterone-only methods are perfectly safe for these conditions as they do not have an increased risk of blood clots. </p>
