			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. It's typically beneficial for plants to surround their seeds with nutrients, which improve the ability of a young seedling to grow. That's the original evolutionary benefit to proto-fruits. But the thing is, there's even more benefit, evolutionarily, to being able to widely disperse seeds and it turns out that animal poop is nearly as good a fertilizer for plants as is the fruit body. Seedlings need some amount of easily accessible calories to begin growing, but once they start photosynthesizing then they need nutrients more than calories, so fertilizer is often just as good as carbs. Being able to spread to more locations (due to seed transport by animals) makes plants much more successful than they would be otherwise, and that favors plants who produce fruits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>funintheburbs has  the answer you are looking for.  everything is random mutations. some mutations happen to be more successful at spreading and maintaining the life (of whatever we are talking about).  ... I see this confusion all the time when it coomes to evolution. things don't happen for a reason, but instead because they happen it might be beneficial...think of it this way.  I heard people say something like &quot;trees have bark because it protects them.&quot;  when in truth trees are protected because they have bark, and they have bark because of a random genetic accident/mutation</p></div>		</li>
