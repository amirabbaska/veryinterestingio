			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know for sure, but from what I can gather reading this thread, it seems like the processing part can take in 1000 fps (or something roughly equivalent to that number) and all of that information is used to put together about 200fps in transmissions to the part of the brain that &quot;sees&quot; the image.</p>
<p>So, more like it's taking in information 1000 times a second, or more, but uses bunches of frames to create image signals 200 times a second.</p>
<p>Then again, I could be way off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>40fps</p>

<p>I have done a lot of tests with blinking LEDs, and there is a very noticeable difference between a LED blinking 40 times a sec and one blinking 100 times a sec. The 40Hz one is <em>more or less</em> stable, but it looks a bit noisy and looks to be fluctuating a bit. The 100Hz one is rock-solid. No noise, no fluctuations, nothing. And IF 40Hz was enough, why then are CTRs 60Hz and up? For me, even a 60Hz CRT isn't a &quot;stable&quot; image, it's flickering ever so slightly. </p>

<p>The average human being isn't going to be able to detect any differences in frame rates higher than 40fps</p>

<p>The average human doesn't know there is a difference. Tell there there is a differance. Then ask them which is better in an ABX test.</p>
<p>There are people that can't hear the difference between a $5 headset powered by a no-brand chine MP3 player and a HiFi system set up by an audio technician. Their brain is filling in for them. They aren't listening. </p>
<p>Another problem is the notion of &quot;FPS&quot;. A more interesting question is how quickly can in image flash before you before you can't make out what is was? Fighter-pilots have been able to identify the correct plane when shown an image for 1/4000th of a second, of 4000FPS if you'd like. But 30FPS is enough for most motion to be perceived as &quot;smooth&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There is a huge difference between what is passable as real, and what that is indistinguishable from real. 30FPS is <em>passable</em> as real, 200FPS+ is.</p></div>		</li>
