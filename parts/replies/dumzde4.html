PharmD student as well-it's kinda interesting cause we also talked about this in class and though it's probably not the best idea to give multiple live attenuated vaccines all at once, the professor said that either you give them all on the same day or give vaccine #1 then wait 4 weeks and give vaccine #2 so you're not decreasing the immune response to vaccine #2 while immune response to #1 is in full blown effect and using most of the resources.
This is a more regional guideline so that could be different from what you were taught (not saying what you were taught is wrong, just different recommendations depending on location of practice)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The person you're responding to I believe is referring to giving multiple, different, live attenuated vaccines in the same day. </p>
<p>What you're referring to would be giving the same live attenuated vaccine on the same day (or close). </p>
<p>A modern live attenuated vaccine is like a sleeping puppy. Your immune system isn't going to be burdened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true.  Per the Pink Book, all indicated vaccines should be given in one visit, with only a couple of very specific exceptions (e.g. pneumococcal and meningococcal for asplenic patients).  If two live vaccines are indicated but are not administered on the same day, then the CDC recommends a four-week waiting period between the two.  But they can absolutely be given on the same day.</p>
