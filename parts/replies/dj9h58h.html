<p>Also, a downside to using a galactic reference frame is that it adds a lot of needless complexity if you're staying within the solar system. For example, the motion of Earth w.r.t. the galaxy changes in a more complicated way compared to its motion w.r.t. the sun, which is elliptical.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's an example on a smaller scale. Let's say we want to represent the position of New York City. With respect to Earth, we might say it's at 40.7ยบ N, 74.0ยบ W. Ignoring plate tectonics, those coordinates will remain fixed for the foreseeable future. With respect to the sun, it would be roughly 1.016422 au &quot;Sunward,&quot; 9.95ยบ &quot;Orbitwise&quot; (defining 0ยบ at Earth's aphelion), and a tiny fraction of an AU towards the &quot;Solar North.&quot; Except those coordinates are constantly changing due to Earth's orbit, rotation, and wobble. Even on a time scale of one hour, they would already be off by over 100,000 km. Now imagine adding in the motion of the sun around the Milky Way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that these coordinate systems are difficult to define precisely. To define &quot;coreward&quot; as anything much more than &quot;you know, generally over that way&quot;, you'll need a specific object that coreward is <em>toward</em>. If that object is nearby (say, a star near the center of the galaxy), then it's constantly moving. The math becomes trickier, the dynamics becomes non-Newtonian... If that object is far away (not in our galaxy), then it's not alway toward the core.</p>
<p>Modern coordinate systems are generally defined either directly or indirectly based on the position of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_Frame" target="_blank">several objects well outside of our galaxy</a>, so that even over relatively long times the coordinate system doesn't move much.</p>
<p>As a side note, &quot;coreward&quot;, &quot;spinwise&quot;, and &quot;north&quot; define a cylindrical coordinate system, in which adding vectors (for example) is trickier. You can translate to and from a local cartesian coordinate system, but why not just start that way in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it depends on which way you are travelling and which system you want to use. In the show, they used two different systems to travel. One was spatial coordinates, exact locations within the quadrant of the galaxy they are going to. The other was using the ship as the center and rotating on its current axis. 360 by 360 which could allow them to simply convey any heading to the helm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't we just define them conceptually, as mathematical averages of the spin of different arms, or the innermost and outermost arms, for example?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The central object moving isn't a problem, as all reference frames are relative. It accelerating is a problem, but I believe that Sagittarius A* appears to be virtually at rest over human timeframes and is a nice sensible reference object. Alternatively, the galactic barycenter may be even better.</p></div>		</li>
