			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a skinny little piece of metal that you normally stick into the center of a cake - if it comes out clean, the cake is done. If there's cake bits stuck to it, it's still raw in the middle.</p>
<p>For savory foods, if you stick a cake tester into a piece of steak, leave it for 2 seconds, and then place the tip (which should have been dead center mass in your steak) on the underside of your lip, the temperature of the metal will tell you the doneness of your steak. If it's cold, it's rare. Medium rare is mildly cool. Medium should be feel warm on your lip. Medium well is pretty darn warm, and well done should be <em>touch</em> ouch hot.  Chicken should feel <em>touch</em> ouch hot. </p>
<p>With fish like salmon, steak rules apply. With fish like sea bass or other fish you don't want medium rare, you can stick the cake tester in sideways through the fish, perpendicular to the grain of the fish. If you feel resistance in spots, the cake tester is pushing against the membranes in the fish. That membrane becomes much softer when the fish is cooked; you should feel no resistance when the fish is fully cooked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why has no one questioned this?
What are the health code regulations for &quot;cake testers&quot; that you are touching to your lip sixty times an hour? You can get an instant read thermometer with a needle probe that you don't have to lick in between steaks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it, I do. And the short answer is: department of health differs from state to state, but I'd bet money they wouldn't like this. But here's the thing:</p>
<p>A probe thermometer has to be sterilized in between every piece of meat that you probe according to the DOH in NY. Is that practical? Is that actually happening in kitchens? And a spatula or pair of tongs to flip meat - is that getting sanitized in between uses? You cut chicken on this cutting board, and now you're gonna cut beef? Nope. Get a new cutting board. Repeat 30 times a night. </p>
<p>The truth of even the 3 star Michelin restuarants is that there is a certain skirting of DOH regulations that occurs, because otherwise, your food would take a LOT longer to make, labor costs go up for dishwashers, the restaurant has to buy more equipment (cutting boards in that past example), and the consumer would have to pay a lot more. A lot more. </p>
<p>I say this not to scare you off restaurants, nor to devalue your comment. The kitchens I have worked in are incredibly clean, and the cooks themselves work clean as well. Cooks take incredible care in trying to avoid situations that are hazardous (and/or gross) for the guests. But there is no restaurant that I can think of or have been to where if time was frozen upon the entrance of a DOH inspector, they would pass with flying colors. It's just (as of now) an impractical way to cook food and still have dining out be an affordable and viable option. </p>
<p>Also, I want to differentiate these kinds of kitchens from the kind where some asshole drops a piece of meat on the floor and puts it back on the grill for a second before serving it. We are NOT talking about the same kind of place, and if I ever heard a story about that kind of stuff, I would not go there. And if you're one of those kinds of restaurant cooks, get out of my fucking profession. </p>
<p>TL/DR: Going to a restaurant is kind of an unspoken contract - you get the food to me in a manner I find acceptable and won't make me sick or gross me out, and I will overlook the fact that you didn't wash your cutting board in between slicing 40 different steaks. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The 1st sign of a crappy piece of grilled meat is when it is resting in a pile of juice and I barely poked it with a fork.</p></div>		</li>
