			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, once you get away from the center of a galaxy, stars tend to move at very similar speeds, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/jf5hf" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. However, because stars further way have to travel a longer distance, they will have lower angular velocities. In order to have all the stars move at the same angular velocity, their tangential velocity would need to increase proportionally to the distance, e.g. as in a solid disk.</p>
<p>As an aside, are you are completely right, that this behavior is different from what goes on in our Solar system, or in fact in any simple Kepler-like gravitational system. In fact, the weird behavior seen in these galaxy rotation curves was key in motivating the study of dark matter as an explanation for this discrepancy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The spiral is an emergent phenomenon caused by independent bodies orbiting each other, it's not a fixed structure and there are not specific stars which are &quot;in&quot;  or &quot;out&quot; of the spiral band. It's more like a wave. Try tracking a specific star in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/e/e0/Spiral_arms.ogv/Spiral_arms.ogv.360p.webm" target="_blank">this animation</a> for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, the apparent paradox you describe is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory#Galactic_spiral_arms" target="_blank">winding problem</a>. The solution is that the arms you see are not fixed structures, but are more like waves. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_bWFHGaPWg" target="_blank">This video</a> does a nice job of running through the explanation in an accessible way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The spiral arms aren't really arms of stars moving along with each other. They do over &quot;shorter&quot; time scales, whenever they find themselves within the dense arms, but they eventually move out of it. Look at the three animations provided on that page. The first two represent how a lot of people imagine the spiral must work, where the stars that make up the arms stay consistent. The third is how it actually works, where the spiral arms are just waves of dense clusters that aren't constantly made up of the same stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory" target="_blank">This wikipedia page explains the most widely accepted theory</a>. Essentially, the arms are not actual structures. They're artifacts of the overall pattern of movement of individual objects orbiting the center of the galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The estimated age of our Solar System's star, The Sun, is about 4.6 billion years old. The galactic year, which is time required for the Solar System to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy varies in estimate from 225 to 250 million terrestrial years. So if we take into account a margin of error saying that the age of The Sun is 4.5 billion years and it takes 250 million years to orbit the galaxy once, then we have roughly orbited the centre of the galaxy 18 times, give or take.</p></div>		</li>
