			<div class="markdown"><p>It bothers me when people won't eat something because it has &quot;chemicals&quot; in it. What do you eat? Quantum fields? Photons? </p>
<p>Or when people only eat &quot;organic&quot; food. Really? I thought humans ate solid elemental magnesium. Maybe I should try some carbon-based food.</p>
<p>Of course I don't actually argue with people about these things, because in context I get what they're saying and it would be unnecessarily pedantic of me to argue about the definitions of the words. I guess being a chemistry major has just made me automatically think of the words &quot;chemicals&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; in chemistry terms. </p>
<p>EDIT: Just for fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;I don't do drugs.&quot; - Alcohol? Caffeine? Tylenol? DayQuil? When you got strep throat you didn't take penicillin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;I don't eat GMOs.&quot; - Practically everything you eat is a result of GMOs, and that's a good thing. Most fruits would taste bad and have tons of seed if it weren't for GMOs. They also let us produce <em>more</em> food with <em>less</em> space and while using <em>fewer</em> pesticides. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;I don't believe in global warming, it's just a theory.&quot; - So you also don't believe in general relativity, or gravity? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Natural foods are healthier.&quot; - There are plenty of natural foods that <em>aren't</em> healthy and plenty of unnatural foods that <em>are</em>. Lots of 'natural' mushrooms are deadly. Hell, cyanide is produced 'naturally'. </p>
</li>
<li>&quot;You can't prove it.&quot; - Try to actually <em>prove</em> anything, then. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes words can have more than one meaning. I'm with you for the &quot;chemicals&quot; thing, but when talking about food, the word organic has a different definition than when talking about chemistry. </p>
<p>You'll find both definitions in a dictionary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, and one can't really disagree with facts haha. However let me nitpick the drugs one, as I think it might be just a semantic issue. Everyone knows the broad definition of drugs and it's not like they deny their existence or denomination, I just think that when we refer to drugs on a casual conversational fashion we mean the harmful, addictive ones, with no particular rule to describe them but rather a list we as a society made up I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not all.  Electrical potentials which give weight to neural potentials, conduction between the dendrites and along axons are purely physical.  There's also a potential element of quantum uncertainty, since measuring potentials can set them off, and exactly which, when and in what order neurons fire could remarkably change cognitive outcomes as firings cascade through the system.</p>
<p>Chemicals regulate and generate the electrical flows in our brains, sure, but fundamentally it's an electrical computer, all the chemical and biological stuff is the support system that keeps it powered and running, akin to the grid and generation infrastructure powers the internet and all its nodes.  The real important stuff is neural activity itself.  That's what makes decisions and forms everything that is us.</p>
<p>The fact is, we just don't know enough about brain mechanics to make an informed determination as to the extent of how much QM affects the brain which isn't covered by higher abstractions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So electrons and their fields aren't covered by quantum mechanics? I thought that QM described everything, at a quantum level.</p>

<p>I see, this is more an issue of modeling and comprehension of how brains work, rather than what actually makes them work. I was calling OP out that (it seems to me that) everything is QM, not just &quot;mysterious&quot; or &quot;strange&quot; things. It'd have been more constructive for me to realize that OP meant what you clarified here, using QM to refer only to things that can't be adequately modeled classically, and asking whether these are necessary to understand the brain, a good question Naturally if a simpler model (classical) can adequately describe something, you don't need a more complex one (QM).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, the answer to OP's question is &quot;Yes, because quantum mechanics is part of physics, and physics determines how your brain works.&quot;  ;D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as we know very little about the physical instantiation of consciousness, I don't think NDT has justification for that claim. The idea that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind" target="_blank">quantum effects play a role in consciousness</a> has been defended in the philosophy of mind, though it is not the dominant view. </p></div>		</li>
