			<div class="markdown"><p>The positive is that those bonds are very stable and almost certainly aren't going to lose money before you go to college (or whatever else you used the money for). The downside is that over the course of 18 years, they likely could've invested in things that earned far more than those bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was year ago, but I think the stability was the point. My grandparents grew up in the depression, so they probably werenâ€™t hot to put that money into anything that posed any amount of risk.</p>
<p>I ultimately cashed it all out at 23 and used it as part of the down payment on my first house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need to get to the international level. When you hear about the Fed buying govt debt on the open market using printed money, it's basically cancelling debt from the system by holding the debt indefinitely and printing new money to settle the initial third party lender off. You can't net it off from the books because it would create serious forex and trust issues, but in practice it's basically the same thing.</p>
<p>The idea is that once central banks get significantly involved both money and debt are just digital points with no intrinsic value, and you can call them whatever you want. The only thing of substance is the systemic equilibrium being maintained by the economic mechanisms involved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have three mostly wrong answers here.</p>
<p>For the US and most major powers, the debt is in the form of bonds. This is how China and Japan bounce back and forth between who we owe the most money to. They buy American bonds, because they are stable and safe investments.</p>
<p>The entire idea that &quot;China could just say, 'The money you owe us is due!' and crash our economy is pretty much BS. The debt they own is from buying and trading for American bonds. They want them because they're stable and a strong investment. If they decided to sell off all their American bonds tomorrow, plenty of other countries would jump all over buying them for that reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not correct, so far as I know - they were purchasing US Treasuries to maintain the yuan's peg to the dollar (and later a basket of currencies of which the majority was the dollar). Purchasing Treasuries with yuan depresses the value of the yuan and increases the value of the dollar - this makes their products cheaper in America and thus helps their export economy. </p>
<p>(A side effect, by the way, is that it helps keep American interest rates low, as China is putting in very low yield bids for Treasuries.)</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-debt-to-china-how-much-does-it-own-3306355" target="_blank">article on the subject</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China makes sure the yuan is always lower than the U.S. dollar. Why? Part of its economic strategy is to keep its export prices competitive. It does this by holding the yuan at a fixed rate compared to a &quot;currency basket&quot; of which the majority is the dollar. When the dollar falls in value, the Chinese government uses dollars it has on hand to buy Treasuries. It receives these dollars from Chinese companies that receive them as payments for their exports. China's Treasury purchases increases demand for the dollar and thus its value.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American Citizens own more of the US government's debt than China does.... pretty much every single 401k, IRA, or mutual fund includes government bonds.   So even if you've never bought a government bond, if you have a 401k you own some government debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the debt repayment schedule is worked into the budget and it throws things off if you either A) pay off debt early or B) have a debt to you paid off early. They also agree, when they buy the debt, to when exactly they get paid back; which is usually a little bit every year for 5, 10 or 20 years.</p></div>		</li>
