			<div class="markdown"><p>This is typically done for front mirrors, such as those used in telescopes. A good video on this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4FBKbNY258" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Your typical bathroom mirror is done through a chemical deposition. Basically the glass is washed in a series of chemicals that eventually deposit the silver on the back of the glass. This is faster and cheaper than vapor deposition, and good enough for regular mirrors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one way that mirrors are made, yes. Aluminium is evaporated and deposited on the back of a piece of glass, and then covered with a protective layer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and not only any mirrors.  Most highly reflective surfaces.  That's how a lot of the bezels and reflectors in cars are made reflective.  It's done in all kinds of applications including putting Gold onto high grade optical mirrors.  Although the details of the exact process vary depending on the substrate, metal being deposited, and the level of quality needed in the parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metallurgist here. For simple 'solid solution' alloys, where the atoms are randomly dispersed, this would be fine. For more complex alloys where you get multiple phases, this wouldn't likely work. You might be able to retrieve something like the initial microstructure through heat treatments, but it's probably more effort than it's worth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of what makes different alloys act differently is their microscopic grain structure (when you work-harden, temper, or anneal a metal, what's happening is that you're changing its grain structure). I assume that an alloy deposited from a vapor would have different structure than one cooled from a melt, and so it would have different physical properties. I'd be interested if any metallurgists know more though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the material. Alloys should be fine. Some compounds evaporate better than others, for example oxides tend to disassociate slightly without using an oxygen atmosphere, whereas fluorides are normally fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alloys will not be fine, since different components will evaporate at different rates. At best, the composition will be different after re-condensing. Some elements will not evaporate at all at any reasonable temperatures (for example, the carbon or tungsten in various grades of steel).</p>

<p>oxides tend to disassociate slightly</p>

<p>Since PVD is usually conducted in vacuum, metal oxides will usually decompose completely. It won't work at all. Only a few exceptions exist - for exotic metal oxides that have molecular structure (such as OsO4).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t have to, some materials can sublimate, others cannot. Sublimation is the phenomenon of a material jumping from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase. Have you ever seen vapor pour out of your freezer on a hot day? That’s sublimation of water, skipping directly from solid to gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, everything can sublimate, it just depends what pressure the temperature change occurs at. Or vice versa. Technically water shouldn’t be able to sublimate in atmosphere, what happens there is quite unique to water, and relies on waters liquid volume being less than its solid volume, also a good amount of that mist is rapid vaporisation due to other effects, mainly concentration driving forces trying to saturated the air with water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the metal. Chrommium, for example, sublimates during typical evaporation. Gold, titanium, platinum and aluminium melt during typical evaporation. We perform evaporation at high temperature and very low pressure. We do not vaporize an entire ingot of metal, instead a small crucible is heated under vacuum, generating a very small amount of metal vapor. </p></div>		</li>
