			<div class="markdown"><p>To put the Scotland and England thing as simply as possible, when Scotland and England unified the reality was that they were unified under one monarch. That monarch was not the king of one country but was the king of two simultaneously.</p>
<p>To illustrate why these holdings are different, in the same way, the early Norman Kings through the Plantagenets had a similar thing going on. They were at one time Kings of England while also being dukes of Normandy and Aquitaine or whatever other continental holdings they had (from William the Conqueror who was a Norman French duke before seizing England). This made them both Kings of England with full control over those lands while technically being vassals of the French king in their role as Norman dukes.</p>
<p>When it comes to England and Scotland it began with one person holding two kingdoms and sort of being two kings in one.</p>
<p>Also important to note, though Britain is a constitutional monarchy it is still a monarchy. It still observes a lot of the technicalities and ceremonies and traditions as they did so long ago when sovereigns were the final say. The Queen in many ways still is the representative in human form of the state itself. And the state kind of doesn't exist without her. And she is also a queen of many countries we think of as different modern nations as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good political explanation!</p>
<p>Wanna tackle sports? Why one “United” team for the Olympics but separate country teams in football?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly boils down to the fact the UK created most of the first international leagues and so populated the leagues with the old Home Nations, those leagues influenced the ones we have today and so the old national teams stuck around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile when the Olympics were created, the UK joined in as Team GB and not as the Home Nations, so in order to enter the football they have to enter as Team GB.</p>
<p>It's a point of contention since the Scottish and Welsh FAs fear that if they participate in the Olympic team they risk their independent FIFA membership and so regularly ban their players. This prevented a female GB team entering Rio.</p>
<p>So really, when you see a Team GB football team, you're usually seeing a English Team.</p></div>		</li>
