			<div class="markdown"><p>Except there are 1.06 males born for every female <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sex_ratio?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">source</a> </p>
<p>Edit: I guess some people like to down vote facts. If you actually read the linked Wikipedia article on the human sex ratio, they don't know why, but there is between 1.02-1.08 boys born for every girl. Some speculate it is because males die of diseases, suicide, and violence more than women and it helps to even out the genders in the long run. Some evidence suggests that males are more likely to be born when the mothers are under stress. In the whole world, there are 1.01 males per female. Although this is due to a much greater ratio of males:females in Asia (<a href="http://statisticstimes.com/population/countries-by-sex-ratio.php" target="_blank">source</a>), which some have speculated to be due to sex selection   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China definitely stands out as having a ton more males than females. This makes sense from a cultural standpoint because boys are much valued over girls. (Source: Am Chinese)</p>
<p>Overall, this is true in the East, except for in countries hit by wars, where men are in short supply (look at Russia.)</p>
<p>Overall, a country like Canada would have a very good average for &quot;natural&quot; rates, since Canada isn't too likely to get into a war and its culture doesn't tend toward boys or girls at birth. (USA has lost more men to wars, especially during the Cold War, which is why that's not a good pick.) Canada has 1.056 boys per girl at birth and 0.98 males per female overall, both of which are enough off 1.0 to be significant.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn't mean this is true for all mammals, but I would definitely agree that the 50:50 model isn't quite complete. Mechanically, it should be (assuming all sperm have an equal chance to fertilize and there is exactly a 50/50 chance of each sperm being X or Y) but empirical data disagrees and empirical data is practically never wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, stats don't really lie. Based on basic biology explanations, if we only considered meiosis, then it would be 1:1. This doesn't occur so that simple explanation is not sufficient. Something else causes for more xy sperm to successfully fertilize an egg and subsequently become implanted in the uterus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's 50:50 random chance, that doesn't mean the end result will be exactly 50:50.</p>
<p>Toss a coin 10 times and there's a 50:50 chance of it being heads or tails. Doesn't mean there won't be 6 heads in the out come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toss a coin 7 billion times though and you'd expect less than 0.1% error rate assuming perfect randomness not a 6% error rate. It would seem that there is probably some factor contributing to sex other than just a completely random 50/50 chance. Maybe males on average produce slightly more than 50% XY sperm cells, or maybe eggs are slightly more likely to accept an XY than an XX. No one knows.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, it could be that census data is not perfect and the chance really IS 50:50. For example, in the past and still to a lesser extent now, in countries like India and China, it was preferable to have males over female children, so maybe a non-insignifican amount of female fetuses were aborted? Maybe in some countries, it is less likely that women will be accounted for, for whatever reason. I'm just speculating but there are a million possible confounding favtors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like you're proving the wrong point with this statement. Tossing a coin tens of billions of times is going to result in 50 percent or extremely close but it doesn't for sex selection.  You can't go on a &quot;heater&quot; for several billion attempts :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just edited my post because people weren't reading it. Basically in every country, there are more males than females at birth. There is probably an evolutionary reason why this occurs. As with much evolutionary biology, speculation abounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In meiosis, diploid cells (ie ones having two sets of chromosomes, which will all be XY in a male) each split into two haploid cells, each having one set of chromosomes. Thus if 1,000,000 diploid cells split, there will be 2,000,000 sperm cells, precisely half of which have a single X chromosome and half have a Y. During orgasm, a random sample of mature sperm are ejaculated, and then one of them (at most) fertilize the egg. Thus the odds are 50/50.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the process is simply meiosis, that is the division of the precursor cells that will make gametes (sperms).</p>
<p>Refresher: cells can divide either through meiosis or mitosis. Mitosis is the complete REPLICATION of the whole genome, when splitting a cell into two. So the cells, both the initial cell, and the new cell, will retain the same number of chromosomes (chr comes in sets; chr1 for example, has two copies, called alleles, one from the dad, one from the mom). Meiosis on the other hand, make one cell undergo another extra cycle of division, so instead of ending up with two cells (1 original, 1 new), you get 4 cells (1 ori, 3 new). This results in each cell only having 1 copy of the chr. </p>
<p>Extending from this, you can imagine if we are looking at the sex chr, which in this case should be XY because we're talking about a man producing sperms, meiosis will result, by simple probability, 1:1 ratio of X:Y. Meaning, out of the four resulting cells, 2 would carry Y while X would carry X.</p>
<p>Check out this video if you are a visual learner. <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/meiosis" target="_blank">http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/meiosis</a></p>
<p>The sperms NEED to have only one copy of all chromosomes, because when mating, and upon fertilisation, the union of the sperm and the ovum need to result in a two-copies set of each chr, as is normal in humans (we are what is called a diploid organism; we need a maternal copy of a chromosome, and a paternal copy of the same chr, to survive as an embryo, and come into terms). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is through the mechanism known as meiosis. Each male, as the above mentioned, has a set of chromosomes known as sex chromosomes: 1 X and 1 Y. During meiosis, DNA is replicated in a cell causing the cell to have two sets of XY. This cell then splits with its two children splitting again, resulting in each of these four cells having one of the X or Y.  As you can see, with males having 1 X and 1 Y, they distribute it evenly to their sperm. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there any reacher that suggests that it MIGHT not be random and there's some predictably? </p>
<p>I know the theory right now is it's random.. But is there a small amount of studies that might suggest otherwise? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have explained in more detail, it's not really random, it's that sperm are produced by cells with X and Y splitting into two cells, one of which gets the X and one gets the Y. The random part is not knowing which sperm will get to the egg first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what I asked. </p>
<p>I asked if a particular sperm cell becoming X or Y is random. </p>
<p>So what you're saying is.... Two sperm cells predecessors (an X and a Y) used to be combined? That's kinda cool. </p></div>		</li>
