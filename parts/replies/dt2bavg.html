			<div class="markdown"><p>That analogy about boxing. What about working out? Why do they say that it’s good for the body and makes old people healthier? The muscles breaking down and rebuilding over and over, wouldn’t that effectively accelerate aging? </p>
<p>I’m confused and you seem pretty knowledgeable, so maybe you could explain that please. Thank you))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to add to the other response. I work in a muscle biology lab and exercise is good for you; it shouldn't accelerate overall aging- with regards to muscle breaking down and rebuilding over and over. In fact, leading a sedentary lifestyle will result in increased muscle loss and strength loss with age (especially over the age of 60). This then leads to frailty and increase likelihood of falls and fractures which, as you may know, take some time to recover from and ultimately changes the quality of life. </p>
<p>Now, regarding muscle breaking down and rebuilding. First of all, muscle cells do not divide once they've become mature (the myofibers with multiple nuclei that ultimately make up your muscles). These cells may break down under stress (exercise), but the way the muscle is rebuilt is from satellite cells (stem cells, new cells basically) that become active and combine to form a mature myofiber. </p>
<p>Additionally, breaking down and rebuilding of the muscle cells isn't always what's happening. Sometimes there is just a change triggered to increase cellular components and protein within the muscle cells. This then leads to stronger muscles, more strength, protection from injury, and other benefits. </p>
<p>The basic thing to take from this,however, is that mature muscle doesn't divide, and therefore the DNA isn't being lost in your muscle cells. Instead, exercising can lead to a longer life due to having a healthy heart that doesn't get overworked due to obesity/overweight or other complications. </p>
<p>Hope this helps! If it doesn't make sense or you have a question just respond or PM me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new cells are, I'm guessing, why muscles become bigger. Simple cell repair would keep them at the same size wouldn't it?
And by referring to &quot;mature muscle&quot; repairing itself in this way, is that to say that muscle that isn't fully developed doesn't follow the same process (and so is why it isn't recommended for kids to work out)? Would kids' muscles actually prematurely age with too much exercise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Undergraduate planning on entering aging research here. The hayflick limit is overhyped, <a href="http://www.telomeraseblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hallmarks-of-aging.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> is generally considered to be the main cause of aging (I can describe if you wish)</p>
<p>In terms of boxing, I don't have any papers to hand on it, but it WOULD lead to greater bone strength in the arms as the skeletal structure adjusts (reducing frailty), and greater muscle strength (delaying sarcopenia / weakness). Exercise can only get you so far compared to what advanced medicine may be able to do in 20-30 years, but it's definitely the strongest 'anti-aging' technique that isn't barred behind pre-clinical (and clinical in one case)-trials at this point</p>
<p>edit: I think exercise may also assist in dealing with intracellular aggregates (autophagy) and epigenetic drift, but that's just off the top of my head)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a toxicology class in my biology graduate studies and the professor mentioned, almost in passing, that because metobolisim produces reactive oxygen species (free radicals) that excessive exercise can be detrimental. I'm not sure what he meant by excessive but just sharing a different perspective. Thoughts? Interesting comments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about for drugs like tretinoin which work by encouraging cell turnover? Tretinoin has been a god send for my pizza face (acne) but I have wondered if it might make my skin more susceptible to cancer in the long run. There are people who have been using it for decades because it is the only FDA approved drug for skin aging but I haven't found any data on it affecting telomeres or cancer risk. But I do wonder.</p></div>		</li>
