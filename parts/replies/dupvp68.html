Trillions more is held by American citizens and companies in various forms.    A minority of debt, roughly a third, is held by foreigners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The federal reserve also bought up like 2 trillion dollars of treasury bills during the financial crisis as a part of &quot;Quantitative easing&quot;  the fed is by law required to return any profits to the treasury, so the interest that it earns by holding those t-bills gets returned to the government, effectively making it a zero interest loan that may never need to be paid back (the fed could hold indefinitely)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is taught in school. It's just ignored/forgotten because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's perceived as boring</li>
<li>It's nonintuitive and difficult to grasp</li>
<li>This information has no tangible use to a common high schooler and thus there is no immediate incentive to learn it</li>
<li>Everyone forgets a depressing amount of information learned in school as they become adults anyway</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask your vehicle for purchasing them?</p>
<p>For instance, is it from some .gov website? Did you provide them a credit card, checking account numbers, or something similar?</p>
<p>Or perhaps through a broker, like Schwab, where you wired the funds in and then found a button to buy them through that broker?</p>
<p>To me, the biggest gap between money in a bank (which damn-near everybody knows how to do) and money being properly invested, is literally as simple as not being sure what button to click to put it in the right investment. Help to bridge the gap, perhaps?</p></div>		</li>
