			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm young and can verify this, my dad used to love heavy metal shit and even bought a few vinyl albums of different metal bands for my fifth birthday (they broke) but now, when I put even his old favorite song (A7X, little piece of heaven) on to loud, he yells to turn it down and then comes into my room to read or whatever to the music. Its weird AF sometimes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mild headache, and it goes away pretty quickly once the music is changed. For me, it usually only happens if the music has lots of percussion and is on while I'm trying to multitask, so I get annoyed at the noise that's disrupting my thought process and feel much happier when it's off. It's more of a &quot;there's too much unpleasant noise&quot; thing rather than a &quot;too loud&quot; thing. I do usually feel like turning it down will help, but honestly turning it off is ideal, and changing to a more enjoyable musical genre is a close second.</p>
<p>I think the headache is from subtle muscle tension, which most people get when they're annoyed or stressed. I get pretty annoyed when things interrupt my thoughts over and over again and make me do my work 10x slower, and music does that for me. If it's music I enjoy listening to, the interruption is pleasant rather than stressful, so I don't get a tension headache. If you enjoy all music, it would make sense that you haven't experienced this phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've replied elsewhere but I'll toss you a reply. I don't get headaches but I get almost physically ill. Like an increasing &quot;anxiety&quot; for lack of better words. Unlike what many seem to say in the thread it's for common and predictable music that definitely doesn't need any new definition, or whatever people have named it, to be created for it in my brain.</p>
<p>This is mostly for pop music, all the way from 90's to current. I can recognize it's well produced, that they sing well and all that but it's so boring it makes me nauseous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just about to say the same thing. I never get a headache - I'm young though, so that may change someday if it does come with age - but I get <em>very</em> anxious. I want to physically get away and I can feel some sort of nausea very clearly in my body.</p>
