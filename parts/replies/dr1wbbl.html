<p>So somebody set out to make a better one. I've no idea if I'm right, but I'm gonna guess it was a guy named Phillips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phillips bought the patent, but he didn't invent it. One of the earlier screws was done by P.L. Robertson <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._Robertson?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">(Wiki) </a>. That blurb has the history backwards. </p>
<p>The TLDR is that his earlier, square hole design was far superior to the Phillips, but Robertson made a stupid decision to turn down a joint venture with Henry Ford to have his screws be used exclusively on the Ford assembly line, and Phillips design was propelled into infamy. </p>
<p>We had to learn this in history class, bc Canadian something something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Robertson really screwed up that deal. From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;The Fisher Body company, which made the car bodies for the Ford Motor Company, was one of Robertson's first customers and used over 700 Robertson screws in its Model T car. Henry Ford, after finding that the screw saved him about 2 hours of work for each car, attempted to get an exclusive licence for the use and manufacture of the Robertson screw in the US. He was turned down by Robertson who felt it was not in his best interest and shortly after that, Ford found that Henry F. Phillips had invented another kind of socket screw and had no such reservations. Although the Robertson screw is most popular in Canada, it is used extensively in boat building because it tends not to slip and damage material, it can be used with one hand, and it is much easier to remove/replace after weathering.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The joint venture with Henry Ford consisted of Ford offering Robertson $10,000.00 for the patent. When Robertson refused to sell  Ford said he would make sure that Robertson wouldn't sell a single screw in the U.S. which was true for many decades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Ford was dicking him around and tried to fuck him over right before the deal went through. He told Ford to go fly a kite and mechanics everywhere still curse Ford everytime a Phillips strips.</p>
<p>Seriously though, Robertson's are used almost exclusively in construction. Unless you're one of those nail people, bleh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One part you missed. The Philips head was deliberately invented to automatically limit torque so screws cannot strip out. That's why the ends of the recessed cross are tapered. The relative angles between these and the taper in the screwdriver's cross put a hard limit on the maximum torque that can be applied to the screw. If they didn't want the torque limit feature they could easily not taper the ends of the cross points, just like on a flathead screw. </p></div>		</li>

I typed out that entire post from the top of my head with zero research whatsoever. I did know about the tapered torque-limiting aspect of Philips, but considered it a little beyond the reach of the ELI5.</p></div>		</li>
