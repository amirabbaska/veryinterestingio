			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for your detailed reply! It's something I've always wondered. I had Latin in school (Netherlands) and my teacher pronounced things with what I perceived as a Dutch accent. I was never sure however, since there was no way to check. Seeing how this thread already taught me it's pronounced <em>Yoolyoos Kesar</em>, I can safely say my Latin teacher would have needed some serious voice coaching if he had lived in ancient Rome. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Patriotism. Believe it or not, some Roman poets and orators actually took the time to describe, in great detail, why Latin is sooo much better than what those smelly barbarians speak on the other side of the hills. These diatribes may include descriptions of phonetics.</p>

<p>If you know a lot of Elizabethan slang Shakespeare plays are full of dirty innuendo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny anecdote, but the word &quot;barbarian&quot; is actually a racist roman joke.  They thought the uncivilized languages sounded like people going &quot;bar bar bar bar&quot;.   Barbarian literally means &quot;the bar bar people&quot;.</p>
<p>It would be equivalent to a modern person referring to the chinese as the &quot;ching chong ding dong people&quot;</p>
<p>*edit:  Alright guys, greek, not roman, I hear you.  Excuse me for trusting the etymology dictionary that said &quot;from Old French barbarien, from barbare, or from Latin barbarus&quot;.  No more explanations needed.  ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually predates the Romans - the Greeks coined the word barbarian.  It originally meant anyone who didn't speak classical Greek.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that the Berber people of North Africa were actually named &quot;Berber&quot; by the Greeks for that reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>'οι βαρβαροι (or &quot;Hoi barbaroi&quot;) refers to the barbarians. The joke is the exact same though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Adding to this, we have spelling errors (sometimes from children). In classical Latin, people sometimes wrote &quot;ai&quot; instead of &quot;ae,&quot; but they never wrote &quot;e.&quot; It's similar to how children will sometimes write &quot;r&quot; to mean &quot;our,&quot; which indicates the child doesn't pronounce it like &quot;hour.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that there are people who pronounced r, our, and hour all the same.  It used to be fashionable--there's a recording of a highly-coached young future Queen Elizabeth II who speaks like that.  Nowadays I think it's mostly just in Appalachia.</p></div>		</li>
