			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this:  This is mainly for compressible flows (gas). Most liquid flow is incompressible (like water). When the flow is sped up enough across a tube, it will typically cause a venturi effect that will cause cavitation. This is when the pressure in the flow is so low due to the high speed that the dissolved gasses in the liquid will boil over and turn into tiny bubbles. When this occurs, the bubbles will collapse very, very quickly and the resulting shock wave will damage the pipes they are in (causing fractures on the surface). This is more of a practical limit to high speed liquid though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cavitation can occur outside of contained flow, given sufficient fluid velocity. In the Channeled Scablands, for example, there are very large potholes. The Scablands itself was formed by a glacial outburst flood from Glacial Lake Missoula, right around the end of the Pleistocene. The lake was about 500 cubic miles in volume, and drained very quickly; a ramification of that was high flow velocity. When the water encountered something immobile and resistant to erosion (like a large boulder), it flowed around it forming vorticity within the low pressure zone that it created. This jacked up velocity further, allowing for cavitation that quickly drilled down into the ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, cavitation is a common typical practical limit on speed of liquid through a pipe.</p>
<p>But when you're talking of the science of limits of fluids in a pipe it's wrong to think of liquid as &quot;incompressible&quot;, water or otherwise. All liquids are compressible, it's just a manner of using more pressure to change the density. In run-of-the-mill engineering pumps cavitation is your limiting factor. But it's trivial to design some kind of pipe that renders cavitation impossible -- if you start with sufficiently pressurized liquid the pressure drop required to change phase will be above the limit of supersonic flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going into the impractical range of things, you could use a superfluid with zero viscosity and drive the flow with something other than a pressure gradient and get the fluid going very fast.</p>
<p>You can also use explosives to drive the flow exceptionally fast.  You could use a nuke to drive it even faster, creating perhaps the fastest moving man made object.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob#Propulsion_of_steel_plate_cap" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbbob#Propulsion_of_steel_plate_cap</a>.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if someone just had the wise idea of tapping into that brine tank's 6&quot; line in that cereal factory in order to supply a half inch line to that corn flake line and their idea was to just let the existing main supply pump supply the 1/2 inch line. Not so trivial when that 1/2 line blows open and spews brine all over you corn flakes and shuts down the line huh pal? Seriously kudos to /u/nittyb for further enlightening me.
Not me BTW.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inside the power house of a large hydroelectric power plant there's deafening noise due to cavitation. I've been inside the runner of a 180 MW turbine that was stopped for maintenance once and one could see pits caused by cavitation on the turbine blades. In the hydroelectric turbine cavitation is particularly bad because the pressure drops very suddenly as the water flows through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Similarly, this is a big issue with the propellers on boats and ships!</p>
<p>Fun fact: the opposite is a problem in steam generation turbines! When the turbine allows too much expansion of the steam, it hits it's phase line and condenses to water and the little droplets destroy the spinning blades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure relief valves and restriction orifices are often, but not always, sized such that supersonic velocity is reached by the fluid flowing through it. The practical reason is to limit the amount of fluid discharging into the downstream system (e.g. flare header in an oil and gas plant). Not really a 'use' for a supersonic fluid per se but example of where you may want a fluid to reach supersonic velocity.</p></div>		</li>
