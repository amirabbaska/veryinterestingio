<p>I was basing it on how Western Europe had institutions such as the Catholic Church, well established monarchies, and city-states while North America had tribes living in what were essentially huts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aside from Catholicism specifically this could all be said of South America. North American had cities like Cahokia, and further North in the Arctic Circle such cities wouldn't have been very practical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cahokia never came close to the metropolises of Europe. Social forms and edifices generally become more complex as population concentrates.</p>
<p>Europe also possessed superior record keeping (written vs oral), metallurgy, agricultural techniques, masonry etc.</p>
<p>This isn't a disparagement of North American cultures. Fact is they lacked the population density and resources to make the leaps that Eurasia did. </p>
<p>There are a variety of arguments, including plant and animal life not being conducive to supporting cahokias (there's strong evidence that it rose and fell several times due to disease, famine or natural disaster), geography inhibiting the spread of technologies and even cultural reasons akin to the stagnation of the nile valley in the 3rd millennium bce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Iroquois Confederacy was established some time in the 1100s. I Would recommend looking into it. </p>
<p>&quot;Tribe&quot; is a pretty meaningless concept. It's been used to refer to everything from small, interrelated groups of hunter-gatherers to large and successful civilizations. </p>
<p>Also considering the average living conditions in most of europe during the colonial period...one or two room huts is a fairly good way to describe it.  The buildings from that period you see today are the ones that survived, and were generally better built structures owned by the aristocracy. Little houses made out of wood, stacked stone and thatch tend to not survive the centuries   </p></div>		</li>
