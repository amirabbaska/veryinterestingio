			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size. The heat is generated through adiabatic compression if the air directly in front of the object. The mass of which is determined by the size of the object. You need both enough mass and temperature to have enough heat to ignite an object. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. You can actually pick up a lot of meteorites with your bare hands after they fall to the ground (my physics teacher joked this was why you should carry a plastic baggie everywhere, so you could just pick one up and plop it in).</p>
<p>The reason is that smaller objects will be slowed down to terminal velocity by the atmosphere, at which point the air will cool them rather than heat them. Imagine dropping a steak out of a plane; it won't be hot, it will be cold. Same thing, basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you could answer his but can this spontaneous combination caused by decomposing matter be the culprit in the whole spontaneous human combustion? Like the person died of natural causes but after rotting there for awhile the mold caused heat that ignited something?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can it? Sure, if the environment is just right. </p>
<p>Is this a plausible explanation for most cases of spontaneous combustion? Absolutely not. This is not something that happens easily.</p>
<p>You have to have a really oxygen rich environment for the bacteria to break down a body fast enough to get that hot enough to combustion flesh or fat. </p>
<p>Commercial composting facilities have this issue, where it gets hot enough to kill bacteria and start a fire. The reason for this is because they stir their pile consistently, introducing new oxygen etc. There are tons of cases where someone has left an earthmover parked on the pile and the tire catches fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all &quot;spontaneous human combustion&quot; is actually caused by an external fire source (often a cigarette, candle, fireplace, or something similar) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wick_effect" target="_blank">wick effect</a>.</p>
<p>A decomposing body is unlikely to generate enough heat to spontaneously combust for the reasons that /u/sparhawk noted.</p></div>		</li>
