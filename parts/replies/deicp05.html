			<div class="markdown"><p>You may know this but for those that don't, the &quot;camera obscura&quot; is the fundamental base of how photography works. You have light moving through a small hole (aperture) in a dark box, that light then flips around and is displayed on the other end of the box recreating the scene infront if you just mirrored and upside down (just like your eye). </p>
<p>Every single camera works exactly like this. The only thing that is different is that we put some glass infront of that aperture (the lens) to modify the FOV, and then we put film or a digital sensor at the other end of that &quot;dark box&quot; to record the information. </p>
<p>When this all clicked for me it was just a marvelous moment. It simultaneously removed some of the magic of photography, and yet filled it with even more wonder. </p>
<p>Abelardo Morell is a Cuban immigrant photographer based in the United States that uses this whole idea of Camera Obscura and takes it to a whole new level. He travels around the world staying in hotel rooms or houses with the best views, blacks out the room, pokes a hole in the blinds, and then sets up a large format camera to record an image for hours. </p>
<p>At the end you see the outside projected into the walls of the room, except flipped and mirrored of course, and it's brilliant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>great comment! </p>
<p>i just wanted to add, &quot;camera obscura&quot; is latin for dark (obscura) room (camera), since a camera is basically a dark room with a lens on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can tell from 'obscura' that those who described the Latin language saw 'dark' as their perception of, &quot;not seeing,&quot; instead of a projection of darkness that lacks light. It's a more visceral reaction of how you wake up in darkness and adjust to your first response.<br />
A camera with a lens is totally different and I believe there is an old art style that studied use of the lens. The evolution of this train of thinking is shown in this history.<br />
Therefore, a dark room appears filled with light from a limited perspective. Kind of the opposite of what our eyes do. Pupils, as the aperture, expand to allow in more light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also better tools and materials. not having to mix your own paint, instead being able to buy it and know it'll be consistently good. and just as building techniques have improved through the years so have painting techniques. We have a much better understanding of how light and the human eye work. more free time to practice, and then you have to consider the tastes of the people at the time. photorealistic paintings are a fairly recent trend in art. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the history on them but there's a lot to charcoal art tools and what's available today is incredible. You'll use 3-5 different erasers alone. Different blending tools made from all kinds of different materials and sticks/pencils in any shade, thickness and hardness. They can all be easily sharpened to many different angles which makes a big difference on how the artist puts to medium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>undoubtedly the camera has had a major effect on photorealism, but photorealism as an artistic movement began in the 1960s almost a century after the first film camera was put on the market. As has been stated elsewhere in the comments, the camera obscura goes back to the 16th or 17th century, and variations on the pinhole camera predate christ.</p>
<p>yes, graphite is just graphite. but in the last few decades of the renaissance someone slapped it between a couple bits of wood and called it a pencil. I would call that an advance in the technology of graphite as an artist's tool.</p>
<p>What about paper? paper came to Europe in the 11th or 12th century, but it was relatively expensive up until the industrial era. </p>
<p>The industrial era also brought machine-consistency to paints, brushes, canvas, somewhere in there the eraser came along, the ball point pen, more consistent inks, improvements in mining and chemistry have brought a wider variety of colors. There's very few trades or crafts that haven't had improvements over the last <strong>500 YEARS</strong> how many painters do you know are still mixing pigments with egg yolks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna piggy back on this to add that most renaissance paintings were completed by multiple people. You can look at a &quot;Raphael original&quot; but chances are that his students did a lot of the leg work. Also the goal of renaissance paintings was not to be photorealistic but hyperealistic which is to say they are exaggerating a lot. They make clothes look wet and their figures are often superimposed onto a background that is compositionally emphasizing perspective lines. Look at Raphael's &quot;School of Athens,&quot; it really is just a bunch of figures pasted into a background that was composed to show off his knowledge of perspective. </p>
