			<div class="markdown"><p>As an automotive engineer who has seen what you are describing in great detail I just wanted to clarify a bit.  Most companies today could probably automate half the hourly jobs currently done by people, and probably 90% within a decade, but there are some headwinds.  A big one is most companies are very short sighted, wanting to make the shareholders happy quarter to quarter, so spending billions on implementing robotic solutions, even though long term would generate enormous economic benefit for the company, would cause a &quot;bad&quot; year or two, so the process is very slow.  Also most car companies don't fire people once their jobs become obsolete, they simply don't replace the manpower lost through attrition, mainly from a PR perspective because it would be a nightmare otherwise.</p>
<p>Also the whole design process has become far more automated than it used to be, but unless some of the other companies are hiding something, it's not quite as automated as described.  People still make clay models, mainly because some higher ups are convinced they're needed.  People still review the market analysis, the concepts are nearly all human generated, and while the actual structural design is highly automated, it's almost an art making that into a vehicle you can actually build and that drives.  Every part comes out just a bit different in reality than in concept, and to actually make them fit many parts are altered during the prototype phase.  I'm sure as time goes on computers will be able to predict this, but even now from a manpower perspective, other than what's required for normal production, launching a new vehicle is the most costly endeavor car companies undergo.</p>
<p>And I'm not disillusioned to think that even as an engineer my job is safe forever, and I do think as a society we are getting ready to fail the upcoming robotic revolution unless we can start thinking more &quot;big picture&quot;, I just wanted to point these things out.  Automation in large part inevitable, and maybe one of the major car companies will tell their investors &quot;look we're going to have a slow year or two and after that we are going to destroy the competition because they're taking it slow&quot; and then everyone will follow suit, but from what I've seen even when the companies tend to be 10-20 years behind the tech availability before embracing it fully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To fully automate a design for manufacture job.. I'd say we are years off. Years. Granted, elements of design are becoming more and more computer assisted. But for a computer system to spit out a fully manufacturable, car? No way. </p>
<p>Even the most high end 3D printers we have at work require a team of people to operate them. The system can't even work out the best orientation of components to place built supports onto them. </p>
<p>Another printing system we use requires parts to be washed manually afterwards, as it uses wax to support the parts. 3D systems don't even provide an automated solution for that part of the process... </p>
<p>I design, sculpt, create miniatures for manufacture, in injection molded plastic. My job requires me to know a hell of a lot, from subject matter, IP, artistic design choices regarding composition, narrative etc... I then need to work out how the sculpt/design I create breaks down into kit components, all with size restrictions to fit within pre determined packaging.. And all the parts need to be moldable in a 2 part injection mold. Believe me, we are decades away from a computer system getting even close to what I'm expected to do, with better results than what I can produce. Auto sculpt in Z Brush? Auto process sculpture for manufacture? Yea, right... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there at least some art to designing a car? Sure, maybe not your average computer but certain nice cars have a passion and look about them that only seems to come from sort of artistic expression. This would be extremely hard to capture and duplicate (not impossible but no where near feasible now). Maybe I'm nostalgic and love cars too much but I think there is some value that will always be associated with artistic design at least for the foreseeable future.

</blockquote>
<p>Artistic expression isn't really pulling something out of nothing, its using elements in new ways that we can't easily classify and generalize.  The problem is that not only can machine learning do that, <em>thats how machine learning works</em>.  Algorithms find combinations that external viewers can't exactly even say why the algorithm did that or how it works.</p>
<p>The result is that machine learning is already being used to produce artistic content, such as music and drawings.</p>
<p>Producing a new design for a car with interesting artistic qualities isn't unreachable for machine learning algorithms, its simply a matter of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most auto companies have a &quot;theme&quot; that carries across all their products, cars and SUVs alike, that typically carries from generation to the next with some changes.  The actual designing what the car looks like is typically very artistic, though sometimes some functional requirement like aerodynamics or handling will dictate a specific form.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the biggest problems for adoption right now is that nobody really wants to go first. Jumping into first generation automation is a great way to go bankrupt. </p>
<p>Also a lot of people have a sort of hyperbolic future perfect vision of robots based on moore's law, which pretty much died a decade ago when dennard scaling failed.</p>

<p>The aging population doesn't have time, money, or inclination to get those skills, which has made unemployment so much of a contentious issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a big part of this issue that I see get glossed over too often. I think it was from 2001-2008 that the county I live in lost something like 5,000 manufacturing jobs. That was just in one county. The neighboring counties also experienced job loss. The one next to me peaked at 18% unemployment if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>It's not as easy as, &quot;Well, go back to school.&quot; The industry that was lost was woven into the fabric of the community because it had been there for decades. It wasn't just like, &quot;Dad lost his job today.&quot; You had entire families, across multiple generations lose their jobs. It was even worse if they happened to work in the same exact place. </p>
<p>They're left trying to figure out what to do next. The obvious choice is to go find work, but there's not much else here besides the industry that's bleeding thousands of jobs. Well, there is fast food and Walmart where they'll be lucky to make half of what they used to. Now you can only find jobs that pay less, and you have to somehow figure out how to support your family. Good luck also trying to figure out how to fit going to college in there. </p>
<p>It's such a mess. There's no real simple solution to it either. Even if the industry did come back, it'll probably have less jobs available due to automation. Then they'll just end up back in the same situation eventually anyway. I don't think we can fight automation. We have to figure out how we're going to live with it. That's something we're going to have to deal with a lot sooner than some people realize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to piggyback on this and add that you and and the poster above you are describing the problem very well, but when we're talking about the future, the limits you guys imply the problem has, begin to disappear. Even the jobs that are left that you guys describe, from fast food to super technical jobs have nothing about them that makes them automation proof. OP alluded to this by saying that one of the things you might be doing is designing better robots, but there is no reason to think we won't see a future where robots are designing the robots. Although he takes the contexts to things far scarier than 100% unemployment, I highly recommend listening to the things that Sam Harris has been warning about with the risks involved in creating AI. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree, really nothing is future proof. Maybe, maybe the service industry, people may want to have other humans doing things for them just for the &quot;organic&quot; feeling. That sort of sentiment has helped fuel stuff like the return of smaller scale farming.  On the other hand, a convincing android with a good personality and better skills than a person may do just fine for 95% of us. I love a good farmer's market but I'll go to the supermarket 19 times out of 20 for sheer convenience and price.</p>
<p>These systems are concerning, but do you think anyone can convince the human race not to build better AI systems? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! I would like to add, humans really need to spend a lot more time reconsidering economics. The basic income idea won't work for many many reasons. There are interesting blockchain based ideas like steemit that pay out money for content. That just one example but the idea of a digital self perpetuating organism that pays people to secure it is interesting. </p>
<p>Money is important because it gives feedback to the scarcity of resources. Meaning things need to get more expensive the rarer they are or they will be used up. Like blue fin tuna needs to go up in price or it gets fished to extingshen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who ends up with all that wealth? The Swiss and Finland have already projected this problem and are considering paying their citizens a monthly stipend. The fact is we've built time and labor saving machines that can do the work of thousands of humans, but the people that work are working more than ever and falling farther behind and deeper into debt. The wealth is so concentrated right now, but ideology makes it impossible to get it out and circulating in the economy. Either tax it or even tax not spending money at a certain wealth level. I would even support using luxury purchases as tax deductible just to get some people to get off their giant piles of money and inject it back into the economy, other than as a loan that ends up making their pile even bigger.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make some good points, but I think you overestimate current engineering as a whole.  Yes there are programs to calculate aerodynamics, stress, design patterns, etc.  These programs do no do as much as you think they do.  Solid works is an amazing program, but it gets those stress calculations SO wrong.  I'm a month into a semester of CAE (computer aided engineering) and the program can mess up a calculation of what happens when you pull on a piece of metal with a hole in it.  Something that simple, and 99.99% of the time, the computer is wrong.  It may get in the ballpark and tell the engineer where they need to look for areas that will cause problems, but in no way can those programs just design a car and 3D print it in one go.  Those calculations also take a huge amount of ram and processing power.  Something a simple as an L bracket (think a curtain rod support or something similar) took 7 minutes to spit out an answer.  These applications take a team of engineers hundreds of hours of fine tuning and manual calculations to design something as complex as a car.</p>
<p>Also, assembly lines are extremely complicated to set up.  There are entire companies that specialize in the different parts.  Pushing a car concept for a new car to an existing assembly line would likely be impossible.  Unless you are making a nearly identical version of the car that was previously made on that assembly line, then everything would have to be redesigned.  I'm sure at some point in the future this will be possible, but the idea of robots building themselves like that is still a long way off in the future.</p>
<p>I also am, ironically enough going to school for mechanical engineering with the intention to work with the job stealing robots.</p>
<p>Tl;dr:  Robots are able to do a large portion of manufacturing work, but they really do not do everything.  Yes we have amazing processing capabilities, but they are no where near as complex as you suggest with your completely automated car design idea.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently I'm underestimating CAE, thanks for making me have an existential crisis about even having a job now.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to break the news to you, but you're several years behind on what's happening in engineering. Even though OP's explanation regarding the car is simplified and not accurate, he's closer to the truth than you are.
We're starting to have the computational power to do exactly that: Automating the design of a car. You feed extremely complex optimization system with a set of target values, like range, passenger capacity and so on and the optimiser will spit out a feasible design for the task.
The system then goes on to start structural design, optimising in regard to for example stress exposure and cost - at the same time. The list goes on.</p>
<p>This is happening right now. I can only speak for the aerospace industry, but take Airbus, they have successfully automated the design of a large military UAV. It was only a feasibility study, since the computational effort is insane, but they have the capability to do so.</p>
<p>Being a mechanical engineer will no longer be a guarantee to get a job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the issue is that humans typically are very bad at recognizing accelerating changes. I attribute the machine learning progress in the last 10-20 years to these factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The breakthrough in the neural network field with the backpropagation learning that broke the decades-long standstill in the AI and neural net fields</li>
<li>Vast increases in computational power made it feasible to actually try more ideas and approaches in less time, thus delivering results faster</li>
<li>The internet made the exchange of ideas a million times easier and faster to accomplish &amp; significantly easier to get access to existing research, further drastically accelerating development</li>
<li>As another result from (3), easy access to existing software development libraries makes it easy even for people not well-versed into AI to incorporate AI functionality into their software (see for example all those people doing experiments with Deep Dream)</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this is why AI in the 80's and 90's was considered a disappointment, but nowadays seemingly out of nowhere we got stuff like PatchMatch, facial recognition, speech recognition, Roombas, DeepMind, IBM's Watson, self-driving cars, the bots from Boston Dynamics etc.</p>
<p>And we are bad at recognizing the accelerating development because humans generally are bad at perceiving non-linear things. We tend to think in linear terms, which is also why for example exponential growth is often so surprising and unintuive to us. For example, thought experiments about how the entire galaxy could be colonized in just a million years or so by using Von Neumann probes tends not be believed, because the galaxy is so large, and a million years isn't long in astronomical terms etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The big revolution in engineering already happened and that was CAD in general. Being able to revise a document in 20 minutes without a draughting team was a much bigger deal.</p>
<p>And guess what, it didn't put engineers out of work, it made MORE engineering work available by vastly lowering the cost.</p>
<p>The fundamental lesson of past automation is you can't assume the current structure of the economy if you fundamentally change the cost structure since the current way things are done is based on current costs.</p></div>		</li>

For example, a neural network was told to design an electric circuit that behaved in the specified way. It produced a working result, but engineers could initially not tell how the circuit worked, since it made use of effects which are usually intentionally avoided and then neglected.
Engineers are still needed to understand and document new solutions in such a way that they can be integrated into the automated design software.</p></div>		</li>
