			<div class="markdown"><p>We work with the Eastern Oyster, Crassostrea virginica, which is the native oyster species. At the time of Henry Hudson (early 1600s), itâ€™s estimated there were reefs of this species covering ~220,000 acres of the NY Harbor (making it one of the largest oyster populations in the world at the time!). Currently, this population is functionally extinct, and while we do find some wild oysters in the area, there are no longer enough to form the large reefs the region once hosted. Currently, oyster (and shellfish) recruitment is very low (and rare in some places), so we are not currently seeing much competition from other oyster species. However, over time, it will definitely be something to look out for.</p></div>		</li>
