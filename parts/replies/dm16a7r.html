			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. They're pretty simple to install as well. Though now I have a power cord running out of my A/C cabinet because there's no outlet in there and I've been too lazy to pull a permit to install one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure the evaporator drain isn't clogged. Spray cleaner down the intake near wiper blades and wash out with a hose. Then change your cabin air filter. When using A/C, turn it off while leaving the blower fan still running for the last few minutes of your ride to lessen future mildew issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is.  After many years driving cars with smelly AC and trying all sorts of products to fix it - this works.  On a warm day, and with the engine hot, do the following at the end of your drive.
1) Switch the AC on, fan on full, recirculate the air (rather than letting the system take fresh air from outside), turn the temperature setting to HOTTEST, open all the dash vents, then
2) close all the doors and windows and, after stepping out the car, leave the engine running in neutral and with the parking brake on, with AC at the settings in 1) for five minutes.</p>
<p>The hot air circulating through the AC system kills all the mold in the system and removes the smell.  Once the five minutes are up switch the engine off and it is done.</p>
<p>For legal reasons, (in the UK at least) do this on private land, not the public highway.</p>
<p>If it does not fix it try changing the cabin air filter on the AC system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a persistent problem, then yes, on a warm day will probably be most effective. You can also do this throughout the winter as your driving, as a general upkeep type of thing, with the added bonus of keeping the inside windows from fogging up or clearing them up in the morning. You don't have to do it all the time. It'd probably be best just to stick to doing it as you are defrosting the car in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the car I suppose, but on mine every time it smells it's the cabin air filter getting moldy, buy a new one (like $10 at autozone) and replace it. On my car it's a 2 minute job and the only tool needed is a quarter to open up the slot.</p></div>		</li>
