			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this point; <strong>because</strong> they grew after everyone had cars, these cities often sprawl across very large physical areas.  Even the city core is not very dense for a city like Atlanta, for example.  So mass transit isn't as practical, because you'd need hundreds of stops spanning dozens of miles.  In an older, denser city (New York, for example), you can build one stop and serve thousands of people.  That makes it much more cost efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, LA isn't really a city so much as the world's biggest suburb. Yes, there's a proper city with a downtown core and skyscrapers and all that, but most of LA is just an endless suburb.</p></div>		</li>
