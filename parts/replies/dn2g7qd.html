			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Also, the spherical shape on the ends and the roundness of the tank helps during transport. With the liquid sloshing around inside, the spherical ends and sides help move the momentum in different directions other than back and forth. Another reason, depending on the type of liquid, for example food grade liquid, there can't be any corners for sanitary reasons. (I'm a professional driver for food grade liquid freight)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine it must suck to clean those out. My assumption is you would use a high heat power washer in the tank. Being in a hot steamy tank sounds claustrophobic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tanks are cleaned using high pressure pumps pushing the cleaning solutions through a tank spinner. You only go inside a tank if there is residue that remains and needs scraping or other hand cleaning to remove. Entering a tank is a confined space entry that requires several safety precautions. </p>
<p>Here is a video of how spinners work.  <a href="https://vimeo.com/146533841" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/146533841</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most places I go stick a washing wand into the manhole in top. Then it goes through a wash cycle. Basically, there's different steps like a regular washing machine. </p>
<p>I know a couple of milk haulers that still wash the inside of the tanks by hand. Not just the little ones either. 9,000 gallon tanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And again, the rules are different for food.
For non-food liquids-like irrigation water, or gasoline, yes there are baffles.</p>
<p>For food the &quot;no corners&quot; rule takes precedence, thus needing an extra careful driver to make up for the lack of mechanical safetys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for food-grade liquids like milk.  The baffles would create impossible-to-clean areas which would be unsanitary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the requester's intuition: a rectangular container will fill the most volume, if you are limited to a certain length, width, and height, but a cylinder will hold the most volume if you are limit only one dimension, and are using the same amount of &quot;container&quot; material (steel or whatever you are using).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physical size is not generally the limit on these trailers, it's the weight. There's a hard limit on how heavy a tractor trailer can be. A lot of them are not full in volume if they are carrying a heavy liquid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see! I was trying to get at the assumptions behind why someone might think that a rectangular solid would hold more volume than a cylinder, and that led me to think of them imagining a certain size rectangular solid in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
