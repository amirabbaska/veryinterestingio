			<div class="markdown"><p>I have enough for a ~15% deposit for the type of house I want without touching my emergency fund but as a student I can't get a mortgage - even though I've paid minimum £5k rent every year for the past 4 years. Banks are ridiculous - could have paid a healthy chunk of a mortgage off with that but nope just wasted £22k with nothing to show for it and have to rent for another two years minimum because I won't even get a quote until I've worked for a year. They don't want us to own houses with such a booming student, and even adult in commuter towns, rental market. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it sounds counter intuative, but renting really isn't 'wasted money'. For that payment you have recieved a service, a roof over your head and (assuming a semi-decent landlord) all repairs and improvements paid for.</p>
<p>Owning a house is great, but when you have just moved in and worst case scenario say, the boiler explodes, the windows are nowhere near as good as you thought and all need replacing (~25k) and floor joists are rotting, then you'd wish you were still renting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence why surveryors are worth every penny  you spend on them. If the boiler is goign to blow and the widnows are crap that only adds to your negotiating position when buying the property and you can drive the price down. Budget for replacing them over the next few years and you end up increasing your house price. If you buy in March thats 6 months of time you have to save money to replace stuff in time for winter. It's harder and more tactical and soemtimes money will be wasted on dodging bullets but the other option is to continue making someone else rich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please don't laugh at me for my ineptitude at all things mathematic  but I'm still a bit confused. I only earn around £18k, I'm a single parent and I have (am due to inherit) about £35k in the next few months. </p>
<p>I didn't think that was possible for me to get onto the housing ladder because my earnings were too low? </p>
<p>In your opinion, would it be worth consulting a financial advisor to see if it would be possible for me to try and get a mortgage? </p>
<p>I'm legitimately rubbish at anything that involves maths and I'm honestly not stupid but when it comes to maths I probably am and I really don't understand who to talk to or ask advice from to get something impartial that would help me know what to do for the best. </p>
<p>I'd hope to get on the housing ladder one day so that I have something to leave behind for my 2 little kids but I find it really confusing.</p>
<p>I'd be so grateful if you have any advice to offer me! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies for typing/spelling errors, I'm on mobile.</p>
<p>I would ring one of the high street banks yourself. Probably start with whoever your current account is with. </p>
<p>IFA's often charge the customer AND the bank but they only have to disclose it in the paperwork if it's more than £350.
Building societies (Yorkshire, nationwide, Coventry, Leeds etc) generally have tighter criteria, but your big banks (Natwest, hsbc, halifax) are likely to be able to help. </p>
<p>When you call, be relaxed, it's just a normal person on the end of the phone, a lot of people are really nervous and stressed but on the initial call there's no need to be. </p>
<p>You'll be asked:
<em>your annual basic salary (before overtime etc),
</em>overtime (If you did this, best advice is to have 6m payslips)
<em>benefits (amount, frequency, type e.g. child tax credits). Not all lenders will use this
</em>age of the 2 kids
<em>credit card balances
</em>mail orders (very.co.uk  ao.com  next directory  etc)
<em>loans
</em>car finance
<em>overdraft details
</em>maintenance you pay out (if any)
<em>maintenance  you get in (if any)
</em>details of anything else you can not / will not give up (like if you've underpaid tax, been overpaid in benefits etc)</p>
<p>If the agent you speak to doesn't ask about something that you feel they should (or is on that list) volunteer it. </p>
<p>Mortgage advisors are very strictly regulated and the calls are all recorded, so they'll be upfront and give with you honest info. We don't get commission so it's not worth it to fudge anything or stretch the truth. My office will regularly tell people that meet our criteria that they're better off with another lender if it's the right thing to do (line if they need a specialist mortgage we don't have)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It very much depends where you live. Up north you can get a three bed terrace for <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-59065078.html" target="_blank">£85,000</a> down south you can nearly <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-59366350.html" target="_blank">double that </a></p>
<p>Have a look at what prices are where you live and if you think you're close pop into your bank rather than asking a financial adviser, or make a post over on r/ukpersonalfinance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best thing to do is go to a mortgage advisor on your local high street. They can take you through what you can get, and how much it'll cost. It's always free, and you'll know for sure what that bank can offer. (go to a few!) </p>
<p>The Internet can be great for general advice, but to know about your specific situation go to a professional! </p></div>		</li>

<p>House prices are a national obsession we talk about constantly. Most Millennials will never be able to afford a house at the current rate, certainly without buying with a partner and bank of Mum and Dad.</p>
