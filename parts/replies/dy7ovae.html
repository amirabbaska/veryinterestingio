			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are mostly correct. In our best understanding electrons can be describe within quantum field theory. In that picture an electron is just an excited state in the electron field just like a photon is an excited state in the electromagnetic field. The spatial distribution of this state can then be interpreted with what we think of in the particle picture as the probability of an electron being there.</p>
<p>This fact helps explain why the sphere model can be very deceiving as the excitation in the electron field has no minimum &quot;size&quot; similar to what you would picture when thinking of an electron as a ball. Having said that, even though the particle picture is in some sense less fundamental, it can still be quite useful. In many cases thinking of an electron as a well defined particle can be sufficient and far more convenient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably not the most satisfying answer, but it is because electrons interact with the Higgs field. This interaction is then responsible for the rest mass of the electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are quantized particles. The many-electron wavefunction cam behave a little bit like a density (and there is an associated quantity called the electron density). However, an N-electron wavefunction is a 3^N dimensional function, not a 3-dimensional function like the electron density is. The extra degrees of freedom are necessary to properly express quantization of the particles and associated behavior, such as Pauli Exclusion.</p>
<p>With regards to OP’s question, discussing the point-like nature of electrons, there is some complexity at play. Many discussions of electrons will focus on the wave function, which does have a physical extent and does correlate to the probability of finding an electron at any particular location. Indeed, seeing as most physical theories treat the electron as a point particle, the extent of the wave function is one of the only physical “sizes” of the electron that make sense to discuss.</p>
<p>However, the point-like nature of the electron can be made more clear by examining the proton. Like the electron, the proton has a wave function. However, the proton is not a fundamental particle and has a radius of ~1 fm. Many physical treatments of protons focus on this wave function, which can be larger than the proton. This treatment is valid in those circumstances. However, in situations where the characteristic distance is less than the size of a proton, or when the characteristic energy is more than the binding energy of the proton, interactions between the individual quarks must also be considered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure how you're counting &quot;dimensions,&quot; but I know that Pauli Exclusion derives from the spin properties of a fermion. So, if you're counting spin as one of those &quot;dimensions,&quot; then your multielectron wavefunction would have to be higher than 3^(N)-dimensional to account for Pauli Exclusion. </p>
<p>Perhaps, are you referring to the coulomb and exchange energies, which will indeed vary based on 3^(N) dimensions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, if you treat spin as a &quot;dimension&quot; you would need 4^N of those.</p>
<p>I was simply referring to the form of the multi-electron wavefunction commonly given in textbooks, PSI(x<em><em>1</em></em>, x<em><em>2</em></em>, x<em><em>3</em></em>, ..., x<em><em>N</em></em>).</p>
<p>My point is just that electrons are more than the local charge probability. It isn’t a scalar field, like the coulomb potential is.</p></div>		</li>
