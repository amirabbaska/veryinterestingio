			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really great explanation thanks for posting! Can I ask a couple of follow up questions; as a neuroscientist and a self confessed beer fan, I'm intrigued to hear your thoughts on the impact of alcohol on the brain in terms of health? Should we all be stone cold sober all the time for optimum brain health ? Does moderate drinking have any affects on brain health? Does it matter what kind of alcohol we consume i.e. Wine or spirits etc ? Sorry just really interested as I'm actually contemplating giving up for good. No real reason, I'm not a bad drunk and it doesn't impact my life much, just feel I've drank for so many years maybe it'd be beneficial to stop ! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably. But there are certainly arguments the other way. There are a few studies that have shown that one or two drinks a day are associated with lower risks of Alzheimer's disease. But above that, you get worsened risk of all sorts of diseases. So it's a pretty fine line (i.e. one drink a day might be good, but three is def. bad).</p>

<p>Again, my understanding is the evidence is mixed. The red wine brigade has certainly got less noisy over the years. But I suspect that is probably the best, then beer/white wine, then spirits. But I'm not aware of a study that has systematically looked into this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks for taking the time to respond. I'm from the UK and my specific demographic tend to not drink much if at all during the week, and then go crazy at the weekends which I know is definitely not good. I'm a red wine drinker myself, and I had read about some of the potential benefits, but I think I'll just give up drinking completely. </p>
<p>Thanks again :)! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to have worse hangovers than most people my age.  So I think this answers the question about the general feeling of discomfort, what about the splitting headache, nausea, and bile that I vomit up all day after drinking too much?  That's surely not just a neurotransmitter problem, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always got some comments and laughs from mates on my terrible hangovers.</p>
<p>As it turns out, most people have an &quot;auto-off&quot; switch to drinking when they get drunk, even big daily drinkers. They get to a quite pissed point, but then naturally drink at a rate to just sit there.</p>
<p>I dont have this, and just drink at a faster and faster rate as the night goes on. not noticable to me or anyone else, as we all had drinks in our hands, and were going to the bar or esky regularly.</p>
<p>But this was the reason for my comically bad hangovers.</p></div>		</li>
