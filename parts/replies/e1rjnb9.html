			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of it, and the other part is that the very process of digestion creates heat that then has to be dissipated by your body. So when your body is trying to generate less internal heat (b/c it's hard to get rid of it when your environment is hot) is counterproductive to eat and digest food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is well known phenomenon. Hot food or drinks for that matter cause you to sweat more and as result your body feels cooled down. This by the way doesn't work in conditions where environment prevents efficient sweat evaporation, for example when humidity is high. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sends a signal to your brain to cool you down. Most don't find it as quenching so they drink cold liquids. Drinking something cold when it's hot feels good but your body has to warm it to digest it and it will wind up counterproductive to a degree. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy in water as heat is 4.1J/cc/°C.</p>
<p>Energy required to evaporate water is (IIRC) 2,200J/cc. </p>
<p>Basically it doesn't matter what temperature you consume, you lose more energy as sweat. </p>
<p>Edit: Natch. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When it’s already warm we aren’t using so many calories.</p>

<p>I don't think this is correct, or at least I've seen people claim (<a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/526014-does-your-body-burn-more-calories-if-you-are-hot-or-if-you-are-cold/" target="_blank">here</a> for instance) that the extra calories you burn in cold vs hot temperatures are completely negligible until it's so cold that you start shivering. </p></div>		</li>
