This is just one example, there can be other ways like you being infinitely small or sphere being infinitely large, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The observable universe has a shape, and not simply in a metaphorical sense. But the universe itself I would agree doesn't have a defined 'shape' to its volume. It's 'everywhere' and has no exterior as far as we know. </p>
<p>That being said, there are descriptions of shape with respect to local geometry and topology. But I believe those are more mathematical in nature and shouldn't be thought of describing a 'picture of the universe from outside'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those local observations do give us a picture of what it looks like from the outside, which isn't an esoteric concept anyway (you can model the outside as a 4-space our universe is embedded in). The thing is, they only give us the big picture if we average those local observations across the entire universe.</p>
<p>At least from what we can observe (the observable universe), our measurements suggest space is on average flat.</p>
<p>Most statements in physics, at least explanatory ones, are of a mathematical nature. Modern physics is literally built around mathematical models. That doesn't mean you have to do it mathematically, but any other formal model you use is going to be equivalent to the mathematical ones anyway (if those models actually accurately describe the universe). With your attitude, we might as well say all attempts to explain quantum phenomena are just mathematical formalisms with no tie to metaphysical reality. That may very well be true, but it doesn't change the fact that those formalisms allow us to actually manipulate our physical reality in ways we were unable to before we had them (ie, you wouldn't be on Reddit right now if they didn't because Reddit and your computer or other internet connected device would not exist).</p>
<p>The mathematical models help us make sense of our reality in the way that is most natural to us (since we find math intuitive). That doesn't mean they are 1-to-1 with the ontological universe, or even the only useful model. They are just the models we have created and found useful.</p>
<p>So no, the fact that our formal modeling of space is purely mathematical and our observations supporting those models are only local does not mean they should be taken with as grain of salt. Because with that attitude, every scientific statement should be taken with a grain of salt (it too is built around a formal model and only finite, local observations), and clearly that is completely absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I guess my reason for asking is: what to make of the idea of the universe as constituted by matter that expands? That is, the idea of a infinite universe seems more intuitive than one with a shape (i think..). But the idea of matter expanding doesn't seem intuitive at all - it seems to imply an unspecified cause or context (eg the universe having an overall shape). Am i making any sense? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a shape but not in the way you think.</p>
<p>If the universe is flat it is infinite in all directions at the instance of the big bang and now, it can still expand and get bigger.</p>
<p>What does flat mean? Flat geometry. This means two parallel lines stay parallel.</p>
<p>The universe could also be closed geometry where two parallel lines converge, or open wherein they diverge.</p>
<p>All evidence shows the universe is likely flat. However you would need an object infinitely large to say for sure if the universe was flat. You can measure known large objects to tell the universe is flat, but if it's closed it needs to be at least x times size of universe for y object to appear to be flat geometrically.</p>
<p>By definition a flat or open universe have always been infinite. Only closed universes can have a size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we speak of 'shape' in cosmology, we're referring to the broad structure of the universe, whether parallel lines curve and join back together, like they do on a sphere, curve and get further apart in both directions, like on a hyperboloid, or always stay the same distance apart, like in Euclidean geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that would be the cosmic event horizon, this is <em>not</em> a synonym for the particle horizon, which separates the observable universe from the unobservable universe. </p>
<p>The former is the volume from which light has had time to reach us, the latter is the maximum volume from which light can ever reach us. </p></div>		</li>
