			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only would I hesitate, I would flat out refute the conflation. As someone who works in clinical psychology and particular in the forensic population, psychosis is absolutely not psychopathy, and the two do not present similarly at all. Psychosis represents a break from reality, where the individual has significant cognitive and perceptual deficits. A psychopath may not have any cognitive deficits typically no perceptual deficits, and typically presents as an unemotional individual whom uses others for gain as they would a tool or object. They don't view others as individuals, but rather as resources to be used and manipulated. </p></div>		</li>

<p>is really spot on but I don't know with her or the DSM there is a requirement for awareness, if anything a specific lack of awareness of their actions, the lack of empathy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i was a child, my elementary school used to test us regularly regarding our iq, psychological balance, eq, talents etc. After one of them, i was grouped as &quot;green&quot;. The least amount of students were &quot;green&quot; btw. They ran a couple of more different tests and called my parents to school same week. My parents haven't told anything about the meeting but that weekend i went to a shrink all of a sudden. I was 9 back then.
Then he told me that i lack fear and excitement in an alarming level that i have to &quot;learn&quot; them through our sessions.
Btw i had a flawless and happy childhood. We always had pet in our house and i always adored animals. But never felt actual love to anyone in my life during those years. I was so posessive of my father, everyone thought i love my parents. I always asked myself what love actually is and how you feel it; if the thing i feel when i'm playing with my dog or cat of badger.
I was 14 when it was the time i stopped seeing my shrink. And i was feeling attatchment, love, fear, anxiety along the way. I don't think rewriting my conscience was necessary because from that sessions till now, i still love to be the center of the attention and to be right in the heart of the things but i sometimes feel so anxious, i piss myself off. I lost my control over my stress long ago that now when i'm on an appointment regarding my job, i lose it. Trembling, sweating, losing track of my thoughts...
Yet i still feel the best feeling is revenge and have never left anything or anyone gone without taking my revenge.
So i'm a kind helpful woman, with an egoistic self indulged inner voice. Overly empathetic but never forgetting and forgiving anything at all.</p>
<p>I guess they can programme you to feel again. And sometimes it's more than you need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to overcome the dark parts of your mind, you have to accept the reality. That's what i learned at the first place. And i know how i feel about revenge. I haven't had to seek for it for 7-8 years so don't worry it's not something you want in your life. But if anyone hurts you, avenging tempts you, that's all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, psychopaths don't necessarily have psychosis/schizophrenia. Psychosis means that you're disconnected from reality, and psychopaths are usually not. </p></div>		</li>
