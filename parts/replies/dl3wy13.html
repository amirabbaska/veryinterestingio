<p>But now, good work is scarcer, causing people who stay in their hometown to have jobs that barely keep them floating above water, or moving and not being able to care for the family that once wanted to kick them out.</p>

<p>As a young American, why has America shifted like this? Everything seems so much less certain and depressing now. Is it possible for it to ever shift back the other way, or is this our future?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the workforce and the economy, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Human rights have always increased and decreased according to supply and demand. My mother was a cashier, my father in law enforcement, neither with any higher education, and they managed to buy two acres of land, build a two story house, and raise two children with a stay-at-home mother. While they were living in the &quot;middle of nowhere&quot; at the time, how common is that feat nowadays?</p>
<p>We currently live in an age where not only are both genders fully committed to the workforce, but a wider variety of ages than ever before. Two of the biggest generations America has ever seen, both the Baby Boomers and the Millenials, are competing against each other with the Gen X'ers holding onto their hats. We have less &quot;career jobs&quot; and more workers than we have had in a long time. And with globalization, companies can just pick up and move to a country that doesn't care if child labor is a thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can raise two kids with a stay at home mom with two acres of land in the middle of nowhere today with a law enforcement job! </p>
<p>No one wants to do that though. The opportunities are extremely thin in the middle of nowhere and you basically need to be buddy buddy with someone who works in the force or have a relative working there for you to have any significant chance of getting hired. The pay is exceptional for the locale though the job itself kind of blows.</p>
<p>You can get by much the same with any decent trade job too without a college background. Again this is in the middle of nowhere - if you are willing to move to where the job is. If you're not flexible the potential opportunities can be as barren as your grandma though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors that made America what it was in the 20th century, but the biggest was post-WWII. The rest of the industrialized world was reeling from the war on their soil, whereas America was relatively unscathed, so we had little to no competition in much of the manufacturing sector, and that allowed us to develop an immense infrastructure, adding even more jobs to the economy. Then the rest of the world started catching up, and all of a sudden paying the wages and taxes to maintain this lifestyle was no longer savory to companies that could find workers for pennies on the dollar and taxes a fraction of what they were paying, when they opened up shop overseas. </p>
<p>No, those jobs aren't coming back. They're all going to be automated soon anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is conventional these days in neoliberal apologetics. Somehow the forces of history just happened to align with a change in government which purposefully reversed the ideological and policy preferences of the previous era.  Your very language points to the real answer &quot;paying the wages and taxes to maintain this lifestyle was no longer savory to companies&quot;</p>
<p>Working class affluence was supposed to prevent working class radicalism.  But the widespread opposition to the  wars in southeast asia proved that it was not as effective as believed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jobs and stagnant pay. I graduated HS in 1995 and immediately went to college. During the summers I took unskilled labor jobs and that paid $15/hr, but adults who had been at that same job for years made less than $15 because they got the typical 3% raise every year, while new hires got pay that was competitive to rival businesses. Many people my age entered the workforce at or close to that $15/hr wage and saw a 3% annual increase for maybe 10 years before the 2008 financial crisis, or Great Recession as some call it, and their wages have been stagnant since then despite strong annual increases in productivity, company profits and an unprecedented stock market rise. </p>
<p>All this had lead to a push to make a $15/hr Minimum Wage and while it makes sense to many, to those who received a higher education and entered the workforce in the 90's and STILL make $15/hr or a little more, to them it feels like a betrayal that new unskilled hires would instantly get paid the same as them. This is part of the reason that I don't support a $15/hr Minimum Wage, as it doesn't address the overarching issue, which is stagnant wages. I actually have no problem with $15 being the Minimum Wage as long as everyone else that's already in the workforce gets a similar raise in pay that reflects the economy. Right now, none of those people are being paid what they are actually worth and it's because corporations say they don't have that kind of money for payrolls, which is true but only because they are so busy throwing that money at executives instead of the people who actually make their products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You hit the nail on the head as far as how I feel about it. Everyone should have a living wage but I busted my ass through school and have a REALLY stressful job, sometimes even to the detriment of my mental health. To think I could go be a secretary or flip burgers for just 5/less an hour than what a lot of positions in my field, well.....yeah. Not such a great feeling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so your filial duty to your parents is more akin to making sure you visit them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also argue that culturally, an American's filial duty to their parents, assuming their parents are wealthy enough to take care of themselves, is to <em>not be a burden on their parent's wealth.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, getting your own job, paying your own bills, and moving out of the house is considered the correct course of action to satisfy parental expectations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my situation, the first expectation was to not be a burden on my parents wealth. The second one is to provide them grandchildren, visit them, and make sure to be nearby so they don't have to go to a nursing home. </p>
<p>In my best friend's situation (also female), she is about to be married, and while they want her to be self-sustaining, they are also pitching a fit because they won't be able to control her or make her visit anymore. They have also demanded that she not get a job until October, so that way she won't make enough and they can claim her on their taxes for that year.</p>
<p>Similarly, my brother worked but lived with my parents after his divorce. When he was 30, he decided to move out and get a second master's degree. My mother, despite holding the &quot;live in your mother's basement&quot; stereotype against him, is now mad at him because he never visits anymore.</p>
<p>Your point is completely valid, but I find that after your moving out of the house step, we're still expected to be close for them and talk with them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>there is a big emphasis on staying with your parents and getting a good job so you can send them money in their old age</p>

<p>small correction, in asian culture you are still supposed to get your own place. you are then supposed to have your parents move in with you so you can take care of them when theyre old. its like a reverse of when you were a kid. theyre living in your house on your dollar. </p>
<p>kids in asia now are running into the same problem though. most asian cities are super dense and housing prices are far more expensive than what young people can afford. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So China having a mandatory retirement age also contributes to this. In many cases the whole family works together to get the son educated and help buy him a home so he can find a wife. Then when the parents have to retire, they move in with their kid and raise the grandchild while the parents work and the cycle repeats. Not having aamdatory retirement age in the U.S. generally keeps parent from needing their children until their health declines and they need more help in a more physical than financial way. </p></div>		</li>
