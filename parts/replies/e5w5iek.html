			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is not very high up but you mention a very important underlying reason the top comments don't mention. Looking at the earth from the &quot;top&quot; (i.e. looking down on the north pole) the earth spins counterclockwise. The atmosphere can't &quot;keep up&quot; with the earth itself, resulting in trade winds around the equator and also the patterns hurricanes follow.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRcp-Wm8dKPuavppOtKhayvGCv2bcy2F5NjAEWYbifqcn1XhsITxVZWmmKX" target="_blank">here's</a> a picture of a divi divi tree in the Caribbean, growing asymmetrically because it's always being exposed to winds from the same direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the atmosphere &quot;can't keep up.&quot; Prevailing winds at different latitudes can be faster or slower than the rotation of the earth. </p>
<p>Uneven heating at various latitudes causes winds, and the winds over a large scale start spinning  because of the Coriolis effect. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok thanks for correcting me. But does this mean that friction (not sure if I'm using the correct word here) between the ground and the air is not a factor at all in the alignment of the winds along the equator? Like how a car drags the air with it as it moves forward. That's how I always understood it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s prevailing winds faster than that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that the hurricane first storms generate along the coast of Morocco by Sahara desert.   There is a city in Morocco where its always windy &quot;Essaouira&quot; and something with weather system where storms generate there.  Is this possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I can tell this city Essaouira is located at a comfortable 30N - a latitudinal band that most climatologists call the Horse Latitudes. This latitudinal band is normally characterised by fairly calm winds and not much storm potential. This latitudinal band is situated between two big atmospheric circulation cells: Hadley 0-30N and the Ferrell cell 30-60N, which are formed by the coriolis force that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>However that being said the calm winds that originate from this band of high pressure flow out to the north (to create the westerlies) and to the south (to create the trade winds) both of which are significant climate drivers that
are responsible for many big storms. So perhaps the knowledge that you picked up were referencing this? - a tad of guesswork!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/M7dniC9.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;Life cycle of a North Atlantic Hurricane&quot;</a> from Encyclcopædia Britannica.  </p>
<p>The atmospheric imbalance usually forms off the coast of Western Sahara down to Liberia, from July to October (Peak in September). From there the systems typically head west along the northern coast of South America, reach Category 1-2 around the Caribbean Islands and shift north to slowly die out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is to see the hurricane as mostly sitting still and the Earth moving under it. The coriolis effect causes the south-north (and north-south in southern hemisphere) motion, but the west-east is mostly caused by the earth moving under the system. </p></div>		</li>
