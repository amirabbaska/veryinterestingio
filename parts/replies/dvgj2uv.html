			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of sublimation for snow is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931008003475" target="_blank">super complicated</a>, but in general it depends on both the temperature and the relative humidity. Just like evaporation, at lower temperatures and higher humidities the rate of sublimation is lower. And when the temperatures get lower, it does not take very much water vapor at all to reach 100% humidity. So the air is often close to saturated in these very cold temperatures, meaning the rate of sublimation will be incredibly slow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or do you mean 5 inches, which would be 5&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those valleys do get annual precipitation, but it's appropriately measured in millimeters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowfall was measured at 11 sites in the McMurdo Dry Valleys to determine its magnitude, its temporal changes, and spatial patterns. Annual values ranged from 3 to 50 mm water equivalent with the highest values nearest the coast and decreasing inland.</p>
