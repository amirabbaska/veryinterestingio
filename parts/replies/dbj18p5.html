			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, congratulations are certainly in order! How long have you been at it? I've been hearing a lot of ads about FroYo 'robots' (basically vending machines). Are you worried about it at all?</p>
<p>Owning a small business is one of the most stressful things I've ever witnessed (my mother was a real estate broker with a few employees under her before the market took a poop). I admire, but do not envy you one bit! LOL!</p>
<p>Lots of people want a go at running their own business - I've witnessed it first hand and want absolutely no part in it. I work <em>for</em> a small business right now, and the owner hides it well, but sometimes when it's exceptionally slow he looks like he's coming apart at the seams. He's got savings, but you can really tell he's sort've holding his breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was more of an investment than a small business.  I don't run it, I just pay the bills and manage the cash flow.  I own another smallish business where I work.  Yeah when it's slow it is painful.  Business owners get paid last. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this comment and one other. A lot of the other commenters answers imply that the owners of the shops in question are idiots. I do not believe many places like yours are started by people who do <em>zero</em> research and have no business knowledge. I'm inclined to believe the FroYo business is just more complicated than most people assume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last year my store made 38k on 280k in sales.  All of that went to paying the loan down so I didn't see a dime of it.  I have 14 months left of the loan and then it'll be decent if sales hold.  You can't live off of it but it's a good side gig if it pays out.  Lots of restaurants don't pay out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy that owning a froyo business that's in the black each year is a side gig, I bet that takes up a ton of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate? 242k went into overhead plus loan?</p>
<p>I'm confused on if the $38k was net profit after all expenses or you still had to put in money towards the loan?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question, the Orange leaf near me switched from charging by weight to charging by cup size.  There is a store about 45 miles away that still charges by weight.  I was wondering is this something each owner decides or if the entire franchise is shifting that direction? (PS I prefer the weight option as it lets me pay for the amount I want to eat.)</p></div>		</li>
