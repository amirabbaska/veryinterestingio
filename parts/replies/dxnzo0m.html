			<div class="markdown"><p>Look into what are called <a href="http://www.formfactors.org/developer/specs/wg_overview_098.pdf" target="_blank">Waveguides Beyond Cutoff</a>. The link has design information on microwaves incident on an array of holes. /u/jpdoane spelled out the basics. </p>
<p>In my university microwave courses we always started with Maxwell's equations, applied boundary conditions, and solved for the resultant modes and propagation.  In a nutshell, a wave incident on a single passage, where the wavelength is larger than the hole, leads to an exponentially decaying wave through the hole. It never goes to zero, but can be made to decay to any level you want, by appropriate designs. They even use this to make precision attenuators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow and they had this figured out all the way back in the 80's when microwaves were invented. Amazing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Finally an answer that does not confuse wavelength with some imaginary wave height.</p>
<p>For those reading that link, note there’s a use of the word “normal” where “parallel” is meant. That had me confused for a while. </p></div>		</li>
