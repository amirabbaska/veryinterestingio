			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, we need to be thankful that is one wasn't a Zaire level lethality. I read the Hot Zone and the first chapter is one of only two books to make me put it down and take a break from reading it for a few weeks. Also it was fun seeing how someone who knew how potentially deadly Ebola was and that she was exposed and almost certainly infected refused to mention it to anyone and got lucky that the strain doesn't affect humans while killing almost all the monkeys in quarantine </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hot Zone is actually a bit exaggerated and not 100% true. It was written for the public, so some parts were embellished quite a bit (it doesn't actually liquefy people and present symptoms nearly as bad as it claims). If you get a chance, Spillover is amazing! It covers a bunch of other scary viruses and tries to predict what the next global pandemic would look like!</p></div>		</li>
