			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is at the event horizon waves have been red shifted &quot;infinitely&quot; (spacetime is flowing into the singularity faster than light can escape) making objects at the event horizon invisible. Slightly above the event horizon the red shift is extreme but waves are still escaping. The red shift continues to decrease as you move away further.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That second video was really helpful to me, thanks.</p>
<p>As a side note, is there a reason you posted the video links with timestamps? It seemed to me to open at the point at which the video was no longer informational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Objects of the sorts of energies we're used would be invisible, however depending on what was around the black hole you may have really, really energetic objects (lots of heat from tidal forces, collisions and compression) which makes the light being emitted by them a lot more energetic, so they could still be in the visible spectrum after red shifting.</p>
<p>(For background, objects emit black body radiation based on their temperature at a peak spectrum, as well as all spectrums below that peak. So room temperature objects are emitting IR light (and everything below that) then things get hot enough to emit light in the lowest visible spectrum: red. They move through other visible lights and eventually are putting out light in the entire visible spectrum, making them &quot;white hot&quot;. As things get even hotter than that they will directly emit Ultra violet light, which can be red-shifted and remain in the visible spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, something like a pulsar may actually emit massive visible pulses rather than xrays and the like? If it were able to survive in close enough orbit to a large enough black hole? That's wicked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I don't know how big it is, but the area just above the Event Horizon is indeed where all observation stops, because any light emitted from deeper in would be red shifted into oblivion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no no, the light past the event horizon is in a space where the only possible path is downwards towards the center of the black hole due to the extreme deformation of said space. It has nothing to do with redshifting anymore.</p></div>		</li>
