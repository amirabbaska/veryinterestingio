			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an effect called Rayleigh scattering. When we work through the problem of how much very small particles scatter EM radiation we get a term in the final equation of 1/wavelength^4. A small wavelength will make this term a lot bigger than a large one. This means that shorter wavelengths are scattered much more than longer wavelengths. That's why the sun looks a reddish yellow (because red wavelengths aren't scattered much at all and end up taking a largely straight path from the sun to your eye, while blue light is heavily scattered and ends up coming from all directions, giving the whole sky a blue colour.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the sun appears much more of a cool white from space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While not the same effect, something similar is why people have blue eyes. There's not actually blue pigment in the eye to make it blue. I think that's also true for other colors, but I only cared about the blue one because that's the color eyes I have.</p>
<p>I learn for selfish motives :P</p></div>		</li>
