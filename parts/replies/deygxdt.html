			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct and also remember that ATC can't see who the plane is unless they tell us. You could fly all day on a fake callsign. N1234 but file IFR as n12435. (Some exceptions with newer adsb tech but that can be disabled).</p>
<p>There are plenty of small air operators that have their own private call signs. DCM (dotcom) is a company that allows people to use their call sign instead of their public tail number (celebrities use this as do Corp executives). So if a plane calls and says dcm158 looking to pickup IFR in the air... It's not my job to confirm who he is or verify it. If it's not in my system, I'll enter it manually without question.</p>
<p>Tell me where you want to go, at what altitude.... Cleared! </p>
<p>ATC isn't the police. Our job is to furnish requests. As long as you are complying with route requests, altitude assignments, etc... No one will notice. (Assuming it doesn't say Delta on the side)</p>
<p>If you want to land at the small fixed base office at a semi major airport... Probably no one will notice either. </p>
<p>I've had a few large Jets fly around just using their tail number as their call sign... Which means it's either privately owned or a few other circumstances. All I said was.... Cool.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you never violate a class b or restricted area, no one is going to notice.... Of course this is handled differently in DC than mid America, but the point lies that you can operate legally in a jet airliner across the country without having to talk to ATC... And if you wanted to you could just make up a valid callsign and no controller is going to care. There is nothing wrong with filling IFR in the air... There is anyone to police the callsign. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is amazing to read for me as a complete layman in these matters, but I was more curious about the second part of the question. What happens when they catch him? What does it mean to be &quot;shot down&quot;? (with what - missiles? who does that - the army?) Isn't it dangerous for whatever objects he's above if he gets &quot;shot down&quot; above US ground? Are they going to warn him over the radio first? (so he could eject at least or something)  </p>
<p>And if indeed unauthorized flight can be shot down (with potential death of the pilot), what about technical communication difficulties that caused the authorization of the flight to fail? Is he to blame (and be killed) for having a radio failure, for example? I apologize if my questions sound really stupid - I admit I know nothing of this area, but it's very interesting for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got some military aviation background, so I'll take a stab at answering this part, but the real answer is &quot;It really depends&quot;.</p>
<p>Once it was established that the aircraft was unresponsive to attempts to contact it via radio, or that it was somewhere it shouldn't be or was headed that direction, the closest fighter squadron would launch an intercept, probably at least 2 aircraft. There are bases around the country that have a couple of pilots sitting on &quot;alert&quot; at any given time for just such a purpose. Currently the most likely candidates if the aircraft is well away from the coast are the F-15 or F-16 (both of which are USAF primarily). Other possibilities depending on exact location include the F-18 (Navy or Marines, most common around the coast but there are inland Naval Aviation Stations) and F-22 (USAF but not many of them CONUS AFAIK). I don't know if there are combat ready F-35 squadrons filling the air defense mission yet, but if there are, there aren't many of them.</p>
<p>The aircraft in question would be intercepted by the fighters and an attempt to ascertain its intent would be made. They would first make sure that the pilot knew that they were there, likely with a close approach well within the pilot's field of view, then they would likely take up a position at a safer distance but still keeping the aircraft in view, probably with one in a location where they could fire if necessary. Radio contact would be attempted on all common channels (UNICOM, local CTAF, ATC frequencies, etc), and failing that, the fighters may even attempt to get close enough to establish visual communications. Maybe the aircraft is in trouble and has no electrical power, maybe the pilot is disabled and the aircraft is on auto-pilot (this has happened several times over the years due to rapid depressurization and/or hypoxia), they might even be able to determine if there are people in the cockpit who shouldn't be (hijackers, perhaps).</p>
<p>They would then attempt to escort the aircraft to a nearby airfield. If it is obvious that there is someone in control of the aircraft, and some form of communication weren't established, or it was but the pilot was defiant, the situation gets sticky.</p>
<p>If the aircraft weren't within easy reach of an obvious target, perhaps it were just cruising over the central plains, or it was on a bearing that didn't carry it close to anything that would make sense for a suicide run, it would be <em>very</em> likely that the incident commander (whoever that might be, more on that in a second) would adopt a wait-and-see approach. There's little point to shooting now if there's not much damage it could do in the next few hours, and the situation might resolve in a positive way given some time and continued efforts.</p>
<p>An order to fire on the aircraft would have to come from <em>very</em> high up. I'm not exactly sure how high, but by that point it's very likely that POTUS is in the loop (if he decides to show up to the briefing). I think it's improbable that they would fire on the aircraft unless it were heading toward an obvious target like Washington D.C. but I suppose any major metro area might present a high enough risk of mass casualties on the ground to warrant shooting it down.</p>
<p>The goal would probably be to time the shot such that the aircraft was likely to come down in a very sparsely populated area, or the least densely populated area between where it is currently, anyway, and what they think the target might be. If the aircraft is fairly low, a shot is likely to bring it down in pretty short order and provide some degree of control over where it lands. If it's at cruising altitude, a lot can happen in the ~10 miles before it hits the ground, and it's a bigger risk to shoot it down.</p>
<p>What they used to shoot it down would depend on the fighters that were on scene. Certainly not the cannon, there's too much risk of collateral damage from stray bullets, and it could leave the aircraft mostly flyable even after multiple hits. The most likely option would probably be the AIM-9 sidewinder, as the fighters will be in close proximity and the AIM-9 is a visual range missile commonly carried by US fighters. They might also use something like the AIM-120 AMRAAM, but I'm not sure how those are/could be employed in close proximity. If the decision to bring the aircraft down were made I think it is probable, especially with a relatively large aircraft, that they would fire more than one to ensure it comes down quickly, in the area they want it to, but that's purely conjecture on my part.</p>
<p>What <em>wouldn't</em> happen, with virtual certainty, would be the employment of surface based missiles to shoot down the aircraft. Besides the more limited ability to engage in a very precise time and place, surface to air missiles present bigger risk of collateral damage in other ways (are you <strong>sure</strong> that target is the correct aircraft in a crowded airspace?). They also are just not widely maintained in an active combat-ready status when they aren't forward deployed, with the possible exception of areas like D.C. that have very sensitive targets. Even then, I don't believe SAMs are considered to be anything remotely close to a first-line defense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only known low level radar coverage in the CONUS are where there are either AWACS operating (Oklahoma from the Tinker AFB training and support base) or where there are aerostat TARS like  EL/M-2083 and JLENS.</p>
<p>Right now those would be - Yuma and Fort Huachuca, AZ.; Deming, NM.; Marfa, Eagle Pass, and Rio Grande City, TX; Cudjoe Key, FL.; and Lajas, PR</p>
<p>Some are in place, or have been in place, at Fort Aberdeen Maryland and at White Sands NM</p>
