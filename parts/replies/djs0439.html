			<div class="markdown"><p>The book series that is based off really seems to respect physics in its storytelling. Ice haulers would be crushed by blocks of ice moving in space at 1cm/second just because of their mass, manoeuvres in space would take their toll on the crew if they turned the ship too fast. Decelerating big ships would take hours of burning in the opposite direction. Asteroid and small moon space stations relying on centrifugal force to act as gravity would see that force diminish as you ascend space station levels (thus approaching the centre of mass). </p>
<p>That series is a real treat and a breath of fresh air as it takes into account all the physics that other sci fi films seems to forget or chooses to ignore for the sake of storytelling. </p></div>		</li>
