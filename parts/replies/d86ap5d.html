			<div class="markdown"><p>Best response so far, just want to add or rephrase a few things.</p>
<p>Classical liberalism was a response originating from the Enlightenment Era and was primarily a rejection of the Divine Right of Kings, as you mentioned.  Hobbe's Leviathan is one of the best defenses of this political philosophy.  We all, by some degree, live in a classically liberal world (as far as developed countries go).  It is similar to a Kuhn paradigm in its pervasiveness.  This view was partially defeated by John Rawls and his paradigm shifting thought experiments.  It should be noted that this is a political philosophy and not an economic one, so it does not rest equivalently with Keynesian views ( a form of market management ) or Neoliberalism ( a strategy for debt and investment ).</p>
<p>Keynesian and Keynesian economics were the <em>de facto</em> macroeconomic theory in public practice.  They intended to address the irrational aspects of macroeconomics that became prevalent with the fall of mercantilism and the rise of capitalism.  Almost every aspect of global economic behavior in the contemporary era has a foundation in his work at Bretton Woods.  It should be noted that a large portion of his suggestions did not become accepted at Bretton Woods.  He was highly concerned about negative externalities, which was established from a unique application of viewing economics with a socio-political lens.  In a way, he was more true to the views of Adam Smith, than many of the so-called Smith supporters.  Woodrow Wilson, an underrated and brilliant academic, also had influence on some of this broad theory in prior years.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism was a response to development issues around the world, particularly following the first energy crisis which <em>created a need/opportunity for investment opportunities across borders.</em>  This led to an easy credit, high debt global structure and pushed austerity and free trade with little consideration to negative externalities.  The Washington &quot;Consensus&quot; highlights some of these points.  The consequences of this strategy formalized the field of International Political Economy, citing the need for a larger interdisciplinary approach to understand these issues and hopefully prevent such action from occurring again.</p>
<p>Post 1999/2008, we mostly live in a Neokeynesian world, which comes with its own share of problems.  Ownership of private debt by central banks, irrational cycle behavior in developed countries, serious TRIP issues, a global &quot;race to the bottom&quot; contract market, crisis-level corporate debt in developing countries, poor signaling/cooperation between central banks, etc.  </p>
<p>It is not the perfect answer, and many academics know this.  They search for the next best paradigm.  Some, like Joseph Stiglitz, offer Copernican shifts from the Wealth of Nations.  With knowledge being the only unlimited resource, he attributes the value of &quot;learning environments&quot; as the true vehicles of progress and development.  He and others hope to find the best answer to manage a near post-scarcity economic environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. ReluctantPatriot is also correct, IMHO. I have a degree in politics and economics, and firmly believe I know what I'm talking about. (Slight tinge of sarcasm or tongue in cheek there). </p>
<p>I would refine their responses by clarifying that the economic models of Friedman and Keynes are essentially the same models. Where they differ is in the policy recommendations that they make. </p>
<p>Keynes and Keynesians (J.K. Galbraith being a very readable one) tend to support a policy of managing the economy through fiscal policy. Governments should run surpluses when times are good and run deficits when times are bad. The idea is that this will smooth out the ups and downs of the regular business cycle and lead to steady, stable growth. Their had their heyday in the late depression and post-war period, and were pushed out by the neo-liberal or neo-conservative approach based on the work of the Chicago school economists.  </p>
<p>The Chicago school types (Friedman et al) disagree with Keynes and prefer that government not manage the economy through fiscal policy. Government should set the regulatory field and manage the economy through monetary policy. I was never a fan of the Chicago school, and can't explain what they were thinking in any depth. The Regan 'trickle down' theory was based in large part on their thought. </p>
<p>The biggest problem with using Keynsian thought to run a government is that governments (at least in North America) never seem capable of saving when times are good. Economy running at full employment?  Great time to increase spending with all that extra cash coming in. In a recession? No choice but to borrow or cut essential programs (or more likely, a bit of both, with the largest of largess going to support friendly industries in the name of creating jobs). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Automatic stabilizers come in handy.  During booms progressive taxes suck up more money, during busts tax collection falls, while spending expands via food stamps and unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>It might also help if our politicians actually knew economics, or agreed on Keynesian policies.  They kind of did mid-century, back when the US had strong growth.  These days at least half our politicians are into voodoo economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also help if politicians would rely on simple algorithms in economic decision making. And plan ahead the next recession. (Put this % to savings account if this % is the current GDP growht. When recession hits, we will launch this and this and this infra project.) Currently it's completely possible that recession has passed when government gets into action. And the action may vary significantly form recession to recession.</p>
<p>This takes some predictability out of government action in recessions and that makes overcoming them more difficult. For example big construction company might fire lots of carpenters right before government announces big road building projects. Because last time the money wen't to car manufacturers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they both have problems, but I think the problems with the Chicago school are bigger: it treats the economy as a collection of rational agents without really any regard for human psychology.</p>
<p>When we're talking about governments I don't think there's a huge effective difference between saving during good times vs. paying off debt during good times, it's just that the latter is easier in democracies due to the irrationality of the public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to correct on the notion of a government achieving a surplus. It doesn't actually have to achieve a surplus, not running a deficit in good times is good enough. Normally, governments include debt payments in their budgets. This means that if you don't run a deficit, you are paying off debt. So if you run deficits and accumulate debt in bad times, and then have a balanced budget in good times, you are doing everything right. But you are right in the notion that even having a balanced budget in good times seems to be difficult for certain governments. But its not really standard. The USA was able during most of its time to have a balanced budget during good economic times. The only expectations to this are Reagen, Bush jr., and Obama.
In Europe the southern hemisphere is having problems with achieving balanced budgets during good times, but the northern european countries dont have such problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even that is more than you need. As long as your average cost to service you debt doesn't grow any faster than your economy, you can deficit spend constantly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Neoliberalism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what you are describing is more Neo-Classical economics (though i might add that stating Hayek and Friedman shared a belief in the same economic theory would be grossly misleading. Hayek was a follower of Austrian Economics which rejected deriving correlations merely from data [ie reject macroeconomics], while Friedman was a monetarist - a macroeconomic theory that emphasises the impact of the money supply on the economy. The one thing they did share was policy recommendations [generally laissez-faire but would disagree strongly about the correct level of interest rates])</p>
<p>Neoliberalism is more a political ideology/theory pushed by figures like Thatcher and Reagan that hold economic growth (via a neoclassical understanding) as the main focus of a liberal society. In other words, a shift away from the classical liberal ideas about rights and the social contract as the basis for liberty and government constraint to holding that these liberal principles are justified because they lead to the most wealth creation. For a neo-liberal, any policy that increases GDP is generally a good policy to follow regardless of any previous understanding about what is 'right' or 'just'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph was right, but your second one was off. Thatcher and Reagan are Neo-conservatives, no?</p>
<p>When I think neo-liberalism, I think something in line with Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, etc. Keynesian, but with a focus on austerity and cutting spending, and lots of trade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neo-liberals are not very big fans of keynesian stimulus spending - im not sure where you picked up the impression that they did. Tony Blair etc could be seen as neoliberals as he (according to some) pursued policies like foreign wars to serve oil and military (big bussiness) interests. </p>
<p>Another facet of neoliberal policy is 'globalisation' (as trump would put it) such as agree trade deals that do more than remove tariffs but also universalise laws which are good for businesses. Many critics have called the EU a prime example of a neo-liberal organisation.</p>
<p>Edit: A point about Neo-conservatism - it and neo-liberalism are very similar to each other and many would say they are the same. I would put the point of difference in attitudes to traditional social policies like marriage or drugs. A neo-conservative would add to their neo-classical economic understanding of the world a conservative social theory. An example would be Thomas Sowell who argues that traditional marriage should be supported as the nuclear family structure and care for ones children is at the heart of capitalistic savings and investment. Thus a breakdown of this family structure would remove much of the drive to earn more than is needed for ones own self (and thus lowering GDP).  </p></div>		</li>
