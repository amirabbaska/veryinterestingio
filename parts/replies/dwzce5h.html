			<div class="markdown"><p>A sense.. yes we do sense time but only in the world around us. Transitions of physical matter we've seen again and again signal to this sense. For example how do we know the time it takes for a ball to hit the ground? We know because our brain has recorded the markers between dropping the ball and seeing the ball bounce.</p>
<p>The reason we can't perceive time while we sleep is that we cease recording these markers. No markers no time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed today we can weigh objects with our brain by watching them fall.</p>
<p>I was walking along on the streets and a boy threw a plastic disposable cup into the air which had some liquid and thus some weight, and I thought it was a glass and braced for its impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite the same. As you likely know, all things fall at the same rate, in a vacuum. That is to say, you couldn't tell the difference between the cup falling with or without water in, if there were no air resistance.</p>
<p>You can get an idea of whether something is particularly dense or not by observing how much it's air resistance slows it's fall, but if the the cup with the water likely didn't weigh as much as a glass in total by a stretch, and if you scaled the cup and it's water content up by the same amount, it would fall in the same way.</p>
<p>Since we have an idea how much air resistance effects a plastic cup falling, we can deduce that if something falls observably faster it is subject to less air resistance per unit mass, so it falls at a rate closer to 9.81 m/s.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you've got a good idea of the exposed surface area and the distance to the object, watching it fall could give you an idea of its weight, but it's more complex than that alone so it wouldn't be too accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed repetition of events signal these markers (remarkable frames in a sequence) that the brain has seen before will elicit the type of response the brain has been conditioned for. A fast moving creature, deadly distance from the ground, danger extending beyond the peripheral vision will all trigger a predictable response from the brain that something bad is about to happen.</p></div>		</li>
