			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is already at the formation of the black hole. A star is made up of a huge number of baryons and leptons (and essentially no antibaryons and antileptons). Immediately upon collapse, all of those are hidden behind the event horizon permanently, immediately violating baryon and lepton conservation very badly. Then your statement, that Hawking radiation contains nearly zero baryons and leptons, means you simply never get these back.</p></div>		</li>
