<p>During asthma, the muscles around your windpipe tighten up and make it difficult to get air in or out.
Asthma inhalers contain drugs (drug particles mixed in a spray) that work to relax these muscles.
Taking the same medication in a pill also works...just much slower and with greater side effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, as a person with severe tree-nut allergies, this got me wondering. If I go into anaphylactic shock, my airways will close. Does this mean that someones asthma inhaler would work just as well as my epi-pens I carry everywhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaphylaxis extends beyond your lungs. Inhalers won't do much good when you're getting hives, severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and massive upper airway swelling. Once your upper airway swells up, you won't be able to generate enough negative pressure (inhalational 'sucking' force) to get the inhaler meds to your lower airways anyway. Use epinephrine. </p>

<p>Anaphylaxis extends beyond your lungs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an important point. </p>
<p>When the reactions are in the lungs, mouth, throat, and similar it can be life threatening by blocking airways. In this case always get emergency care.</p>
<p>But about 80% of anaphylactic reactions are on the skin. They are usually itchy hives and swollen skin, but usually can be treated by washing the area to remove the allergens and hydrocortisone cream to help control the reaction.  The person should be monitored, but in most cases they'll be fine without advanced care.</p>
<p>Either way the body can go into anaphylactic shock even when there are no breathing problems, so watch for that until the reaction subsides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Anaphylaxis  does more than affect your lungs.  An inhaler will only ease one of the many symptoms; it will not stop the progression of anaphylaxis
An inhaler may not even stop your asthma attack.  A rescue inhaler only affects the symptoms, not the cause, which is why it is important to have comprehensive treatment for your asthma.  If you use an inhaler too often, you should go to the doctor and adjust your maintenance medications. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, your inhaler is doing it’s job. </p>
<p>Whatever you’re having a problem with may not be apparent to you in the air but once it’s in there your body’s going to react. </p></div>		</li>
