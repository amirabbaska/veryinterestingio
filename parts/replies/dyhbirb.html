			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, even more impressive to me is creatures that have cocoon stages. Cause it's like, how do you develop a middle-ground in evolution for that? You start out as one thing (caterpillar), wrap yourself in your own body fluids, hang around for weeks, and then come out looking completely different, it's crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even weirder because, at least in the case of caterpillar cocoons, they actually digest themselves inside of the cocoon before rearranging their genetic goop into a butterfly. How the hell did THAT get started?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't even get how that sort of behaviour is evolutionarily advantageous, with the increased risk of being eaten by a predator while in the cocoon, the energetic cost of metamorphosis, the sheer complexity of it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not related to silk but maybe semi-relevant, but I just watched videos on Velvet worms... they spray prey or predators with a slime that almost immediately starts to harden and is impossible to get out of. </p>
