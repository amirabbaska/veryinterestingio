			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent post, I also wanted to add that the native people that the Norse had contact with were wiped out, the Inuit who live there now are a different group, both culturally and genetically.  .  </p>
<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140828-arctic-migration-genome-genetics-dna-eskimos-inuit-dorset/" target="_blank">One theory is that the Dorset People died of European disease, and that the diseases never spread to other cultures because of the isolation of the Arctic.</a> There are some clues that the Dorset didn't like interacting with other groups, they may have inadvertently spared their neighbors from contagion.  But the Inuit culture was on the rise before the Vikings showed up, no one really knows.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Inuit is the name given to the tribe by the English that first contacted them. Names get reused a lot. In this case, it's the English alphabet spelling of a word that comes from a differently language with a different alphabet. It's just coincidence that it mimicked a previously used word or term. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, diseases also required large population densities to develop and confer relative immunity in Europe.  Later European conquerors came from such centers, as their trips were funded and manned by powerful empires.  But the vikings that contacted the Americas would have come from considerably smaller and long-isolated communities in Greenland, Iceland, etc.</p></div>		</li>
