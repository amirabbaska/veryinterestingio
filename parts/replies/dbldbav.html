			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, the problem with constantly being around people, whether it's a group or even just most individuals, is that it takes effort to not come across as passive-aggressive.  I don't know why that matters so much, but I'm aware that short comments can be interpreted as being hostile.</p>
<p>When I'm alone though, I don't have to worry about any of that.</p>
<p>It's not all the time either, and I think that's a common misconception about introverts. We can be social and even every once in awhile, surprisingly enjoy being the welcomed center of attention.  Personally, I just get anxious when I can't take a break from it, or especially when being in that situation is something I'm forced to do (out of obligation or otherwise).  That state of being on edge non-stop for too long is mentally taxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. As an extrovert, I get tired after being alone for a few hours. A couple weekends ago was the first weekend I spent alone in years. I was excited at first, I could play a bunch of video games and watch movies and be a degenerate. Saturday morning I wanted to shoot myself, I was so bored and exhausted. I get mentally reinvigorated by talking to people and partying and dancing and playing games etc.</p></div>		</li>
