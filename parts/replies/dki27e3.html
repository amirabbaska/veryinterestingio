			<div class="markdown"><p>But with that realization they step on that many times per day is it not worth into seeking the time being wasted because of such? It's money spend on checking a scale. While I get it, it's little time though 10 times per day times 200 working days times let's say 2 minutes for giggles that's 4.000 minutes wasted. I have no clue what the going rate for a house doctor is but let's be conservative at 100 usd/h  that's 6.000 USD+ per year spend on working with a scale.</p>
<p>I get the notion of the old scale won't break down though for 6.000 USD a year I can buy a ton of commercial scales.</p></div>		</li>
