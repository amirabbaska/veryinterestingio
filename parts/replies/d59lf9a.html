<p>Great post though that makes a lot of sense.  So slowing time makes sense, but is there a way to travel to the future in this theory or did I miss something? It seems to me like slowing time is the one option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the poster correctly, you do not exactly travel in time like in the movies but say a 5 year old took a stroll near a black hole, when he came back he had just aged one year so in his own perspective he is then 6 years but earth had aged for example 1000 years, this could be seen as travelling forward in time.</p></div>		</li>

If time slows for me but maintains the same &quot;rate&quot; for my friend, how would things progress at different rates if we're both looking at one another the whole time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time may be confusing because it has two meanings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time on the clock that is used to track our days, calculated by counting vibrations of a quartz crystal.  The vibration movement is nearly constant, so you can conclude that X amount of vibrations is equal to 1 second. </li>
<li>The amount of compression/contraction there is in a volume of space, usually explained mathematically using a vector direction.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Light will always travel the same speed, so we can tell how compressed space is based on how it changes it's frequency or wavelength.  </p>
<p>The compression of space does cause a quartz crystal and other cyclical actions to change where space is distorted.  Mass is fundamentally made of energy, so it too must follow the speed of light constant within the mass.  It has been found that time dilation is proportional to the properties of gravity. This is the why the theory of time dilation is a strong theory.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea after a certain point the five year old is sitting in the other room yelling, &quot;OK!! SORRY I ASKED!!!&quot;</p>
<p>The time travel comes from time dilation. When you slow time down when traveling really fast or in a gravity well, time doesn't slow down outside of it. So everything outside of the well and your spaceship travels normal time speed and you travel at a very reduced time speed. So one year for you is, lets say 100 years to the other people outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as how time is a human construct though, as in there I am flow of time. Only past present and future. So what is the actual mechanism here? Do molecules simply move more slowly near higher gravity thus everything ages slower relative to lower gravity? Because that actually makes sense to me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So if you travel really fast along the outer edge of an event horizon time will dilate so much that thousands of years will go by in no time from your perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is the case, does that mean that if humans were able to amass the amount of energy necessary to propel us to <em>C</em> we would effectively be able to traverse the universe without any effects to our bodies that we now associate with time in space?</p>
<p>For example, two years in space would damage bone densities for humans. But if we travelled that distance at <em>C</em> would we not lose bone density because we technically experienced no time?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the perspective of a photon, a transit across 13 billion light years is instantaneous.  So for your question, if one could travel at those speeds and do it safely, they would just appear at their destination with literally no time passing from the time they hit C to the time they left it.</p>
<p>Unless we can conceive of some kind of FTL to get around that limit, then it's not going to happen.  However if we can funnel the energy of countless suns into our ship, we can get some decent returns on time in space, but you have to be real close to get a large benefit from it.</p>
<p>If you were travelling at 99.7300000% of C, a year for you would be 13 years on Earth.</p>
<p>If you were travelling at 99.9999000% of C, a year for you would be 246 years on Earth.</p>
<p>If you were traveling at 99.9999996% of C, a year for you would be around 12,243 years for the Earth.</p>
<p>As you can see, the last bits gain you a largest amount of dilation, but they also cost the largest amount of resources.  As you get closer to the speed of light, you need more and more energy to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard you need infinite energy to get to c, and you'd gain infinite mass once you got there.</p>
<p>which brings me to wonder. If time is meaningless at c, how can photons travel at all? i mean.. r=d/t right? if t becomes meaningless doesn't d and t become meaningless? </p>
<p>second, how are photons quantifiable if it requires infinite energy to be at c?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time does not exist for a photo or something traveling at C because the laws of the universe must mean that time has to slow down so much so that the speed of C does not go faster than C so that time stops for C?

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Photons do not &quot;experience&quot; time or distance because they have no mass. Of course, this is all a thought experiment because it will always be impossible to reach light speed by pushing on a massive object. If we ever effectively reach or exceed light speed it will be because we've bent space time and tricked our way around it, not because we pushed something through normal space time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. But from what I've read about the expansion of the universe, at some point even travelling at light speed won't allow us to travel to different galaxies because they will be expanding away from each other faster than light speed. Gravity is stronger than the expansion and so will still keep solar systems and galaxies together. I can't remember if the expansion is accelerating, but if it is then it would eventually overcome gravity and all the other forces too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You lost me at the idea that time must slow down to allow &quot;Runner B&quot; to go in and out of the ravine and get to the finish line at the same time as &quot;Runner A&quot;.</p>
<p>What the law that says both Runner A &amp; B must use the exact same amount of energy to finish at the same time? Is that the constant?</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that hitting a depression in space means that once you go in, time <strong>has to</strong> slow down.</p>
<p>If it's the same distance, and both Runner A &amp; B are moving at the same speed with nothing stopping them, why don't they just arrive at the same point at the same time regardless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The misconception that you're holding onto (that we all hold onto when we first learn about this because it's so <em>weird</em>) is that time itself is constant. It's NOT. That's why it's called spacetime.</p>
<p>Think of it like this - we travel through spacetime at a constant rate, it's just that the majority of our travel is along the time dimension, with a relatively microscopic amount of it going through space. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/VY3iheu.png" target="_blank">Look at this as a speedometer that represents a particle's travel through the universe (sorry it's bad, I just made it in Paint):</a> As the particle increases its velocity, the meter rotates counter-clockwise, indicating that more of the particle's travel through space-time is taken up by time instead of distance. Note: That magnitude of that red arrow is <em>c</em> (the speed of light), so remember that the fastest vehicles we've ever created won't move that arrow more than a pixel above the line. </p>
<p>If I'm not changing distance, then I'm purely moving through time. If I'm going at the speed of light, though, then I'm purely moving through distance, and time stops. Whatever happens, though, that red arrow has to remain the same length, which is why if gravity distorts distance itself, time slows down. But again, it's not that time slows down to compensate, per se... it's that the two are <em>part of the same thing</em>. We just are not at all used to thinking of them that way, so it's really weird to us when we start trying to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember, it's not a depression in space, it's a depression in spacetime. We think of space as an emptiness, a void. But really what we call space is a physical substance that can be warped. And that substance is also the &quot;clock&quot; for whatever exists within it. Time is completely flexible on a universal scale, and is only determined locally by the state of the space you are existing within. </p>
<p>Since the state of local space directly affects the passage of time within that space, we condense the two concepts into one, &quot;spacetime&quot;. A depression in space is the very cause of altered time. The two phenomena are one and the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im still confused on the relative perspective part.</p>
<p>So here's what we know:</p>
<p>-Person A and B are both going the same rate of &quot;speed&quot;(speed=distance/time) </p>
<p>-Their &quot;speed&quot; will not change</p>
<p>-They will arrive at the same point at the same time</p>
<p>-Person B has a further distance to travel overall </p>
<p>-So if a person is standing in the ravine, person b would appear to be going the same speed as person A would look to someone on the straight line </p>
<p>So what would person B look like to someone on the straight line looking down into the ravine, and visa versa</p></div>		</li>
