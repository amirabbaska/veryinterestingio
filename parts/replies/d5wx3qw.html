			<div class="markdown"><p>So I just google what all these were and put them down. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bleeding</li>
<li>Infection</li>
<li><strong>Amniotic fluid embolism</strong> -When amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, or other debris enters the mother's blood stream via the placental bed of the uterus and triggers an allergic-like reaction.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Peripartum cardiomyopathy</strong>-
a weakness of the heart muscle that by definition begins sometime during the final month of pregnancy through about five months after delivery, without any other known cause. Most commonly, it occurs right after delivery. It is a rare condition that can carry mild or severe symptoms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH)</strong> - Babies give you high blood pressure. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abnormal placental lie (vasa praevia, placenta praevia)</strong>- When the placenta gets in the way of the uterus- causing severe vaginal bleeding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abnormal placental inplantation (placenta accreta, placenta increta, placenta percreta)</strong> - Placenta accreta occurs when all or part of the placenta attaches abnormally to the myometrium (the muscular layer of the uterine wall). Means nasty times trying to come off I guess</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Umbilical cord prolapse</strong> - occurs when the umbilical cord comes out of the uterus with or before the presenting part of the fetus. The concern with cord prolapse is that pressure on the cord from the fetus will cause cord compression that compromises blood flow to the fetus. Can cause fetal death and further complicaitons.(aka death of the mother)</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Uterine rupture</strong> - Your uterus literally rips apart. With a complete rupture the contents of the uterus may spill into the peritoneal cavity or the broad ligament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Placental abruption</strong> - If the placenta peels away from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery — either partially or completely — it's known as placental abruption. Placental abruption can deprive the baby of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cephalopelvic disproportion</strong> - when a baby's head or body is too large to fit through the mother's pelvis. It is believed that true CPD is rare, but many cases of “failure to progress”</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Dystocia</strong>- dystocia is a specific case of obstructed labour whereby after the delivery of the head, the anterior shoulder of the infant cannot pass below, or requires significant manipulation to pass below, the pubic symphysis.
Haemorrhage</li>
</ul>
<p>My uterus is sore now after reading all of this. Babies now scare the shit out of me.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some things to clarify/add:</p>
<p>W/r/t pregnancy induced hypertension, that usually doesn't kill the mother, and will usually resolve after birth.  If it gets out of control, though, there are two things that are dangerous for the mom (and also baby): HELLP syndrome and eclampsia (basically you develop seizures possibly leading to status epilepticus (never-ending seizure) which can kill you).</p>
<p>Vasa previa is where the umbilical cord lies over the cervix (the &quot;out hole&quot; for the uterus.  This is more dangerous to baby than mom because it cuts off the baby's oxygen/nutrient supply.  Placenta previa is where the placenta lies over the cervix.  This can be dangerous to both.  Usually in both cases you aim for a c-section at 36/37 weeks.</p>
<p>Umbilical cord prolapse is much more dangerous to baby than mom.</p>
<p>Abnormal placental implantation can potentially be dangerous to mom, but usually isn't something will cause the OB (obstetrician, aka baby delivery worker) to freak out.</p>
<p>Dystocia:  if you want to see an OB shit themselves and chaos break out during a birth, this can do it.  You have a very limited amount of time to get baby out if their shoulder gets stuck.</p>
<p>Breech position: this is where the baby is basically ass down, so if the birth is vaginal, the baby would come out ass first.  Not recommended and has a high rate of mortality for baby, but in resource-deprived areas it may be the only option.</p>
<p>There's also vaginal lacerations that can occur which could cause the mom the bleed out.  Gotta sew that shit up.</p>
<p>There's puerperal infections which are infections of the female reproductive tract after birth.  Good news: your cervix+vagina are a natural opening to the outside to let the infection drain, so we don't have to cut into it to drain it ourselves.  Add antibiotics and most women will do OK.  </p>
<p>You could go on forever with this.  If want to really be scared out of childbirth, just read about the normal physiology of pregnancy.  It really is like a parasite alien suckling on your uterus for 9 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With most of those things, it's the baby that's at risk or they are things where the doctor can save the mothers life even if it means the baby dies. Sure if the doctor did nothing the mother might die but they aren't things that cause the mother to die in modern times.</p>
<p>Out of 280000 births at our hospital, the only thing that killed a mother was an Ectopic pregnancy, I think there were two deaths from them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been working in anaesthetics on one capacity or another for over 10 years. I have never seen an amniotic fluid embolism and only know of one colleague who has. They are very rare.
I have seen less than half a dozen cord prolapses.
Abnormal placental implantation is far more common but is related to multiple pregnancies and a history of Caesarian sections. It is less common in first babies.
Dystocia and CPD are uncommonly seen (especially by me) due to Caesars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I'm that guy in the ambulance. I've always wondered, how do doctors know if the placenta is whole? I know protocol says that if I deliver a baby I need to take the placenta with me to the hospital for the attending physician to make sure it's whole. But is there a specific method for this, or do you just kind of guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preeclampsia and Eclampsia are probably some of the more common disorders on this list, after bleeding and infection, but are often overlooked. </p>
<p><strong>Preeclampsia</strong>- high blood pressure associated with protein in your pee (indicating some degree of kidney disfunction)</p>
<p><strong>Eclampsia</strong>- Seizures thought to be caused as a sequela of pre-eclampsia. Can be fatal to mother or baby or can leave mother in a coma.</p>
<p>So, if you aren't terrified of having a baby yet after reading all of this, look up &quot;perineal tears grading.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am a doctor, an anaesthetist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She's a doctor that makes you feel numb so it doesn't hurt when they cut into you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I regularly do obstetric anaesthesia - epidurals and caesars both awake and asleep. <strong> In a developed country, pregnancy and childbirth is very safe.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She does the regular kind of making-you-numb. Epidurals are where they stick a tube in your spine and put the medicine in the spine to make you go numb. </p>
<p>Caesars? I'll assume that is C-sections. That is where they cut the women's abdomen open and deliver the baby through there instead of having her push the baby out the vagina.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, things can go wrong, much like everything in life. There is simply not enough time or space to provide an accurate explanation for all these here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't always go as planned mom and/or baby end up dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a short list:
Bleeding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should be easy enough to understand. She bleeds too much. Without enough blood, she dies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When bacteria infects the mom. Sometimes they can be mean infections and kill the mom. (and baby)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amniotic fluid embolism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where the amniotic fluid (the water around the baby) enters the mothers blood stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peripartum cardiomyopathy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where, because of being pregnant, the walls of the heart get weak and the heart enlarges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and associated diagnoses of PIH with proteinuria (often referred to as preeclampsia), eclampsia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High blood pressure that is caused by being pregnant. Proteinuria is having protein in your pee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abnormal placental lie (vasa praevia, placenta praevia)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a woman is pregnant there is usually a normal place for the placenta to attach to the uterus. Sometimes it does not attach there. It can attach to the cervix (the opening of the uterus). Or it could be close to the opening but the blood vessels that go to the placenta are running across the opening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abnormal placental inplantation (placenta accreta, placenta increta, placenta percreta)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Placenta accreta is where the placenta grows to far into the uterus wall than is normal. Placenta increta is just like accreta but it digs further into the wall. Placenta percreta is where the placenta is digging it way all the way through the wall like it's trying to check out the other side. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Umbilical cord prolapse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the baby is born, usually it's born head coming out, then body and umbilical cord. With umbilical cord prolapse, the umbilical cord falls down so it's coming out first and the head is squishing it. This stops the blood flow to the baby, kind of like strangling the little guy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uterine rupture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can remember, this is where the babies head pushes out the uterus wall rather than coming out the hole that is already there (cervix). Or there might be a scar from a previous C-section and it bursts apart like a balloon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Placental abruption</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the baby is born, the placenta lets go of the uterus wall and comes out of the mom through the vagina. With the placenta abruption, the placenta doesn't wait for the baby to be born. It detaches while the baby is still inside the uterus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cephalopelvic disproportion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where the babies head or body is too big to fit through the mom's pelvic area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dystocia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where the uterus is squeezing like it's supposed to (contracting) but the baby isn't able to come out. This could be because the baby is facing the wrong way or other things that I can't think of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haemorrhage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is lots of bleeding. Not, &quot;ouch, I cut my eyebrow and there is blood all over my face&quot;. But more like, &quot;HOLY FUCK! IT'S LIKE NIAGARA FALLS!&quot; of bleeding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood loss during delivery is normal. The female body has an increased red cell mass and copes quite well with up to a litre of blood loss. Usual blood loss from a vaginal delivery is 500mL. This amount is higher with caesarians as there is blood loss from the incision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had 3 babies. 1 through the vagina. 2 through C-sections. There's a lot of blood involved and this is normal. Even though you feel like you are bleeding like a stuffed pig, it's very normal to bleed a lot because the body prepares for it by making extra blood. It's normal to lose 2 cups (give or take a TBSP or three) of blood when delivering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obstetricians are highly trained individuals who work with a team which includes anaesthetists, midwives and oftentimes neonatologists or paediatricians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vagina doctors who have a specialty of delivering babies often work in groups with the pain-numbing guy, a doctor who knows how to treat newborn babies (especially sick ones or dying ones) and a doctor who treats children/babies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll add here that maternal mortality in the USA is quite high and increased from 12 to 28 per 100000 between 1990 and 2013 . Pretty shocking when you consider, for example, that in Australia (a similarly-developed country) this figure is around 7.1 per 100000 on average and in 2012 it was 4.4 per 100000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lived and grew up in the US. I am not shocked, sadly. </p>
<p>Side story: My first son died at five days old because he was born too early. He was born at 28 weeks. He also had Downs Syndrome and Hydrops Fetalis (excessive water build up in the body - Do NOT image search it). His lungs were not developed enough to breathe on his own, his heart didn't work very well. His kidneys failed. It was bad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: formatting.</p>

<p>She screwed up the formatting and came back to fix it (which I will probably also do)</p>
<p>Edit: Yup, I did. And I fixed a few spelling errors too.</p>

<p>Stupid question, but I thought the placenta is what the baby is in? Like if the uterus was the sleeping bag, the placenta is the sleeping bag liner. Is that not the case?</p>
<p>Actually, now that I think about it, I've always heard of the placenta needing to be delivered after the baby... So, baby pops out of placenta and placenta gets left behind? Or have I been wrong all this time and the placenta is not like a sleeping bag liner at all?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok, amniotic fluid embolism is when something gets trapped in the fluid. Baby's hair or blood clots or something, then it gets Ito the mother's blood causing a stroke or heart attack.</p>
<p>Pericardium cardiomyopathy is when the heart fails due to strain from the birthing process.</p>
<p>Preeclampsia causes an ultra high blood pressure that shreds your internal organs, particularly the delicate kidneys.</p>
<p>Abnormal placental placement- if it's in the wrong place or grows into the flesh of the uterus it can rip open and cause massive bleeding.</p>
<p>Umbilical cord prolapse- the cord gets pinched off and strangles the baby. I think it can give the mother a stroke too, or burst and cause massive bleeding.</p>
<p>Uterine rupture- the uterus rips open. Massive bleeding, if you're very unlucky the baby starts falling out of the uterus into the abdominal cavity.</p>
<p>Placental abruption- the placenta rips away from the uterus. Massive bleeding.</p>
<p>Cephalopelvic disproportion- baby head is too big for the pelvis and gets stuck. If you are not saved with a cesarian you will eventually die of infection or physical strain.</p>
<p>Dystocia- iirc, something else gets stuck in the pelvis, like the shoulder. Sometimes the baby's shoulder gets broken when they try to free it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reasons for the increasing maternal mortality rate from the article. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three factors are probably contributing to the upward trend in maternal mortality and morbidity in the USA. First, there is inconsistent obstetric practice. Hospitals across the USA lack a standard approach to managing obstetric emergencies and the complications of pregnancy and childbirth are often identified too late. Nationally endorsed plans to manage obstetric emergencies and updated training and guidance on implementing these plans is a serious and ongoing need.5</p>
<p>A second factor is the increasing number of women who present at antenatal clinics with chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which contribute to pregnancy-related complications. Many of these women could benefit from the closer coordination of antenatal and primary care – including case management and other community-based services that help them access care and overcome cost and other obstacles. In the USA, women who lack health insurance are three to four times more likely to die of pregnancy-related complications than their insured counterparts.6</p>
<p>Another factor is the general lack of good data – and related analysis – on maternal health outcomes. Only half the USA’s states have maternal mortality review boards and the data that are collected are not systematically used to guide changes that could reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. There is no national forum for the states to share either their best practices for reviewing maternal deaths or the relevant lessons that they may have learned.</p>
