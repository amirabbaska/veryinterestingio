<p>EDIT-</p>
<p>NO!!  I just got the hiccups and did what you said and it's an epic failure.  I can barely type this as I hiccup.  I actually got on-line and looked up your response and took all that time and effort to tell you that your advice for hiccups did NOT work and continues NOT TO WORK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks.. I've been doing the hold my breath whenever i get hiccups and it works most of the time.. i didnt have any idea before but i just discovered it..</p>
<p>we have a superstition where you need to drink water if you want to get rid of hiccups, but i noticed was i don't breath when i drink, i experimented by holding my breathe as long as possible. and it worked.</p></div>		</li>
