			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that &quot;empty&quot; just isn't a very technical term. There is no simple, physical definition that correlates 100% with our common-sense notion of &quot;empty.&quot;</p>
<p>So I would give two answers, based on how you defined &quot;empty.&quot;</p>
<p>1) &quot;There is nothing there?&quot;</p>
<p>This question gets a little tricky. What is a thing? For example, if you hand me an empty bucket, I could say that it is filled with air. But we normally ignore the air. Similarly, if you hand me a section of vacuum I know it is actually filled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy" target="_blank">vacuum energy</a>. But normally we call that energy &quot;nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>So, in order to ask the question &quot;is this space empty of particles&quot; you must first tell me what kind of particles you care about.</p>
<p>2) &quot;Can I put stuff in?&quot;</p>
<p>This sounds like it is just a rewording of question (1), but it really isn't. Consider hydrogen storage as an example. Many metals - including aluminum - can store hydrogen (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_gas_porosity" target="_blank">hydrogen porosity</a>). When you add hydrogen this way, the metal doesn't actually expand very much. The hydrogen just goes in there, in between the aluminum atoms.</p>
<p>Does this mean the aluminum metal is empty? From the perspective of hydrogen gas, yes. From the perspective of my hand, no.</p>
<p>So to answer this question, you must tell me what you want to put in there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't there also a big issue where we aren't even necessarily aware of all the particles out there? Perhaps emptiness does not exist and instead there are ridiculously small particles that completely compose space. Isn't this possible?</p></div>		</li>
