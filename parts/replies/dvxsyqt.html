			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually you could record the video. My last flight we did not have the screens on the back of the seats. You had to download an app to watch the movies once you were in the air. Well since I have an unlocked phone with root access I was not able to use the app. The app would see that I had root access and kick me out. So since I have root access I could have recorded any movie I wanted. </p></div>		</li>
