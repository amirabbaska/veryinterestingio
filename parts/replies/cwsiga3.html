			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to clarify something really quick. There aren't many (if any at all) who completely deny the holocaust ever happened. Most holocaust deniers claim that the holocaust is greatly exaggerated and that it didn't happen how most accounts claim it happened.</p>
<p>To be clear though, I'm not a holocaust denier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught about the holocaust at school, believed it 100% I thought hitler was a sick fuck.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across David cole <a href="http://youtu.be/aQjNs-Ght8s" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/aQjNs-Ght8s</a> </p>
<p>I watched that and was confused - how come  I was never told that the gas chamber at Auschwitz was in fact built by the soviets after the war?</p>
<p>That the reason for the massive piles of clothing, footwear and hairless prisoners was due to the delousing procedure. A procedure used to keep prisoners alive? Wtf weren't they trying to kill them?! </p>
<p>Then I read the book by David Irving, Hitlers war </p>
<p>Followed by The transfer agreement by Edwin black..</p>
<p>Now I don't know what to fucking believe</p>
<p>EDIT: The title of the post was clearly a question asking how people can have alternative views on events which are otherwise well documented - I stated how one could come to the conclusion using my own experiences and i was down voted. Are people upset with my experiences? Or upset with the material posted? I'm confused :s </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lachlannn, gas chambers and incinerators destroy a lot of evidence and allow people like David Cole to make up stories. But what about all the Jews (including little kids) who were lined up in front of mass graves during the early years of the war, machine gunned into those pits, and then buried, sometimes merely wounded and still alive? Around 20,000 skeletons were dug up at one site alone. Why would you think people who would do that wouldn't also gas Jews if they thought that would be more efficient? The impulse to murder innocents is still the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shitty teacher/curriculum. I was taught that it was rebuilt by the sovietsn</p>

<p>Keeps it off the guards. That wasnt the reason though. Clothing and footwear could and was reused, and hair was used in fabric manufacturing. Every scrap that the SS could use was used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're more likely revisionists but of course any questioning like that and you're labelled an anti semite and call a denier to discredit them. When you have concentration camps reducing the numbers killed themselves it's confusing what to believe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The truth is a north Korean is confronted routinely with fake evidence that their leader has divine powers and that there is starvation in America. A sufficiently repressive government can force all sorts of crzy ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is starvation in America... look at parts of Detroit, the skid rows and tent cities in various states.  We see countless photos of it and more importantly, you can go see it with your own eyes.  What have you seen of North Korea though?  Have you been there yourself?  Whose testimonies have you read?  Have you seen photos? Are they worse than the U.S's poorest places?</p></div>		</li>
