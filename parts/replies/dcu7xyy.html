<p>by definition, if you're in a coma you are unconscious i.e. not dreaming  </p>

<p>So are the dreams people who have been in a coma experience all the result from brain activity during waking up from the coma?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd add only a few things. First of all, the speech/language cortex holds most of the verbal memory. The same for the motor and sensory, as well as parietal spatial relationships and skills.</p>
<p>We know for a fact, that if those cortical areas are severely damaged by ischemic strokes, those specific, structure/function areas lose those skills, memories.</p>
<p>So, as visual cortex holds a great deal of the visual memories, for comparison as LTM (Long term mem.), the visual memories are very likely also to be lost, just as they are in the motor, sensory, speech, and even in the FFA, which makes us able to ID faces.</p>
<p>So, yes, we could still dream, but those dreams requiring an intact visual memory would be impaired to the extent the visual cortex was damaged.</p>
<p>This is straight, structure/function relationship work, which is how we know what areas of the brain do what functions. It's been developed highly over the last 100 years. to which CT MRI and fMRI have recently added a great deal more. </p>
<p>So, yes, very likely the visual aspects of dreaming would be as damaged as the visual cortex which holds such memories, which are the MAJOR source of memories, upon which our dreams are based. So would language, sensation and spatial relationships, too, be lost in dreams, were those areas damaged.</p>
<p>That's how the brain works in short.</p>
<p>it's a meaty, insightful question.</p></div>		</li>
