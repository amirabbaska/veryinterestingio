			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the complaint was that the shuffle would sometimes play songs from the same album/artist too close together. Say you had 10 albums, 100 songs. It would create a shuffle playlist out of those 100 songs, so you never had repeats, but you might have songs from the same album playing next to eachother. </p>
<p>They changed it so that you never have repeats AND you are less likely to have songs on the same album play one after the other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shuffle <strong>was</strong> random, that was the problem.</p>
<p>Let me clarify with an example:</p>
<p>If your music library consists of 10 artists with 10 songs each, it's highly likely that you will hear 4 or 5 songs by a single artist before you hear at least 1 song from every artist.  That how randomness works, and it's not what people generally expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I develop procedural 3d art for video games and we use a &quot;controlled random seed&quot;. </p>
<p>It means that the stuff we &quot;randomly&quot; generate is actually controlled by a number that we assign as an input to the tool so that we can always avoid having duplicate or repeating results as well as always be able to go back to a randomly generated result.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://nomoreretake.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wedge04.jpg" target="_blank">Pretty much like this.</a> The number of the random seed will always generate the same results, but because the random seed has no limit the results can always be unique. However with complex tools with multiple random seeds/inputs its hard and sometimes even impossible  to go back to previous results, but atleast they never repeat.</p></div>		</li>
