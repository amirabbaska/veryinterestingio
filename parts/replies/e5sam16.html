This effect wouldn’t be as relevant to initial radiation sickness though surely, as that’s just from primary cell damage </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am quite sure it is. While you severely suffer from this kind of sickness if 1 cell in a million die from primary cell damage, an organism with 1 million cells would just see a single cell dying... And the smallest animals have a few hundreds of cells, so you would be already dead while just a single of their cells began apoptosis or necrosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is true. If they died when one cell ruptured they would never have evolved.
The one in a million cell in humans is usually a high speed dividing cell though, skin, hair, gut lining etc... if smaller organisms had fewer long term static cells (grey matter, osteocytes etc), and more of these fast mitosing cells, surely this would make their DNA more susceptible </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's to say that an orginism with 1 million cells would only lose one? How does that translate from a human to a smaller organism? </p>
<p>I hope that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would we actually die if just 1% of our cells died, say evenly distributed amongst us? I mean they can reproduce and heal in most all cases. Unless you were unlucky and it was 1% of your cells but the entire 1% was your heart or brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leaving out bacteria in and on our body 1% of our cells means ~600g of cells of an adult weighting 60kg. On the one hand this sounds like a lot, on the other hand I don't know how many cells die and get replaced every single day, especially on organs like skin. </p>
<p>We also know that even very complex organs like the brain are able to adapt and recuperate from massive loss of tissue as long as it's a process that's slow enough. There was a <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-man-who-lives-without-90-of-his-brain-is-challenging-our-understanding-of-consciousness" target="_blank">man who is missing 90% of his brain and he's still living a normal life.</a> A condition like this would kill people if it would happen in a short time. </p>
<p>Sadly I don't know an answer to the original question but I'm staying here to wait if maybe someone else can answer it. </p></div>		</li>
