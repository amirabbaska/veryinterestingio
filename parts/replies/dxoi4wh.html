			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if there is a reversal here... I understand a mutation becoming dominant, but what if it was more chance that we shared such a trait that made us great hunting partners, rather than a quick evolution? </p>
<p>To counter my own position, eye mutations spread rather quickly. ~10k years ago the first blue eyed person appeared and they now account for something like 17% of the world population, despite the gene being recessive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trait could have theoretically evolved independently. But it is still something that is unique to humans among other primates.  So it's evolution is still likely tied to some part of our story not shared by any other primate.  And so this type of pack hunting with wolf companions certainly seems like a logical choice for how this trait came to be dominant.  But it is by no means a certainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed... I often try and reverse scenarios around to see if they are still plausible when one switches the sequence or cause around a bit. I first learned this technique when we were presented with data that essentially claimed something like &quot;20% of people who smoke marijuana drop out of high school&quot;, when &quot;20% of people who dropped out of high school smoke marijuana .&quot; is an entirely different way of explaining the same data but subatantially changing what the same numbers might actually mean... As it goes from indicating that if you smoke marijuana you are more likely to drop out of high school... To meaning that if you are a person who might be on the path already to drop out of high school, you have a higher chance of also smoking marijuana.</p>
<p>It is a really fun technique when presented with any type of data that is more speculative in nature, things that are dubious or hard to prove with strict science, or scenarios where the underlying assumption relies on some sort of percentages. In this instance, we could likely trace back when such a mutation might have happened and try to correlate it with our shared habitats and relationships with canines, but it still would require a bit of guess work and, in the extreme, could be a solid and well known case for a symbiotic evolutionary relationship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it wouldn't really matter if the wolves were involved or not. It seems reasonable that the white sclera would benefit a hunting group of just humans to allow for silent and motionless communication. Where hunters could stop, and within peripheral of each other's eyes, could identify where each other were looking with out having to point, or gesture, would minimize unnecessary movement and make them more formidable pack hunters.</p>
<p>IF this is true, then I could see how hunter-gatherer humans would already have the white sclera prior to any domestication of other animals for hunting.</p></div>		</li>
