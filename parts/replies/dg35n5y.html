			<div class="markdown"><p>He made several mistake. First of all he is talking about the geometry of space (not to be confused with the shape of the universe). The geometry of 2D object is easy to understand, the geometry of space itself is a bit more abstract so we use 2D term as analogy.</p>
<p>There is 3 possibility. Space can have a positive curvature (shape of a sphere), negative curvature (shape of a saddle) or flat (shape of a piece of paper). Draw a triangle on a piece of paper, the angle will add up to exactly 180. Do the same on a sphere and the angle will add up to more than 180. Do the same on a saddle and the total will be less than 180. </p>
<p>Now the complicated part. If you look at the CMB (cosmic microwave background). There is some blob in it where matter in the early universe was close enough of each other to mix up more. Scientist can calculate the distance between 2 points on the CMB (don't even ask me how they can do that). We can also measure the distance between us and these points on the CMB.</p>
<p>So now you have a triangle. The base is the distance between the 2 points and the two sides of the triangle is the distance between us and the 2 points. Now we can calculate the angle between these two points should be if the universe is flat and compare that to what angle we measure. The angle we measure is almost perfect, meaning that the universe is almost perfectly flat.</p>
<p>Think of it as the way light travel through space. Does it curve as it move along space or does it go straight. And so far it seem that it go almost straight. </p>
<p>Another way to see it is the mass/energy density of space. If the universe is very dense, then it will collapse on itself, which mean it's a finite universe. If the mass density is low, gravity will never be strong enough and the universe will expand forever which may or may not mean that it's infinite. If the mass density is just right, it mean that it will expand forever, but at a decreasing rate, which also may or may not be infinite.</p>
<p>If the universe would have been spherical we would have known that the universe is finite, but it's flat. So now we need to know if the universe is simply-connected or not. Again that's a 2D geometry analogy, but that's out of my league at that point lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not really a theory that involves a finite universe with an edge, so it would have to curve back on itself in order to make sense with a finite volume. </p></div>		</li>
