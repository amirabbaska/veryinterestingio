<p>It's not an advantage in an impact</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguably it's probably not a bad response to impacts we'd have experienced before the industrial revolution, like tripping or falling off a low branch or something.</p>
<p>It's just bad if you wrap your corvette around a lamp post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True - putting your arms out to stop you smashing your teeth out on the ground or getting ready to bend your knees and roll. Or even falling from a high branch and trying to grab others on the way down.   </p>
<p>Dodging a charging whatever-you're-hunting-for-dinner would be a sort of high speed impact best avoided by being ready to leap out of the way too.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  Tensing your abs up when you're about to get punched? Fine. Tensing up before hitting a steering wheel at twice the maximum human sprinting speed? Not so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, any force which your muscle fibres can withstand can be flexed against, otherwise, go loose or you'll over stretch (over tighten) and snap! Muscles are just like variable strength elastic bands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good in a combat situation, in general. Tense muscles prevent deeper damage from blunt trauma, and tend to be harder to cut through. It's torque and probably after a certain threshold of impact that tense muscles become a negative. </p>
<p>Really though it depends on the injury pretty heavily. High speed impact and torque definitely bad to tense up on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it right here. The tensing for impact reflex did not evolve to deal with situations involving the velocities and forces of a car crash.</p>
<p>Tensing is good for taking a hit from something made of meat not so much when you're in a metal and glass cage that was going 100kph.</p>
<p>You can see it in modern car design too. Old cars would survive a crash but turn the person in it into soup filed with broken bone bits where as modern cars have crumple zones and air bags that are all designed to distribute forces rather than resist them. Just like a limp body does vs a tense body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being limp isn't even the best thing in a lot of purely modern high impact events. Being limp and getting thrown around like a ragdoll can lead to some seriously nasty whiplash and they've shown that you're more like to survive a plane crash in the brace position than while asleep. </p></div>		</li>
