			<div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine! The arms are like &quot;waves&quot; propagating through the galaxy. At the &quot;peaks&quot; interstellar distances shorten and at other regions the stars are further apart. So a star that was part of the arm might not be part of it millions of years later when the &quot;wave&quot; has passed through it.</p>
<p>Edit: This &quot;wave&quot; triggers star formation too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, then if I understand right, the galaxy is disc shaped, but waves cause the outer rim of the galaxy to ‘bunch’ into arms as the wave passes through? Is this also true for bar-type galaxies with only two arms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's not just the center that has mass - the disc has mass also that is not evenly distributed.  Therefore local areas that are denser congregate as they orbit the center, forming arms.</p></div>		</li>
