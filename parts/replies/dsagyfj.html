			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, it’s important to note that while  it’s pretty clear the K-Pg happened around the time the non-avian dinosaurs went extinct, that doesn’t necessarily mean it was the sole cause of the extinction. With any global mass extinction, the causes are probably very complex and usually can’t be pinned down to a single event. Various other factors such as major volcanic activity in India that was ongoing for millions of years before the asteroid have been implicated in the extinction as well. In all likelihood, some combination of these additional factors had already destabilized global ecosystems, so that the impact occurred at just the wrong time to wipe out most of life on Earth—or just the right time, from the perspective of the survivors’ descendants!</p></div>		</li>
