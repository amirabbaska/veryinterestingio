			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, I should have touched on that. In order to describe a spacecraft's position, you first have to describe the coordinate frame you'll be using. The coordinate frame can be whatever you want, but some coordinate frames make more sense than others. But any coordinate frame has to define where the origin is (which has coordinates [0,0,0]) and at least two of the three axes (the third can be deduced).</p>
<p>If we're talking about a spacecraft in Earth's orbit, we typically use a coordinate frame with the origin at the center of the Earth, an x-axis in the direction of the vernal equinox (basically, the intersection of Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun), a z-axis that points through the North Pole, and a y-axis that is perpendicular to both the x and z axes. It might look something like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AYFsIy2.png" target="_blank">this.</a> I wouldn't worry too much about the specifics, but that's a typical way a coordinate system is defined.</p>
<p>You'd need to describe 3 things in that coordinate system: position, velocity, and attitude (which is theme thing as orientation). All three are going to use the same coordinate system.</p>
<p>Position is described as three numbers, an x position, y position, and z position. Just like describing where a dot is on one of these <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Pvwoxh5.jpg" target="_blank">number planes,</a> just with an extra dimension involved. Position might look like [8000 km, 7000 km, 9000 km].</p>
<p>Velocity is similar. The velocity describes the spacecraft's speed and direction of motion, but described in the same 3 coordinates. Basically, how fast it's moving in x, how fast it's moving in y, and how fast it's moving in z. It might look something like [5000 m/s, 1000 m/s, 2000 m/s].</p>
<p>Attitude gets tricky, and there are a lot of ways to describe it. There are Euler angles, rotation matrices, and quaternions. Let's just focus on Euler angles because they're the simplest to visualise. Yaw, Pitch, and Roll angles are used, just like for airplanes. Essentially, what that's doing is describing the angles of 3 rotations that would take the spacecraft from one reference orientation to its current attitude. The reference orientation is based on how the engineers define a &quot;body coordinate system&quot; of the spacecraft, but I wouldn't worry too much about the specifics there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not arguing space nomenclature with a rocket scientist but why do we call mars or pluto deep space ? Shouldn't it be near space and things 2 or 10 or 20 light years away be deep space ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We refer to anything outside the Earth-Moon system as deep space, because that's far for a spacecraft. Most are in Low Earth Orbit within a few hundred kilometers of the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>I'm guessing it boils down to this: engineers made the term. Mars and Pluto are far away to them if they're trying to send something there. And we usually send stuff to Low Earth Orbit. The planets aren't far to astronomers who are only trying to look at them and are used to looking at stars that are light-years away. If astronomers coined the term, &quot;deep space&quot; would probably mean something very different.</p></div>		</li>
