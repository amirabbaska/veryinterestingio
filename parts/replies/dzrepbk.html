			<div class="markdown"><p>So much went wrong in Grenfell, and the city is still reeling from it in terms of &quot;what next?&quot;. If you're really interested in fires, fire safety, and what the problems are, it's most certainly worth reading about. The Guardian has some good write ups/longer reads than the BBC, and it is still an ongoing investigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really curious about the status of the other buildings in the UK. When I was over there last year this was all still a huge deal and people were freaking out because despite a mandatory request for samples of cladding being made to all high-rises the majority at the time had not complied, and EVERY one that had complied, failed miserably.</p>
<p>Any word on how that went?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s apparently a push from government to ban certain types of cladding now but the actual initial report on the stuff didn’t even recommend that course of action. I get the impression this is such a massive clusterfuck that nobody really knows what to do.
Some ridiculous proportion of buildings in the UK are covered in material that is highly likely to fail serious fire tests ( or those devised since the events last year) but it’s such a web of confusion about what is or isn’t acceptable that the public are pretty confused.
The testing used even today is not exactly fit for purpose and a lot of the rules seem to get twisted and bent just to fit in with what councils need/want.
I mean the cladding on Grenfel actually passed a fire test, one which checked if it could catch fire from the outside through the aluminium cladding shell. That’s pretty pointless when you consider the inside of the stuff was a death trap and a ticking one bomb, yet the it still was passed and said to be safe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still an ongoing problem. People who are living in high rises are worried, and different companies and boroughs are taking different approaches. Some are asking the residents to pony up the cash for re-cladding. (there's a big case in Croydon regarding this). Honestly, IMO, there's not been enough done, and I think the gov and the big property companies are just hoping people will forget. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, the cladding that was basically covering their building in thermite, non-functional fire safety systems inside. Plus, from what I've read, the big reason so many people died was they'd renovated the building and put up new &quot;what to do in a fire&quot; placards around the building for modern fire codes where the instructions are &quot;stay in your apartment until help comes or there is literally fire in the apartment&quot;, because modern apartments are supposed to be able to keep fire from spreading between units for something like 30 minutes per unit, and stop it from spreading to hallways for a lot longer. But Grenfell had never actually been updated to those new fire codes, so people should have been evacuating, and by the time folks realized they were in a death trap it was too late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologise, but you seem to be quite confused on a few aspects about the Grenfell tower fire.</p>
<p>Firstly, it wasn't 'essentially thermite'. It was a combination of the internal layers of the cladding being flammable whilst the aluminium sheeting protected and funneled the flames upwards along the outside of the building. The problem was that the fire rating for the cladding was based on its surface flammability, and not that if you got the whole thing hot enough it would eventually burst into flames on the inside.</p>
<p>Additionally, the main reason people have should have evacuated was explicitly because the recent cladding added to the building compromised the existing compartmentalization. The main problem with this is that it wasn't widely understood that the cladding 'had' compromised the original design's fire protection measures (fundamentally this is the result of the disconnect between the lowest bidders installing the cladding,the management/ownership, and the actual residents). It had nothing to do with new vs old systems or schools or thought, because there was nothing wrong with the original structural fire safety elements of the building. It was entirely because the newest alterations were not properly considered to be dangerous. If the addition of cladding had not been made, then staying put would have been a 'relatively' reasonable course of action (though there is some debate over this as a generalized strategy). The fire would never have been able to spread effectively inside the building. </p>
<p>To better explain this: there was actually a fire at Grenfell several years earlier that burned out one of the flats but never spread any further. That only happened because it couldn't use the outside cladding as a flammable chimney.</p>
<p>Here is a write-up of a  conference of sorts that was conducted in the aftermath of the fire, if you're interested. I have a few other sources on the subject I'd be willing to share, though I think this one of the most comprehensive.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially this. We would (typically) set accountability in the building lobby and staging/recycling 2 floors below the fire floor.</p>
<p>Engines on the street hook into a hydrant and pump water into the fire department connection (FDC) which is typically a dual connection of 2.5&quot; intakes on the outside of the building. This supports the sprinkler and stand pipes.</p>
<p>The crews inside will take high rise packs (bundles of hose meant for highrises) up to the area of operation and hook them into standpipes (the water sources you see in stairwells that ware being fed from the street). </p>
<p>Most north American ladder trucks are between 75' and 110' tall so given that a floor is 10-12' and the angle that theyre operating at they usually max out around the 6-7th floor, sorry penthouse owners. Some European trucks go upto 300' tall but they still won't come close to the top of most high rises. </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges with high rise fires is the time it takes to get set up. Often times building elevators can be operated but if they're not in use you have to take the stairs. Considering each firefighter is carrying 50-100 pounds of gear even exceptionally fit members are not going to be running for more than 20-30 stories and once you make it to the top you still need to set up and do the job.</p>
<p>Fortunately modern building are equipped with sprinklers which are incredibly effective at stopping fire spread. Most large building fires I have responded to have been spent dealing with all the water produced by the building's supression system. Water tends to cascade downwards which is why most fires end with a small burnt area in one room and millions of dollars in water damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Backups/supplemental. If there's a fire but main water pressure can't be maintained (power outage, earthquake, pump station is also on fire), the engine can always hook up to the FDC to provide pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a few sprinkler heads, building supply pressure may be enough. For several popped sprinklers or in the event of a loss of power to the building's pumps or city water supply, you may need to flow from the truck or use the higher flow and higher pressure delivered by the truck's pump.</p>
<p>FDC connections can be charged in excess of 200 PSI permitting flows of 500 gallons per minute through a single 2.5&quot; hookup. A 2&quot; city line for an apartment building of some size might normally flow 50 gpm, and should never reach a household device above 70 PSI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they not have pipes for the fire crews incorporated into the build?</p>
<p>I never did fire training in the UK, but I have since I moved to France so can speak with some (very) small authority. Here, all the office buildings have &quot;dry columns&quot; that are there for the firemen to attach their pumps directly.</p>
<p>I don't know how high that would be useful though. Not more than 10 floors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will go inside and set up one or two floors below.  The key to this operation is the standpipe, the pipe you sometimes see running up stairwells.  This will be connected to the pump on the engine and used to supply water and fight fire.  So the engine supplements pressure/water to standpipe/sprinkler system, ffs connect hose and fight as if engine is right there.</p></div>		</li>
