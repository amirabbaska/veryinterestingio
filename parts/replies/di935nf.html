			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that by definition 'not unified'? One becomes inaccurate at v nears c, while the other doesn't. Sounds like Newtonian physics is plain wrong then, and serves at best as a rule of thumb—one accurate <em>enough</em> to describe lower v situations, but it is not <em>correct</em>, clearly.</p>
<p>If it were, there'd be no difference between Netwonian and Einsteinian physics, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being 'accurate enough' is the highest achievable goal for a theory.</p>
<p>Similarly having one theory be a 'special case' of another is the best you can hope for when you generalise a theory. Two theories can't be any more unified than that, without being essentially the same theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, Newtonian gravity is pretty much plain wrong. It's just that it's simpler to teach and use (because in almost all cases not involving space, it's good enough).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're telling me everything I've been learning for the past year is wrong -.-</p>
<p>If Newton's space stuff is wrong why do they even bother teaching stuff like Newton's law of gravitation etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you intend unified to mean &quot;the exact same thing&quot; then no they're not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I was being too charging. Apologies.</p>
<p>What I understand of 'unified' is no being synonymous, but rather that they both function (in this case by describing reality) without contradicting one another.</p>
<p>e.g. the statement 'birds need air to fly' and 'birds can fly on the moon' cannot be unified into one grand description of birds' behaviour, because of the premise that the moon has no atmosphere.</p>
<p>That is to say: they describe different situations, but when antecedents or consequences are explored, it leads to an eventual contradiction—they cannot be unified.</p>
<p>It's in this sense that I don't see how the two physics are unified: Newton's is functional in regards to everyday behaviour, but reach absurd <em>v</em> and it simply fails to describe at all.</p>
<p>Hm. Perhaps its not unification I'm wondering about, but rather whether or not Newton's is correct at all: it's easy, as in it's a shortcut because it's good enough, but when put to the test, it's simply inadequate.</p></div>		</li>
