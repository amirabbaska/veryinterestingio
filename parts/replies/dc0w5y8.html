			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, here in Florida our cold winter days are often cloudy days. Usually a cold front follows rain and a few days of very wet, cloudy, cold days. Then the sun comes out - this is the sweet spot because it's still chilly but if you go outside under the sun you balance out and it's pleasant. Then the cold goes away and it goes back to being a swampy steambath. </p></div>		</li>
