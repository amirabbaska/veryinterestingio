			<div class="markdown"><p>I see.  So the external pressure from the mass of the star that is exerted on the fusion core is also what keeps it from simply exploding?</p>
<p>I mean, is there an equilibrium point where the internal pressure from the fusion core and the pressure of the star's mass stabilizes the star and allows it to maintain its &quot;form&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are two types of pressure.  One is gas pressure, which is basically what happens if you heat a gas from inside a box but try and push the walls of the box inwards, you feel a pressure against your pushing.</p>
<p>And there's also radiation pressure:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure</a></p>
<p>In our sun the first one is more important.  But yes, our sun, and all stars, are in a state of equilibrium with gravity pulling mass in and fusion heating the interior causing both gas and radiation pressure out. As the star dies, the fusion reaction slows down and it begins to collapse.  What happens after that depends on the size of the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium" target="_blank">Hydrostatic Equilibrium</a> is what you're looking for.</p>
<p>Here's an example: Say your star's core begins to cool off a little. This leads to less fusion, and thus even more cooling and less outward pressure. </p>
<p>The inward pressure of gravity starts to 'win', and the star collapses inward. But only a tiny bit. When the star presses inward it drives up the density and temperature of the core, which leads to more fusion, and even higher temperatures, and thus, more outward pressure. </p>
<p>Now let's look at the opposite: Now your star has lots of fusion and a very hot core. The outward pressure is so great that it overwhelms the gravitational pressure, so the star begins to expand. If this keeps up, the outer layers of the star will be blown off.</p>
<p>But it never reaches that point. Because when the star expands even a little, it lowers the density of the core. Things cool off, and there's less fusion. Lowering the outward pressure. </p>
<p>Leading to collapse, leading to more fusion, leading to expansion, back to collapse, and then more expansion.</p>
<p>This is hydrostatic equilibrium. </p>
<p>The constant expansion and collapse of the star, with he associated changes in density, temperature, and rate of fusion at the core. </p>
<p>It all ends up balancing the inward gravitational pressure and the outward radiation pressure. Leading to a stable size for the star. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they'd probably go white dwarf to neutron star. Eventually everyone at the show will have been pressed up into the front and danced the fusion dance until they can't mosh anymore. At this point, everyone at the show will be pressed together as tight as humanly possible and still trying to reach the front. Due to Electron Degeneracy Pressure, thry can't compress anymore because <del>two fermions can't occupy the same quantum state</del> two bodies can't occupy the same space. They're now a white dwarf .</p>
<p>And yet, up at the front a few bodies <em>do</em> suddenly occupy the same space and become freak mutant humans. All the exhausted humans in the immediate vicinity freak out and dash through the crowd away from the show. Lots of people follow screaming im fear, but most don't see the mutants and just keep pressing to the front. More <del>neutrinos</del> mutants start forming and more layers of <del>gas get blown off</del> people run away until you're just left with a  few mutant freaks with plenty of room to just chill at the front without being crushed more.</p></div>		</li>
