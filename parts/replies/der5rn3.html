<p>There's actually quite a lot of foreign military members in the US at any given time. There's just not a need for them to have their own bases, so they serve on already existing US bases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest difference is that they're here in limited numbers because we're providing them a direct tangible service, usually training or expertise. It's much different than the US having huge independent facilities on foreign soil. We have the world divided up into combatant commands and are deployed in other countries on mutual agreement for force projection; they get our protection, we get to wield the big stick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah man I was a submariner.  Your force is extremely small (I think 4 diesel subs and maybe only 1 or 2 that are operational) but we had a Canadian XO train on our ship.  That dude was sharp and knew his shit.  He was calling range in his head (at my best it takes a min on paper, usually just let the firecontrol system Calc it out for faster and better results), and he was absolutely awesome to stand watch with.  Super nice guy with a great sense of humor.  Glad to have people like that as our allies.  Really can't say enough good things about my experience with Canadian and Australian navy personnel.</p></div>		</li>
