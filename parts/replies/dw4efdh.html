<p>Infant formula is so tightly controlled as to ingredients you can use, the parameters to the nutritional ranges are tightly controlled too, it's more just assembling a jigsaw puzzle. There is some satisfaction in that.</p>
<p>With the demand for wet blended/spray dried product in China it can be simplified further. A number of NZ dairy companies spray dry a paediatric base. All you need to do is add about 20% lactose to get a basic infant formula or you can add some other ingredients for more complex (!) formulae. Adding nucleotides, DHA or taurine can be the difference between a basic cheap formula and an expensive formula.</p>
<p>It may be different if you work for the likes of Nestle or Danone. I wouldnt know because the latter turned me down for, and I quote &quot;being too smart for the job&quot; (hope I don't sound bitter here. Lol. It was frustrating at the time) but I can imagine working with some world class researchers will be a lot different to a Chinese owned infant formula company.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun and job satisfaction developing a product for the Aus/NZ market that although still tightly controlled as infant formula, meant I couldnt dry blend but needed spray drying. This couldn't be done in NZ but ended up being done in Europe. Seeing one man's dream coming from paper to a product on the shelf is enormously satisfying.</p>
<p>However, that aside, I have a lot more fun developing nutritional products where I can develop to both regulations and my own creative side by marrying foods with proper nutrition.</p></div>		</li>
