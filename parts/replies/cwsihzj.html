			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point, they got the idea that &quot;the Moon Landing was a fake&quot; in their head.  It's sad to say, but it was probably on the Internet.  When discussions of the Moon Landing come up, they trigger memories of the notion that it was a fake, and they say things like &quot;It was a fake&quot;.  The memory that it was a fake is self-reinforcing, particularly when folks get upset that the person holds such an obviously false opinion.  That critical reaction reduces the impact those people's recollection will have on the re-consolidated version of the persons &quot;Moon Landing&quot; memory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think what OP might be more interested in is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">cognitive dissidence</a>, which explains how people can observe evidence against their usually impossible beliefs but still hold them to be true.</p></div>		</li>
