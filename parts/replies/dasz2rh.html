<p>&quot;Yeah... that's exactly who I want to be. Goodlooking, rich and super famous. If only I would smell like this guy, the rest would follow on its own!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like the kind of guys far more likely to buy certain types of high value beauty products... some hairy backed truck driver isn't a great appeal when you're selling style and sophistication either, even if it is to an outdated stereotype of a man's wife, and her doing all his shopping for him!</p></div>		</li>

<p>No rational marketing campaign would specifically cater or target <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/183383/americans-greatly-overestimate-percent-gay-lesbian.aspx" target="_blank">less than 3.8% of the American population</a>. Yes I know there are LGBT people in other countries but I doubt the proportion vastly varies. For example, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals compose <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dai/smr08/2015/smr08_203_2015#a3" target="_blank">3% of the Canadian population</a>.</p></div>		</li>
