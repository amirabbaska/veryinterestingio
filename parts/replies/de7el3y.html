			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the police in the US will play games with you to try to get you to incriminate yourself.  Once you are detained do NOT talk to the officers until you have consulted an attorney.  Don't even say 'I'm sorry' about ANYTHING or that can be turned around and used against you.  It cost me $35,000 to learn from that mistake.  </p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>I do not consent to searches</li>

<p>If you need an object lesson, watch <em>COPS</em> or any crime reality show, and see if you can get through an episode without shouting &quot;stop talking, you are making it worse!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada, asserting your right to remain silent or your right to a lawyer doesn't mean the police have to stop questioning you. Assuming you are being lawfully detained, they can keep asking questions hoping you'll change your mind and start answering. This was decided by the Supreme Court in a rather controversial case some years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is quite a bit of variation between western democracies, even ones that follow the British common law tradition.</p>
<p>I know in the UK, remaining silent can be used against you if you later decide to offer an explanation.  Basically the jury is allowed to infer you are lying after you had time to think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completly correct. Your right to have an attorney present during questioning only applies during custodial interrogation. (In this context) Meaning you have to be in custody, and being asked guilt seeking questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you are in custody, you don't have to talk to the police. The thing is that if you are in custody, and you express the desire to exercise your right to have an attorney present during questioning, then the police must stop asking guilt seeking questions. It is a very specific set of circumstances. LOADS of case law that applies to this subject.</p></div>		</li>
