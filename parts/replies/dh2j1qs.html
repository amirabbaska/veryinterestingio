			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer and I have wondered about this for many years</p>
<p>Is it fair to ask where the surface energy comes from, or what surface energy really is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an abstract concept that comes from the intermolecular forces at play. When intermolecular forces are stronger it lowers the energy density of something, this is a general statement rather than something specific to interfaces between materials, it is the reason why compound are lighter than the sum of their constituents and nuclei are lighter than the sum of their nucleons etc.</p>
<p>The stronger the bonds are then the more dramatic the difference between the energy density of the material when you include the bonds versus just considering the constituent particles of the material.</p>
<p>What that is a really awkward way of saying is that if a material is made up of strong bonds then it will have a lower energy than if it is weak bonds.</p>
<p>When we extend this beyond just a material bonding with itself we get the surface energy. It is a measure of how much potential energy is in the interface between the materials.</p>
<p>In the capillary (gonna use glass as an example) problem we have 3 bond strengths to consider. water-water water-air and water-glass.</p>
<p>Water-air is a weak bond and  water-water  is a medium strength, this means that a water molecule would <em>prefer</em> to be near other water molecules rather than air molecules since water molecules will pull more strongly  on it. This gives rise to surface tension where the water forms a shame that minimises the amount of contact with air and maximises the amount of contact with itself. Spherical droplets are the extreme case since a sphere is the smallest surface area shape (and thus minimum water-air contact) that the water can take.</p>
<p>Water-glass is a stronger bond than water-water so the inverse happens, a water molecule will be pulled harder towards the glass than to it's fellow water molecules, i.e. it will have a lower energy density if it increases the amount of contact the water has with the glass. This causes the water around the edge of a glass to bend upwards, up the side of the glass. Since water-glass bonds are stronger than water-water then we can talk of the water being in a lower energy configuration when it has more water-glass bonding. Since the total energy of the system can be lowered by maximising the water-glass contact then it can be energetically favourable for the water to flow against gravity and up the capillary tube.</p>
<p>I hope that is more clear than before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a molecule is in the body of the liquid it has loose bonds to all the other molecules around it. These bonds are electromagnetic. If a molecule was to move to the surface of the liquid it would now only have these bonds on the non-surface side, the surface side bonds got broken. Breaking these bonds requires potential energy. Hence smaller surface area is preferable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wet paper does not soak up water because all of the cellulose of the chanels are saturated with water. Unless there is evaporation of water at the far end, as in leaves of trees, there will be no movement of water. </p>
<p>Paper is made by pulping wood fibers, pressing them together, and drying them (by oven, sun, or evaporation). The energy to suck up water by capillary action comes from the energy needed to dry the cellulose in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fuckin' love Reddit. It's 21:27 here, and I'm pretty drunk, yet, I am reading about surface tension defeating gravity by the conversation of energy - reaching equilibrium, Newton's 3rd Law.</p>
<p>Even there are potentially thousands of miles of distance between us, I learn something new every day - or at least I get reminded that not just science have taken us so far, but it will take us beyond our (current) imagination.</p>
<p>Than you for your time and explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many forms of energy--kinetic, gravitational potential, electric potential, chemical potential, mechanical potential, etc.</p>
<p>Gravity is a fairly weak force. Chemical bonds, for example, keep your head from rolling off your shoulders due to gravity, and they do a very good job of it (we don't generally worry that gravity will win out if we aren't careful). Similar forces are at play in the napkin absorbing water.</p></div>		</li>
