			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is generally the correct answer but...</p>
<p>Where I work (broadband company) we have a netflix mirror in our NOC so most of the traffic stays in our network.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Netflix's buffering strategy allows for quick connectivity interruptions without playback interruptions.</p>
<p>Back in the day video streaming apps would download the entire video at your max data rate or a server-side restricted rate until the video was finished.  This prevented ever having to deal with buffering issues unless your bandwidth as shitty.  Then streaming companies were like &quot;not everyone finishes the video they are watching...lets figure out a way to only partially buffer data and we will continue to update the buffer so we can tolerate quick connectivity interruptions.</p>
<p>This has continued to get worse and worse over the years because these services have to pay hefty fees for bandwidth so in the end we have extremely short buffers that can tolerate only slight outages because if a user stops watching, they have wasted data and so the user experience suffers.  Netflix is not filled with nazis and they have a significantly larger buffer than most sites/services.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This- Netflix can push their content, especially their most popular content, down to the local level. As big as Netflix is, they're only offering some thousands of videos to stream.</p>
<p>YouTube has completely original content uploaded constantly. They have a hard enough time managing that firehose of data without trying to push it all downstream to the local level. They do use prioritization and caching... if you notice, most popular videos will load quickly while small videos with just a few views can often take a while. It's just totally impossible for them to try to optimize access times to all videos for all people the way that Netflix can. </p>
<p>The US Netflix library has about 5000 movies and 1000 TV shows. If you estimate a movie is about 2 hours and a TV show is about 10 hours, that's about 20,000 hours of video content. Youtube, on the other hand, has 300 hours of content uploaded every minute, or over 400,000 hours of content uploaded every day. They have about a billion hours of content that is watched every day.</p>
<p>The numbers here are literally mind boggling if you've never seen them before. Literally everyone else in the market is a small fry compared to YouTube when it comes to the technical challenge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix installs video content servers directly in your ISP's data center, so your streaming content is mostly travelling a very short distance and dealing with far less internet connectivity uncertainties.</p>
<p>ISP's agree to this because it cuts their costs as well. Your ISP would normally have to pay their upper tier backbone ISP for the bandwidth of your stream that has to be fetched outside of their network, but with Netflix's content sitting right in their data center, they pay nothing for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some good answers here. Another thing I’d like to point out is - Netflix app is usually it’s own client (say installed on Roku/Xbox One). The client can then make intelligent decisions about whether it is stuck or not and ask for a different server on it’s own. YouTube player on a normal web browser isn’t intelligent as browser is a generic client. </p></div>		</li>
