			<div class="markdown"><p>wavelength is important as well, that's why you use metal halide for veg and sodium for flowering, they produce more blue and red wavelengths respectively. Though I don't know if those are still common, what with the new led lights and stuff, been a long time since i kept up with that kind of thing.</p></div>		</li>
