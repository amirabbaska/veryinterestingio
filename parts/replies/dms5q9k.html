			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 60s and early 70s, high displacement coupes (muscle cars) were popular.

This is why trucks and SUVs are so popular today. The loophole allowed manufacturers to continue selling large, high value products by positioning trucks as passenger vehicles. </p></div>		</li>
