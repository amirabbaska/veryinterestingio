			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, yes. <a href="http://www.funnz.org.nz/sites/default/files/MycNotes4-FungiCubed.pdf" target="_blank">A fungus on a fungus on a fungus</a> for example. Also, parasitic wasps can be hyperhyperparasitoids, parasitoids of hyperparasitoids (tertiary hyperparasitoids). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19175445" target="_blank">Example</a>. There are also even higher levels but those are usually kind of weird, more like competition between two tertiary hyperparasitoids within a host and one eats the other, that makes it a quaternary hyperparasitoid but it's not like it is their usual diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool.  When ecology gets this complex I just wonder if it wouldn't be simpler to say that any ecosystem is a polyhyperparasitic whole, whose parts can display any variety of spatio-temporal overlap.</p></div>		</li>
