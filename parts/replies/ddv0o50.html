			<div class="markdown"><p>JS: Thanks for the kind words! As an undergrad in marine biology you are the future for the protection and conservation of these animals. My biggest recommendation is to volunteer and not be afraid to work really hard. My career started during college as a volunteer in the local marine mammal stranding network in FL and when a position became available I was their first choice. This also helps you learn if that is truly the career for you. I have learned over the years that every job, whether thought to be insignificant or not, is a valuable part of the mission and any member of the team should be ready and able to complete it. Regarding vaquita, I don't directly work on that species, but I know a lot of researchers from around the world are interested in this issue and are communicating with Mexico on this front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for the reply! I'm lucky enough to live near a research and stranding center, and have just begun volunteering. I'm happy to know I'm on the right track! Again, thank you both for your selfless work in the Entanglement Response Program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also suggest trying to go to conferences as an undergrad! Even just to watch the talks if you're not presenting. Meeting relevant people in the field is a great way to learn who is doing what work.  I'm sure there are plenty conferences on cetacean rehab. </p></div>		</li>
