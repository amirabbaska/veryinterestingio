			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I believe we only use Lithium-6 in the blanket.</p>
<p>The breeding reaction we want to happen is:</p>
<p>Lithium-6 + n -&gt; Tritium + He</p>
<p>I don't really know about other possible reactions - isn't my area of expertise. </p>
<p>I'd guess at lower energies you might get neutron capture Li6 + n -&gt; Li7, and possibly further capture/decays after that but I'd just be speculating talking about it more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>^6 Li + n → T + ^4 He + 4.8 MeV (exothermic, 7% natural abundance)</p>
<p>^7 Li + n → T + ^4 He + n − 2.5 MeV (endothermic, 93% natural abundance)</p>
<p>A neutron multiplier and moderator can be used to slow 14 MeV neutrons down to the &lt;5 MeV range where ^6 Li has a higher cross-section.  A mixture of lead and lithium is often discussed.</p>
<p>The ^7 Li reaction was responsible for enhanced yield of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Bravo#Cause_of_high_yield" target="_blank">Castle Bravo nuclear test</a>.  The bomb had deuterium and lithium, and they planned to breed tritium from ^6 Li via neutron bombardment.  Scientists assumed the ^7 Li didn't matter, and ignored it in their calculations.  However, it created some tritium and an extra neutron, which added to the fuel and made the yield three times higher than predicted!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know some designs for fission reactors use LiF-BeF2, because it's supposed to be good as a conductor of heat without needing excessive pressure. Since this is made with Li6, would this work for this application? Or would the Fluorine and Beryllium interfere with the neutron capture? It seems like it otherwise would be perfect for what you're describing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds interesting actually - but honestly it's outside of my expertise so I don't know.</p>
<p>I work in the plasma physics side of the fusion energy field - it's the nuclear engineers who are the experts in that area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's one of the blanket fluids people are looking at.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major candidate breeding materials consist of liquid breeders, mainly liquid metals although recently some attention has been given to FLiBe, and lithium ceramic breeders. </p>
<p>[...] FLiBe is another possible liquid breeder with the advantage of low chemical activity with air and water and no MHD problem for self-cooled concepts. However, issues such as corrosion, temperature limits, modest tritium breeding, poor heat transfer capabilities and tritium permeation limit its attractiveness. There seems to have been up to now only limited effort on conceptual design studies for FLiBe concepts in MFE reactors. For completeness, some parameters from the FLiBe blanket considered for an helical-type reactor (FFHR-2) are included in Table 1 [23].</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>D + ^3 He → ^4 He + p + 18 MeV</p>
<p>The products are all charged particles, which will eventually impact a solid surface at the edge of a reactor, heating it up.  It would be necessary to have cooling channels under the surface to extract the heat and create energy.  But...</p>
<p>D + D → T + p + 4 MeV (50%)</p>
<p>D + D → ^3 He + n + 3 MeV (50%)</p>
<p>The deuterium can fuse with other deuterium ions in the plasma, making some neutrons and some tritium.  The tritium can then react with the deuterium and make even more neutrons!  So ^3 He fusion isn't truly anuetronic, but has a lower neutron yield than DT.</p>
<p>p   +   ^11 B   →   3   ^4 He           + 8.7 MeV</p>
<p>might be truly aneutronic, but has a low reaction rate unless you get to really high temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the plasma still gives out a lot of heat to the reactor walls as you can't confine it perfectly. These wall components are all actively cooled by water running through pipes embedded inside of them.</p>
<p>In principle you might be able to extract the heat you need from that coolant water, but I have no idea how feasible this is from a engineering perspective.</p>
<p>While aneutronic fusion is interesting, it's important to note that the reason we are focussing on Deuterium-Tritium fusion is because it is by a huge margin the easiest reaction fusion reaction for us to do at the temperatures we can achieve currently.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4b.html" target="_blank">This graph</a> shows the cross-sections of various light fusion reactions as a function of plasma temperature. For reference the hottest temperatures we get with current fusion experiements are in the 10-15 KeV range, and the next-generation experiment called ITER (currently under construction) we expect to hit around 25 KeV.</p>
<p>You can see that in these temperature ranges DT-fusion is by far the easiest - so if we can't make a reactor that works well on DT, we have no chance of making one that runs on other reactions such as D-He3.</p>
<p>At some point in the future (likely many decades) if fusion experiments can achieve very, very high temperatures (in the hundreds of KeV) alternative fusion reactions are definately on the table - but for the foreseeable future DT-fusion absolutely the only option.</p></div>		</li>
