			<div class="markdown"><p>As an experiment you can do at home, get a bright flashlight at night and put it on a table and stand as far as you can. It will appear very bright, look from the side and you'll see there's lots of dust in between the flashlight and you (or you have an exceedingly clean house). You can even place small objects in front of the flashlight and if you look directly at it you may not even see it due to the light overwhelming the object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but black holes are too small in size for that to really be visible. They have a big <em>mass</em>, but their radius is so small that we can't really see individual black holes.</p>
<p>You see it more with big galaxy clusters, where it bends the light and gets you a magnified view of some distant galaxy behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the light that is headed directly toward the black hole does not pass by.  Even the light that passes close by is drawn in.  They actually proved the existence of black holes, in this fashion.</p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, though.  What is actually happening, light passing close to the black hole is absorbed. Light passing a little further away is curved by the black hole, which produces the distortion you see in this gif.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At some point when I was studying I encountered peculiar unit of measurement: g/cm^2. It took me a lot of time to wrap my mind what could it mean until I realized that it is actually measurement of distance (length). It is length of a cylinder with just 1 cm cross section stretched in outer space until it will contain enough gramms of matter inside it's volume to absorb particle. Space is so empty, it contains so little matter that this cylinder will stretch out for light years until enough dusts and particles will be in it's volume.<br />
This is how much (or rather how little) matter divides us and stars out there...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused as to what you're saying. g/cm^3 would be a measure of density, which would make sense given your description. Cylinder volume being cm^3. I still don't understand the g/cm^2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. He just explained the concept poorly (or doesn't quite get it).</p>
<p>It's called Interaction Depth, it's basically a way to compare interaction between two different materials of different densities (example: a kilometer of air vs a few centimeters of water could have the same 'interaction depth' if we're talking about what stops cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Maybe this site will explain it better:

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you have a cylinder that is 1 cm^2, then you take that cylinder and make it so long that eventually it will contain 1 gram of matter (the rest is vacuum/empty space). Because there's so little matter in space, it will be a very long cylinder before there's 1 gram in it. It has nothing to do with volume. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>g/cm^2 is &quot;column density&quot;. Density is g/cm^(3). If you integrate density along the line of sight, you get column density. Basically, it's adding up all the stuff along the line of sight to the object.</p></div>		</li>
