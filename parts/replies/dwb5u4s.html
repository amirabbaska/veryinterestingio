<p>Technically, yes, but I wouldn't start readying the tanks just yet. Extraditing people willy-nilly doesn't play well with those people's countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m guessing it’s just a terminology slip up, but this has nothing to do with extradition. This is the host country saying that a named person is no longer approved to be within the host country. It’s basically revoking a visa. </p>
<p>Also, it has nothing to do with tanks (or troops, or military actions) so I’m not sure where that comes from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By name. It’s essentially the host country saying “these visas that permit these names people to be in our country are no longer valid”. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a silly question, but did the UK <em>just happen to</em> discover that they're &quot;undeclared intelligence agents&quot; around the time of the poisoning of Skripal? If not, does that mean they were somehow OK with having known spies around until then? Why would they be OK with that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know a person is a spy, you can somewhat control what they have access to. Allowing limited information to be collected can be strategic.</p>
<p>It’s also a bit of “we knew about these people and you don’t know how long we knew about them, so how much of their intel over the years can you trust”. </p>
<p>Finally, it’s symbolic to the public. The visiting nation isn’t usually too put off by the expulsion of a spy, it’s a cost of doing intel work. They will insert new agents over time, or re-task existing ones. But to the people, it looks like you’re doing something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some speculation, since I know absolutely nothing about any of this: maybe the thought is that it's inevitable that there will be spies. It's probably better to have spies you know about and can keep an eye on?</p></div>		</li>
