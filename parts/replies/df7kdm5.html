			<div class="markdown"><p>Suffered a concussion about 3 weeks ago, like the other guy said, it's important for the doctors or paramedics to ask you some questions and see if your answers make sense or not. For example, in sports team, they will do the SCAT Card. (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool). If the player is unable to answer any of these questions or failed the test, he cannot go back on the field. Another reason is to ask the person if he or she feels any pain. One of the most dangerous thing about a concussion is internal bleeding because it elevates the pressure in the head and can have severe consequences.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor, this is an answer from my personnal experience and what I was told, this may not be as accurate as a doctor's answer or any specialist in head trauma</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffered a concussion at camp and I'm now recently realizing how horribly the nursing staff handled it. I fell backwards onto a skateboard ramp while on a skateboard (First time, fearless 12-13 year old) and hit the back of my head. I remember &quot;seeing stars&quot; and being very confused for a few minutes, then one of my friends pulled me over to the counselor and I went off to the infirmary. They asked me who the president of the USA was and I said Laura Bush. They gave me water, told me I must have pinched a nerve, and sent me on my way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A buddy of mine got in a street fight last year. Got a bloody nose and some bruises on his head. Walked away fine, was talking etc. He almost didn't even go to the hospital. His girlfriend forced him to go. When they got there doctors realized his brain was bleeding. They had to air lift him to a bigger hospital to do immediate surgery. He died later that night. Concussions scare the shit out of me. There truly is no way to know if you have suffered internal bleeding/bruising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here. Loss of consciousness is also an indicator of how severe the head injury was. If you were hit hard enough to get knocked out,  then it could have been hard enough to cause a brain bleed or contusion. Brain bleeds are particularly scary in that they can shove your brain over, and cause it to herniate, which can kill you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years after a car accident, I was at a neurological exam for a seperate injury not related to the car accident. With the tap of my knee, the neurologist knew without my explanation, just by the reflexes, that I had been &quot;knocked unconscious in a car accident.&quot; He was correct, I had no side airbags and put my head through the driver side window striking the temple area, then was impailed up by the airbag for a second blow to the top of my head. He said the duration of unconsciousness impacts your reflex speed. Do you know where I could find more info on the reflex topic? I have never had any luck with web research on this topic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An indicator, but not a correlation.  Source: I rolled my car a couple of years ago, banged the gourd around pretty good.  After the accident I left the car and crawled a couple hundred yards (no memory of this).  Apparently I didn't lose consciousness, because the cops found me within about 30 minutes of the accident (people reported the noise) and I had made it pretty far on my belly.  I did finally did pass out after I was in the ambulance on the way to the ER.  Neuro told me later I had several brain bleeds. </p>
<p>EDIT thank you for kind thoughts in the replies and messages.  I'm fine, I don't think I'm any stupider than I was before the accident.  But if I was, would I notice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was eleven I took a fall from a brick wall. When I came to the middle school had just let out so I had probably been unconscious for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>My memory is slightly fuzzy, but I had thought I had somehow simply fallen asleep. I stood, walked about ten feet and collapsed as I was so dizzy. The next thing I knew there was a woman and a girl from my church standing over me. The woman was there to pick up her kid. The girl told her my name and that I lived about a mile and a half around the corner. The woman tried to get me into her car, but I refused.  </p>
<p>I felt so sick that I could barely walk but she couldn't carry me. Luckily, we ran into my brother who took her information then ran me home. I had never been so grateful to be scooped into my brother's arms. He called my mom while my sister fought with me to keep me awake. I ended up vomiting on her.</p>
<p>Mom came home and took me to the doc. They wanted to do an xray, but I was so out of it and irrational that they sent me home. I remember being very very disoriented. It took almost 2 weeks for my dizzy spells and disoriented feeling to go away.</p>
<p>I know I had a concussion but do you think the doc not doing xrays and just sending me home was irresponsible?   This was 30 years ago so it isn't medical advice. I just have never quite understood what happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus staying conscious means that you are actively protecting your airway, fall unconscious and your tongue can obstruct your airway and if your mental status isn't normal you may suffocate in your unconsciousness</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, the main concern is developing intracranial hemorrhage. Yes, you may or may not have obstructive apnea, but unconscious patients cannot verbalize their headache or elicit a neurologic exam. Therefore, it would be much more difficult to identify a brain bleed, which would require emergent intervention instead of the passive watching that concussions are treated with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really good to know. Thank you for clarifying.
I got a concussion at a party once and just went to my friends bed and fell asleep. Woke up on the floor of my own apartment with no recollection of how I got there. I only has 1 glass of wine, so I wasn't even tipsy. My friends later told me that it looked like I was too drunk to speak so they took me home with a cab. I have no memory of that. The next day a friend told me my eyes were all over the place, like they were moving in weird directions. So I went to the doctor and they took a CT scan and found out that I had disorganized white matter. Something that just never gets better... That year my grades dropped and I was really having hard time focusing and was constantly getting pierced headaches for 1 whole year. I still have hard time speaking without stupid long pauses... Or following what people tell me. Something that was never there before </p>
<p>Concussions are real, and ruin lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you get the concussion?</p>
<p>Also, I hope you recognized it early enough. Any activity post concussion seriously hinders recovery. You need physical and mental test until you're fully recovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also heard it's not about being unconscious, but it's about determining if they CAN be conscious.  Like, if you've suffered a head injury and immediately afterwards you can't stay awake even when people are trying to keep you awake, that shows a LOT of damage.  So it's 'stay awake to prove you can'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, that's one part of it. Another big part is that sometimes a quick deterioration may happen several hours after the injury. And if the person is sleeping at that point, no one will notice until the next day when they're already dead. It's called a lucid interval, I wrote a more detailed comment <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/60mib5/eli5_why_is_it_important_not_to_fall_unconscious/df7r1ti" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>
