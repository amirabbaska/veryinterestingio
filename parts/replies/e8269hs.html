<p>Finally, recent studies based on paleontological data or comparative  anatomical evidence strongly suggest that the neocortex was already  present in the earliest emerging mammals.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain#cite_note-PrinciplesBrainEvolution-5" target="_blank">[5]</a>  In addition, although non-mammals do not have a neocortex in the true  sense (that is, a structure comprising part of the forebrain roof, or  pallium,  consisting of six characteristic layers of neurons), they  possess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallium_(neuroanatomy)" target="_blank">pallial</a>  regions, and some parts of the pallium are considered homologous to the  mammalian neocortex. While these areas lack the characteristic six  neocortical layers, birds and reptiles generally possess three layers in  the dorsal pallium (the homolog of the mammalian neocortex).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain#cite_note-PrinciplesBrainEvolution-5" target="_blank">[5]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain#cite_note-ReferenceA-7" target="_blank">[7]</a> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telencephalon" target="_blank">telencephalon</a> of birds and mammals makes neuroanatomical connections with other telecencephalic structures<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain#cite_note-PrinciplesBrainEvolution-5" target="_blank">[5]</a>  like those made by neocortex. It mediates similar functions such as  perception, learning and memory, decision making, motor control,  conceptual thinking.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I did not know that, thank you! Nonetheless the same page has a &quot;Lay interest&quot; section where it states how this is still an useful model for those beginning in neurobiology, so I will leave my comment as it is, this being ELI5 and all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My field used to be psychology, not neuroscience, so I'm not very qualified to disagree but I disagree given this is a thread on the nature of consciousness and an outdated model of the biological underpinnings of it is more trouble than its worth.</p></div>		</li>
