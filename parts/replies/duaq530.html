			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it does. What he said was essentially true, the problem arises from the misconception that placebo can cure anything. It can only treat whatever the hormones and neurotransmitters that we can mediate by a psychologicsl response can cure. So not cancer or serious diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read that the efficacy of placebo has risen steadily and consistently decade by decade, and the reason for this unknown and it's real head-scratcher. Is this true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain symptoms are actually very dependent on the state of mind. It's not just that people are lying or getting fooled while reporting it, people can genuinely feel better just by imagining (various tricks of visualisation) it or adopting a different state of mind. That's why placebo has reported to be the most effective for mood problems, pain, fatigue or nausea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Regression to the mean&quot;.</p>
<p>You're listing cognitive biases and sources of experimental error, these are not &quot;things that make up the placebo effect&quot;. You can control or otherwise eliminate these things as much as you like, the placebo effect will still be present.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists don't compare things to a placebo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trials might attempt to control the environment to such a tight degree that an effect beyond placebo can be demonstrated. The intervention may indeed be compared against placebo, or against a non-intervention group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they use the placebo to measure all of these hard to spot factors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really sure I follow you here.</p></div>		</li>
