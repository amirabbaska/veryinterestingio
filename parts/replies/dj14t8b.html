			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the electron flow, these solar panels are grounded (only assuming), therefore the electrons flow through the ground and through a wire that connects where? I've wondered how a field of solar panels can electrify a whole subdivision of houses, but where is that central campus where all the electrons flow to and give these houses electricity? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The panels are connected to Inverters that turn it into aleternating current and then it feeds into the electrical grid through a standard meter that works exactly like the one on the side of your house (but counts energy produced instead of used).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not necessarily grounded, they can have a DC Return (- or Negative) lead that is not connected to ground.  It's just that there's a preference in electrical engineering to tie some point of every circuit to earth so that everything has a common &quot;reference&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ground wire never has active electricity passing through it unless there is a short or the electrician made a mistake wiring it up. It is there for safety, so the frame never becomes electrified as that would be super danger city. The elections would flow into a hot or a neural wire, and wherever those wires touch again, (grid, battery, ect) the electricity will complete its circuit and flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep it simplified (and again, slightly wrong), there's electrons coming in the other side too. The power generated is not solely due to the movement of electrons, it's also due the potential/voltage across the solar cell. </p>
<p>The equation for power is P=IV, where I would be movement of electrons and V is voltage. Let's say a battery is connected across the solar cell. The battery shares the same higher potential and lower potential nodes as the solar cell, however the electrons enters the battery into the positive potential part, while the electrons enter the solar cell into the negative potential part. So, using the equation P=IV, one of them would have a negative P and one would have a positive P. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To use an illustration as well, think of the electrons as water in a bucket with two hoses running out of it and connected to a water pump. When the pump is off, the water doesn't move. When the pump is on, the water moves through the closed circuit of the hoses, and so moves out of the bucket, through the hose, through the pump, through the other hose, back into the bucket. &quot;Rinse and repeat&quot;.</p>
<p>That's essentially how electricity flows from a battery to the solar cell and back again, with the solar cell working as the &quot;pump,&quot; the battery is the bucket, and the sun is the on/off switch to the &quot;pump.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you leave the circuit open, eventually enough voltage builds up that the electrons are pushed backward across the P/N junction as fast as they get loose, so the current is tiny and it just kind of circulates through the cell itself. </p>
<p>As soon as you connect both electrodes to any load, though, the electrons pass through whatever device you're powering, and although they take the long way around, as many go out the &quot;-&quot; terminal as return back into the &quot;+&quot; terminal.</p>
<p>It's actually important to have a cell on what's called a &quot;peak power tracker&quot;, which allows enough electrons through that the cell is actually doing work, but not so many that the voltage on the cell is zero. Finding the &quot;sweet spot&quot; where the product of voltage times current is at a maximum (and therefore, the cell is doing as much work as it can) calls for some computation using exponents and such, back in the late 90s at least there were simple analog computers purpose-built for this computation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little to the above answer, the way the other elements are mixed in (called doping) makes the two layers of silicon into something like a diode, where electricity can only flow easily in one direction. When light knocks the electrons out of place, they go in the opposite direction, so it is hard for them to go against the diode and get back to where they started. In fact, it is easier for the electrons to go the other way, out through a wire, through the entire electrical grid, and then back through another wire to the other side of the solar cell. So, that's what they do, and along the way, we can use this electron flow to power our computers and light our cities and toast our bread.</p></div>		</li>
