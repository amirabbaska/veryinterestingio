			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a cool term to describe many of my projects. I'm drawn to old, simple vehicles, but I despise engines and their complexity. I'm fairly confident that I'm building things the way the original engineers would have it they could. A big old electric motor with some state of the art lithium cells really finishes off a 50s or 60s era vehicle nicely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you said, it's very simple to install and outputs a lot more torque (and hey better for the environment). The problem is that decent batteries alone can easily cost more than paying someone to rebuild an entire conventional engine. </p>
<p>Also, combustion engines really aren't as complex as they seem! Especially in older cars! they're startlingly primitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually rolls very easially for it's size, it weighs half of a Tesla. I've never really measured the power consumption with any real accuracy but I think it's about on par with a Tesla, around 3 miles per kWh. But I generally drive the Tesla like a maniac and I'm cruising slow and steady in the truck, I don't really trust the drum brakes.</p></div>		</li>
