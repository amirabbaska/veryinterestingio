			<p>Wikipedia's timeline seems to be wrong 480 mya was around the time of the Taconic Orogeny. Which certainly formed mountains, but is sorta in the middle of the Appalachian story.<br><br>The last Orogeny was Allegheny around 300 mya, this was essentially the closure of the Iapetus ocean and formation of Pangaea.<br><br>An interesting thing to note is that the tallest Appalachian mountains were not overtop current mountains, rather they were over Richmond, DC, and NYC.</p>		</li>
