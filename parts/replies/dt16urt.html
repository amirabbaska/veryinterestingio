<p>It may even change year-to-year in your town/city depending on if they farm out the contracts to private companies and the bid-holder changes or your municipality may upgrade their facilities and change protocols.</p>
<p>Great advice!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it depends on your city &amp; their recycling equipment. Usually the grease/food residue is the concern. A little bit of cheese might not be a problem, but that's hard to educate. Easier to just ban pizza boxes than risk idiots leaving boxes covered in greasy crap that could foul the process. </p>
<p>City differences Ex: My city has outdated P.I.T.A. bags for recycling, but recently started accepting plastic bags/film - which most don't. </p>
<p><em>Source:</em> I work in the Environmental industry &amp; have worked with multiple cities &amp; recycling contractors. </p></div>		</li>
