			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, we kind of try to have it both ways. It is pretty weird when you think about it. The degree to which laws can differ from state to state or even from municipality to municipality can be staggering.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm going to assume it's from Americans who don't even know what the EU is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it is, and that's by design. None of the states could really get along at the beginning and we still don't. It's why &quot;states' rights&quot; is such a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's soo nice and handy, it's great. They'll even send you the voting info booklets with all the candidates and proposals on it. Granted it's just a blurb and one should still do more independent research, it's miles better than nothing. Great for us night shifter who are usually not awake to pick up a packet at the library. </p>
<p>But as some who handles a lot of mail for work, fuck those voter pamphlets, shits heavier than sin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they have mail ballots and early voting almost everywhere. In my state, early voting extends 2 weeks prior to election day, including weekends. Not having time to get out to vote is a ludicrous argument. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, but voters can also be purged for other reasons, like if there's a mistake with their registration. I think some of the ones in Georgia were purged for &quot;mismatched signature&quot; or lacking a signature altogether. </p></div>		</li>
