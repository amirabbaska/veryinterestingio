			<div class="markdown"><p>To an extent it does - in many of these 'discomfort' sounds the spectral content (frequencies that make up the sound) is not harmonically (or mathematically for eli5 purposes) related.</p>
<p>Musical instruments, which could be much louder and have much of the same frequency content as these 'discomfort' sounds, sound pleasant because their frequency content is harmonically (mathematically) related. When an instrument needs tuning, this harmonic relationship starts to diminish and subsequently the instrument sounds odd i.e. out of tune.</p>
<p>There are spectral processing applications (a company called Izotope makes this kind of stuff) where you could take a recording of, say, finger nails on a chalk board, remove some of the inharmonic frequency content and upon playback you will/may have a more pleasant sound to listen to.</p>
<p>Also, to add to the first point about sensitivity, have a look at the Fletcher Munson curves/Equal Loudness Contours.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Musical instruments produce the harmonic series.  This is normally constructive and pleasant to listen to if amplitude (energy) stays at reasonable levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think with music though that what is pleasant sounding is influenced by one's surroundings/culture? As a screamo/metalhead, dissonance and general loud scary-ness don't bug me in music, just the opposite. Maybe I'm just an aural masochist haha</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if it's really innate related to the harmonic series or if it's more of learned phenomenon that seems innate because of how distinctly society perceives different good/bad sounds as you grow up? Good old &quot;nature vs nurture&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when it comes to sounds doing weird things like annoying us, or breaking glass, or making non-newtonian fluids move in strange ways, the frequency is usually the culprit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I pictured a bunch of phonograph needles scraping against a bunch of records all at once, all of which are Lou Reed's &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; played at 77rpm.</p>
<p>I unironically listen to that album as much as I listen to Yo-Yo Ma play Bach btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of loudness? For sure styrofoam is way worse. I'm imagining a sharp chef's knife with a flat edge being dragged against a sheet of steel with the whole edge touching the metal. As horrible as that sounds, rubbing broken styrofoam that is used to pack TVs is extremely loud. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Like pulling out a drawer from a freezer or scraping ice of a windshield.</p>
<p>No one else cares about those sounds too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure the same principle applies to an extent, but there are probably other issues going on with all us that make our perceptions unique.  Things you aren't even necessarily aware of.  Associations with the ice scraping that are subconscious but harken back to a bad experience you once had with an ice scraper in a dark alley.</p></div>		</li>
