			<div class="markdown"><p>My comment got removed because it was an anecdote and I don’t know it couldn’t be shared sorry about that! Here it is as a reply in order to comply with the rules:</p>
<p>My girlfriends cousin suffers from this. One day he sent her a video about how it works online and ever since then it seems to have gotten worse. He is always looking around and says out loud most of the time that people are after him. Any time he passes a high building he points out that someone could use that as a good spot to snipe him. He will look out the window ever few minutes to make sure nobody is messing with his car or coming up to the door. The poor dude left his city, Oakland, to move a couple hours away to try and escape it, but it didn’t help in his head. Every so often he will call out my girlfriend like she is apart of it and he does the same thing to her grandma. He regularly thinks someone is messing with his stuff and will take everything out of his bag to examine it. It really sucks because he is not the type to ever get help and will probably never get the attention he needs to fix the problem </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because he sounds like he has schizophrenia. If your mind has the illness, it would necessarily impact your ability to make rational judgements about health. It's a horrible illness because how are you even supposed to deal with it? It's affected your very core and mental state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure your gf understands she cannot help. She should avoid all contact if he is building any part of his delusions around her.  Don't deny, don't make an appeal to logic. Do Not Engage. Get out of his line of sight. Trust me, I have a friend who put me at the center of his conspiracy and he has hassled me and family and friends for over a decade.  </p></div>		</li>
