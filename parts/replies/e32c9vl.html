			<div class="markdown"><p>In some sense it is always surprising how well the theory and the preditions of Einstein's General Relativity work.<br />
Even close to one of the most extreme objects we can imagine, a supermassive black hole, the laws of physics work and govern the motion of the stars. Despite beeing 100 years old, Einstein's theory so far has passed all tests with flying colors.  </p>
<p>The effects of a black hole on its host Galaxy are the matter of intensive research. There seems to be a connection between the growth of the central parts of a Galaxy and the Black Hole.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you clarify what you mean by the &quot;growth&quot; of the center of a galaxy? Does that have to do with how mass and/or speed affects time? Or does it mean something else like how planets and other bodies form?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's to do with star formation. Tidal currents from the supermassive black holes are probably dragging clouds of matter into each other and causing star formation. Many of these are probably then thrown clear by the gravitational slingshot effect and end up orbiting the black hole our here in the less-dense areas of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Consider how rare it is for matter far from any super-massive black holes to actually ever coalesce into stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does every galaxy need to have a supermassive black hole in its center to hold it together, or can it be held together by its own collective gravity (I'm a relative layman so I hope that's the correct term)?</p>
<p>Since I'm late to the party I'm chaining this to a higher comment even though its not related. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you always have to try to poke holes in theories. No matter how successful. Perhaps they thought this would be a good place to look for holes in the theory that would enlighten us in ways that let us develop a better version of the theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GR works incredibly well; we also know for a fact that it's incomplete and breaks down in extreme conditions and we need a deeper and more fundamental theory that will combine GR with quantum mechanics.  So trying to break GR with ever more extreme observations and tests of it is useful, since if we can find any deviations from GR, it'll give us clues about how to develop that deeper theory that we need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We confirmed general relativity as already many other experiments have done. You could call this &quot;un-surprising&quot;. Really surprising would have been if we would have found a conflict beween the theory and our observations. </p></div>		</li>
