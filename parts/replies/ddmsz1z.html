<p>This is wrong.  Virtual particles pop in and out of existence at the event horizon all the time.  The whole notion of Hawking Radiation (the process by which black holes decay) is that virtual particles which would otherwise annihilate pop in and out on the event horizon with a very slight preference for the anti-matter side to go into the black hole (made of normal matter - the opposite if the black hole were made of anti-matter) while radiating matter with a similar process for light.  The net effect of which is the black hole decaying over time - meaning a matter + anti-matter black hole colliding would in fact annihilate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No there is no preference for matter or antimatter in hawking radiation, also the virtual particles have nothing to do with what there is inside the bh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... considering we dont really know what happens to the matter inside the black hole, as you say yourself i think the more fair statement would be &quot;we dont know&quot;.</p>
<p>And i dont think we can claim that whatever happens inside cannot affect event horizons either.</p>
<p>Tangentially, i find it interesting that they still exhibit gravity.
Sure, sure, energy is mass but still, that is something that is getting out even if gravity may be just a curvature of space time. </p>
<p>And from that we can atleast assume that property of &quot;mass&quot; remains inside. It is not destroyed.</p></div>		</li>
