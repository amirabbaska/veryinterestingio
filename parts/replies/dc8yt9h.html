<p>When they campaign on a specific stance or issue, and then change it as soon as they're in power, it appears (and generally is) disingenuous. If they espoused that opinion during the election, they wouldn't have gotten elected.</p>

<p>While this is often true, it's the result of an unfortunate practical reality of our electoral system: a policy position can be wildly popular, it can even have overwhelming support in your own party, but if a small fraction of your &quot;base&quot; opposes it strongly enough, openly supporting it may mean losing a competitive race.</p>
<p>(For example, this is why Obama began &quot;opposing&quot; marriage equality when he ran for U.S. Senate after having been a strong supporter of it as a state senator. A majority of Illinois voters supported it; an overwhelming majority of Illinois Democrats supported it; but there were just enough Democrats who opposed it strongly enough that he might have lost the election if he'd stood on principle.)</p></div>		</li>
