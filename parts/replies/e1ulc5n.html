			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, very true. And if something is that diffuse, it's going to be even harder to measure its effects, even if it was particularly massive, because it would be pulling in multiple directions and cancelling itself out.</p>
<p>If there was like, an invisible asteroid, we might have a shot, even if it was fairly small, by studying the orbits of nearby objects. But an invisible, touchless cloud is going to get tricky.</p></div>		</li>
