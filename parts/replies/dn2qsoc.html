			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being a Junior in high school taking calculus and having my mind blown when I was filling a water bottle at a water fountain. I was filling it from the fountain part not the actual &quot;water bottle fillers,&quot; so the bottle was tipped slightly. When you fill the bottle like that, some starts to spill out as the water reaches the opening. I always thought that meant the bottle was as full as possible and I would give up because I hated getting wet with nothing to dry your hands on (I was weird). I suddenly realized that if more water is going into the bottle than coming out, the bottle was still filling. That never had occurred to me before. We probably had just talked about that in class. Anyway now I could time it just right so that I could finally get my water bottle filled and not about 90% full, while still not spilling! I suddenly appreciated calculus.</p>
<p>The best part to me about this story though is I'll tell this story to my friends trying to convince them calculus isn't math in a normal sense. Not to be afraid of the name. Once a friend looked at me funny after and said, &quot;okay but I knew that,&quot; referring to the perfect bottle full. He's terrible at math in general, but the dude understood a variance in the rate of change in a limited volume to achieve something in real life. I mean you might think it's a small and insignificant part of your day, BUT it's still calculus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>calculus is the relationship between change (ie. rates, slopes, differentials) and content (ie. volume, area, distance, etc).</p>

<p>That is a great explanation, for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. The way I teach calculus to my students is that, at the heart of it, calculus is the study of change.</p>
<p>Derivatives tell you how &quot;fast&quot; something is changing in relation to something else, and integrals tell you the &quot;total&quot; change.</p></div>		</li>
