			<div class="markdown"><p>Less than 10% of known nuclei are stable, so it doesnâ€™t really make sense to not include those which decay. In the field usually draw the line at particle-bound nuclei, as I did above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not just neutrons (though they're largely neutrons), they're a mix of neutrons, protons, electrons, and maybe even some other more exotic stuff nearer the core (like quark-gluon plasma): the structure of neutron stars isn't terribly well understood, because we can't really observe them directly (they're too small). </p></div>		</li>
