			<div class="markdown"><p>Land surveyor for 9 years here. Those instruments are called transits, modern ones are actually theodolites. They can measure angles and distances, vertically and horizontally. So you start with two known points, you set your instrument on one and sight to the other, now you measure the angle and distance (Vertically also) to the unknown point and now you know that point. You then go to that point and back sight the one you were at and sight in a new unknown point. That is how you &quot;carry&quot; co-ordinates. You can also sight other points as you are set at each known point. The points you set up at are called stations, they may not even be points you want to know but instead are strategic points that allow you line of sight to the points you want to know. This is done in a loop so your final shot is back to the starting point. Then you compare what your last shot calculates to the actual know location and you can see how much error is in your loop, usually an inch or less per mile of loop (very accurate instruments). You then apply an adjustment to every point in the loop to average out that error over the entire distance you looped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Under the sun, sweaty, mud, water, dirt. Not to mention the setups of the theodolite and balancing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually done a small amount of surveying (I was the one holding the pole). We started from a point of known elevation and used a leveled sight to look at the pole and record the number it hits, giving the elevation of the pole relative to the sight. The leveled sight was then moved to the point of the pole and the process continued. All in all not as complex as your method but pretty involved considering it only provided us with an elevation value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't worry about it. I think that a large part of mathematics was developed solely to make this very task (and navigation) easier. In other words, there is a lot of math involved.</p>
<p>I was taught to use a theodolite in the Peace Corps about 25 years ago and the concept is as simple as they describe above. Doing the math without computers was a pain in the ass however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before electronic distance measuring, they had to use a &quot;chain&quot;. It's exactly what it sounds like. So, &quot;chaining&quot; a distance involved pulling a chain, setting pins at certain intervals to maintain a certain tension. Temperature also had to be figured as the chain would expand and contract with the temp. Distance could also be figured with a 3 wire transit or level.</p>
