<p>as u/pulchritudinousest said, definitely the latter.</p>
<p>edit: here's <a href="http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/saortho/chapter_74/74f2.jpg" target="_blank">rate of a specific kind of cancer in dogs with age</a>.  Same general trend.</p></div>		</li>

I am currently working towards a degree in electrical engineering (I want to work with very tiny electrical fields) and was wondering if you could tell me more about what you do ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also read that purebred dogs are much more prone to cancer than mutts. Given that dogs have undergone much more selective breeding than humans, I would imagine dogs are, on average, more prone to cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain breeds are over represented in cancer. Golden retrievers,  boxers. We don't know why exactly but assume it must be genetic. It's hard to breed out/ avoid propagating unlike say joint problems and dysplasias, since most cancers only show up after the prime breeding age. Then certain breeds are over represented for certain types of cancer. Bone cancer in large to giant breed dogs. However there are breeds that i'd say seem less prone to cancer, like chihuahuas. </p>

<p>I wish they had done the statistics a little differently . They only number of registered dogs of each breed to the whole and then the rate of cancer to the whole. So you can get a sense of over representation but not a number unless you calculate it yourself . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about cancer in particular, but Muts are generally healthier than purebreds. Too much in-breeding and breeding with dogs that have similar problems (This of course depends on the breed, lineage, breeder etc...a lot of factors. Hell just having one of those dogs with crushed in faces is a huge problem and that's by design!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it wasn't doing intense research, I was just reading up on chow chows as I was buying one. They said that purebreeds have shorter life spans and tend to get cancer if they live long. Sure enough, my dog died at age 9. He had cancer but the vet said he died from old age, not the cancer. Similarly with male humans, if they live beyond age 95, there's something like a 99% chance that we will get prostate cancer. You won't necessarily die as a result of the cancer, however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is both true and incorrect at the same time. There are certain dog breeds more commonly associated with certain types of cancers, conditions, and overall physical health. Golden Retrievers are unfortunately highly prone to a tumor type known as hemangiosarcoma (tumor of vascular wall endothelium), but other dog breeds can develop this tumor type as well. Boxers in general are unfortunately widely known in the veterinary community for developing a wide array of cancers including neural, lung, and bone tumors, but are also known for their upper respiratory issues such as elongated soft-palates. </p>
<p>Mutt dogs have the advantage of a concept we call &quot;hybrid-vigor&quot;, taking advantage of the desirable traits of both parents while tending to eliminate undesirable traits through statistically lowering the chances of two parents of different lineages both having undesirable traits (which tend to be recessive traits).</p>
<p>Dogs are no more prone to cancer as many other animals are. Cancer is among the leading cause of death in domesticated felids as well alongside heart and endocrine disease (and associated factors). Cancer is a complex bio-mechanical process that takes into consideration both environmental (toxins, parasites, diet) and internal factors (certain cell lines, age, breed).</p></div>		</li>
