			<div class="markdown"><p>definitely. There's a reason you see a lot of very unhealty people eating salads and not losing weight. As well as some surprising calorie counts on salads.</p>
<p>Unless you are modifying orders or getting something that is explicitly supposed to be healthy restaurant eating is made to be tasty so that it sells not healthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lettuce is fairly calorie light, but very rarely do you just see a salad made of Lettuces. Throw in a some fruit, some nuts, some cheese on top and then a dressing made of liquid fat and you might as well have had the burger. </p></div>		</li>

<p><em>always</em> order the salad with no cheese, dressing on the side if you are trying to eat healthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always ask for your dressing on the side so you can put however much you want on it. You can always add more, but you can't take salad dressing off. Nothing is worse than soggy lettuce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching Hell's kitchen and a kid put way too much dressing in the mixing bowl for the hand tossed salad, and Gordon just reached his hand into the bowl and screamed &quot;It's a salad dressing, not salad fucking soup!&quot; And squeezed the salad as a river of vinagerette came flowing out of it. That stuck with me for not putting too much dressing on my salads. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it doesn't even have to be diet related. If I like a salad, I'm ordering the extra large version and taking home leftovers. I don't use a lot of dressing anyway. But I don't want soggy good damn lettuce leftovers. Ewwwww.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://www.myfooddiary.com/foods/4905857/cheesecake-factory-salad-chinese-chicken" target="_blank">Chinese Chicken Salad at Cheesecake Factory</a> has almost twice as many calories (960) and fat (49 grams!!) as a <a href="https://fastfoodnutrition.org/mcdonalds/big-mac" target="_blank">Big Mac</a>  (540 calories and 28 grams of fat)</p>
<p>And yes I know &quot;Then don't go to Cheesecake Factory&quot; but is it that hard to imagine a situation where you're the only one of a group of friends who doesn't want to go because you're dieting so you cave in figuring &quot;Well I can get a salad there while everybody else pigs out&quot;</p>
<p>This is part of what makes dieting so hard: it can be pretty antisocial</p></div>		</li>
