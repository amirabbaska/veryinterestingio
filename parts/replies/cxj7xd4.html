			<div class="markdown"><p>You use the Arrhenius model, which essentially compares the conditions the component goes through at normal use with the conditions that it goes through in the stress tests. For determining the acceleration factor with high temperature stress tests you use, AF=exp[(ΔH/k)(1/T1−1/T2)] , where T1 is the normal use temperature, T2 is the stress test temperature, k is the Boltzmann's constant, and ΔH is the activation energy.</p></div>		</li>
