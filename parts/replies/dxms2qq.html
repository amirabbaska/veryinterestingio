			<div class="markdown"><p>In Madison there's a main drag that enters the interstate going north on the left.  About 1/2 mile after that there is an exit on the right to sun prairie... But you have to cross FOUR lanes to get to it!  It's fucking insane every day... Complete cluster fuck.  And then once you frogger over to that exit everyone slams on their brakes because some dbag tries to cut in at the last minute.  </p>
<p>There is an accident there at least every few weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NJ is the worst when it comes to this. Every on-ramp seems to have an exit ramp within a few hundred feet of it, so you have a constant stream of cars speeding up to merge onto the highway meeting cars slowing down to exit the highway. It’s insanity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally they are on state routes(highways) not interstates although some interstates will have an exit on the left, generally in cities from my experience. </p>
<p>What is the difference between a US highway and an interstate highway?</p>
<p>Succintly: Interstates are generally limited access (i.e. don't have stop lights and have an on/off ramp) and were created as a part of larger defense network of roads across america created under Eisenhower.. Highway is basically a designation for major route (usually normal side road access and regular stop lights).</p>
<p>I travel on a state route(2 actually) on the way to work. They have regular roads crossing them on a regular basis. The one every quarter mile and the other around every mile or two. The second one I have to take a left turn off of to get into town for work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It in infuriating and even more so when you see people who get on the interstate and immediately need to cross 3+ lanes of traffic to be in the passing lane and then drive right at the speed limit. Pseudo traffic cops assholes!</p></div>		</li>

<p>the rule Slower Traffic Keep Right</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even this thinking is part of the problem. <em>ALL TRAFFIC</em> should keep right unless passing. The problem with thinking of the left as the 'fast lane' and the right as the 'slow lane', is that people's definitions of fast and slow are subjective. There will always be someone in the left lane going like 15 over the limit, with brutal traffic stacking up behind them thinking &quot;what's people's problem? I'm going plenty fast smh&quot;</p>
<p>The point of the left lane is not to go faster, it's to pass. If people took this to heart we would have SO MUCH LESS traffic everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But im always passing....  The modification to the rule is that you can stay in the left lane as long as you want as long as you are going faster than the right lane, but when you see a car coming up behind you, you need to get over to let them pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure, if you're making a pass on one car and there are 3 more right in front of them it's not like you should come back to the right lane after each one and then switch to pass again...but yeah, as long as you try to drill it into your own head and habits that the left should be open for others to pass in you'll be good. It makes me absolutely irate every single day how many people just see the left and right lane as '2 lanes to choose from' in their driving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For 6 months after my test I was this guy. I’d do exactly 10% over the limit in the fast lane and wonder why I was constantly getting people flipping me off etc.</p>
<p>I now mainly use the middle lane and only use the fast lane for passing. When I do I’m constantly checking my rear view and will always move over when I see someone flying up behind me.</p></div>		</li>
