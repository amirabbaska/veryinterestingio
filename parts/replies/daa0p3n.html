			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends is a larger lad, and when our group of friends go to the cinema I really try not to sit next to him. I don't know if it is weight, but he seems to be very loud at breathing, and it pisses me off. If I happen to hear it during the movie, then for the rest of the screening I cant help but keep hearing it.</p></div>		</li>
