<p>Pretty cool that if you go to a desert on a new moon, you can see space exactly as it would look in orbit for a much cheaper price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is in one sense. The twinkle is caused by the atmosphere, but the way a star twinkles is partially mediated by tiny variations in the shape of your retina. These variations are as unique to you as a fingerprint, so you see the stars twinkling in a subtly unique way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Significantly less. Their light goes through a larger volume in the atmosphere, so you see the average of a lot of air motion. The average is more stable than individual parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Light from planets go through the same amount of Earth's atmosphere as stars do. My guess for the less tinkle is that planets are generally orders of magnitude brighter than stars and thus the fluctuations that cause twinkling are much less noticeable compared to the brightness of the source.</del></p>
<p>I misread the above comment as &quot;their light travels a longer <em>distance</em> in the atmosphere&quot; rather than <em>volume</em> of atmosphere - my bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The previous commenter is right, if a bit unclear. Light from stars is effectively a point source, whereas all the planets visible to the naked eye can be resolved as disks with a small telescope. Their angular size may not be visible to the human eye, but the averaging across slightly separated paths through the atmosphere is what cancels the twinkling.</p>
<p>If that doesn't make sense, think of observing an object through a pinhole lens. If the pinhole is of effectively zero size, there is a one to one mapping between points on the object and points on your retina, so anything passing across the pinhole sharply blocks out part of the image. There's no redundancy. As the pinhole gets larger , the depth of focus shrinks and the redundancy is increased. Multiple points on an object can follow the same path to your eye, and (more importantly) one object point can take multiple paths. Try waving your hand in front of a telescope: you'll hardly notice the difference, save for a dimmer image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. It's actually true that while stars are exactly like point sources as far as your eyes are concerned, planets are close enough and big enough to behave like small disc sources, meaning that fluctuations in the atmosphere do tend to get averaged out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't. For a star the atmosphere involved is a cylinder with the width of your eyes, a few millimeters per eye. For Mars it is a cone (without tip), with a few millimeters at your eyes but with a width of about 10 cm to 1 m at a height of 10 km.</p></div>		</li>
