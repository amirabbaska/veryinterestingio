			<div class="markdown"><p>Some reasons off the top of my head:</p>
<p>Tall buildings block sunlight, pack a bunch of people into a small area, and to some, detract from the natural landscape.  They also require a disproportionately large amount of resources and utilities.  Pumping water to the 45th story of a tall building isn't as easy (or cheap) as pumping it to a smaller building, and pumping sewage out isn't easy either.  </p>
<p>Large buildings also tend to be owned by large companies, which exert an outsize influence on the local government through tax receipts and lobbying.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted, though, that it is much cheaper and more sustainable in the long run to build 100 units upward than extend roads, plumbing, electric, and sewage out to 100 individual units in a suburban-sprawl-style-subdivision that was formerly farmland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, for tall buildings, there's usually a single pump to drive water up to a large reservoir at the top of the building. Gravity will then feed that water to the floors below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Structural - in a place like Los Angeles, the taller the building, the more susceptible it is to earthquake damage; in a place like Washington DC, much of the ground is former swamp and may not be able to support such a structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aesthetics - preservation of optics is a community issue - in my Brooklyn neighborhood, almost all buildings are 6 stories or less, but they recently built a 20-something story luxury apartment tower, and that thing is an eyesore. It blocks a lot of light, too, and really takes away from the coziness of a long-standing community oriented neighborhood. It also allowed for a rapid population increase, which has, in a number of dimensions, effected the neighborhood. </p>
</li>
<li>Flight safety - in some cities where the airports are essentially down the block from the rest of the city (NYC and San Diego come to mind), building height and air traffic must be kept in mind to not create hazards or compromise flight paths. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Boulder's case, it's a case of collective vision for the city. They have strict urban growth boundaries as well, which means that existing homeowners get better return for their investment, and almost all new construction maxes out the height restriction to take advantage of the limited land, which creates for a rather optimal density that makes carless living possible without feeling cramped. Boulder has literally capped its population at about ~100-150K, keeping its college town, champagne liberals happy while forcing its growing pains on neighboring cities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LA is surrounded by mountains and ocean, and most of its individual residential units are single family homes rather than apartments (much less buildings over 6 stories). </p>
<p>The answer is zoning.  </p>
<p>The City of LA was zoned for 10 million residential units as late as the 1970s, and then the zoning was tightened way up and basically capped only a touch over 4 million - which is now the current population of the city, and rents have skyrocketed. </p></div>		</li>
