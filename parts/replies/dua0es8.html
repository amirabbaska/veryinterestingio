			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't think of an English word that has that sound. Best way I can describe -  try to say the 'g' from 'garden' from the back of your throat with aspiration.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed 'garage' to 'garden'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. It's really cool that you went to all that effort. It's difficult for me to hear the difference between the dental and palatial &quot;t&quot;s, but that's ok I don't have to be good at everything. As for the trying out the &quot;gha&quot; sound, I have a sore throat today and it hits right on the sore spot :-( Maybe I can try it this weekend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ordering is also the ultimate origin of the arrangement of Japanese kana charts, which were developed by Buddhist monks, though sound changes over the centuries have resulted in drift. The modern order is: K/G, S/J, T/D, N, H/B/P, M, Y, R, W.</p></div>		</li>
