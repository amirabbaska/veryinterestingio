<p>The PRC and the U.S. reached an agreement that says there is one China and the U.S. agrees that its government is in Beijing. </p>

<p>This is not technically correct.  Our position has been that there is One China, but we do not take a official position on whether or not it's the PRC or the ROC.  However, at the same time, we have broken off official diplomatic relations with the ROC for decades, while supporting them as a military ally unofficially.</p>
<p>Beijing publicly describes the USA position as acknowledging that they are the real China, but we have been more cagey about it.   Basically we say that we acknowledge that is their view without affirming that we agree with it.  Also, the position of the US Congress has pretty much forever been that the ROC is the true China.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, you're right. I was sloppy. I was trying to ELH5, but I could have done better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's funny is we're all about independence in just about every other case but this, and the person who essentially led this to be the case (Nixon) was a Republican that Democrats historically hate almost as much as the Republican they're now yelling at for defying what he established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple thing to keep in mind here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Taiwan has never claimed independence. They claim to be the government of all of China. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Republicans were historically pro-Taiwan. Nixon shifted his position because he said we can't leave a billion people in angry isolation--i.e. the negative consequences of refusing to recognize the government of a billion people instead of the government of 15 million outweighed any positive benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jimmy Carter normalized relations with China, not Nixon. Nixon formed the communiques that were the basis, but the details were not done under his administration. The U.S. did stop opposing China's entry into the United Nations under Nixon, though they did have poor George Bush there to try to argue that Taiwan should also get a seat that the world rejected pretty easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ronald Reagan criticized normalization with China, even though he accepted it upon taking office.</p>
</li>
<li>I would say the U.S. opposes independence in most cases. The U.S. is not pro- Tibetan independence, Dagestan independence, Kurdistan independence, South Ossentian independence, Western Saharan independence, and so on. The U.S. supported Kosovar independence, which is another insanely complicated can of worms that I really don't want to get into. </li>
</ol></div>		</li>
