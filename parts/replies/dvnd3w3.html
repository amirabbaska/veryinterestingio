			<div class="markdown"><p>You irradiate the water. Sometimes it captures a neutron, making heavy water. There might be a single molecule out of a few hundred moles of water, but it has to be controlled and handled as if it's all heavy water. Why? Legal issues and requirements that predate proliferation fears.</p></div>		</li>
