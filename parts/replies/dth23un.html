			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;A measure of the strength of the EM field&quot; sounds pretty abstract to someone without any background in QFT.</p>
<p>The way you can actually measure the fine structure constant to such ridiculous accuracy is by measuring the strength of the magnetic moment of the electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I followed up with what I meant with that statement when I talked about coupling between electrons and photons. Maybe thatâ€™s too abstract still, but I figured if someone is asking about these theories, then they have some background on what electromagnetic (EM) fields, electrons, and photons are. Perhaps I was mistaken. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This constant can only be determined experimentally, but we use QED to make predictions of this constant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on other measurements only. QED only tells us how to relate the constant to the experimental results.</p>
<p>The current relative uncertainty is 1 part in 4 billion.</p></div>		</li>
