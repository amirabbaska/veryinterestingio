			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran into <a href="https://youtu.be/oiWZYdr9Zvo" target="_blank">this video</a> that talks about the effect of microwaves on metal - it segues into explaining that the same effect happens with visible electromagnetic waves, which causes metals to be shiny. </p>
<p>It takes a while to get around to the point, but it made it quite well for me and was immediately understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons in a material exist in valence band (the range of energy levels electrons normally have). There is another band, the conduction  band (the range of energy levels that are normally vacant in that material)
The amount of energy between the maximum of the valence band and the minimum of the  conduction band is called the band gap.
The band gap is the minimum amount of energy needed to excite and electron causing it to conduct electricity.
Thus the higher the band gap the better insulator a material is.</p>
<p>The band gap of a material is also what determines if it is transparent or opaque. Because photos striking a material with an energy greater than the band gap get absorbed by the electrons and the electrons get excited. Photons with less energy that the band gap pass through it and the material appears transparent to that wavelength of light.
E.g. silica glass is transparent to visible light because it has a large band gap, but it is opaque in UV light because it will absorb UV light.</p>
<p>On to metals. In metals their valence band and conduction band overlap. That's why they are such good conductors.
It's also what gives them their colour. Because they will absorb light in the visible range, exciting the electrons to a higher energy level, those electrons then later fall back to their original energy level and give off light (and that is the entire principle behind both LED's and solar panels, but those use semiconductors which I won't go in to). Thus metals absorb light briefly and then re-emit light in the same frequency they absorbed. Whats more is that most metals will reflect electrons equally across the entire range that corresponds to the visible part of the light spectrum  thus metals appear silver, because essentially it is the absence of any colour and just completr reflection of all colours.
But not all metals. Some metals have a slightly narrower band where they are reflecting light, so they start to absorb some higher energy wavelengths of light. In the visible spectrum it means that they will start to absorb some of the blue light incident on them.  That means there is more orange/red light being reflected than blue/green and so metals like gold or copper gain their colour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because oscillating in phase creates light resembling the incoming light. A smooth surface will collimate this light creating the reflection </p>

</blockquote>
<p>I find that misleading. Uncollimated light will still be uncollimated after the reflection if the surface is flat </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because as soon as they stop absorbing the light, they are moving, and will send it out in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Try to imagine sending some special water wave to hit a special pendulum suspended in the water.  The pendulum can absorb the wave perfectly, but once it has, it is moving, so it will create the opposite wave back.</p></div>		</li>
