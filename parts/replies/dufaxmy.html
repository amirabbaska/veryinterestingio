			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes the most sense. It's why we always round numbers in math after the decimal but not before (if there was always a fractional part of the answer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the obvious answer.</p>
<p>It's not important to know how many digits there are shown after the decimal point, but it is <em>crucial</em> to know how many before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer needs to be at the top, but I simplified.</p>
<p>This is ELI5, people:</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers after the decimal are a fraction of 1. </p>
<p>Commas are used to separate whole numbers that have reached the next integer tier. </p>
<p>No commas are used because the numbers after the decimal are not even a whole number.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
