			<div class="markdown"><p>former USMC SGT here, your God damned right, I can't tell you how many times I had this discussion with my Marines. especially when they were talking about sending us up to L.A. from Camp Pendleton during the riots after the Rodney king trial. no way we were going to tell any civilian what to do, we would have deployed to the streets to go sling arms and then just turned our backs and let them do what ever they wanted. not interfered with the civilians at all. no matter what order was given.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, when I was at OTS they specifically cited Hitler as an example please of why we swear allegiance to the Constitution instead of the President. The attitude of the discussion was not, &quot;this'll probably never happen, but just in case...&quot; but rather, &quot;This could legitimately happen and you need to decide now how you will react so you aren't tempted to chicken out when faced with the choice.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
