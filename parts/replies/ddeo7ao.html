			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a common misconception is that big bang happened in one point. It happened in the whole universe at once. if the universe is infinite (and that's very probable from today's data), <em>it was also infinite at the time of the Big Bang</em>. Our best guess for the total size of the universe comes from the local curvature, and not from our knowledge of the size of the early universe plus the expansion history. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Big Bang describes the universe much, <em>much</em> less than a second <em>after</em> the 'start of time'. That near infinitesimal fraction of a second isn't really covered by any of our theories; there may have been a singularity, but it isn't required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OLz6uUuMp8" target="_blank">The 2013 Isaac Asimov Debate</a> hosted by Neil Degrasse Tyson does a great job of discussing what was before the big bang. No answers of course, but it gave me a good understanding of what it meant for the big bang to happen everywhere.  It's a long talk, but worth it if you wanna start to grasp this stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it? I though that that universe is not expending <em>into</em> anything. The process of expansion creates spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;size&quot; of the universe itself isn't changing. According to the cited theories, spacetime itself is getting bigger and bigger. But the universe itself would be infinite and would have always been infinite. Only the distance between the smallest particles (or rather between energy) has been increasing due to expansion. It took around 300k years for spacetime to be big enough to allow the energy to group together into atomic particles. Before that, there just wasn't enough empty space for particles to form; there was too much pressure and too little volume.</p>
<p>Think of drawing something on a balloon and then blowing it up. It's still the same balloon, you didn't add any material, but your drawn picture is bigger now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that the size of the universe is infinite because it is always expanding. The mass of the universe is finite. Is this correct? Is the energy of the universe finite or infinite?</p></div>		</li>
