			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is a planar molecule, that might be it.    Water molecules are wedge shaped, like the ^ symbol, but with an angle that's around 120Â°.  You can capture that structure in 2D, so we call it planar.  </p>
<p>It's likely that there are a lot more ways to get stable configurations of many of those wedges if you keep them all confined in a plane versus trying to make 3D shapes, so when we get a bunch of water molecules at about the right temperature and shake them around inside a black box, we end up with mostly 2D shapes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The angle of water is actually 104.5 degrees if you're curious. 120 degrees would be for a perfectly trigonal planar structure, but water's shape is actually a tetrahedron as predicted by VSEPR. The 4 points on a tetrahedron, if perfectly spaced out, will be 109.5 degree angles. Due to the lone pairs on the oxygen the hydrogen atoms get pushed closer together giving 104.5 degrees.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note that water is a polar molecule - one end (the 2 hydrogens) have a partial positive charge, while the other end (water) has a partial positive charge. Like a magnet, the positive and negative ends will align and attract each other, which leads to the formation of hydrogen bonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a guess: since water molecules are a flat and have a single bend, the fewest it would take to form a polygon out of them is a hexagon of 3 water molecules.  So they would keep bonding into tiny little polygons, and since they're only bent in the one direction, the most neutral shape for them to bond into is opposite of the previous connection (i.e., continuously flat).</p>
<p>Over time, this would keep building outwards. As the diameter gets bigger, other molecules hit the middle of the shape, and add another layer, making it a little sturdier</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is bonding in a 3d way; it just is much faster to grow in 2d and thus is much thicker in the 2d than the third dimension.</p>
<p>Water naturally forms HCP crystals; the honeycomb structure. It is easier to grow in the plane than out of it (ie. it is easier to make a new honeycomb cell than a new layer).</p>
<p>Magnesium and graphitic structures are also HCP crystals and grow in this fashion.
