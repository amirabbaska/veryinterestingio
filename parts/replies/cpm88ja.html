Really though? That sounds like a lot considering the mass of the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reviewing the math, the relationship between the rotational kinetic energy of the wheels to the linear kinetic energy of the while car is equal to the ratio of the mass of the wheels to the mass of the car. This assumes that the wheels are uniform disks. Back of the envelope calculations for a 2014 Camry gives rotational energy to be about 5% of the linear KE. I concede the point.</p></div>		</li>
