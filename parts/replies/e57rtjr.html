<p>Less than one might expect. There is the short half-life energetic radiation hazard shit and the long half-life poisonous shit. They'll be distributed according to burst height and prevailing wind layers. But the world is a big place and even if we played all-out global thermonuclear war the radiation, while certainly detectable, isn't going to sicken everyone, or even close to it.</p>
<p>One large factor that acts to reduce the spread of radiounucletides is that almost all nuclear weapons are designed to explode several hundred metres above ground level. So instead of irradiating and aerosolising several tons of earth to drift down-wind it's just the bomb materials and small amounts of gas that define the fallout. The reason is that you get about 1.5 times more energy transfer to the target by bouncing the shock-wave of the initial detonation back to the target. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_burst#Nuclear_weapons" target="_blank">See here for a diagram</a></p>
<p>If you're interested, there is a very good book <a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Thermonuclear-War-Herman-Kahn/dp/141280664X/" target="_blank">link here</a> about how to fight, and win, a nuclear confrontation. It's heavy on game theory and has some maths too but it is very readable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks man, lots of resources.. and yep, I knew about the airburst concussive advantage... the bombs certainly won’t make everyone sick, but I’d say cancer would play a larger role in our lives for a few generations </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its also because smaller yields are more efficient with regards to area damaged.</p>
<p>10 100kt weapons will have 2-3 times the coverage of a 1mt weapon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lower yield weapons are also due to the improvements in targeting systems and much higher accuracy than back in the 60's when you just wanted a 15Mt warhead to get within 5 miles.</p></div>		</li>
