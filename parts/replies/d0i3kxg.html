			<div class="markdown"><p>As a contractor in NJ we don't bid in NY City due to the prohibitively high insurance costs and red tape associated with any construction work. Every crane accident or collapse makes it harder and more expensive.  In Philadelphia to close a sidewalk now (full closure) you need a letter from an engineer stating that it is necessary with drawings showing proposed pedestrian traffic patterns.  That's about $2,000/ closure.  NYC is far worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The crane accidents are almost all because they try to continue operating when winds exceed the maximum allowable speed. The cranes cost thousands of dollars PER MINUTE to operate so they try to squeeze every cent out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pedestrian it sucks to get detoured from one side of the street to another just because companies that build stuff don't care about their impacts to us who walk in the city. Though I enjoy using my legs, it takes longer and requires more effort to get anywhere and your little detour can double the time it takes to traverse a block. We're seen as the perpetual whipping boy, the first thing to be rerouted, and after navigating around your project there's another one a block down on the other side of the street that we just switched to, and then another, and another. Meanwhile cars constantly get priority to cruise on through as if sitting on your ass a little longer in a climate controlled pod isolated from heat, cold, precipitation and effort is such a hardship, as if disturbing a driver's microcosmic vacuum is the worst thing a city could do. I get you need room to build shit and it's not a major disruption to our lives to go around, but it wouldn't kill you to take a lane for us to use, to squish traffic a bit, to send the folks who parked all day in the public right of way somewhere else for a while where it's not a impeding the progress of everyone else trying to get things done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>City work is hard because accessing the area of work is very limited in general.  For instance, if we use a 125' high reach to get to the 9th floor of a building we need to take up a traffic and/or parking lane and the sidewalk underneath the reach's arm for safety in case something falls.  Scaffold is another method of access but can cost  more than 1/2 the cost of the work itself so we all try to avoid using it unless there is a lot of work on a facade.  There really is no way to no block sidewalks in these instances and we work with city engineers to try to make it as painless as possible, but in the end, work must get done.  A lot of our work (masonry restoration) is facade remediation and inspection to prevent falls.  Not long ago we had a call for a 4'x4' marble panel that came down from a 6th floor and luckily no one was there when it landed.  This is more common than you may think, so we work with city and other engineers to prevent these types of things so no one gets killed out there.  i guess bottom line people's inconvenience are &lt; people's lives.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, blocking off a car lane has many more negative effects than blocking a sidewalk. If you look at many of the streets in NYC that already have lane closures, the traffic caused can go for blocks and affect public transit as well. Having a few people walk for a few minutes longer has a much smaller affect than stopping hundreds of cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably also has to do with where the digging is happening.</p>
<p>The Upper East Side of Manhattan is literally one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the world. And apparently they're paying some residents to relocate as a result of construction issues. So people in one of the highest rent areas of the world are being paid to move somewhere else, sometimes for months.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if local businesses are getting compensation as well. 2nd Ave is a huge commercial strip and tons of these businesses are being made less accessible to foot traffic because of construction.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FINALLY I HAVE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>Hi I live near the second avenue line. It's funny to read &quot;proposed&quot; because it's been in the works for years. I mean hell, they've practically almost built the damn 72nd street stop, that's pretty far done. I remember when they were just blasting out the ground.</p>
<p>Local businesses have suffered terribly. I think most of the places that used to be here are gone. Of the places I went to on Second, only the Walgreen's and a bagel place is still there (on the plus side, a tiny convenience story opened up right next to the new station, so that's nice). The outdoor diners were just devastated, I don't know a single one left in my little corner. It really depended on where they dug though: in various places the fences really impede foot traffic more then in other places (hell, you literally cannot see what store is what in areas, so advertising is out), so it's really hit-or-miss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are really two Upper East Sides (south of 96th St):</p>
<p>A) West of Lexington Ave (even more so past Park Ave) towards Central Park and B) East of Lexington Ave towards the East river.</p>
<p>Section A has some of the most expensive apartment/co-ops in the entire city.  </p>
<p>Section B is much more middle class (for NYC) and has some of the cheaper apts in the city (ie Manhattan), especially as you get further away from the subway stops. </p></div>		</li>
