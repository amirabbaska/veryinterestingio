<p>You sweat to cool your overreacting body (I don't have a reference to the study but it is also said that it is to flush your system of possible bacterial intrusions as your body is in panic mode) which then irritates the skin causing the acne. </p>

<p>That sounds... I dunno, thin.  Sweating is actually a fairly good way to keep your skin healthy, as people who use saunas know.  If you have clogged pores or other existing issues, then I'd expect it can be a problem.  Also it can create the conditions for pre-existing bacteria to thrive and cause issues (like ammonia irritation, smell, etc).</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure any flushing of bacteria is purely a side effect, as the stress response is mostly your body shifting into high gear to deal with a macro scale threat to life or health, like a flood or an attacking predator.</p>
<p>As far as sweating in response to stress, I think it's partly anticipitory for cooling - your body isn't trying to cool itself because it's hot, but it's preparing to keep you fighting longer because it's getting ahead of the game by cooling you before you get warm.  Overheating - especially in warm climates - is a big limit on how long humans can maintain physical activity.  It's right up there with adequate glycogen reserves (stored energy).  With blood flow diverting to muscles, the cooling system ramping up, and the brain receiving stimulation your body is basically ready to perform at peak for a little while, hopefully long enough to escape whatever.</p>
<p>This actually isn't a &quot;normal&quot; situation, either.  Humans evolved to run down prey in long chases, winning by endurance rather than power or speed.  The stress response seems to be intended for defensive situations where it is useful short term to ramp up fast to escape an ambush predator or unexpected event.  </p>
<p>As a lot of people know, the response is actually detrimental to health, especially if it's maintained for more than a short time.  Again, our bodies aren't designed to do this except for a few minutes once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5:</strong> Humans have a special ability, like a super power, that we use when we're in danger.  It exists because it used to help us escape animals and other things that would hurt us.  Even though there aren't as many scary things in the world today, sometimes we accidentally use our power.  It happens when we get scared by something or when we feel hurt or very worried, and it isn't good if we feel like that all the time.</p></div>		</li>
