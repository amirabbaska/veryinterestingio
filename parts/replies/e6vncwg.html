			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, this made my day!  I have a young child with ADHD, and I've been reading a lot about Ecexutive Functions.  This was BY FAR the best analogy I have ever come across.  Thank you for posting!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!!</p>
<p>I’ve spent my life with ADHD and my life changed when I started treating it like an Executive Functioning problem and not an attention problem. And it’s gotten much easier to get loved ones and coworkers to understand this way too. </p>
<p>Now, the positive flip side is that under the right circumstances, the ADHD brain can outperform - like when the boss steps out for a moment and comes back to find a unique solution was thought up in their absence. In most cases, though, it’s about finding ways to make sure that the boss is up and running and that there is a clear way of working. </p>
<p>My biggest challenge has always been just thinking step-by-step and maintaining a working memory (aka, keeping track of one thing while doing another) and “attention deficit” has absolutely nothing to do with that. </p>
<p>Parent that kid! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always thought of my ADHD as a crutch that’s only ever hurt me given my past experiences with it. Reading your comment made me realize something that I already experienced on a sub-conscious level. With this new realization I feel like I can culminate that. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would explain the symptoms of massive hyper focusing or excessive multitasking. I've found through my own experience post medication that I'm generally better at multitasking than others. Usually only marginally so, but I definitely don't find it as stressful as my peers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is rather similar to my experience. Its worth adding that there are subtypes: inattentive, hyperactive and (I just found out tonight) impulsive. </p>
<p>I'm of mostly the inattentive type, though possibly with some impulsive type mixed in. It sucks. It really sucks. It has never had any obvious benefits, and the drawbacks have caused me enormous difficulty in every area of life. I shudder to think what my life would be like if I'd never Adderall+Wellbutrin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This video was posted to reddit a little while ago, and I'm working my way through it and enjoying it. It's a ~3hr presentation to parents about ADHD and discusses a lot of things I'd never heard of without being boring (so far). Some of what he discusses describe me so accurately I'm wondering if I should see someone. Sharing in case you haven't seen it.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to u/thesweetestpunch thoughts.</p>
<p>Imagine that feeling when you are tired but you want to stay awake to try to concentrate.  You want to sleep at the same time you want to stay awake.  Your body fights your mind, and you become figity, you cant sit still.  You can't focus on one thing,  because your body and mind cannot agree on the state you should be in.</p>
<p>This is the life of someone dealing with adhd.</p>
<p>A stimulant like adderal levetates the adhd brain into full conciousness.  For those that don't suffer from adhd, it causes reactive responses such as agression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh I like this one. When I’m losing control of my focusing methods it really does feel like that - it’s a physical struggle. People without ADHD who are like “lol I’m so distractable” can’t really relate to how physically difficult it can be just to do the one thing you have to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo I've been having this problem for a really long time and it's starting to affect my school.  Say I'm in a lecture and the professor says something that grabs my attention, my brain will CONSTANTLY take that one thought and just fucking bolt with it and then 5 minutes later I snap back to reality and realize I have no idea what I just missed.  Or sometimes I'll just randomly phase out and start thinking about what I need to do for another class or something and it isnt because I'm bored at all.  Is this something I should maybe bring up to my doctor to look into further or is it normal?  Because if I can get meds to help me stay focused it would be a godsend.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add this isnt just in school, its constant.  At work, during conversations with friends.  Just all the God damn time and it's really starting to bug me.</p></div>		</li>
