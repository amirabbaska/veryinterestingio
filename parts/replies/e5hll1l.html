			<div class="markdown"><p>There you have it, very well explained. </p>
<p>Here's another way to look at it. Compare how it feels to stand in still air at freezing temperatures to the way it feels at the same temperature in a stiff wind. If moving air cold can more effectively strip heat from your body, moving hot air can just as well transfer heat to a body, preferably not yours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in Assisi Italy on a day it was 42°C. At the top of the hill there is an old fort. It felt cooler standing in the direct sun inside the walls than it did in the little bit of shade outside, because there was a slight breeze. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Phoenix, Arizona where the temperature hitting 115 freedom degrees (46 communism degrees) in summer isn't uncommon, the breeze feels like a hair dryer blasting you in the face.  Or the feeling where you open an oven and all the hot air comes right out at you, just constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it won't. The air is all the same temp. But if it moves, if will transfer heat from your body better. It will also help evaporate you sweat more quickly which transfers more great away from your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it another way: Imagine dipping your hand in a bucket of cool water. After a little while, the water around your hand heats up from your body heat, and becomes warmer than the water in the rest of the bucket. So now you have an insulating bubble of water shielding your hand from the cooler water in the rest of the bucket. But now if you swirl your hand around in that bucket, the water instantly feels cooler again, as that insulating bubble of water is disrupted.</p>
<p>A convection oven is like constantly stirring the bucket, so it can’t ever form that insulating bubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so if there was a way to move air in a conventional oven, without burning out the fan or letting out the heat, would it be a convection oven at that point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably. convection just refers to how the transfer is happening, so if you got that air moving some other way it would probably be considered a variant of a convection oven.</p></div>		</li>
