			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught half-life was the amount of time it takes for half of the isotope to decay, rather than how long it stays in your system. Was I taught wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: also isn’t tritium used on gun iron sights? Doesn’t seem that dangerous compared to what’s in a bullet...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means both. When talking about nuclear decay, it is as you stated, the time taken for the radioactivity of a specified isotope to fall to half its original value.</p>
<p>However when you are talking about something in a biological sense, it is the time required for the concentration of a substance in the body to decrease by half.</p>
<p>So if you ingested tritium you would be dealing with both definitions at once because there would be one timeline for the radioactive decay, and an entirely separate timeline for the biological elimination of the tritium itself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Are the effects similar?</p>
<p>Could you point me to some studies so I could educate myself? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially nothing.  As u/cowboylasers said, seawater has all kinds of radioactive isotopes in it naturally; that radioactivity would overwhelm the tritium present in the waste water by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>The guy's a nuclear engineer.  He deals with this stuff for his living--and he said he'd have zero problem <em>drinking</em> that water.  Let that sink in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh okay, I'll just take your word for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guy's a nuclear engineer.</p>

<p>Or should I take the nuclear engineer's word for it?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>So there's really nothing to sink in.</p>
<p>Wait, was my question answered?</p>
<p>I guess I'll just have to believe that the reason we can't use the tainted water is because the machinery to do so is too expensive.</p>
<p>So it's better to let the ocean sip it up, because the ocean is big and already has radioactive isotopes in it, surely a nuclear meltdown won't affect it. </p>
<p>I mean c'mon, humans are pretty smart, if you can build a bomb, you can build a structure to withstand said bomb (if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball), so I'll give you that one. </p>
<p>And last but not least there would be at best, marginal effects on marine life if said water flows into the sea. </p>
<p>Our only source of water. </p>
<p>Our only source of water forever and ever. </p>
<p>Edit: as in, if we are wrong and we destroy the (already decaying *ocean), we can't fix it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About reactions rates being different for different isotopes, that's called the <em>kinetic isotope effect</em>. It's used for a lot of things outside of this stuff. For example, it is used to give us insight into reaction mechanisms - that is, it can help tell us how a chemical reaction works based on whether a reaction is faster with a heaver or lighter isotope.</p></div>		</li>
