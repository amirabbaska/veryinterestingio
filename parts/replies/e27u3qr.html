			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I would be so mentally fried being stuck in that cave for so long, wondering if I was going to die down there. This is a great perspective on the situation. I truly hope they none of them have any long lasting mental health issues stemming from this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really unlikely. The Chilean miners, for example, have had lots of lasting psychological issues, including PTSD.  Granted, they were trapped 4 times as long, but they were also very familiar with the conditions. </p>
<p>On top of that, the ~5hr cave diving rescue itself would have been an absolutely terrifying ordeal so intense that I'd expect it to be the most traumatizing part, though depending on which specific medications they gave the kids to calm them down through it, it might help at least minimize the psychological trauma of that part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the one diver died trying to rescue them...each of those boys will live their whole lives knowing they have a debt to a dead man they can never repay.  That alone would be quite a load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without a debt, finding out someone you had just interacted with at that age is traumatising. </p>
<p>And then you know it's somehow your fault. That's way too much guilt for a child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nice that they're trying to keep the boys together. Gives them something to do and hopefully softens the blow a bit.</p></div>		</li>
