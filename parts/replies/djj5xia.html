			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that there are four groups of people:</p>
<p>-produce the smell and can smell it</p>
<p>-produce the smell but don't smell it</p>
<p>-don't produce the smell themselves but can still smell it (in the urine of those who <em>do</em> produce it)</p>
<p>-don't produce the smell, but couldn't smell it anyway</p>
<p>I've never smelled it in my own or anyone else's, and have been told by someone who can usually smell it that they don't smell it in mine, so I think I'm in the last category</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Could be this is the answer. I can 100% smell it, there is no way it's &quot;in my head&quot; or anything like that. And it's very potent and distinct from pretty much anything else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is some debate to this; some scientists think certain people don't produce the smell itself</p>

<p>Wouldn't that be extremely easy to test? Collect urine from people who ate asparagus and test other people on whether they can detect the smell. I feel like there should be no debate here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How often are you eating asparagus that you can or can't smell it on other people's pee? Does your wife sit there sniffing when they go toilet?? I have so many questions...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife loves asparagus, and I hate it because of the pee smell. So when I first protested to my wife making asparagus, and gave her the reason, she said she doesn't smell it. I asked a couple of other friends, and then looked it up and found out what the deal was.</p></div>		</li>
