			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that it's relatively close and it has a pretty small size, wouldn't this asteroid be a prime candidate for the proposed &quot;move an asteroid into Earth orbit&quot; mission? Or was that mission supposed to target even smaller asteroids? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as i know NASA already had picked out the candidates for that.  i have no idea if the specific orbital trajectories for the chosen asteroids line up better to save fuel, with this one in an orbit already to bring it closer they would need to slow it down, buit its orbit is very elliptic. it might be more fuel efficient to move one into a trajectory that puts it in a closer orbit that they can make more stable easier.</p>
<p>but im guessing, i dont know the full mission profile for NASA, maybe this is a better candidate.</p></div>		</li>
