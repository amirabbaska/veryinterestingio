			<div class="markdown"><p>The largest atom that has been studied well is cesium with a radius of 260-270pm depending on your source. That's about 4 times bigger than carbon and still 250 times smaller than you can see optically.</p>
<p>The reason there aren't bigger atoms, well there are a few. If you get too many protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, the result is unstable, resulting in atoms that don't stick around for very long. There's a narrow ration (1 proton to 1.25 neutron if I remember my nuclear chemistry right) that results in stable elements up to a certain point. After that, for the moment, they're all unstable (lead has the most protons of any stable stom known, at 82). </p>
<p>Cesium has less protons but is bigger due to how it's electrons are organized. Electrons tend to come in shells (2, 8, 8, 18, 18, etc) and elements with fewer electrons in their outermost shell tend to be larger in radius. Elements with more electrons in the shell tend to be more compact.</p>
<p>The element below cesium, Francium,  may be larger but has a half life of only 22 minutes and there is thought to only be about 20-30g of it in the crust. It hasnt been studied enough to know what the properties of its radius are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only that. The size of the atom is made by its electron shell, and you reach a point where filling higher and higher shells changes the size of the atom, but makes it less and less bound, so any interaction with it just kicks off the electrons. </p></div>		</li>
