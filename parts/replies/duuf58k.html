			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a great, and simple, answer to the question. I always knew that trying to defend yourself was foolish, but I also never quite knew why. The reason I always thought was &quot;it makes them seem smug, and full of themselves, so people are less likely to believe them.&quot; but then you mention that you need evidence authenticated.. That's not something I ever would have thought of.</p>
<p>Silly side note here; every time I read the word hearsay, in my kind I read it at heresy first, and have to correct myself. Does anyone else have this issue, or am I just bad at reading? </p></div>		</li>

<p>You're not the first person to notice such issues. Two situations that can make it even funnier.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Autocorrect on mobile devices. &quot;Heresy&quot; is sometimes preferred over &quot;hearsay,&quot; leading to some deeply weird texts/chats/posts sent via mobile. </p>
</li>
<li>Proceedings in church courts. Yes, they're a thing. Meaning occasionally there will be arguments about whether proposed evidence of alleged heresy is hearsay or not.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the assurance there. Thankfully in my day to day life, neither word come up often. Maybe I'm just living wrong, but that's a different discussion.</p>
<p>However, I do see it about once a month. And, I need to do a double take to verify. There have been a couple times where either word would have more or less fit in the sentence, but may have changed a lot.</p>
<p>Regarding the church Court.. I have never heard of that, but it sounds as if that situation would be humorous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doing lawyer stuff is like trying to do complicated taxes by yourself.  The laws and regulations were written by bureaucrats cooperating with lawyers and accountants, so the language and logic of it all can be extremely confusing even if you are very well read.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another lawyer here:</p>
<p>Except....whether it was your camera or your neighbor's actually has nothing to do with whether or not the tape was hearsay, nor whether there would be a hearsay exception that would allow for its introduction. </p>
<p>My point not being to nitpick your explanation, but rather to agree and demonstrate that the rules of evidence are complicated and even lawyers don't agree about them :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, wasn't suggesting the tape would be hearsay. But the stuff about &quot;Oh, this is my neighbour's security camera&quot; would be hearsay from the neighbour who told you that is what the footage is. </p>
<p>But yeah. Stuff gets complicated. Also, deadlines that mean a solid gold case on Tuesday can be unwinnable on Wednesday if the right documents weren't filed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right on.</p>
<p>Yeah, video as hearsay was always so interesting. Where I'm at, as long as someone testifies that to the best of their knowledge the camera was in working order and the tape wasn't tampered with, it comes in. I always argued that wasn't nearly sufficient, but I always lost that battle O_o. From a legal standpoint I think I'm right, but from a practical standpoint I understand why judges wanted to STFU. Preventing videos from coming in would grind the system to a freaking halt. Which is, of course, why I wanted to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't help that a large part of current law means defending yourself is setting yourself up to get blown out of the park.</p>
<p>You might have a solid case, but if you don't follow every rule in confirming and submitting it, then it's not so hard to get a motion going to disallow the evidence - in other words, if you don't know the legal stuff you have to do to validate some evidence, you're fucked.</p>
<p>At least last I understood it, feel free to contradict me if I'm horribly wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no! </p>
<p>I've definitely seen some judges &quot;take it easy&quot; on people who represent themselves, but not always. </p>
<p>One thing is that at least in simple criminal cases, the defense generally doesn't put on a case, instead relying on poking holes in the prosecution. That's a little less technical for a non-lawyer to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to traffic court and saw a lawyer stand up, I was trying to figure out why anyone would use a lawyer for a ticket. He had 5 clients, he had all of their cases heard first, and he had a defense for four of the cases that I had never heard before, the officer didn’t write the distance from the car he was at when he used his laser. 4 of the 5 got off, but the judge was also apparently pissed about the sloppy police work and started letting anyone off who’s ticket had the same issue, including me. </p>
<p>Law is as much procedural as it is about right/wrong. Learned my lesson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Some of my cases I have won by knowing the right objection to keep out critical evidence. Had a file where the police officer signed a form instead of a witness, which made the document inadmissible. </p></div>		</li>
