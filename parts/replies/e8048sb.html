			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention that happy endothelial cells help control vessel diameter. What I'm curious about is what level of exercise would be beneficial for someone whose aorta is starting to show a very slight dilation (ectasia). It sounds like a certain level of exercise might help delay the onset of aortic aneurysm or other issues, but too much might exacerbate the situation. Any thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dilation of the aorta is essentially that the artery wall has been weakened somewhat. Depending on the dilation... if it’s very minor, then exercise wont make it worse. (Of course of the dilation is measuring around 5cm dear lord please don’t exercise, also get that fixed) However, if the patient hasn’t changed anything about their lifestyle (diet &amp; smoking) then that is the biggest contributor for it getting worse. Of course this is also age dependent and genetics dependent. If you’re 70 and have just a slight dilation prob won’t get too significantly worse. If you’re 40 and have a dilated aorta, well def make those necessary lifestyle changes, and get routine ultrasounds :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying! My doctor didn't say how much in cm, only that it was very slight/minor, and didn't think it needed to be checked again for 3-5 years. I'm 40, cholesterol &amp; BP are both good, don't smoke, but I could lose a few pounds. He wants me to get more exercise, but the aorta comment made me very nervous &amp; afraid to do anything even remotely active (even with his reassurances). Maybe I'll go ahead and join a gym!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood pressure control is the main thing with aneurysms.  Consistently high BPs lead to ore rapid expansion and when it gets larger high blood pressure also increases your risk of rupture.  Diet/smoking/excercise...all these are meant to lower your blood pressure, and lower your risk of becoming hypertensive.  If your aorta is only mild/very slighty dilated I think you should be far more concerned with your long term BP control than with excersise induced (short) periods of high cardiac demand.  Even when your heart is racing and your breathing is super hard at maximal exertion your bp doesn’t really rise.
TLDR:  hit the gym, get a bike, go for a swim...don’t be sedentary!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So smoking doesn't necessarily have an effect on BP, other than briefly right after a cigarette. This was one of those boards factoids that don't really matter in real life, because it has so many other bad effects on vessels. Of course my info could be outdated, but I'm mostly just replying to kill time while my wife gets ready.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr --&gt; I provide some background, reflect on some current research, and ultimately say &quot;I don't know; it's not clear. I don't want to give bad advice that I'm probably unqualified to even give in the first place.&quot; Sorry I couldn't be of more help.</p>
<p>I'm no clinician (nearly a doctor, but not THAT kind of doctor), so I definitely don't know the ins-and-outs of this pathology nor would I want to give medical advice. However, I'll try to address your question through the lens of what knowledge I DO have.</p>
<p>For context: the endothelial cells (ECs) themselves don't DIRECTLY control vessel diameter. That is done by the vessel's Smooth Muscle cells (SMCs). ECs and SMCs are intimately in contact, and healthy ECs send signals to the SMCs to contract or release tension (shrinking or dilating the vessel, respectively). ECs also mediate SMC phenotype (the expressed, visible functional form of something). SMCs have a handful of phenotypes (contractile, which is good for vessel size; &quot;synthetic&quot;, which is good for injury recovery, macrophage-like, which is new right now and just seems like it's only job is to kill you via heart disease but we'll see where the research goes) which ECs can induce. So, indirectly, Exercise --&gt; shear stress --&gt; EC function --&gt; SMC function --&gt; vessel diameter.</p>
<p>I admit I don't know anything about ectasia, by that name, but I can speak a wee bit towards aneurysms. I'm a little weak on their initiation, but they grow when the shear stress values are too low. The problem is, unlike in straight sections of arteries, increasing blood flow doesn't automatically increase the shear stress. Because aneurysms balloon outwards, they are like...little side pockets that don't go anywhere. The fluid going down the main artery, that is close enough to the aneurysm, will &quot;sidetrack&quot; to fill the space and form this whirlpool type flow called recirculating flow (or eddy). This type of flow moves very fast but exerts very little frictional shear on the cells, resulting in low shear stress values and endothelial dysfunction. Paradoxically, aneurysms don't rupture at these spots but generally do so at locations where the shear stress happens to be super high (and is pushing hard against the vessel wall). Sorta like how it's easier to pop an inflated balloon compared to a deflated one.</p>
<p>To your question about exercise recommendations. At this moment, with the knowledge I have, I don't know how much it would help (note: not a negative outlook. More like genuine uncertainty).</p>
<p>Aneurysm researchers really like to do MRI/ultrasound scans of vessels, make digital simulations of that data, then test them under different conditions. I found a couple papers that looked at cerebral artery aneurysms (not aortic. So similar, but not the same; take it with a grain of salt). They used the following exercise protocol on a handful of patients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each subject undertook three sessions of graded exercise [on a ramp], consisting of 6min of rest, 6 min at 20% of maximal oxygen uptake (V.O2 max), 6 min at 40% V.O2 max, and 6 min of recovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When that data was eventually modeled and played with, the researchers reported that exercise-appropriate increases in blood flow didn't alter the aneurysm shear stress values all that much. On the other hand, it GENERALLY reduced the amount of time particles spent in the aneurysm (faster blood means faster particle transport) which these authors suggested might help slow progression by providing more nutrients and removing more waste products within the same amount of time. Exercise conditions also didn't make the flow pattern in the aneurysm significantly worse.</p>
<p>Again, grain of salt + not a doctor, but it seems like it would be very hard to change the flow patterns directly on the cells inside the aneurysm with exercise alone. That said, knowing what I do about endothelial cells, speeding up the blood flow in the normal section of the artery while the shear stress remains about the same in the aneurysm may make the likelihood of rupture higher. EDIT: revised that last sentence; poor clarity/grammar.</p>
<p>All I can confidently say is: &quot;If you have this diagnosis, you definitely should exercise. Consult a specialist about how much exercise would be safe for you.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
