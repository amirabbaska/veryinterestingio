			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought musth was specific to adolescent elephants just around puberty and directly caused by increased levels of hormones and adrenaline, kinda like the human ‘rebellious teen’ equivalent. In which case it would be different from headaches, though I do see the parallel you’re making. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and it is mostly a big problem only in elephant populations that experience poaching. Normally, young male bull elephants are the most aggressive when they go into musth. In healthy populations, aggressive behavior and desire to fight of young bulls  is inhibited by older male bull elephants who can beat the crap out of misbehaving adolescent males. Unfortunately since old male elephants have the largest tusks, they are often targeted the most by the poachers. This can remove all the older males from the population and cause adolescent males to run amok. This as two further damaging effects on elephants. First, such males who are not disciplined by older males when young, continue to be aggressive as adults. Second, these very aggressive males can injure females when they try to breed with them. So poaching of older males can screw up elephant populations for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And then the poachers blame the elephants for their aggressive behavior and use it to justify further abuse on them while taking no blame at all for the ramifications of their actions?  Or am I just extending a metaphor too far...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Male elephants going into Musth is not caused by them going into heat. They can go in Musth at any time for the reasons stated above (temporal glands leak and cause pain). </p>
<p>As well as becoming highly aggressive, their testosterone levels shoot up to about 40 times than usual. Which is why we probably see them trying to mate when in Musth. </p></div>		</li>
