			<div class="markdown"><p>...at the expense of the lives of Americans, it's important to note. For example, Ford intentionally weakened the roof pillars on Ford Explorers from what engineers had said was necessary, because it meant they could use less of the expensive, high-strength steel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youre all partly right. Ford mortgaged all they had (including their symbol) before the crash because Mulaley read the winds right. GM and Chrysler timed it wrong and there wasnt enough cash lying around when they desperately needed to borrow money. Ford did accept a loc from the government for developing more fuel efficient cars, as did the other two. They also seriously restructured their parts divisions and bought back some visteon plants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a feeling that ford stock will be a great long term play for electric and autonomous reasons.  Eventually the average person will want an average electric car, not a tesla, and ford is in place to run with that.  Plus it's a good value play at the moment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This cannot be overstated- They bet their logo, the font, and other property items. I belive that &quot;Mustang&quot; and the &quot;F&quot; series trucks were also on the line. It took some serious intestinal fortitude to do what they did.</p></div>		</li>
