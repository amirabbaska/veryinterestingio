			<div class="markdown"><p>I went there! Incredible place. I've got some cool shots I could post if there's interest. Many fossils from the ancient seabed.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here is a little gallery of my visit in 2009:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, so soil is essentially a mix of organic matter (which is typically dark, wet, dense and fertile) and minerals (dry weathered rock, typically in the form of parent material or bedrock). The Sahara and any other desert is what you'd get if you were to take all the non-mineral material out of any ordinary soil. Furthermore, because the Sahara is so hot and windy, there is a lot of advanced erosion of whatever rock remains, which contributes even more to the sand.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind is incredibly good at sorting sediment by mass, and since most sediment has similar densities, by size. So sand dunes tend to be made of particles that are all pretty much the same size. This is very different from running water - streams sort sediment as well, but sand from a stream has a range of sizes, and you can find sandy deposits not far from muddy deposits. Sand in sand dunes is astonishingly uniform.  Small clay and silt-sized particles are carried off by the wind, leaving the sand and larger material. But only the sand moves well as dunes, so the sand accumulates, burying the larger, heavier material.</p>
<p>Those tiny particles, by the way, get carried quite a ways in the atmosphere, and play a role in <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/user-resources/sensing-our-planet/saharan-dust-versus-atlantic-hurricanes" target="_blank">Atlantic hurricane formation</a>.</p></div>		</li>
