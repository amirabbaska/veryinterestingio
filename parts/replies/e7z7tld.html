			<div class="markdown"><p>Many researchers and philosophers question whether or not brains are actually fundamentally like computers at all. They may be completely unalike. Certainly computers as we've had them so far are not at all like brains, because brains are massively, ridiculously parallel. </p>
<p>Also brains don't have algorithms for solving their problems. You may be able to simulate what a brain does with an algorithm, but it's not &quot;an algorithm for seeing the world correctly&quot; or &quot;an algorithm for doing crosswords&quot; because the brain often fails at the things it tries to do. When you create a correct algorithm for solving a problem and run it correctly on a computer you always get the answer. But the brain is happy to settle for losing a certain amount of precision and reliability in return for greater speed and responsiveness. Machine learning is the area where technology most emulates living thinking systems, and in machine learning we see the same tradeoff between speed, breadth, accuracy and cost (in money and time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe we do not have the classic &quot;algorithms&quot; of computing, but we certainly have something. We are not puddles of neurons in the ground throwing sparks and chemicals randomly. However  large, complex and plastic it may be, we still have a well-defined  neural structure, and that can be dismantled and studied.<br />
We are almost perfect biological machines and each of our mental processes, with the appropriate knowledge, could be perfectly predictable in the same way that you know the result of a function.</p>
<p>Eventually the sciences of psychology, neurology and computer engineering will decipher all together the secret of consciousness.</p>
<p>In the worst case, nobody who reads this will live long enough to see that day... or in other even worst case we will all be extinguished by an atomic war or a giant asteroid or something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy to computers is imperfect but some parts of it are unambiguously true.  There are many types of algorithm+data combinations where humans and computers give perfectly consistent results.</p>
<p>The differences may or may not be the interesting part.</p>
<p>The brain isn't a collection of algorithms, but you can run algorithms with the brain.  Computers only use algorithms, but neural networks can be simulated with algorithms, and functionally, the &quot;algorithm&quot; disappears when neural networks are really used, because the process the data goes through is no longer directly known in terms of a list of steps to get from say a photograph to identifying a person by name.  That's why we don't write such algorithms explicitly; we train more general algorithms by telling them when they're right and when they're wrong and they adjust how the individual &quot;neurons&quot; react to input and produce output.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Saying &quot;thoughts are like programs&quot; doesn't come close to explaining what it's like to have thoughts, or how biological processes generate the what-it's-like experience. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To describe it very broad the memory is a certain connection between neurons that holds for an extended periods of time. The chemical-electrical processes in the neuron network are constantly changing their connections between each other and when this connection holds this chemo-electrical signal pattern becomes a memory.</p>
<p>Hallucinogenic drugs basically interfere with neuron interconnection and chemo-electrical reactions in the brain so if we are ELIFying making your computer wildly glitch. Sometimes this process becomes irreversible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Memory is a little better understood, though still with it's own mysteries. The simplest explanation was proposed by a pioneer of neuroscience, Donald Hebb, who proposed that &quot;neurons that fire together wire together.&quot; Now, there are a complex series of neurochemical, transcriptional, and physiological changes that underlie this process, but the simple version actually works surprisingly well.  Now, imagine structures in your brain that are dedicated to looping these  connections repeatedly when something memorable is occurring, and you have a basic understanding of how these imprints are formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well as far as we know thoughts <em>are</em> the electrical impulses that our neurons fire in particular patterns.

</blockquote>
<p>I mean, it depends on whether you're Daniel Dennett or you're David Chalmers. Dennett defines consciousness in such a way that he effectively denies &quot;qualia&quot;, the ineffable internal experience, whereas on the other end of the scale Chalmers calls it the <em>Hard Problem of Consciousness</em>, sees Dennett as overly reductionist, and promotes the idea of <em>panpsychism</em> (the idea that consciousness is in some way fundamental to the universe)</p>
<p>I've found that this Dennett-style, purely materialist, &quot;consciousness is just an emergent pattern&quot; view is incredibly popular in certain crowds, particularly all sorts of STEM crowds, like tech.</p>
<p>Leaves me wondering, as father of virtual reality Jaron Lanier does, whether Dennett isn't a &quot;philosophical zombie&quot;, if he really doesn't &quot;get it&quot; when people try to talk about ineffable qualia</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/zombie.html" target="_blank">http://www.jaronlanier.com/zombie.html</a></p>
<p>Of course he considers this essay humorous, but I really do wonder if we're just all talking past each other when we try to talk about the private, ineffable experience of qualia, or if, maybe, some truly aren't inhabited by a &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; and just can't connect this idea to anything in their experience.</p>
<p>In any case this quote cracks me up</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only a zombie like Dennett could write a book called &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; that doesn't address consciousness at all</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is will humans ever be able to fully understand the human brain. It seems a bit parodoxical when you think about it. The organism studying itself.. An organism so monumentally complex would need to be studied by something even more complex. Or maybe the combined sum of human intelligence can tackle this problem </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrical signals themselves seem to be the closest neural correlates of thought we have discovered. Specifically, activity in frontal cortical areas tends to be most closely associated with integrating sensory information from multiple sources, as well as decision making. These are functions that closely align with our concept of thought. But again, it's hard to connect that activity with the qualitative experience.  Some have even suggested that conscious thought is a byproduct,  a passive window that emerges from the complex series of interconnections. But that might be beyond ELI5 scope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't overemphasize the electrical signals since many are chemical (and chemistry involves charges interacting by we don't properly call chemical reactions electrical).  Neurotransmitter release results from electrical signals and causes further ones.  And changing the chemical parts, i.e. the amount of transmitter released, the number of binding sites, is a major way our brain changes itself through learning.</p></div>		</li>
