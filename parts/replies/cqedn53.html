			<div class="markdown"><p>i just saw that video yesterday, it has a good animation of how the water in the ground slowed the neutrons to a speed where they would actually hit the nucleus of the uranium until the heat from the reaction vaporized the water, thus stopping the reaction because the neutrons move too quickly to collide, then the temp would cool down so the water would turn to liquid again, starting the cycle over</p></div>		</li>
