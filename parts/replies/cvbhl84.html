			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is linked. In the weak field limit, Gauss' law holds like in EM (the flux of the field through a surface is the energy-momentum inside). But if the sun disappears at t=0, at a later time presumably the field still hasn't disappeared at the distance of the Earth. Then Gauss' law gives a contradiction. That's because the (linearized) field equations imply conservation (or continuity, same thing different names), like in EM, which is a pretty cool result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a much better question, maybe you should post it as a question :)</p>
<p>Let's say we can near-instantaneously accelerate the Sun to speed of light. It's 8 light-minutes away from us, so after 1 minute of such acceleration , the Sun is less than 1% further away. So we would not notice much change in the strength of the pull, but the direction of the orbit might change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't like asking what football would look like without the forward pass. It's like asking how math would be different if 1 + 2 = apple. The question itself can't be answered with physics because it implicitly assumes that the laws of physics are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That energy would still be present and gravitating. Gravity in GR depends on energy and momentum (via the &quot;stress energy tensor&quot;), of which mass is one aspect of energy.</p></div>		</li>
