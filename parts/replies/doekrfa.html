			<div class="markdown"><p>Work hour rules are governed by 10CFR50.26. The limits are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot work more than 16 hours in a single day</li>
<li>Cannot work more than 26 hours in two days</li>
<li>Cannot work more than 72 hours in a 7 day period</li>
<li>Must have 10 hours off between shifts</li>
<li>Must have a continuous 34 hour break in a 9 day rolling period</li>
<li>Must not exceed a 54 hour average over 6 weeks (324 hours in six weeks), or must meet minimum day off requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>That's how we are supposed to work. Obviously if someone calls in and nobody is there and you have to violate one of these you will, but you will make every effort to get someone in ASAP to cover the shift, will initiate a fatigue assessment on the individual, and will allow for breaks or naps if the individual is sequestered on site for some reason (hazardous weather for example). The supervisors and up are all trained on fatigue assessment, and we have a process we use and behaviors to look for to determine if an individual is fatigued. If someone is fatigued and cannot go home due to minimum staffing, we will let them rest on site and have another on-site operator take their position, but they will still be required to respond in an emergency. Even when I have guys inside work hour rules, any time someone has to work more than 12 hours, I do not assign them any work after that, because the likelihood of them making a mistake goes up tremendously. I tell them to find a good spot to chill, and just be ready in case we have a transient or a fire or something they need to respond to. Now if the whole crew is sequestered, you just take turns with breaks and naps.</p>

<p>Annunciators and other warning alarms do come in often. However when I say &quot;Transient&quot; I'm referring to any major perturbation of the primary or secondary systems all the way up to design basis accidents. A feedpump trip is a transient, even though the operators don't have to do anything if the equipment works, the reactor automatically throttles down to a reduced power output so the remaining in service feed pumps can keep level stable. A turbine trip is a transient, it causes a reactor scram and a significant level and pressure perturbation and may need operator response to stabilize the plant. A reactor coolant leg pipe shear is also a transient, even though it happens so fast a human cannot respond to it and all of your emergency cooling systems are required. </p>
<p>The bottom line is the ESFAS (Engineered Safeguard Feature Actuation System) is only designed to perform the immediate required actions. They start ECCS, shutdown the reactor, isolate the containment, start emergency generators, and a handful of other immediate actions, and that's it. In a boiling water reactor you have to put residual heat removal in service within 10 minutes. That's not automatic. </p>
<p>Part of the issue with trying to make the plant respond to all events, is that you create new problems. You don't have enough logic or inputs to deal with every possible scenario for generation 2 and 3 plants. Plus you still have to deal with sensor failures, equipment failures on your safety equipment, etc. And there are always scenarios that require alternate actions, for example in a boiling water reactor if the reactor fails to shutdown I have to immediately disable all injection to the reactor and disable all emergency core cooling systems, forcing the reactor onto natural circulation at reduced water levels to prevent steam chugging in the fuel channels which can lead to core instabilities and gross fuel damage. But during every other possible event you want all ECCS and feed systems to continue operating. So designing that stuff in is a challenge</p>
<p>For generation 3+ plants under construction, they are capable of a minimum of 72 hours with no human actions, and a week with minimal actions and no AC power. However, their emergency core cooling system ends up boiling steam in the containment, makes a nasty airborne contamination mess, and is hard on the equipment (will cause violation of ASME code upset cooldown limits) if you rely on it for too long. So again, it's preferred to have humans to restore the active core cooling systems and shutdown the passive cooling systems to minimize the stress on your systems. </p>

<p>The smaller the reactor, the less decay heat you have. Smaller cores (less than 150 MW thermal) have very low decay heat and become air coolable in a short amount of time. NuScale's small modular reactor only needs water cooling for a short period of time, and becomes air coolable before its water supplies would be depleted. Generation 4 plants utilize fuel that's accident tolerant and can go for extended periods of time or indefinitely without cooling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for typing all that, very interesting stuff! If you don't mind I actually got more questions from it though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You mentioned feedpump and turbine trips. If aerospace engineering is any indication those can be designed with a set reliability and life expectancy in mind, so I'm assuming these trips are not purely a mechanical failure. What part of the entire system is the most chaotic then, that current control systems are unable to handle certain perturbations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the newer generation plants, what is the limiting factor for increasing automation? Is there a current practical limit based on processing power?</p>
</li>
<li>How are (coolant) pipe shears allowed to occur at all? Aren't pipes among the objects whose life expectancy can be easily estimated?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>4. I'm guessing multiple of these could just be ran parallel to get more power; is the downside to doing that just fuel efficiency and cost or are there other downsides to running multiple smaller and safer designs?</p>
<p>5. Lastly, what is your personal opinion on large scale thermocouple based plants? With near-future material improvements, could these hold a distinct advantage in terms of reliability that offsets their lower efficiency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question that's pretty trivial.  How long can a NPP still generate power once the emergency shutdown is initiated?  </p>
<p>If an emergency shutdown was triggered I'm guessing it would immediately be sent up the line and neighboring power plants would spool up power generation.  But how long could the NPP continue to generate power using residual steam/heat?</p>
<p>Sorry for asking such a broad question that doesn't really lend itself to a definitive answer!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stringent work hour rules. While I'm unfamiliar with the rules regarding SRO's(since they are non-unionized), Reactor Operators and Equipment Operators are unionized and have limits on the amount of hours you can work in a day, how many hours you have off between shifts and a maximum average of hours worked per week(~56 hours/week over a six week period).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be in conflict with regulations he can't leave though. If he's supposed to be relieved and everyone else licensed to do his job is unable to show up, he can't leave. And from the sounds of it he can't just say &quot;I've got my 16 legal hours for the day, I'm going home, good luck.&quot; since at that point he's basically just setting them up the bomb. (not to say there wouldn't be consequences for his employer if he had to stay, but if people don't show up they don't show up, you can't just magic qualified employees out of thin air.</p>
<p>I'm guessing if it comes to it and he ends up on a double or triple shift they figure out the bare minimum he must do to keep the plant from exploding, and let him take naps between those activities.</p>
<p>Edit: or thinking on it a bit more if he gets towards the end of a double shift with no relief in sight they might start shutting down the reactor so he can leave, but from what I understand of nuclear plants that's not an action to be taken lightly as it's difficult to restart them once they're shut down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, but OP's hypothetical seemed to imply a situation where you and most of the people at the plant suddenly <em>died</em> or something. Some kind of Captain Trip's superflu that killed 99% of the population in minutes. You aren't just abandoning your station, you're just... dying.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends. In my professional opinion, the most likely situation is either equipment failure or loss of power grid causes the unit to come offline and the reactor the scram. Initially the plant will self stabilize, but at some point you'll lose all offsite power, then you will either deplete your onsite water inventory, exceed your containment suppression pool heat limits and bust containment, or run out of diesel fuel. After that, within hours you'll begin damaging the reactor core. </p>
<p>Automated systems can only turn stuff on or off. It doesn't add oil to pumps. It doesn't patch leaks. It doesn't see stuff in the field and swap from pump A to pump B when pump A has a seal leaking and you're losing reactor coolant. And ultimately you'll reach the limit and lose adequate core cooling.</p></div>		</li>
