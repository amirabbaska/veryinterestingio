			<div class="markdown"><p>It is probably relevant to note that alcohol also lowers inhibitions. Personally, alcohol makes me less inhibited to over eat, and less likely to choose healthy options over junk food. This could be part of the psychological cause for the hunger/cravings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting possibilities blue study. I don't like the lack of data presented on that site though. The effects of alcohol are still only partially known in many cases. Being a medical student what are your thoughts about the gluconeogenesis path as the most likely cause of a hunger state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I assume you are referring to is the depletion of NAD+ via the metabolism of ethanol using alcohol dehydrogenase and subsequently acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. You bring up a good point that this can impair gluconeogenesis within the liver. I think the major extra piece is that this subsequently liberates fatty acids because of the downstream increase in glucagon. Through some complex mechanisms this leads to the resultant fatty liver over time that is seen in heavy drinkers. It certainly does contribute to hypoglycemia based on the biochemistry alone, however I will be honest in saying I do not know how much of an effect this has on the systemic circulation during a bout of drinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. The fatty liver is also due to inhibition of lipase activity but you get the general idea ;P. Best of luck man. I'm swimming the same stormy sea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you already pointed out, gluconeogenesis is inhibited when you consume large amounts of alcohol due to increased production of NADH which is then used to regenerate NAD+ via pyruvate â†’ lactate transformation. This leads to hypoglycemia which stimulates the hunger centers in hypothalamus and orexigenic neurons in other centers of hypothalamus. This is therfore a likely explanation as to why alcohol causes hunger.</p>
