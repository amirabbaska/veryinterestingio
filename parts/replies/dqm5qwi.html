<p>I had heard that both fission and fusion stop at iron, and that rust is what makes red giants red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These stars usually have nickle/iron cores when they die. Once they start forming nickel-56, that decays into Iron-56 and all the energy that was being emitted is consumed by this process  So you had an equilibrium of fusion pushing outwards and gravity pulling inwards.  Suddenly the fusion is gone (within seconds), gravity takes over and starts pulling all the material to the core of the star.  There is still enough material that this causes a massive fusion reaction that is so catastrophic it can overcome the forces of gravity. It is also this reaction that forms the heavier elements on the periodic table. </p>
<p>Our sun is destined to become a red super giant star. The reason is it's size. It is small enough that when it begins to use helium instead of hydrogen, the output of energy will be much greater. However there isn't enough material to overcome the sudden increase in energy. So the sphere around the star expands to a point where gravity can keep it in check. Because of this expansion, the outermost parts of the star become very cool (relative to stars) and thus turns a red color. If you could somehow remove the corona, you would see that the core of the star would actually be considerably brighter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All fusion within the star ceases in seconds? Thats something i would expect to take hundreds if not thousands if not millions of years. Based on the lifetime of a star. Thats insane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. Nickel is much further down the periodic table.</p>
<p>The Red color however is due to a lower temperature, not the presence of rust. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nooooo.... nickel is 2 HIGHER (in proton count) on the periodic table, with Cobalt sammiched in between.
Rust is Iron oxide, and anything at the (non-brown) stellar level is far to hot for molecular arrangements to occur. So tossing your rusty metal into a star would be a great way to get rid of rust.
Stars are plasma, not gas (meaning they can't form bonds like rust).</p></div>		</li>
