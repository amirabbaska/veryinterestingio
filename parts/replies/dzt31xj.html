			<div class="markdown"><p>Roseanne's life isn't ruined.  She just got herself fired.</p>
<p>She had the legal right to say what she said, no one disputes that.</p>
<p>But often, decisions have consequences.  If she wanted to keep her job, she made a very poor decision.</p>
<p>By the way, the main American football player who doesn't stand also doesn't currently have a job.  Although my personal opinion is that the circumstances are veeerrrry different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have the right to react as I see fit, up to and including having you escorted off my property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freedom of speech means the government can't arrest you for tweeting something racist. It doesn't apply to business transactions on private property in the course of employment, as is the case for both Roseanne and the NFL players. Similarly the right to bear arms doesn't apply on private property, so you can't take a gun into Disney World or NFL studios. Most of the Bill of Rights is protection from government, not regulating conduct of individuals or corporations. . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone with lots more money than you. Its a shit system because of that IMO</p>
<p>And i dont think anyone life should ever be ruined just by what someone says. Only by what they do. America is fucked up and corporations run our lives</p></div>		</li>
