<p>Are you sure this is correct? Shouldn't the proper volume integral in curved spacetime have a correction, namely the Jacobian determinant of the metric?</p>
<p>I'm also asking this about the surface area of the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I am sure it is correct. For instance, in Gullstrand-Painleve coordinates, at a given instant in time, the metric reduces to a formally identical Euclidean metric on a sphere (and these coordinates are valid inside the event horizon). So the volume just ends up being 4Ï€R^(3)/3.</p></div>		</li>
