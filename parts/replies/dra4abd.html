			<div class="markdown"><p>The ones we climbed were secured at 4 points but I see what you mean.  Strange... The odds of military police climbing down a rope ladder like they did in ww2 and unlikely but, hey better to teach us the correct way regardless I suppose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most military spec ladders are going to be connected at 4 or more points, but sometimes weight or availability come into play. I remember when I was at Ft. Knox, they trained us on three different kinds of rope nets/ladders; a very wide one connected at 20+ points, a regular 4 point ladder, and a 2 point ladder. The instructions were the same for all three types; &quot;try to keep your center of balance on a verticle line that is connected at both ends&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
