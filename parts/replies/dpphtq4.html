			<div class="markdown"><p>It does save energy, but people have a higher basal metabolic rate in winter in response to the cold outdoor temps so a lower indoor temperature helps offload some of that heat more comfortably</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think about the fact that those thermal comfort standards don't seem to take the differences in men and women into account? The difference between the amount of heat men and women produce can be up to 35%, so women really <em>are</em> colder and need warmer temps. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/chilly-at-work-a-decades-old-formula-may-be-to-blame.html" target="_blank">x</a>)</p>
<p>Then factor in the differences in clothing, and women end up freezing a lot of the time. </p>
<p>At my office, I have an electric throw because it's so cold - even during the summer, and I am fully covered at all times (conservative workplace + personal preference). It's not about cost-effectiveness, because in the summer it'd be far more cost-effective to allow the office to be a bit warmer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are definitely differences in thermal comfort for men and women.  As to the reason why offices are so cold, I think it's poor building management more than anything.  </p>
<p>In a perfect world, all offices would have localized thermal zones so you could control the temperature of your cubicle with a thermostat (not an uncommon aspect of high performance buildings) but that level of design just isn't in the budget for almost all buildings (or the building manager/designer doesn't care) which is why we are plagued with cold, harshly lit offices</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sales office I worked in for years was kept at 68 degrees year round. The PD felt it kept staff and guests 'alert'. In a skirt and sandals (because back then I was wowing them with my gorgeousness) in mid August, it sucked. But I was definitely alert!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because most offices have both men and women and we need to find a compromise temperature that fits everyone. </p>

<p>If it really is that cold, then maybe it <em>is</em> too cold. 69-70f feels uncomfortably cold in the summer. And I'm male.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think most offices do compromise. As OP’s link says, they’re often set to a temperature that’s comfortable for men in suits, and women just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>For the record, I’m a guy but I almost always find office temperatures colder than I would prefer.</p></div>		</li>
