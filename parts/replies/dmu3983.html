			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars is also in a critical position for supporting mining in the Asteroid Belt.</p>
<p>So long as basic supplies and food can be produced on Mars, it becomes something like 11x more efficient to launch a rocket from Mars to the Asteroid Belt than from Earth. It's also more efficient to launch a rocket from Mars to our own Moon by about 3x, though the travel time is a bit longer.</p>
<p>It becomes part of a triangular trade route since Mars could easily sell these supplies to the Asteroid Belt, Mars would then use that money to buy more difficult to manufacture equipment from Earth, Earth would then buy raw materials from the Asteroid Belt and sell advanced equipment as well.</p>
<p>Mars becomes a good investment simply by luck of positioning assuming asteroid mining takes off and those basic resources can be produced there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus balloons would seem the best first option for colonising a new planet, but only as a means to bottle CO2 and ship it to mars where the carbon and oxygen could be separated and used in greenhouses. Over time this option could also build a martian atmosphere as gas is released into the environment.</p>
<p>Otherwise there would be no good reason to float around above Venus. </p></div>		</li>
