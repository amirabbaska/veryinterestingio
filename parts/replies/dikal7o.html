<p>You would not hire these companies as an army to fight a war though.</p>

<p>Sure you would.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The company was notable in its ability to provide all aspects of a highly trained modern army to the less professional government forces of Sierra Leone and Angola. For instance, in Sierra Leone, Executive Outcomes fielded not only professional fighting men, but armour and support aircraft such as one Mi-24 Hind and two Mi-8 Hip helicopters, the BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle and T-72 main battle tank. [15] Note that these were the property of the client state and not Executive Outcomes itself. [16]It also possessed medevac capabilities to airlift the wounded out of combat zones via Boeing 727 D2-FLZ owned by Ibis Air. These were bought from sources in the worldwide arms trade within Africa as well as Eastern Europe.[17]</p>

<p>I'm not surprised African countries have more lax laws wrt private soldiers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do sometimes get involved in wars but in their capacity as a security force.</p>
<p>I.E. A country with precious stuff to defend but an underdeveloped army will hire them to protect say, a valuable mining spot, from an invading force. </p>
<p>The whole &quot;hiring an army to invade someone else&quot; thing doesn't really happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate from my experience. We preferred the term security contractor though. Source: three years as security contractor in Iraq. Although security contractors and those contracted to train local police forces are quite different. While I was actually in the Army my unit trained local police forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan and we had some IPLO trainers attached to us (international police liaison officers) whom were civilians that were responsible for training and reporting the status of the local forces back to the State Dept, but those fuckers didn't do a damn thing. As a contractor I was part of a team that provided security to the Consul General in Iraq while he was out and about on his daily business. We also provided security for the Ambassador when he flew up from Baghdad as well as senators and congressmen (and their teams) when they came to visit. We were also responsible for security of our VIP (Consul General) and helping the Secret Service advance team plan when the VP came to visit.  Nothing shady from anyone on my team (~12) or our entire detail (~200) during my employment with the company; not that PMCs don't have their issues. </p></div>		</li>
