			<div class="markdown"><p>The Vasa sank in Stockholm harbour, it was only in a hundred feet of water. What preserved it mainly was the sheer pollution that went into the water in that time, which prevented a particular parasite that would ordinarily feast on wood from a ship from doing its thing. That and Stockholm harbour is deep in a 50+ mile archipelago, so there isn't a lot in the way of tidal action by that point, and the salinity compared to open seawater is very low.</p>
<p>But yeah typically depth and cold help a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you are referring to ship boring worms, they do not survive in the colder northern waters around England or the Baltic, those worms kill ships in a short time farther south unless they were hauled out like the old Greek galleys.</p>
<p>However rust at 100 feet down is pretty severe because oxygen is higher in cold surface water than in warm. Hence the northern and far southern latitudes have the most fish. At ten thousand feet there is little oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
