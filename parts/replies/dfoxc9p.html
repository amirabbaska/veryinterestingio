<p>The reason a neutron can release a few light particles and turn into a proton is because it is very slightly heavier, not the other way around. The binding energy is not directly the reason for the mass difference between the proton and neutron.</p>
<p>To my understanding, because the proton is charged, it has some small interactions with virtual photons that the neutron can't, which effectively lowers the mass. This in turn allows neutrons to decay into protons, since particles can only decay into lower-mass particles under normal circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah i've heard too that protons are very stable and have an half life of 10^35 years atleast. But on the other hand i've heard about two types of beta decays, one is beta positive decay(proton) and the other is beta negative decay(neutorn). Can you explain then what i might have read.</p>
<p>P.S. - Please excuse me if i'm sounding dumb, i've read physics only till high school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, you're correct. I'd misunderstood what you were referring to. Beta+ emission is very different from proton decay, but you're right in that it happens. Even in beta+ emission processes, the resulting state must have a lower mass than the initial one; this is done by giving off enough electrons to compensate.</p></div>		</li>
