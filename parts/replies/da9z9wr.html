			<div class="markdown"><p>But the battery is only one piece of the puzzle in smartphone screen time. Unoptimized apps (looking at you Facebook) negatively affect battery life, while better processors can do more with less power consumption. Optimizing the OS like Android or iOS also helps with each new version released. Features like doze that is built into Android tremendously helps with battery time by freezing apps in the background that haven't been running for a period of time. So a lot goes into smartphone battery besides just the battery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer I would also like to add for the OP one thing that JUMPS out at me...</p>
<p>Batteries have been marginally improving especially when we switched to bigger phablet-like phones.
But we're alot more demanding of our phone batteries now so the batteries are just trying to maintain the same standards of working hours while taking on more intense tasks.</p>
<p>The more vivid display, the instant wake mode, the better audio quality, the better processor, more wireless connections like wifi, Bluetooth headphones, GPS navigation, 4G allowing better video streaming which means more phone use</p>
<p>Even just using our phone is more constant now. Ten years ago we weren't checking 3 different messaging systems, 2 social networks, reading eBooks, and video streaming for 2 hours and GPS navigating for an hour all in 1 day. We'd pick up our phone take calls, perhaps text, and very sparingly browse html websites, and read emails. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is IMO the right answer. The <em>technology</em> itself in energy storage hasn't advanced much further, yet our demand for more energy has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing goes for generating renewable energy on a household basis. The cost of producing solar energy is much cheaper than storing said energy for when it's actually needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a better metal mixture invented in Japan but it's super difficult to manufacture and make certain that it's pure with no defects. They can last 7 days or even up to 30 on standby and are as thin as a credit card. But if there's any teeny tiny defect, they're extremely dangerous. I saw this on NHK about 5 years ago but the ability to mass produce them isn't available because the process is so delicate.</p></div>		</li>
