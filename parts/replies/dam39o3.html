			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, but just to add to this.<br />
No one is saying companies should be prevented from charging for premium access/content. But that should be coming from the content providers/creators, NOT THE INTERNET COMPANIES/GATEWAYS.<br />
So, for instance, A product like YouTube Red, you pay a little extra, get fewer ads, and more content. Totally legit! But say, a product like &quot;AT&amp;T Red&quot; Where AT&amp;T will let you watch the channels they own without hitting your data cap, TOTALLY NOT LEGIT. Now AT&amp;T can legally and silently push out all other content creators via the mechanism u/NaturalSelectorX described so well above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And to add to that, this isn't exactly what AT&amp;T is doing right now, but if providers were to offer a tempting package such as zero rating the services most people use, say Netflix and YouTube, from data caps, it would be much easier to get their foot in the door. People would be willing to go along with that because those are the services they use most often. </p>
<p>However, at that point, it's only one step to &quot;Oh, yeah, our service agreements have changed, so now you have to pay an add-on subscription fee for those services.&quot; The basic model of charging differently for data depending on source is already in place, already widely accepted. </p>
<p>But data is data. It costs them the same to deliver data regardless of source or format. By letting ISPs introduce pricing tiers and service agreements like this, you've handed over the fundamental shape of the internet to these middlemen, forcing content creators to enter into agreements with ISPs, whose only role should be to deliver the content the user requests. So even if you've already paid for a content service such as Netflix, it lets ISPs add on their own charge for those services, despite not adding any value to them. </p>
<p>The role of an ISP should be simple and efficient: Deliver the data that the customer requests, period. That's what you've paid for. Letting them tack on fees and pricing tiers depending on the type of content not only gives them leeway to start extracting additional fees, but it also unnecessarily complicates the process, which overall will make your internet connection slower and less reliable. (This is what people call an &quot;anti-feature,&quot; essentially a 'feature' you pay for that has no benefit to the consumer.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even then it's a slippery slope to paying Netflix for HD content and your ISP for the ability to view that HD content (because maybe only SD content doesn't count against your data)</p>
<p>It's all very worrisome, especially given Trump's appointment to the FCC (who is opposed to net neutrality). I fear we've already lost, given carriers are already implementing this &quot;free data but only for certain services&quot; thing</p></div>		</li>
