			<div class="markdown"><p>I started this about a month ago, waiting longer to eat my first meal of the day but otherwise eating a similar overall amount.
Once I got over the mental block the first couple days of ‘oh my God, I didn’t eat breakfast, going to be ravenous and grumpy’, it wasn’t that bad at all.
Side benefit, my late night cravings went from almost every night to maybe once a week, I think the hormone response to the intermittent fast is helping that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this argument flawed/is it a lie?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not eating lots of refined carbs or sugar and are healthy it shouldn't make a huge difference but it has been shown many times that ppl that practice IF have better insulin sensitivities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned that less food will result in less insulin secretion. There is also a compelling body of evidence that continuous caloric restriction with <strong>decrease your metabolism</strong>, as well as other body functions such as heart rate, etc. Basically, if you starve your body, it will start running at a lower caliber of intensity (less energy required b/c less food available). </p>
<p>Once again, this is why intermittent fasting is a distinct approach than caloric restriction. IF suggests we go for a 12+ hr period without food (minimal hormone secretion), which does not have the undesired effects mentioned above b/c you continue to eat at most other times, thus promoting an active metabolism with segments of fasting (fat burning, lipolysis). </p>
<p>Let me know if I can clarify anything. Replying to a million responses and people demanding sources. Keeping this brief but you raise a good point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this reply!! I do have a question that people look at me like I'm a moron for. Ive recently started taking my ADHD medication recently that really makes me hate food between the hours of 10am-10pm. Im normally starving for breakfast, disgusted by food at lunch, and snacky around 8pm. I opted to have my &quot;dinner&quot; for breakfast (lots of interesting looks at work as I eat some seriously delicious dinners at 8am) and just skip eating again until maybe a late snack of popcorn or yogurt. Rinse and repeat.  I have lost about 25lb, falling to a great BMI, but everyone is telling me how unhealthy my eating habits are and how I'm going to screw my hormones and metabolic profile up.   I FEEL awesome  but do agree the weight loss feels/looks different vs how I was when I was bulking/cutting.    </p>
<p>Am I possibly screwing up badly? Is this sustainable? If I decide to lift again and want to get stronger, how do I manage getting the protein in I need for muscle growth etc? 30yr old woman btw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree!
I remember watching some video in school about kids in Asia and how they ate fish and rice for breakfast and everyone in the class went, “ewww! Fish for breakfast?!?!?” </p>
<p>The thought of eating fish for breakfast didn’t bother me, and it made even more sense in the video. the family was just eating the previous night’s leftovers—I think it was some coastal village somewhere, and I’m pretty sure there weren’t any frozen waffles within 100 miles of their hut. You eat what you can, and honestly fish and rice with leafy greens sounds way healthier than fruity pebbles or a blueberry muffin. </p>
<p>Personally, I love steak and eggs for breakfast. Muffins, doughnuts, waffles, pancakes, and cereal don’t make any sense to me. That sounds like dessert for breakfast!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a guy with ADD here, not an expert, but I like to set two alarms for the morning: an alarm for when I need to be up, and a medication alarm that goes off 30 minutes earlier. I wake up to the med alarm, take my pills, go back to sleep, and wake up 30 minutes later with the meds fully kicked in. That means I wake up with more energy and less appetite; it made fasting a breeze back when I was doing IF. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a look at the YouTube channel of Evan Centopani, he's a competitive bodybuilder who's quite knowledgeable on nutrition and healthy intake of proteins carbs and fats along with your micronutrients without relying on shakes and supplements too much. It is a good guide for people wanting to put on mass in a relatively healthy way. I would not necessarily advocate body building for healthy longevity btw. I am a normal medical doctor, no specialist interest in nutrition, but I have been doing IF for 7 weeks now and have lost 20lbs and feel well within myself. I consume 1200 calories on average between 2-7pm and cycle for an hour in the gym with some HIIT periods 5 times a week. My blood sugar levels, blood pressure, pulse and ECG have all been fine (I check these randomly every few days, smart watch tracks pulse through the day) . I can't see anything specifically wrong with your eating habits as long as you are avoiding a high amount of simple sugar and saturated animal fats. Depending on your meat and vegetable intake and country of residence, you may wish to include a multivitamin containing some vitamin B and D among others. </p></div>		</li>
