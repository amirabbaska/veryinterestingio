			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite factoid is related to this. This exact same nerve is present in giraffes, and it follows the exact same path. This means the nerve is more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_laryngeal_nerve#Evidence_of_evolution" target="_blank">4.5 metres longer than it would need to be</a> if it followed a more direct path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There was this great article about giraffes, they have the exact same thing!  Vegus nerve goes all the way down to innervate the heart,  then all the way back up to innervate the salivary glands (apologize if I've got some of that wrong its been like 6 yrs since I learned this stuff) </p>
<p>Edit: linked similar article
<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2010/06/22/the-laryngeal-nerve-of-the-gir/" target="_blank">http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2010/06/22/the-laryngeal-nerve-of-the-gir/</a></p>
<p>Tldr: giraffes have such a nonsensical and idiotically designed vegas nerve that the only logical conclusion is incremental change over time,</p>
<p>Edit: just noticed the title says &quot;laryngeal nerve&quot; I also did not read...</p></div>		</li>
