			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have microwaves with a frequency below the but-off the wavelength gets longer than the height of the cavity. But the wave must have nodes at the conducting planes, so there is not even a single full wavelength that fits in the z-direction.  The behaviour in z-direction is therefore trivial and the only degrees of freedom that matter are the two in the plane.  Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide_(electromagnetism\)" target="_blank">waveguides</a> as a starting point.</p></div>		</li>
