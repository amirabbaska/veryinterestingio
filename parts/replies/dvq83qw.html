			<div class="markdown"><p>That aside - my money is on cosmic rays. More gene damage leads to more repair and altered dna. Space cosmic rays could've biased gene repair to over repair and create the 'dna change' of longer telomeres. Changed none of our basic knowledge, just how that knowledge applies to space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA replication is what shortens telomeres (mostly happens in cell division). Basically, you can't copy the stuff on the very end of the DNA strand and so you lose a little bit each time you replicate the DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's obviously the most logical conclusion. But as they didn't say that it sounds like that they already excluded this specific cause for some important reason.</p>
<p>Their emphasise is on &quot;low gravity&quot; as a cause and not just as a symptom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enough of the expression changes related to bone formation that I don't think it was just the food.  It might be a combination of low-level radiation, food, microgravity, and other things, but it probably wouldn't just be food.  And eating freeze-dried food isn't as horrible as eating all fast-food or even the typical American processed diet.</p></div>		</li>
