			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it.  Not to mention, Japan has so much excessive domestic savings that it is venturing into &quot;ZIRP&quot; (zero interest rate) and more recently slightly into &quot;NIRP&quot; (negative interest rate policy) territory.  </p>
<p>TL;DR: their corporations and citizens have too much cash sitting idle that they'd rather lend it for free to their own government than rent safe-deposit boxes to store their cash.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the reason why Japan is not in dire straits but Greece is: Japan owes money to itself, at 0% interest rate while Greece owes money to the mafia at high interest rate.</p>

<p>Ding ding ding!</p>
<p>I was actually going to use the mafia analogy as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Japan owes most of its debt to its own people </p>

<p>Even better, a significant amount of debt is held by the BoJ, which means that it is a debt that one branch of government owes to another branch of government. Effectively, it is a bookkeeping entry rather than 'real' debt.</p>
<p>Here are better alternatives to the debt / GDP ratio to measure solvability:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>debt not owned by the state / GDP ratio</p>
</li>
<li>debt / country's wealth ratio ( instead of debt / production ).</li>
</ul>
<p>A country's wealth is hard to measure, but a good proxy would be total banking deposits.</p></div>		</li>
