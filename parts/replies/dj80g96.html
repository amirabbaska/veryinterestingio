			<div class="markdown"><p>I solve this by falling asleep in bed with the TV on. Seriously... I haven't been able to fall asleep without a TV in about 15 years. I always bring my tablet to any place I stay over. </p>
<p>I usually pop on Futurama (rip on Netflix) or American dad (rip 50% on Netflix) and nod off because I've memorized every episode... So I'm not really paying g attention. </p>
<p>If I do t have a TV on I'll toss and turn all night fucking night about every damn stressful thing in my life.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm exactly the same as you, except instead of Futurama or American Dad it's The Office, Friends or Parks and Rec. </p>
<p>It's a bit fucked up but my dad is getting older and if I don't have the TV on in the background my brain just defaults to the thought of my dad dying and it just completely debilitates me. </p>
<p>I'm so thankful to my girlfriend for putting up with my bullshit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My go-to sleepy time TV is either The Office or Parks and Rec. Like you said, I could probably quote the script of either of those shows from the first episode to the finale, so it helps me turn my brain off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parks or 30 Rock for me. Sometimes I'll mix it up with Office or Arrested Development. It has to be something I've seen enough that I can half-follow the plot with my eyes closed while I drift off</p></div>		</li>

<p>hat if you're lying on the couch and fall asleep, you're not actively trying to sleep, you just fall asleep because you're tired. When you go to bed, you're actively deciding to sleep, and thinking about trying to sleep actually keeps you awake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paradoxical intention.  Anytime I find myself having a hard time falling asleep, I open my eyes and try to keep them open as long as possible.  When they start closing, and I'm aware of it, I'll open them again.</p>
<p>I usually fall asleep within 5 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I do, but sometimes that's too stimulating if your story is good.
What I do when I really need to sleep is imagine a cool but relaxing situation. Less fights in lord of the rings, more walking across fantastical landscapes in middle earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me on mild and regular basis, but had it really bad Sunday night. I had to be at work 2 hours earlier than usual on a Monday and was terrified I'd oversleep. The longer I laid there the more I was afraid to go to sleep because I worried I wouldn't wake up. The later it got the more I worried I was, and the harder it became to sleep, and so on. Long story short, I got up on time, but only after about 3 or so hours of fitful rest. It's a bitch sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Already had it two nights in a row now. I think I've gotten like 4 hours of solid sleep over those 2 nights combined. I'm doing surprisingly well atm.  The moment you think &quot;ok I really need to sleep now&quot; it's just ruined. Overall I'm not THAT bad a sleeper, but lately I've been doing some programming side projects on my own in the evening. Doing anything that requires mental gymnastics should really be avoided the last two hours or so before going to bed. When I hit the sheets my mind literally continues to program on its own,  I see algorithms fly by or spontaneously come up with improvements to a process flow. Takes at least an hour before my brain shuts up by which time I'm frustrated enough about not getting any sleep that my frustration starts feeding the insomnia by itself. Doesn't help either that the days are at its longest right now and sundawn starts around 4am.</p></div>		</li>
