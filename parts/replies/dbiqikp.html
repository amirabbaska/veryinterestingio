			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the best answer is to do what you do very well, and commit to being a very good frozen yogurt place. You just have to go into it with enough capital to give yourself some insurance against unexpected losses or expenses, and even then you have to carefully forecast and plan for slow season. Teachers who don't get paid all summer typically figure out that they need to save money over the school year to keep their finances in order. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's your source for this info? Because it doesn't exactly make sense if it is known to be seasonal. Whoever owns the building probably has frozen yogurt equipment in there already year round. The company renting space would rent it for 6-8 months and bail when it expires. Since equipment stays there, a different company comes around again next year once the season kicks in and rents the space with the equipment again for the 6-8 months.</p></div>		</li>
