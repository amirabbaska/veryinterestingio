<p>shut down major ocean currents</p>

<p>Particularly the North Atlantic Drift, which brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico up to the area of the UK, and makes for a MUCH warmer climate there than the latitude would otherwise dictate. Shut down the NAD (which scientists believe happened at the end of the last ice age when glacial melt flowed into the sea), and England would become as cold as northern Canada.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read up on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current" target="_blank">North American Drift</a> and that second link in my original post describing thermohaline circulation.  I'm far from an expert, but in a nutshell, saltwater is denser than freshwater and cold water is denser than hot water (which is a little counter-intuitive since ice floats, but that's another science - essentially, ice crystallizes which opens up space to make it less dense).  So what drives the circulation is generally water from the north moving south, warming, and rising to the surface and moving north and then getting cold and sinking....add to that the fact that the ocean isn't equally salty everywhere, so that also helps drive this rotation.  (As to why the rotation versus just rising and falling...that's beyond my knowledge level, but I'm sure it has to do with the earth's rotational forces).  </p>
<p>Now, the hot/cold cycle might be sufficient to maintain the currents, but if we flood the system with a bunch of freshwater and disrupt the salinity variations, it definitely will weaken the current and we don't know if it would disrupt it entirely, and even weakening the current can cause weather variations that could further lead to weakening of the temperature variation that drives the current.</p>
<p>There's a lot of speculation beyond that point.  There are mathematical models and small-scale simulations I'm sure you can find, but the earth is very complex, so nobody knows for sure.  Still, it's a bit of a scary proposition since that status quo means a healthy(ish) Earth capable of supporting human life and a worst-case scenario means a collapse of the food chain and Mad Max-style fighting over resources as humanity dies out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah!   Probably not, but I suspect if you dumped enough in the right spots, you could probably counter-act the impacts of the freshwater addition.</p></div>		</li>
