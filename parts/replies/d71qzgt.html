			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like a good way to describe the use for AC other than basic transmission of power is that a wave is much more authentic when replicating certain complex information such as audio samples. Huge difference in sound with tube amplification (AC/analog) vs solid state (DC/digital sampling)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying, and yeah, AC transmissions are wave-like by nature just like sound. Though, I've made DC sound circuits before; the wave just oscillates between zero and nine volts. So, you can definitely have analog DC circuits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard some decent digital/solid state guitar amps before, and they've come a long way. But I don't know why, but there's still just something about analog/tubes that is so much better. It doesn't lose all those subtle tones and it has this perfectly imperfect tone. It's such a full bodied sound, I guess. I wish I could describe it better. But I'd been using emulation softest the past few years to play through, and I recently brought my '66 Marshall clone I handwired years back and started it up. Tubes lit up, amazingly after years collecting dust, and when I played the first few notes through it again it was just instantly a sound like no other modern amp has provided, in my experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a brilliant response. The aqueducts metaphor is much easier to understand.</p></div>		</li>
