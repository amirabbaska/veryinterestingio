			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it goes much further, though you elaborate certain situations perfectly. Before I continue, I'm officially classified as gifted. I hate labels. I hate the word 'gifted' and I'm the last person who would use it to feel superior in some way. Actually, for most of my life I've felt inferior to other people. I've felt as if I was dumb for not understanding - I've been repeatedly told so. And I haven't made much of my life as of yet - I'm currently 20 - though I'm really working to let myself be... me.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is, I'm actually very emotionally sensitive. It's very hard to compare, since one only experiences their own emotions. I will never know what it's like for other people. But I prefer to think of it this way: if you slap someone in his/her face with a flat hand, that's what they feel. I feel like you just used an axe, figuratively speaking, of course. Emotions are much more intense within me - and that actually makes it more difficult to handle them. I can also feel the emotions in a room or when speaking with someone. It's really difficult for me to handle people who are angry - especially at me. I hate hurting people, but in life that inevitably happens. Even the thought of hurting someone twists my stomach. A good example of this is when I was driving a year back. I like to drive faster than is officially allowed - this happens also more frequently in smarter people, because they think they can drive better and that rules don't apply to them. Now my dad always warns me about police, what you can and can't do... But also that some cars may be police in disguise. So when someone is following me for longer than is usual, I start to freak out. It doesn't even matter if I'm speeding at that moment - I'm so afraid of being reprimanded, that my emotional state swings from very positive to continuous anxiety. It's not even the fine I'm worried about - it's the fact that I did something wrong and someone is going to be mad for that. At one time, this feeling lasted for hours. Eventually you learn to deal with it, but it's more difficult than for other people. Even right now I have tension within my stomach - and usually I can't even identify what the reason behind it is. So I run away from my feelings - especially negative ones - to deal with it another day. Sadly, that's not a very healthy coping method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can be the most energetic, enthusiastic, spontaneous person in the room when I'm feeling well. But you won't even notice me when I'm feeling down. I've perfected the art of pretending, because I've never felt understood. Hell, I didn't and don't even understand myself. And when you're ridiculed because other people don't understand what you're saying, doing or thinking - well, then you get the wrong idea about yourself. I have to do things my own way, because the standard, usual approach usually doesn't work with me. I stopped reading the news entirely - though my Dutch teacher said it's one of the most important things, because you get a lot of knowledge from a lot of different things - but I can't do it. It's practically impossible to ignore everything, but at least I don't have to get caught up in it. Terrorism attacks make me so... Angry, disappointed, disillusioned, helpless, powerless. I basically want to fix every problem I come across -  but I can't. It overwhelms me. If I start focusing on the general news - which is mostly negative, to grasp your attention - I can't do anything else than think about it. I only read what I want to read - e.g. scientific articles, psychology, physics, technology, business and much more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tend to take things much more seriously than people intend to. Because of that, I can actually see a simple 'joke' as truth, especially if it involves a joke which is personal and negative - who enjoys such jokes, anyway? And everything becomes even more complicated when my rational mind gets involved. I can be angry at someone, but I simultaneously think about why they did what they did, that it wasn't their intention and that there are many variables which is impossible for me to even guess which all combines into that specific result. I overanalyze and because of that, I don't act. I understand, but I'm still angry. Plus I don't want to hurt other people. My solution for most of my life: don't do anything, don't say anything. Take the blow and move on. But the conflict within me doesn't go away. And I'm still looking for an efficient way for me to blow some steam. So if someone has tips - please, it'd be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is, I've always wanted to fit in. Wanted to be 'normal'. It is so much easier to just be angry at someone, let it all out and not taking their feelings into account. Ignorance is bliss. What you don't think about, doesn't hurt you. I've thought about this many times, but I've come to peace with it. The term 'gifted' has a negative stereotype: ah, you're so smart! Why can't you do this, then? I've been an underachiever for most of my life, for multiple reasons. The things I think are important are drastically different from the thing my peers, or parents, think are important. It's very complicated - but the best thing you can do for a human being, is letting them be themselves in an environment of like-minded people. Being 'gifted', or 'smarter' isn't better. It's different. And this world needs difference. Celebrate it. Don't feel threatened - it's just how someone is. People often think I'm arrogant, but it's my truth. I know I can do some things. And often the things I say are so outrageous that people think I'm boasting or I try to be someone who I'm not. So when I say I'd love to have a debate with Geert Wilders - or Donald Trump, for that matter - and I think I can win, I'm serious. When I say I know how to make things better, I'm serious. When I say I want to change society for the better and that I don't care who is in my way - I'm serious. And I don't care if society 'allows' certain things. I don't care how, I will make it happen. When I see or feel unjustice, unfairness or simply an opportunity to do it more efficient, I'm in war mode. And when I'm in that state, there is nothing that can stop me. I will do anything to win. When my parents punished me for having bad grades, it was on. If you do it that way, I won't do anything anymore. It's going to hurt you more than it's going to hurt me. At that point, I don't care about the consequences. Just about winning the war, so to speak. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always hope to find more people to share thoughts with. I didn't have many when I was younger - and I'm still not satisfied. People say I talk too much... Well, deal with it. That's just who I am. I will no longer sacrifice myself to make someone else feel better - instead, I will make them feel better by doing what I love. If you made it this far, thank you and I hope I've given you insight into a mind which has felt alienated for most of his life, because he didn't know how to cope with being smart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My older son is a math savant who is on the spectrum - when you're around a genius-type kid, that intelligence came first and confused the hell out of his friends- he sees Math as patterns in his head- when he described squares/square roots to me when he was in kindergarten he sounded crazy- but as an adult I knew what he meant.  Right now his big thing is logic/philosophy.  Talking to him is ridiculous because he latches onto the slightest logical inconsistency worse than Spock</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the spectrum for Aspergers and a couple other minor mental challenges. When I was in first grade any time there was a math problem I would see numbers in my head. I would solve problems almost as soon as I saw them. I was banned from explaining math to other students because it was &quot;confusing&quot;, but it totally made sense to me. I think your son's interest in logic/philosophy is very important for his growth. At the very least it was important for me. Understanding the emotions of others, what is right and wrong, and why are things right and wrong can be hard to grasp. I understand that some people will never be able to integrate into society by themselves, but my understanding of logic/philosophy and science has helped me integrate into many scenarios that I otherwise would have struggled with or would have been completely unable to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend that is some genius at math but doesn't have any mental disabilities (is that really how I would classify aspergers, etc?) that I know of. He has friends and is very competent socially. Anyways, he often argues with the math teacher and is usually right (but most of the teachers are rather incompetent at their jobs). I often ask him to explain things not because I don't understand the problem, but because I enjoy figuring out how he looks at them.
A few years ago we were talking about perfect right triangles. I didn't understand how you knew if it was a perfect right triangle without checking it with a calculator. I hate not understanding things because I'm usually quick to grasp things. So I asked my friend and he started in on how you were multiplying and adding and dividing things and then he circled a number on my paper. I still have no idea what he did but it was impressive to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope that's what's going to happen.  He definitely has the idea that there is a classical structure to western thought and that's what he's investigating.  He's not living in the moment the way emotions can let people smoothly enjoy friendships and most discussions take on an analytical slant.  There's worse things that could happen in this world other than to be brutally smart, even if it means he has no qualms insulting me or anyone else in his vicinity...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love your comment as it gave a lot of insight from different perspectives and provided a lot of material to think about. I have a couple follow up questions though. 1) it was my understanding that sociopathy is a spectrum disorder and only those at one extreme end felt absolutely no Emotions while others may have trouble only with things like empathy or guilt. Has this been proven/disproven and is it a useful metric?
2) studies have been done that show a correlation between income and IQ <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/pumpkinperson.com/2016/02/11/the-incredible-correlation-between-iq-income/amp/" target="_blank">https://www.google.ca/amp/s/pumpkinperson.com/2016/02/11/the-incredible-correlation-between-iq-income/amp/</a> as well as studies showing a correlation to psychopathy and success (21% of American CEO's are considered to show psychopathic traits <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/on-small-business/wp/2016/09/16/gene-marks-21-percent-of-ceos-are-psychopaths-only-21-percent/" target="_blank">https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/on-small-business/wp/2016/09/16/gene-marks-21-percent-of-ceos-are-psychopaths-only-21-percent/</a>)  which the wiki does a great job of outlining <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_in_the_workplace" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_in_the_workplace</a>. Since psychopathy and sociopathy both fall under ASPD (anti social personality disorder) can we infer/conclude that those with a higher IQ are at a higher risk of sociopathy/psychopathy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree with those studies - I have Aspergers with a high IQ and a Doctorate, yet struggle to hold a job because of the issues associated with the condition (boredom, anxiety, depression, sensory overload etc). Regardless, I think IQ tests should be scrapped because not everyone thinks in the same way so using a blanket measure to ascertain someone's intelligence is not only stifling and stigmatising to an individual but frankly archaic in 2017.</p></div>		</li>
