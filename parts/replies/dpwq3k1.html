			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the constant temperature of caves. Where does that heat come from? Above, or below. I've always wondered because no matter the temperature above, most, caves stay at an average of 55ish°</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cave temperature is not the same around the world. There is a equation dependent on both the latitude and altitude of the cave to <a href="http://weather.buffalostate.edu/sites/weather.buffalostate.edu/files/uploads/photos/PDF/Cave%20Temperature%20Poster.pdf" target="_blank">predict its internal temperature</a>. This strongly suggests cave temperature is determined by seasonal variation smoothed function of the external solar/weather driven temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat comes from the sun. The surface temperature cycles because of the day-night cycle. But warmth on the surface takes time to travel deeper into the ground. That slow heat does tail off over night, but then the sun rises again and the slow heating starts again. Eventually a balance is reached between how long it takes for that heat to travel down, and the length of the day-night cycle. In caves humans can reach that equilibrium point is 55ish. </p></div>		</li>

<p>On the surface, it’s negligible. Something like less than 10 Terawatts of energy. The crust’s thickness insulates virtually all thermal radiation from the earth’s core. </p>

<p>Eh, no. The power generated inside the Earth and the power delivered to the surface are practically identical (whether it's 10TW or closer to 50TW). There's nowhere else for the energy to go. The reason the core of the Earth is so hot is that even though the power generated is comparatively small, it's insulated very well. So it takes that big temperature difference to drive the thermal conduction (and a bit of convection) through to the surface, at the same rate as the power is generated in the interior.</p></div>		</li>
