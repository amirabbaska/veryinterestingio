			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad yours snapped back into place for you! I wasn't so lucky... I had a tummy tuck (thanks 10.1 lb. beautiful son) and the doctor sewed my muscles back together. He described it to me by using a corset as an example and said he laced me back up. It felt very odd for a few months because my muscles were literally sewn up from vag to ribs, but it worked! I'm not encouraging the procedure because it's very invasive and horribly painful, but it is an option for those who want the muscles fixed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also had this, 12 years after my son's birth. When I got pregnant I was all of 5'2&quot;, 110lbs, and not only gained a crap ton (I was a young mom with no clue about nutrition), but he was also 9lbs 6oz. </p>
<p>It was the BEST decision ever! It wasn't covered for me and I paid about $12,000 (yay Canada), but I'd do it again. </p>
<p>It was also the WORST pain! I thought I'd be fine. I have a high pain threshold and had a C-section. No. It's nothing like that. They basically sew up your muscles for an instant 6-pack so it's very very painful. I had to sleep sitting up for a month and couldn't fully lay down for about 7 weeks. I walked hunched over like a hunchback for about 2 weeks. Couldn't bend or laugh or anything. You use those muscles for EVERYTHING. </p>
<p>Then 3.5 months later I was 100% happy, enjoying my new bikini belly in Mexico. </p>
<p>Just...Be prepared for the worst for a temporary term lol.  </p>
<p>Edit: Also removing the drain tubes was the creepiest thing. They were like 10 feet long! OK no, but it felt like it. Felt like pulling worms out of my body. Probably the creepiest sensation ever lol      </p>
<p>Edit #2: also! My belly button is still numb, and it's 4 years later. But at least I have one now! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make sure you have help the first week of you do it. The first week I was in horrific pain (if you had a c-section, times that by 20), the second week I could manage the bathroom and microwave by myself but stayed in bed otherwise, and it got easier from there. I had swelling for a couple of months but that was normal.  The drainage tubes were a pain in the butt (they didn't hurt but were awkward to move around with) but I didn't have any pain when they were removed. I was just glad they were out! It was all worth it though! It is hands down the best cosmetic decision I ever made. </p>
<p>As far as it feeling normal now, not to me. My muscles are great, but I have some skin numbness that is permanent. It doesn't bother me though. To others, I just have a flat, rock-hard abdomen. :)  </p>
<p>I had an abdominal hysterectomy (when I was 25 :-/ ) about six months after my tummy tuck and it hurt waaaaay worse than the tuck. So if you've had a hysterectomy, you can handle it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  Do doctors/physicians usually recommend physiotherapy?  Or is that something you have to pursue individually?  I reckon that every situation is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia we try to get all our patients to see a physio. In some places its just a class that we have on the ward and we recommend the Mum's attend. If they do or not is another matter. If we find they have a large diastasis recti during their daily postnatal check then we refer them directly to the physio. </p></div>		</li>
