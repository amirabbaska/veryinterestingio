<p>For a while, byte referred to the group of bits encoding a character, even if it wasn't 8 bits.</p>

<p>And if you read some old standards you will find that they actually call 8 bits an <em>octet</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Octet' is still used to refer to each 8 bit part of an IP address today - e.g. the most common representation of an IPv4 address like 173.252.120.6 is 4 octets, as decimal numbers, separated by a dot.</p>
<p>It extends to the newer IPv6 addresses too: 2a03:2880:2130:cf05:face:b00c:0000:0001 is 16 octets, as 2-digit hexadecimal numbers, with a colon separating each group of 2 octets.</p>
<p>That's not the only possible representation of an IP address of course, since ultimately it's just a 32 bit/128 bit number (and so you can just as easily represent it as a decimal number - <a href="http://2919004166/" target="_blank"><a href="http://2919004166/" target="_blank">http://2919004166/</a></a> should take you to Facebook, for example.) But breaking it up into bytes/octets makes it much easier for humans to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer!</p>
<p>To add a bit more color: The PDP &quot;minicomputer&quot; series (they were &quot;mini&quot; because they didn't take up a whole room) were some of the most popular computers of the '60s and beyond (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor</a>).</p>
<p>Even in this same series, the word size jumped around dramatically, for machines intended for different purposes, or designed in different eras. While Intel chips have changed word sizes in compatible extensions (8 bits at the 8088, to 16 bits in the 80286 to 32 in the 80586 &quot;Pentium&quot; and nowadays, 64-bit processors), the PDP series was all over the map.</p>
<p>The original PDP-1 was an 18-bit word size. They kept that for a few revisions, but the PDP-5 cut it to 12 bits! The PDP-6 and PDP-10 were larger models that featured a 36-bit word (so, double the original 18). The PDP-11 was a 16-bit machine.</p>
<p>Eventually the dominance of the IBM architecture meant that power-of-two word sizes were here to stay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually the 8088 up until the 80386 was 16 bit. You're thinking of it's 8-bit data bus (which would require too much explanation here) compared to a 16 bit data bus. The core processing architecture of the 8080 on the other hand, was actually 8 bit, then 8086/8088 was 16 bit until the 386. then it was 32 bit, and finally we're now at x86-64 which is 64 bit. (though it can still operate in 32 and 16 bit modes)</p></div>		</li>
