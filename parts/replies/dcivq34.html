<p>also, if you stifle the free market, the companies that are protected get lazy. they don't need to compete with other markets, so you get shittier cars. ALL of this has been tried before. it doesn't work. </p></div>		</li>

It did NOT work, and America sank further into the depression. It was something economics. Something D-O-O economics. Voodoo economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the end result is still more expensive cars.  Domestic cards are more expensive.  So to benefit a small subset of society (automotive factory workers), we've slightly hurt all Americans (by making their cars a bit more expensive).  It's at best very wishful thinking that the benefit of employing those automotive factory workers is going to do more than end up net zero.  Historically it usually is a net harm to a country-at-large.  If it weren't, everyone would run with massive tariffs.  </p>
<p>So in a lot of ways, these kinds of import duties actually resemble general taxes.  General, fairly regressive taxes.</p></div>		</li>
