			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm happy when gas drops to 1.60 eur/liter over here in the Netherlands, most of the time I'm paying around ~1.70.</p>
<p>Beyond the high fuel prices, we also get to pay a pretty high road tax (mine is 60/month) and the ridiculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_tax_\(Ireland\)#Other_countries" target="_blank">BPM</a> tax, which basically means that buying any sort of car new you'll have to pay a premium tax on it, which depending on the car can result in a ridiculous high price, for example the same Volvo S60 T5 with ~240 bhp costs 53k eur in NL as opposed to $34k in the US, no wonder the tin cans C1/108/Aygo/etc. are so popular here.</p>
<p>It's all relative but I think Americans have it pretty good even at $3 a gallon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're contradicting yourself, although perhaps you don't realize it. The United States may be rich, but we're also one of those oil producers you talk about who tend to have significantly lower prices. It's not primarily that we're rich but subsidized, it's that we produce more of our own gas than any other Western nation except probably Norway. We need higher gas taxes because the current highway fund can't repair or replace even half the bridges and federal roads that are critically damaged right now, but even fully re-funding the Department of Transportation wouldn't bring prices near UK or German levels.</p>
<p>When you've got major crude deposits in or just offshore of some 8 odd states you get to drive cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The average price today, across the states, is 263.2 cents per gallon, while your tax is about 18%, also average across the states, making your pretax price per gallon around 211 cents. </p>
<p>The average price across the UK is around 734 cpg, while our taxes make up around 70% of the cost, meaning our pretax costs are around 212 cents. </p>
<p>The same taxes as the UK would give the states a similar price to the UK. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Completely wrong. Producing more of your own gas does not lower the prices for your country at all. Oil is a globally traded commodity. The oil companies don't give Americans discounts on oil just because some of it came from here. The reason oil producers tend to have lower prices is because they use that oil money to subsidize their consumers. Not oil producers do it though. Gasoline in Norway costs around $10/gallon. </p></div>		</li>
