<p>As such, what we observe is the survival of the gene and the meme (in the scientific meaning of the word, not the Internetz meaning), with us being mere vehicles of genes and memes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good! I deliberately left memetics out of the discussion because I cannot find a good source on memetic evolution and homosexuality.</p>
<p>Actually, this post has given me a idea. If female sexuality is more fluid than male sexuality as discussed in my post above, might there be a place for memetic evolution in this? Let me think about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I was not stipulating that memetics plays any particular role in homosexuality. I just wanted to complement the statement what &quot;our current understanding of evolution&quot; actually means.</p>
<p>But of course, mine is still a gross simplification. But then again, both would be way to complex for ELI5.</p>
<p>But please, do think about it and share here what you've come to!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought Kin Selection was pretty much established due to the existence of other counter-intuitive traits such as menopause. Females becoming spontaneously infertile wouldn't make any evolutionary sense unless by doing so they increased the chances of evolutionary success of their own daughters. Not trying to start an argument, but aren't there a bunch of traits that support the Kin Selection hypothesis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, Kin Selection is a thing and is used to explain things like menopause where older women stop having babies and start taking care of their grandkids.</p>
<p>For Kin Selection to apply to homosexuality, you need to show that homosexual males are spending more time and money on their relatives than their heterosexual counterparts, increasing their chances of survival. To the best of my knowledge no study has been able to show that, though if you manage to pull that off you're welcome to apply Kin Selection to homosexuality</p></div>		</li>
