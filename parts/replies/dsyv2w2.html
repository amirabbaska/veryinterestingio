			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the highest resolution machine I've worked with, which surpasses the limits of both optical and electron beam methods. This machine in fact relies on the small chance that an electron will break the rules of classical physics and fly from one object to another without contact, a technique that was developed alongside the advent of quantum physics. By cutting a thin wire at a sharp angle (with literal wire cutters from any hardware store) and using a machine to move that wire infinitesimally close to your sample, it turns out that that small chance becomes a measurable electrical current when you apply a charge to your sample. By setting the machine to maintain a fixed current, the wire is then traced over the surface of your sample. It will change height depending on if the current increases or decreases, so the topography you see is actually the path that your wire travels over the sample. </p>

<p>There's a very typical image on the Wikipedia page here, but not all atoms are arranged in that same structure, and not all of them are perfect like that.</p>
<p>The machine I used was suspended in three sealed stabilization chambers to eliminate vibrations from people walking in the building, air conditioning, nearby cars, elevators, etc. We had a pretty scrappy lab set up though, so although it was safe to breathe softly, speaking or sneezing had a high chance of distorting the image or forcing you to recut the wire. We often started with a broad low resolution topography to locate interesting areas, then took a higher resolution image of a smaller area once we found something good. This process can take hours and often the images are underwhelming and you need to try again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, this is the most badass thing I've ever seen on Reddit. You are obviously a wizard and I would appreciate if you would copy some level 7 spells into my spellbook.</p>
<p>Anyway, how do read what I expect is a veeery tiny change in potential? Do you have to cool the samples to reduce noise? Do you make multiple passes and add them together or is this a single pass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then atomic lattice structures I am referring to are smaller than that by several orders of magnitude, another commenter posted a very very good image, and in the Wikipedia article I linked to below there is a typical image of what you see being produced on your screen in real time while using the machine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not atoms at the top of that.  According to the scale at the bottom right it'd but an atom in the um magnitude of scale which is incorrect.  They're more in the angstrom magnitude which is 10000x smaller.  Also the fact that right underneath is what appears to be a smooth surface means this is not on the atom scale.</p>
<p>This is however a cool picture of a man made structure on the micron scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if STMs are the same way, but old electron microscopes actually had phosphorous screens you'd stare at to see an image. To take a picture you'd actually expose photographic film, then have to take it into a dark room. I used to have to do my TEM work in a dark closet taking notes by the glow of the big, mechanical buttons. Nowadays you get to sit in a well lit future-room browsing Reddit while you wait for the CCD to finish it's exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but why doesn’t it look like a photo taken with a flashlight? I mean there’s a single source of “light”, I would imagine such thing will look like a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CnNoqOM.jpg" target="_blank">Z depth pass</a> </p>
<p>Yet you see “light” bouncing all around. </p>
<p>That fresnel coating is what makes it look cgi. Idk. I can’t wrap my head around it. </p></div>		</li>
