			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. It's one of the reasons why many newer sites being built use media queries to adjust the layout of the site based on screen size instead of having a mobile version. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A mouse is still more precise than your finger on a touchscreen. Even on larger phones trying to click on things on, for example, the Reddit desktop site is fiddly and often leads to mis-clicks.</p>
<p>A mobile optimized site will have bigger buttons for easier touchscreen use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention the loads of data they get from your location, contacts, microphone and other built in data gathering tools. When using your browser, all they get is access to certain things, with everything else being automatically blocked. When you install the app, they're no longer hindered by those pesky security features in the browser.</p>
<p>That data they gather is worth money. It's not a lot for a single user, but if you get enough, companies will pay a good amount for it. These companies then mine that data in an effort known as &quot;Big Data&quot; to determine the behavior of their target market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This drives me nuts. I'm not a &quot;professional&quot; web designer, but I've made plenty of websites. If you do simple HTML coding by hand and stop using WYSIWYG shortcuts, it's really easy to make everything in your webpage relative. If you chill out on the annoying ass Flash content, you can easily make a fantastic webpage to fit any screen. It's that simple! You can even still drown the user in JavaScript without ruining the experience. I promise!</p></div>		</li>
