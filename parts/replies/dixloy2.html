			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a scene in halo four where John is talking to Lasky. </p>
<p>Lasky looks very human due to some very subtle movements. It's not the appearance of texture or lighting, it's hesitation and minor movements that look human. It's when John is about to fly the plane from the ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, in Final Fantasy 13, there were a few scenes, most notably little smiles that made me go O.O!!! Because it was so perfect.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have just been me knowingly processing a cartoony face and losing all sense of disbelief</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. The first two times a CGI character looked human to me were when Watto recognized Anakin in Star Wars Episode II and when Gollum reacted to the name Smeagol. It was a very subtle eye twitch in both cases, but it made them look like real beings and not graphics </p></div>		</li>
