			<div class="markdown"><p>What you should take from the second link (which is reasonably well-researched) is that the matter is by no means settled amongst historians. It isn't a great myth, it's just not easy to discern exactly how true or false it is. This is the reality of the medieval culinary historian because archaeobotany and other disciplines that can provide us with physical evidence for these questions are in their infancy. </p>
<p>Gregory of Tours is referenced for example, and while there are mentions of water being drunk in his work, there are far more of mentions of other beverages. The example of Radegund drinking water is poorly handled there, because actually that suggests that it was unusual: it's only mentioned because it's a mark of how she had become an extreme ascetic. Fortunatus tried to get her to drink wine as well for the sake of her health. </p>
<p>There's a 6th century dietary guide by a cleric called Anthimus that he wrote for the Frankish king Theuderic, and IIRC he doesn't mention water once (as a drink to be taken on its own) but mentions numerous alcoholic drinks in positive lights.</p>
<p>I just wrote my dissertation about early medieval alcohol consumption, and many of the sources I used failed to give the impression that water on its own was a popular drink (though as a diluting agent it certainly was). The secondary literature is pretty ambivalent, as it's hardly a worthwhile focus because we can't really determine it through archaeology or the literary sources. I am talking about the early medieval period though, I'm sure there's historiography about this for the later periods that are much richer in evidence and scholarship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this is one of those rumours that spreads around but doesn't have much basis in fact?</p>
<p>How to make water safer was probably known for a long time (it's essential to living). </p>
<p>The idea of drinking weak beers from my memory came from the multiple runs of grain that happened in the middle ages. The first run (therefore strongest) was given to the lord, but sparging wasn't a known process by that point so a second or third run of beer would be made from the same grain creating weaker pisswater.</p>
<p>When you're a serf working every day to stay alive i imagine getting drunk is pretty integral to staying vaguely sane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really about intoxication. Small beer might have been like, 1% ABV. It's just more nutritious than water, and if you're a serf you definitely need all the nutrition you can find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing no one has mentioned, beer (and specifically hops) acts as a preservative. So, you might have clean drinking water. But if you're trying to take it on a ship and keep it a container where it will be exposed to bacteria over a long period of time, beer becomes the better choice. IPAs supposedly became widespread because of this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and mead needs the domestication of honey</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't have to be domesticated. Wild honey is often collected, and probably has been for a very long time. The Hadza of East Africa, who may be the best existing analog for our ancestors &quot;in the wild&quot;, get something like 20% of their calories from wild honey, and honey from a variety of indigenous bee species was a major item of trade in the Maya region centuries before the honey bee was introduced by the Spanish. Mead is also easier to produce in some ways; it doesn't necessarily even have to be boiled, and honey naturally has antimicrobial properties that make a spoiled batch less likely. The boiling part may be important, because it's hard to boil anything without ceramics or metalworking. It's quite possible that mead predates beer. If water was sweetened with honey, and then stored for a while in a skin or gourd, it might very well ferment on its own, with no additional labor required, and that's something that could easily happen by accident. If it did, that would certainly be noticed by our hypothetical foragers, and the conditions that resulted in mead would not be hard to replicate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it has even been speculated mead may have been foraged itself from water collected inside hollow trees housing beehives with some fallen comb.  </p>
<p>If we remember honey comes inside honeycomb (which was valued itself as wax for either burning or using to seal things), it seems most likely to me mead resulted from comb washing water fermenting.</p></div>		</li>
