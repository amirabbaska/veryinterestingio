<p>Play tends to be unique to animals whose abilities change and grow with them. You won’t see much play among insects, arachnids and most reptiles for instance. They’re born fully capable (even though practice and learning can improve their capabilities).</p>

<p>Whoa. That never even remotely occurred to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a little spider that lives somewhere near the visor in my truck. That little bastard plays all the time. Comes down and tries to scare me. Much like a little kid jumping out from behind the door. I act scared and my spider buddy seems to laugh. Then he sits on the dash and keeps an eye on the road/my driving while also hoping for a fly to come in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just in lower grades really. I work at a university and some of our best professors insist on making play an integral part of their curriculum.</p>
<p>Our technical medicine students build robotic prosthetics that they need to control with their bicep to launch a pingpong ball into a goal. Our physics students fill inflatable pools with corn starch and water to learn about non newtonian physics.</p>
<p>We have tons of facilities for rapid prototyping so students can try out their ideas. And we have a number of large project teams that compete in global competition for solar and hydrogen powered land and water vehicles so they can put their knowledge into practice.</p>
<p>Cramming sucks, applying what you know makes knowledge stick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What university is this? These sound like the sort of things that a ridiculous amount of money should cover in an education, as opposed to most schools I see where you're just paying the ridiculous amount of money and going to regular &quot;cram and forget&quot; classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. If you are in university and reading this right now, join the clubs. You'll get more education out of them than from most of your classes. They look really good on a resume and they are really fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In high school I worked at a summer camp for young kids. When I started it was highly scheduled and didn't have great reviews. A new director the next summer let it be a little more free flowing, and had more free time for the kids. Kids loved it, and reviews and applications were up the next year. </p>
<p>Kids like to play. Let them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept of play-based learning is considered best practice for early childhood education where I am. The hardest part is getting teachers to move away from their pre planned non-emergent curriculums. Hopefully it becomes the standard someday though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curriculums are the result of adults rationing and scheduling a predetermined volume of information that the adults think every adult should know. It is an antiquated approach based on ignorance -- it presumes linear learning, presumes that all adults need identical knowledge, presumes that memorizing is learning. </p>
<p>I don't go to my dentist for her math skills and don't go to my accountant for his great essays. </p>
<p>Play allows us to efficiently learn what we're enthusiastic about, led by our own interests, the same forces which will help us to selectively accumulate the expertise which will make us valuable for others. </p></div>		</li>
