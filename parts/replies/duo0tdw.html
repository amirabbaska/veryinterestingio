<p>The system with the most planets I am aware of is the recently famous TRAPPIST-1 system, with 7 confirmed rocky planets</p>

<p>surely then our own system is the largest? (edit: among all systems that we have observed obviously, as that was what OPs question is about)</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can't see it if its too small, we can't see it if it's orbit doesn't pass over just the right spot, and we have to be looking for planets around that star right when it passes in front of the star. This can be really difficult, especially when the planet has a long year like Neptune (165 Earth years) just for one trip around the Sun. We have to make sure that the change we see is caused by a planet getting in the way and not some other phenomenon.</p>
<p>There are almost certainly star systems with far more planets than our own, it's just really hard for us to see them. Until recently we were wrong about how many planets were in our own solar system, we might still be wrong, there could be planets orbiting our sun that we just haven't found yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd point out that planets are hard to see, but we still have observed planets directly.</p>
<p>HR 8799, for example, has planets (or at least, probably planets, depending on mass uncertainties) we have directly imaged and the outer planet takes over 450 years to go around the star.</p>
<p>There's also a few other methods that can be used to find planets around other stars, like radial velocity measurements of the star, which also doesn't require the precise alignment that a transit does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were observing our own solar system from the outside, we probably would only have found 1-3 planets at most. We are much better at finding large planets with short periods. For other types of planets we are much worse at detecting them, so the fact that we haven't found a larger system doesn't strongly indicate that our system is the largest. /u/dukesdj posted a good graph to demonstrate the kinds of planets we have found so far to demonstrate this bias: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GbC7W" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/GbC7W</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>About four times the diameter of Earth, so big but not massive. It would be smaller than Neptune. And it would be in an orbit, so not &quot;making its way into the inner solar system.&quot; It's theoretical orbit would bring it no closer than 200 times father from the sun than the Earth out to about 1200 times Earth's orbit.</p></div>		</li>
