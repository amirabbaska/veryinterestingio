			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that CharmingRogue851 was referring to the fact that melatonin production increases when the sun goes down/when it's dark out, decreases when you have optical exposure to sunlight. For me at least, whenever I go camping I always fall asleep way earlier than normal because my exposure to light decreases after the sun goes down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, exactly. I just stated that Melatonin was influenced by sunlight, I should've also spoken about the direction in which it is influenced in. Thanks for clarifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be because you're exhausting your body at the beach by being exposed to sunlight, forcing your body to produce more melanin and also sweating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absolutely wrong. Melatonin has a very mild hypnotic effect and secretion only starts 90-120 minutes prior to habitual bedtime. </p></div>		</li>
