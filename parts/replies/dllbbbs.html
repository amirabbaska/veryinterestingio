			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. I actually feel very refreshed afterwards. These naps are absolutely necessary if I didn't get enough sleep the night before; when that's the case, I'll nap for about an hour if I can.</p>
<p>If it helps, my general rule is that if the sun is still in the sky it's still ok to nap. Then aim for shorter naps the later it is.</p></div>		</li>
