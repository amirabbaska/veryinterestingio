<p>A couple of things about the Eskimo/Inuit diet, maybe you or someone else here can shed some light.</p>
<p>First, is the amount eaten that high due to maintenance of homeostasis?  They are living in arctic/subarctic conditions, and I'm guessing it takes a lot of energy to stay warm up there.</p>
<p>Second, is it really true that the extremely low carbohydrate diet that those population groups eat for much of the year have good health effects?  Low-carb advocates constantly single these people out as examples, and the claim is that incidents of heart disease and metabolic disorder are far lower among traditional Inuit than among those who have adopted a modern Western diet.  I'm asking this mostly because I've never found a direct source for these claims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only have a couple of minutes to fire off a quick reply, but:</p>
<p>1) Yes. Gotta eat a lot of calories to slog through the snow, kill seals, drag it all back home. But it's not as hard as that, really; the Inuit and similar groups have adapted remarkably well- well enough that &quot;prepared&quot; Europeans would starve and freeze, <em>even after observing how the natives did it seemingly effortlessly.</em> I would recommend &quot;Fat of the Land&quot; by the Arctic ethnologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson. The <a href="http://highsteaks.com/the-fat-of-the-land-not-by-bread-alone-vilhjalmur-stefansson.pdf" target="_blank">pdf is available online.</a></p>
<p>2) Health effects are contestable, if for no better reason than that it is impossible to do similar studies today. People will be happy to point out the modern Inuit and Inupiat suffer a slew of medical problems, but- then again, they don't eat and live like their ancestors did. The introduction of Westernized foods, starting with the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line, was a catastrophe, one documented in <a href="http://journals.lww.com/nutritiontodayonline/Citation/1977/05000/When_the_Eskimo_Comes_to_Town_.7.aspx" target="_blank">When the Eskimo Comes to Town</a> written in 1977. The teeth rot, for one thing. Introduction of tobacco and other factors have made it impossible to compare health factors.</p>
<p>Then there's the argument that they &quot;didn't live that long,&quot; due to the tough life, meaning they shouldn't develop cancer as Westerners did, anyway. <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2008/07/cancer-among-inuit.html" target="_blank">This blog</a> discusses cancer, and the next entry discusses the longevity issue.</p>
<p>But I will note this: cancer in the Inuit was rare enough that its appearance merited publication in the pre-DEW Line days, i.e.: pre-1950s.</p>
<p>I will happily agree that the statistics are wonky because 1) old medicine isn't always good medicine and 2) there are some difficulties in the statistics due to age, but I would humbly suggest that the subject merits additional review by those unfamiliar with the extant literature. It is intriguing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? There are athletes out there with activity levels that would be sufficient to burn off that kind of input. Not a <em>huge</em> number of them, but it wouldn't be impossibly difficult to find a cohort of competitive swimmers or similar to recruit for a study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, when those asshats from Top Gear took a super-off-roader to drive to the North Pole, they were advised to eat about 8000 calories a day in high fat high sugar foods, just to maintain a metabolism that was working overtime to keep them warm. </p></div>		</li>
