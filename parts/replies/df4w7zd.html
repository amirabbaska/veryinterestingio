<p>Think of a plane with the tail kinked slightly to one side, it will not fly sight without constant adjustment from the pilot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bit of an off topic FYI:  It's not uncommon for aircraft to have uneven loads/drag, especially with military aircraft carrying external stores.  In addition to that, the weight of the plane will change as fuel is used and external stores are used (and thus the amount of lift required to maintain altitude decreases).</p>
<p>Most aircraft allow you to trim the aircraft to adjust for these imbalances.  What control surfaces you can trim will vary from aircraft to aircraft.  Some can just trim elevators, while others can trim elevators, rudder, and ailerons.  <a href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/7b5/a-10c_2.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> you can see the gray trim hat on the stick of an A-10C, which allows you to trim the elevators and the ailerons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot / most single engine prop planes actually have the tail canted slightly one way to counteract the force of the prop that wants to move the plane sideways. Some twin engines are able to negate this by having the engines counter rotate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that: when you push on something that's not spinning, it moves in the direction you push it. When you push on something that is spinning, it moves sideways from the push. </p>
<p>That means that instead of the bullet tumbling in flight, it precesses: it rotates around the axis of the spin, but still basically points in the right direction. Then, instead of the initial push making it tumble and go completely off-course, it remains almost on the original course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am so damn confused, pushing it while not spinning causes it to both go in the direction you push it, but also makes it go off course? How are those not opposing statements?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bullet is pointing forward and moving forward. The air pressure is slightly off-centre, for example due to an irregularity in the bullet's shape. </p>
<p>If the bullet is not spinning, this unbalanced force turns the bullet's nose away from the direction it's moving. Now the air resistance is even more unbalanced, making the bullet go off course, and tumble in flight.</p>
<p>If the bullet is spinning, a slight sideways push on its nose makes it go in a circle: instead of tumbling around an axis at right angles to the direction of flight, it will now wobble around an axis that's in line with the direction of flight, just like an American football thrown with a spin.</p></div>		</li>
