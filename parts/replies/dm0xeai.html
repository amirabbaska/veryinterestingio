			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the behaviors of very small things are perceived to change, at that scale. What behaviors would seem to change on the opposite end of the same scale?
Is there a specific point where quantum effects begin to be observable? Where macro (?) effects begin? Is it gradual?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird effects happen as you get bigger, smaller, or faster. Big and fast things are affected more by relativity, and small things are affected more by quantum effects. </p>
<p>Quantum effects are noticable when you are looking at individual atoms or molecules, although with some materials you can get quantum effects at a larger scale. The reason they arent noticable at a medium scale is that the effects cancel out and sort of blur into what we percieve as normal behavior. They are physically too small to notice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, relativistic effects are noticable at any scale depending on the situation, such as a sattelite in orbit measuring time different from an object on the surface. As far as the more famous relativistic effects go, gravitational lensing is only noticable on large objects.</p>
<p>I would say relativistic effects appear more gradually than quantum effects.</p>
<p>All of these effects are explained by the same laws of physics everywhere in the universe, and like the commenter above me said, these laws never change. In this case, laws mean mathematical equations.  These equations simply have more or less of an effect on the behavior of an object dependint on the scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're observing quantum effects currently by using a transistor based computer. The output of your computer is quantum effect in action.</p>
<p>I think what the original post you were replying to was getting at is there is no difference between the quantum scale and any other scale, it's all continuous, you don't just have a stopping point where you have a certain scale where you are immune from quantum effects. It's all one big complex interaction. </p></div>		</li>
