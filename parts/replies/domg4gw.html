			<div class="markdown"><p>So are the different clouds made of different chemicals that don't like to mix with each other? Or do the chemicals separate out at different temperatures? Like gas A might start rising at temperature X, and gas B might rise at temperature X+10%...??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about phase changes from gas to liquid.  As air rises it gets colder, which makes some of the gases condense into liquid drops or ice crystals, like dew or frost on your car windshield.  When the air sinks it warms, and the stuff turns back into invisible gas again.  Different gases condense at different temperatures, and the rising and falling patterns vary from place to place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help to think about it this way: why is the sky never completely full of big fluffy clouds? Those clouds are formed by rising air. However, you can't have rising air everywhere so there has to be regions between clouds where the air sinks back down to the surface. What controls how big the rising region is relative to the sinking region is one of the big open questions of atmospheric science and is hugely important for understanding how clouds / precipitation / storms will change with climate change, for example. The problem is that clouds are extremely complex, with important processes occurring on molecular level (phase changes, nucleation) and large scale (thunderstorms).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The darkest areas, often found on the edges of the bands, are where air is sinking, so the lack of clouds lets us see deeper into the planet.</p>

<p>Hold up - the only places we really see a lack of clouds on Jupiter are in the 5-micron hot spots off the edge of the Equatorial Zone - indicated by the arrow <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hlKqKnu.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> - and tend to be bluish in color due to Rayleigh scattering off the cloud-free hydrogen-helium atmosphere.</p>
<p>If by &quot;darkest areas&quot; you're referring to the source of color in the brown belts, that's not caused by cloud-free areas. Both zones and belts still show spectral signatures of a top ammonia cloud, it's just that the lower cloud-tops in the belts also show a spectral signature of an overlying haze layer with a different single scattering albedo. At no point in the belts is there a break in the upper ammonia cloud deck where you're seeing down to the middle ammonium hydrosulphide cloud deck.</p>

<p>Yeah, those are the bits I had in mind, though by &quot;lack of clouds&quot; I also meant &quot;fewer clouds until you get deeper&quot;.

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC there are NDE mass specs. Does the term &quot;mass spectrometer&quot; necessarily require an accessible sample? </p>
<p>In any case, other methods of spectroscopy exist and can certainly aid in the discovery of atmospheric composition. After all, we know that there is a giant source of blackbody radiation illuminating each planet, and we have a pretty good method of determining the intensities across the emmision spectrum. So long as we've got satellites to capture the reflected emmisions, we've got a pretty good guess regarding the composition of other planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We absolutely could!  However, since a mass spectrometer needs actual samples to work with, we need to drop one into the atmosphere.  Only one spacecraft (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Probe" target="_blank">Galileo probe</a>) has ever done that, and it had the bad luck to land in one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Hot_spots" target="_blank">dark, no-cloud regions</a> I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But you're right that that would solve the mystery, and if you've got a couple billion dollars to spare we'd love to go back and try again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out it's (surprisingly) difficult to pick out cloud composition from infrared spectroscopy of Jupiter's clouds.</p>
<p>While all our models suggest the top cloud layer is ammonia, and we do indeed see the entire planet cloaked in clouds, only about 1% of the surface area shows Spectrally Identifiable Ammonia Clouds (SIAC). The assumption here is that ammonia cloud particles get very quickly coated in hydrocarbon haze particles, essentially masking the spectroscopic signature of ammonia in most cases. Only the very freshest clouds (not yet coated in hydrocarbons) seem to be SIACs.</p>
