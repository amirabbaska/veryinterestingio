			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer I was going to give.  People get too caught up in the details.  Yes, if you walk out on Mars using a hospital oxygen mask, you are going to die quickly.  Forget that dumb example; imagine you are engineer who wants to make an emergency life support system that you can snap on in seconds, can you do it?</p>
<p>You need to hit the dangers in order of priority.  Priority number one is oxygen.  Can you get oxygen into a human mostly exposed to vacuum?  Priority number two is probably to save your eyes from drying out.  After that, everything else becomes a long term danger.  Vacuum exposure will eventually start to kill you, but it is going to be a good long time.</p>
<p>Personally, I imagine a face shield that covers your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.  You put it on, and then it cinches up very tight, and maybe spews a tar like substance to make a solid seal.  It would have to be cinched up so tight it hurt, and even then I think you would need to use some sort of sealant, but one assumes this is an emergency and you are okay with that.  </p>
<p>The only other real kink I can think of is probably your ass.  That said, I have a feeling that that would functionally seal up good enough that it would let you maintain internal pressure.  Your intestines would will probably just collapse and effectively seal up your guts from your longs.  Maybe they need an emergency butt plug too?</p>
<p>Once you have your face protected, you are good for a while.  Your skin can <em>easily</em> maintain 1 bar.   You will swell up and maybe start to get cold as the water in your skin evaporates, but that is a long term problem; and it might be set off by the fact that, assuming you have decent boots, the only way you will be losing heat is through evaporation and a little radiation; you are otherwise in a nearly perfect insulator from conduction and convection; a near vacuum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i would like to research further this emergency butt plug. More so the name. Would it be behind glass that must be broken? Would you want something in your butt that was around broken glass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anal seal is less of a problem than intestinal gas. It will expand and overwhelm the ability of the intestines to cope. These farts from hell will be no laughing matter but outright dangerous. Early attempts at high-altitude flights were bothered with this problem until pressure suits began to be used. There is little you can do with intestinal gas. It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_altitude_flatus_expulsion" target="_blank">HAFE</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then how come it isn't a serious problem for saturation divers decompressing from several atmospheres?</p>
<p>Actually, damn, I can answer that myself: If you were down long enough to build up pressurised fart gases rather than just compressing your existing farts, you'd have to ascend too slowly for this to be a problem since dissolved nitrogen in the blood is a bigger concern.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you know what the difference between Earth to vacuum is? Roughly the difference of going 10 meters underwater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no it's not. I see your point, that there's a difference of roughly 1 atm between Earth and vacuum vs Earth and 10 metres (which I presume you're saying is 2atm, doesn't really matter if it's 1.5 or 2.5, I get your point), and that 1atm is 1atm.</p>
<p>Except it's not. You're assuming the difference is additive rather than multiplicative/divisive, but it's certainly the latter. Going from a fraction of an atmosphere (vacuum is never exactly zero, but that's not the point here) to 1atm is three orders of magnitude if I'm being conservative. Going from 1atm to 2atm is less than 1 order of magnitude. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say in another comment it's not exactly the same or that easy.</p>
<p>That being said, even without a suit you can survive in the equivalent in pressure difference using just a pressurized mask and tank under water.</p>
<p>It was more of just something to point out how people treat vacuums as the worst thing, without an analog, when it really isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. What aspect of the pressure difference are you talking about here? You're right if we're talking about a balloon that stretches to equalise internal and external pressure with zero resistance, but I don't think that's the best model.</p>
<p>If you have a pressure vessel that resists the force without changing size, then it's the same stress applied to it going from vacuum to  sea level as from sea level to 10m down.</p>
<p>I think a better way of making your point would be sticking with his analogy: If you're on the surface and breathing air from a SCUBA regulator 10m underwater, it's going to be like sticking an air gun in your mouth. The pressure differential over your body is the problem here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now of course to build something that can create a perfect seal around someones neck(Assuming we are isolating the entire head) that is pressurized to Earths atmosphere without leaking would be quite a task, let's not talk about the engineering aspect. Assuming that is true; YES you can survive in space and on mars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would also need to create a seal around you genitals and anus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the anus and urethra should be able to overcome the pressure difference. I mean water doesn't rush into your anus and urethra when you're down 30 feet due to pressure difference does it?</p>
<p>Sure it's not exactly the same, but skin and our seals are amazingly resilient. Mostly you would probably just fart an incredible amount then be fine. Any liquid near the end of your urethra etc would evaporate so having a dry peehole might be incredibly uncomfortable, but for the most part i'm sure your anus can overcome the pressure difference.</p>
<p>Though this was almost my entire point. At the point you need special engineering, and still have a lot of ill effects like skin dying over time etc, why not just wear a full suit? A full suit is much easier to pressurize and keep anything from leaking, then relying on a mask that can create a seal over your face. Muscles moving can slowly allow breaches in your mask, for example.</p>
<p>Plus butt plug or something to go over your waste and head, what's the point? Wear a suit.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You're much bulkier and less manoeuvrable and dexterous, and any slight damage anywhere on your body will decompress the whole suit and kill you.</p>
<p>As best I can tell, it's the fact that it's so damned hard to get on and off that killed the space activity suit, once it's on it seems clearly superior to a traditional pressure suit.</p></div>		</li>
