<p>Lobbying in its current state evolved from a more acceptable practice of simply getting advice from people knowledgable in a given field.
For example: If you are trying to enact reform on law enforcement, a congressman who has little interaction with the police would have a hard time drafting legislation to address any of the prevalent problems. Therefore lobbyists would come to the Congressman to give their perspective.
Activists from groups such as the NAACP or ACLU might give their opinion on the problems with how law enforcement currently affects people negatively, so he would know what problems need to be fixed. Representatives from the police union might give their opinion on the reasons officers act with the protocols they use. The congressman needs this kind of information to do their job effectively.</p>

<p>The problem here is that not all stakeholders are allowed to give their input and it typically ends up being one &quot;highly financed&quot; side with no representation of other sides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<p>I'm Canadian, and a formal political staffer to several MPs. My bosses were frequently lobbied, and I was usually in the room. But the dynamic is totally different because of the role of money in politics.</p>
<p>In Canada, we control money in politics in 3 ways: contribution limits, spending limits and 3rd party limits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Contributions: Only an individual (no corporations, unions, trade associations and such) can make a political contribution. The individual must either be a Canadian citizen or a Canadian permanent resident (landed immigrant or refugee). Individuals can donate a total of $1,550 per year total to all MPs, federal candidates (people running to become MPs in an election) and riding associations (the legal entity behind the MP in their party at the local level). Not per candidate, that's the total amount you can give to all in that category combined. Plus, you can also give $1,550 to political parties (again, all parties combined). So no individual can donate more than $3,100 to federal politicians in a year. Ya, that's a hefty chunk of money, but it's really not enough to buy loyalty. Influence, yes. Especially when you get a group of like-minded donors together and pool their funds. But it's really hard to deliver huge sums, and as you'll see, it wouldn't matter if you could</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spending limits: spending in the &quot;writ period&quot; (about 7 weeks leading up to an election) is tightly controlled. Political parties can only spend about $20 million in that period leading up to the election. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that they'll spend about half of that on the private jet required to move the party leader around the country. Local MPs and candidates have a spending limit of about $150,000 in that period. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/dean-del-mastro-appeal-election-expenses-jail-1.3522329" target="_blank">Politicians go to jail for breaking this rule</a> and it even includes in-kind donations (except for labour). The spending limit is also connected to fundraising, because most A-list politicians have this amount in their warchest. This means that they effectively spend most of their political lives without the need to fundraise, because it would be a waste of time.</p>
</li>
<li>3rd party limits: if third parties want to advertise in an election, they have to follow strict rules that force them to talk about issues only and not specific parties or candidates. They have to register with Elections Canada, and in the 7 weeks leading up to the election, they can only spend $150,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Our system isn't perfect. There are changes that need to be made, including better regulation of the inter-election period (there is talk of the Trudeau Liberals introducing legislation that would regulate annual non-election political spending as well as in-writ spending). We probably also need some form of public disclosure on bundling. But by and large, at the federal level (unlike certain provinces, which have their own election laws) it's really, really hard to buy politicians.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So question: Let's say a lobbyist happens to be a business owner or a board member of a corporation who controls a large amount of real estate. They also have many friends who have access to goods and services.</p>
<p>Lobbyist donates their &quot;maximum&quot; $3100 annual fund, writes it off in taxes and so on. Then the lobbyist sees to it that while politician is staying at a hotel the room is not charged, their meals &amp; rooms service are paid for and so on. Things happen every day in hotels where guests rooms get comped. While there the banquet facilities are utilized to hold a dinner for a private town hall. The politician gets a few rounds of golf in, and during the rounds the lobbyist and dinner attendees discusses donating to the policitians &quot;completely non-profit&quot; organization.</p>
<p>So the lobbyist donated $3100 on paper and gives probably another $500k in goods, services, and exposure which cannot be proven to be gifted.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok so what can private corporations spend? What's to stop a corporation from running ads which are indicative that &quot;The new policy enacted by the NDP will lead to a safer future for Canada&quot; in a very heavy handed manner. Again it's not backing a candidate but it's lobbying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice, true. In theory, everyone is completely able to call their congressman, your congressman might just not give a damn. But it would be hard to write a law(and harder to enforce one) mandating that public officials genuinely care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You did an excellent job explaining the principles and utility of lobbying. In particular, you explained it in a way that's difficult for a reasonable person to misinterpret.</p>
<p>The only omission I can imagine for an ELI5 would be a short description of just how overt true &quot;corruption&quot; is in some places. Some leaders literally install friends and family members  in key civil and governing positions, allowing over-the-counter payments and benefits with clear conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>People will complain about cronyism and nepotism until their faces turn blue (and rightly so), but to help someone understand why we might use different terms it's useful to remind them we've come a long way from where some parts of the world still are.</p>
<p>Not intending to criticize, just adding to the conversation. Your response was excellent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem I see is that not every stakeholders input has equal precedence because just like in corporate sector when higher the share of the stakeholder (donations) more attention will be given to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No-nonsense comment.</p>
<p>If I may, may own â‚¬0.02 on how this is addressed in France :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>campaign budgets are capped by law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the finances of political parties and candidates must be accountable and auditable by third parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the cost of electoral campaign is refunded by public money, provided the candidate garners a somewhat significant vote share (5% ?)</p>
</li>
<li>such rules are routinely enforced : now and then, elections are invalidated, politicians are convicted, sometimes sentenced to prison.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still imperfect, of course : such laws are written by politicians, who are not naturally inclined to castigate themselves. Public prosecutors enforcing those rules are, after all, civil servants answering to the government. However, any politician openly oposing those rules has no chance of being elected and the somewhat wide array of political parties ensures that every politician is under scrutiny at all time.</p>
<p>Case in point : the current front-runner in the upcoming French presidential election comes out of seemingly nowhere and is building his own party on the go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The law cannot restrict an individual from spending their OWN money on a television ad to promote themself, due to freedom of speech. So if there was no mechanism for politicians to raise money, almost all large scale political campaigns would be inaccessible to anyone who was not privately wealthy or famous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect on multiple premises. The requirement for large amounts of money removes most people's access for multiple reasons. The first is obvious. They don't have the money, so that makes them less likely. The second is that politicians end up inadvertently preferring access to those with money as they have to in order to win the election. </p>
<p>When money isn't an issue it generally doesn't matter who is visiting politicians from a financial perspective. What they will start considering is the issues of importance to voters, which is objectively a better route. </p></div>		</li>
