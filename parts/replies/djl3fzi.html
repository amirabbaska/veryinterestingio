<p>An atom basically looks like the solar system. The sun being the centre and the planets in orbit are the electrons orbiting. The only difference is there are multiple elecctrons in a single orbit. So imagine Earth absorbing a photon. What happens when an electron absorbs a photon is that it jumps up to a bigger orbit because it has so much energy. Thus Earth will jump up to the orbit of say Neptune. Then instantly Earth will release that energy in the form of light and return to its original orbit.</p>
<p>A phosphorescent Earth will also jump to Neptune, but then will jump down in smaller steps releasing small amounts of energy (dim light). It will jump to Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter and so on until its back to its original orbit. </p></div>		</li>
