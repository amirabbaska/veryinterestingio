			<div class="markdown"><p>The tendency to have seizures is a defect. Normally developed brain should not get seizure from sensory input. When someone is born blind the other sensory modalities often spread to visual cortex so it is not really unused. There are studies where TMS has been applied to the visual cortex of congenitally blind people and where in the controls it usually induces visual responses the blind subjects experienced for example tingling sensations. </p>
<p>We don't actually know exactly what causes seizures. The reason why certain sensory inputs induce them is probably the rhythmic nature of those stimuli. So a strong light is not as bad as flashing light. I would guess that an epileptic brain has some kind of abnormal feedback loop that can form dangerously self reinforcing activity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. In an epileptic person, even who otherwise doesn't have occipital lobe seizures, that's probably pretty likely to trigger one. In a non-epileptic person, it's probably a little less likely, but really any time your brain is going through major rewiring like that you're susceptible to seizures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it says no speculation, but this is more of a question in response to you mentioning frequency.</p>
<p>Do people react under specific frequencies (e.g. 5Hz), or is it once a frequency has been exceeded (e.g. any frequency greater than 5Hz)?</p>
<p>If it was only specific frequencies, could constructive interference at certain frequencies be a possibility as a result of higher amplitude waves then causing a knock-on effect in the brain?</p></div>		</li>
