			<div class="markdown"><p>We havent done any of those. We do a bit of EDM &quot;drilling&quot; into carbide blanks so I assume its something similar. A copper EDM rod will &quot;drill&quot; into carbide pretty easily.</p>
<p>The bits we make are in the medical field mostly.</p>
<p>Edit: After looking it up, looks like the blanks are formed with a wire in the desired helix and then heated to the point where the wire melts away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbide tools are made from powdered tungsten carbide, so the holes are formed in the press before it gets sintered. No machining necessary   I’ve never seen HSS drills with coolant holes so I’m not sure if/how those are made</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some tools have a central coolant channel and then holes are spark eroded in to meet the channel as required.
Others where the coolant channels follow the helix can be made as the powdered carbide is pressed through a die.  There are wires with a type of ferrule crimped on the end that float in the centre of the die as the powder is pushed through.</p>
<p>Imagine the process of creating pasta twirls to get an idea of what I mean.</p></div>		</li>
