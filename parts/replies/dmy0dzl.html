			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works with a table top x-ray laser, this is correct (more or less). The physics behind the x-ray generation is called high harmonic generation (HHG) and is explained using the Three Step Model. </p>
<p>Paul Corkum published it in 1993: <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1961" target="_blank">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1961</a></p>
<p>This produces coherent light in the x-ray regime, however this process is not amplified simulated emission. I think that technically speaking x-ray lasers are not a thing in that nobody had been able to do Light Amplified Simulated Emission which produces x-rays (to my knowledge). Instead physicists have used other methods (e.g. high harmonic generation, free electron lasers) to produce light with the same properties an x-ray laser would have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. The people at <a href="www.xuvlasers.com/Technology.html" target="_blank">XUV Lasers</a> seem to have a legit Neon laser operating at 25 eV (46.9 nm) utilizing the 3p-3s transition.  Current work in HHG aims to produce light near 1 keV (1.24 nm). Free electron lasers go even higher, LCLS operates between 200-9500 eV (0.13-6.2 nm). </p>
<p>Wikipedia says x-rays are 100-100k eV, which is in a region where there are no valence transitions for any element. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-ray guy here. Do the linear accelerator type &quot;free electron lasers&quot; really use stimulated emission or is it a misnomer to call them lasers?</p>
<p>It sounds like the tabletop ones are relying on harmonics which I imagine would produce a really low intensity beam.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free electron lasers are actually radiation produced through the magnetic acceleration of relativistic electrons.  Laser might be a slight misnomer, but the term laser is generally applied to any photon source that is coherent over usable distances and times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linac light sources use bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering. I don't know if any reason to call either of those processes &quot;stimulated emission&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of. Typically they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-amplified_spontaneous_emission" target="_blank">Self-amplified spontaneous emission</a>. Light emitted early shapes the bunch to increase the probability that light emitted later is in phase. You get light with laser-like properties, but not from the same mechanism as in a conventional laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am working for a Team at DESY in Hamburg where we want to do table top acceleration of electrons and generate xrays via inverse compton scattering. The basic process is shooting with a Laser on a photocathode to emit free electrons which get accelerated through an therahertz Field. Afterwards the inverse compton scattering Takes Place where a high power Laser is shooting against these electrons to bring them to emit the xrays. All of this should fit into about three laborstories and the aim is to give a wider spectrum of useres the possibilities to do their experiments. Right now there are a few free electron Lasers which are at least 300 meters long where you have to wait about a year to do your experiment. Of course the tabletop Will Never be as powerfull as the big FELs but we  want to open a new market for an easier accessible use.
The Project is called AXSIS.
And a good book would be the physics of free electron lasers written by Saldin and jurkov. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I liked Milonni's book (&quot;Lasers&quot;) a bunch. Boyd's &quot;Nonlinear Optics&quot; is also a pretty complete reference/overview. Both have pretty solid discussions of the fundamentals of both CW and pulsed light generation. As far as elaborating goes, creating pulses is kind of its own world within the laser world, since they're usually used in order to produce higher power lasers by creating the energy in short bursts (since power is energy per time and making the denominator smaller makes the value bigger). But this comes at the cost of losing precision in the energy, since the short bursts come from the constructive overlap of multiple frequencies (also follows Heisenberg, since you can only minimize precision in time more by losing frequency precision).  The short pulses (increase in timing precision) also provide the necessary time resolution for seeing the real time dynamics on time scales faster than anything purely electronic/mechanical would be able capture. More than that though, especially if you're asking for grad level, I'd say the books will serve as much better sources of info. I love talking about lasers, though, feel free to PM me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fantastic, thank you! It's some really cool work you do!! I work in EO but more on the image processing, MTF Calc side and will be transitioning to some laser based work. It seems I struck the jackpot in asking your thoughts. Thank you so much! </p></div>		</li>
