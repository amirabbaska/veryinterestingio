</blockquote>
<p>I guarantee they do not spend $4 to ship most products. At the company I used to work for, which was in the medical supplies business, it cost 3 cents a mile to ship FedEx to places. Now let's consider that Amazon is one of the biggest companies in the U.S. with a revenue 11-12 times that of the company that I used to work for. They might be spending 1 cent a mile at most because of their volume and the economy of scale discounts they get. Combine that with how effectively their distribution centers are spread around the country and I'd venture that most places are within 100 miles of their DC's. They may even have deals in place that will limit the maximum price per parcel they pay. Not saying that you're idea isn't right, just pointing out their shipping cost is likely a lot cheaper than you think it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I don't know what amazon pays, but as a third party seller, I get a massive UPS discount when I ship product into amazons warehouses because of their partnership. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: your last point. The item isn't  $40 because Amazon built shipping into pricing. The 3rd party sellers lower their price and add shipping to price match amazon. Many sellers lose money and go out of biz trying to compete against amazon. Source: I sell on amazon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of those $40 prime &amp; $35 + $4 goods are actually being sold by the same 3rd party sellers, one fulfilled by Amazon &amp; one fullfilled by merchant. They get the prime members who only search prime and then they also get the non-prime members who see $39 as a better deal. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, fast processing and predictive warehousing.  They have nearly every item I've ordered within a 6 hour drive of my apartment.  Occasionally I'll order something that has to come from a couple states away, but its rare.  I kinda do some supply chain analysis for work, so I really like reading about their models for predicting what will be sold where and preloading their warehouses to meet expected demand.</p></div>		</li>
