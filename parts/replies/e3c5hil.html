			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a thing I recall from an Einstein documentary. Einstein was famous for his &quot;thought experiments&quot; and this is one I remember.</p>
<p>Imagine you're working on a train, shoveling coal into a furnace. If you double the amount of coal, you double the amount of energy in the system, and by extension, you double the speed of the train (in practice, this is obviously not true, but this is just for purposes of illustration, so let's go with it.)</p>
<p>Now, let's say you're on a train moving at the speed of light and you add more energy to the system. The train cannot go faster than the speed of light, so the only other option is for the train to get <em>heavier</em> instead. E=mc^2 so energy becomes matter.</p>
<p>This is also the reason that only massless (or essentially massless) particles can reach the speed of light. The more mass in an object, the more energy required for it to accelerate, and there becomes a certain threshold where the amount of energy needed to reach the speed of light is infinite. Photons are (far as I know) the smallest particle we know of, and therefore the fastest. This isn't to say that for example tachyons might exist with even less mass moving at even greater speeds, but if that's the case, we have no evidence of such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, tachyons move backwards in time, or so I was told previously. That is, I presume due to their smaller mass and that they can exceed the Speed of Light, correct? Seeing as they're faster, that leads to arriving before the light and before they can be processed, so from our perspective, they're arriving before we can record they've left...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for bringing up the train experiment hadn't thought about it in a while :-)</p>
<p>The quality which permits them - in fact requires them - to move at lightspeed is that the photon lacks rest mass.  All of a photon's mass is from the energy of its moving wave.  A photon with no wave energy is nothing at all.</p>
<p>I love tachyon physics as a sci-fi concept but I think there's a thing called &quot;tachyon condensation&quot; which happens to the mathematics of a tachyon field that in a universe with a light-speed-limit which causes the hypothetical tachyon-like particle to instead be experienced as an all-pervasive always-on field.  If I am remembering this stuff right, there's a field theory hypothesis about the first moments of the universe having multiple tachyonic Higgs particle types which immediately encounter tachyon condensation which forces them to combine into a single Higgs effect, which in turn underlies regular nuclear matter's experience of rest mass.   So the physics of relativity bars real FTL particles from existing but creates something amazing instead: infinite fields of non-zero energy.</p></div>		</li>
