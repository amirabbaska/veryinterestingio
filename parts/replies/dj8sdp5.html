			<div class="markdown"><p>Few holes in your logic, though. <strong>First</strong> of all why did you take the population of USA? I'd argue that there is a relatively big chance that siblings live in the same city or area - at least big enough to not just assume it could be one in 300 million. Also, 300 million is roughly the whole population. There are a lot of requirements to become a sperm donator. Often a sperm bank got things like a certain height, age 19-39, certain educations, good health and more. If you take all this into account, there are A LOT less people who can actually donate.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, why do you say sperm donation isn't going to result in full siblings incest but half siblings incest? Half siblings means that you only share one parent, that has nothing to do with it as I see it. If a woman gets donated sperm and the donator is her brother, then it's full incest.</p>
<p>And as a <strong>third</strong>, you take 300 million people down to 3 million with 100 half siblings. Who has 100 half siblings? That would mean one of your parents have a child with 100 different persons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea over all people assume risk of defects is a lot higher the. It is reality is different a one off child as you say is a small increase it's only a real issue either if there's already a family history of incest generational or a genetic trait that being family members both having would cause to show up in the kind. Again not that incest is ok but the risk of defects is way over blown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct. Historically cousin marriages were common, and communities were also small with little communication. So the risk of inbreeding was much higher, and the risk was everywhere. Today, people move a lot and marry to strangers. So today the risk is so low as to be meaningless. </p></div>		</li>
