<p>To back this guy up, anyone can try shining a red light through your finger. Your finger will not block all the light, but will glow red. IR absorbs even less in the skin.</p></div>		</li>

The clinical context was treating high-attenuation structures like melanoma, but doing minimal thermal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.</p>
<p>Light is a fascinating thing when you really get into it.  I always like to demonstrate Young's double slit to my first year undergrad students, and see if those who don't know about wave-particle duality can reach the correct conclusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like your students shouldn't be able to get to undergrad level physics without knowing about wave-particle duality. It's a pretty core concept and taught, at least in the UK, at A level so 16-17. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are exactly right. Typical wavelengths used for cleaning rust off metallic pieces are in the IR region (typically 1 um YAG type or 10.6 um CO2), where skin has a very weak absorption.  </p></div>		</li>
