			<div class="markdown"><p>It did for me when I was in a band.  The  lead up to the show was always intense and felt like it dragged on, then you hit the stage and it's over in 5 minutes.  Except you've been playing for 40.  It just felt like 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Also happened with marching band in highschool and college.  The halftime shows take like no time to finish even though they might be 15 minutes of continuous movement.  Feels more like 3 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I thought I felt this, I’ve performed with my friend a few times with him on violin. We played difficult songs but after a while of practising I just kind of didn’t even try, my hands kind of just moved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about this comment led me to an interesting personal observation.  I tend to enter flow state while speaking for some reason, and actually find this to be disorienting, because I then have to try and recall what I said or exit flow state to listen to a response.  I think this is part of the reason I tend to avoid speaking too much, even though flow state is supposedly &quot;good&quot; in many ways, it disrupts my conscious control and awareness of the overall conversation.  </p>
<p>It's weird but being &quot;good&quot; at talking comfortably makes me more of an introvert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can relate to this! I was a tour guide a few years back and once I got really comfortable speaking to large groups I would just sort of zone out during the tours. Sometimes I’d ‘wake up’ mid sentence and completely forget what I was saying or what I had already said. Part of it was due to the repetition but definitely disorienting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean speaking as in conversation or as in public speaking? I did a lot of public speaking back in the day, usually the same content (more or less) and found that I could almost separate myself from the person talking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both, but moreso in situations where I feel anxious, such as with large groups or people I'm nervous around.   It may just be babbling, but it feels very similar to flow state.</p></div>		</li>
