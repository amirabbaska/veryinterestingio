			<div class="markdown"><p>It is interesting, because on the one hand, this is the first ever autonomous diagnostic AI to be cleared by FDA. On the other hand, there is a ton of regulation and guidance on safety for such systems. Here is a partial list we comply with:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>US 21 CFR 820 - FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practice</p>
<p>ISO 13485: 2016 – Medical Device Quality Management Systems</p>
<p>IEC 14971 – Applications of Risk Management to Medical Devices</p>
<p>IEC 62366 - Application of Usability Engineering to Medical Devices</p>
<p>IEC 62304 – Medical Device Software Life Cycle Process</p>
<p>HIPAA</p>
<p>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p>
<p>SOC 2 Auditing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the above pre-existing safety criteria I listed, the entire trial design and analysis approach now forms part of the safety criteria for autonomous diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The design and analysis were peregistered and are available online as supplemental information.</p></div>		</li>
