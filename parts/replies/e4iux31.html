			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem like there is any difference in doubling pressure vs adding 1 bar/atm for a depth of 10m in this case. Doubling 1 bar is the same as adding 1 bar.</p>
<p>Do you mean that in an environment where atmospheric pressure was 2 bar, the pressure at 10m depth would be 4 bar?</p>
<p>I guess I'm just not sure the point of this &quot;doubling&quot; language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, Precisely because they are expanding and travelling faster. The water they hit breaks the bubbles surface tension and splits it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a stupid question at all! A trivial use of the ideal gas law would suggest that this would happen below 8200m - considering that the deepest point in the ocean is the Marianas trench at 11000m, this isn't unreasonable. In reality, however, gases tend to condense into liquids at extremely high pressure, so you'd be very unlikely to see a sinking bubble.

			<div class="markdown"><p>If air always behaved like an ideal gas (PV=mRT) and water density doesn't vary much with pressure, then there would exist a theoretical depth where air will become more dense than water and wouldn't rise. However, this depth would be much deeper than anything you can find on this planet, and honestly I'm not sure how air would behave at such depths. Intuition would tell me that by the time air stopped behaving as an ideal gas it would still have less density than water and the two would vary linearly together such that air never becomes more dense than water. </p>
<p>In other words, there probably doesn't exist a practical depth where air bubbles wouldn't rise. </p>
<p>edit: The other guy did a better job than I did. </p>
