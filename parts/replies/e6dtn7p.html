			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on that: orbitals tend to try to minimize energy. In the case of two H atoms, a single MO that is filled (1s, with 1e- from each atom) is at lower energy than a single AO that is partially full in each H atom separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a good response, I would suggest to edit it a bit. What you refer to as highest occupied and lowest unoccupied is in fact just the binding and anti-binding molecule orbital. You can't really tell if they are occupied or not. In fact most Anti-binding orbitals are occupied.</p>
<p>It is completely true for some easy molecules though.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong</p></div>		</li>
