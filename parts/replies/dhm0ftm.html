			<div class="markdown"><p>In any discussion of Frequentists vs Bayesian the Bayseian view ALWAYS comes across as the more correct and reasonable position, while the Frequentist is portrayed as wrong. It feels like Frequentism is the 'flat earther' equivalent in statistics, eg in the xkcd comic and Douglas Hubbard books.</p>
<p>Is Frequentism an actual school of thought with followers, or is it more of a straw man thought experiment? </p>
<p>If the former, can a frequentist please ELI5 why their position is better, and why it is often so poorly portrayed.</p>
<p>Serious question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequentist statistics are entirely valuable. As I said in my earlier reply, your choice between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches depends on the question you are asking and the types of uncertainties and biases you're willing to accept in your inferences.</p>
<p>The &quot;more correct&quot; appearance of Bayesian statistics comes from the application of prior knowledge as a distribution of probabilities, thereby going ostensibly &quot;beyond&quot; the inferences frequentist statistics can make. However, a LOT of bias can be introduced into the priors and thus skew the results of the analysis and the conclusions drawn. Depending on prior beliefs, a researcher could willingly or unwittingly set up a result to fail or succeed. Bayesian statistics need to be used with honesty and appropriately conservative priors in order to be useful.</p>
<p>If you're trying to answer only the question of &quot;could data as or more extreme as the data I've observed have occurred, given the null hypothesis is true?&quot;, then frequentist statistics are a relatively unbiased means of getting your answer. There are problems there as well, namely issues of sample sizes and what we call p-hacking: as you increase the size of your sample, variance shrinks relative to the size of the effect you're looking for and you can  &quot;hack&quot; a significant result (p less than .05). Frequentist statistics, like Bayesian ststistics, need to be used with honesty and appropriately conservative sample sizes (and other decisions) in order to be useful.</p>
<p>Both have flaws. There is no magic bullet in inferential statistics, because you are necessarily dealing with uncertainties and biased humans doing the analyses.</p>
<p>As for why the frequentist view is often so poorly portrayed, it's because it has legitimate problems and has been around long enough for everyone to be aware of all of them. While Bayes' theorem has been around a long time, it's relatively new to statistics. Given enough time and enough good instruction in the topic (it's not taught nearly as often as frequentist statistics in universities because it is new and more complicated),  the flaws in Bayesian statistics will be as well-known and something else new and promising will come forward as the hero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem mostly is that frequentist statistics is frequently misunderstood (also by people who use it). There is nothing wrong with frequentist methods as long as you correctly interpret the results. The p-value in hypothesis testing is one often misunderstood concept (and i have noticed it is actually hard to explain to students). A frequentist p-value cannot be a probability value of any hypothesis since it is a function of a random value (the data) and thus a random value itself. Instead it is the likelihood of the data given the null hypothesis. </p>
<p>On the other hand in bayes it is very possible to mess up by using bad priors or choosing unsuitable likelihood model. Unlike some say, prior should not be &quot;prior belief&quot; but rather prior information. With no information one has to use uninformative priors. Also bayes can be stupidly difficult to actually do unless you are lucky enough to get a nice model and a prior that fits it nicely.</p>
<p>I can whole heartedly recommend andrew gelmans blog <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/" target="_blank">http://andrewgelman.com/</a> if you are at all interested in statistics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bayesian inference is a very sensible form of reasoning. In fact, it's the way we actually think in our daily and professional lives. A strict frequentist (if such a thing exists) is actually a Bayesian in their heads even if the statistical methods they follow are frequentist.</p>
<p>However, comparing this general formulation of Bayesian inference to frequentist methods is not fair. If you want to compare methods to methods, modern Bayesian statistics operate in a pretty unique form based only in spirit on the general principle. The use of uninformative flatly distributed priors and millions of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to optimize the parameters based not on any prior information, but on the data itself sort tosses all the nice common sense wholesomeness of the Bayesian method by the wayside. It's just as nuts as frequentist methods.</p>
<p>The fact is statistics are nuts, it doesn't matter whether you're a frequentist or a Bayesian or you use Linux.</p></div>		</li>
