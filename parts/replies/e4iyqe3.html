<p>So then why can't we achieve the same effect by holding our breath?  Is it just that it's psychologically hard to do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but if someone is having a panic attack, and they realize it enough to breath into a paper bag, couldn't they also force themself to hold their breath?  I can see why that would be harder, but it doesn't seem like it would be impossible.</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever had a proper panic attack, though, so someone please let me know if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially for a person hyperventilating. You know - CO2 needed in the lung.and if the person can't keep it there for a necessarily long time, let's make it more concentrated (by trapping it in a bag) instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s physically that hard to do. Your central ventilators drive won’t allow you to hold your breath indefinitely.
In addition, you exhale a lesser amount of oxygen with every breath, so the air you rebreathe into the bag has O2 that would would miss out on by holding your breath.
Further, a paper bag on the face is not a closed circuit, so air (including oxygen) is entrained into the bag every time the pressure in the bag decreases with your inhalation.</p></div>		</li>
