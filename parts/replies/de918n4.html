			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not about keeping employees trapped. If employers had it their way, they wouldn't offer healthcare at all. But they know skilled workers expect it, and if you don't offer it, they'll take a job elsewhere that will.</p>
<p>Here's the ugly truth: Corporations don't want it BECAUSE they KNOW they'd be taxed so much they'd be paying the same, if not more, for every employee so that the costs would be covered for all people in the country. So let's say a company right now has 1,500 employees and 1,000 have health insurance, and 500 don't. Let's say the average cost for health insurance paid by employer is $7k annually. The company would have to pay $7 million per year.</p>
<p>But if the govt. said, &quot;Hey, employers no longer have to pay health insurance, but companies will get a tax increase that equals to [just] $6k per employee!&quot; suddenly the company is paying $9 million annually because it now has to cover the cost of all 1,500 employees!</p>
<p>It's all about the money. And taxes will skyrocket for individuals and companies if this ever changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not how any developed nations does healthcare. The individual pays taxes to support healthcare and in nations like Japan the companies pay a fraction of what they'd pay for private insurance to cover the tax for employees. So it would be more like the government comes in and says its only $3 per employee not $7 cause our healthcare is extraordinary overpriced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure some of your logic holds up.  You're also taking some liberties with your assumptions.  What sources do you have showing that we have have to tax more than the current cost of health insurance under a single payer system?  </p>
<p>The whole idea of single payer is to reduce costs.  This is why the employer insurance system costs far less than buying insurance in the individual market.  As you scale the size of the coverage pool, you gain better leverage when negotiating costs.  If you have a pool with 300 million people in it, you have some serious leverage to cut out waste in the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That logic doesn't hold.</p>
<p>Your argument would only make sense if companies were concerned with retaining otherwise unemployable persons.  Persons who can find employment elsewhere will get healthcare at their new job. </p>
<hr />
<p>Actual reason: tax cost, and legitimate concerns about <strong>monopsonistic</strong> systems.  &quot;Monopsonies&quot; are <strong>reverse monopolies</strong> (one buyer, who can dictate all pricing) -- and they can create huge problems via a number of means: lack of diversity in care and focus means that expensive experiments equipment, etc are less likely to be funded impacting medical research and buyer-seller relationships with one buyer can also hurt competition and thus innovation and quality.</p>
<p>There are definitely <strong>legitimate issues</strong> on both sides and trying to reduce either view point to malicious/selfish intent is beneath us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your logic has flaws as well such as just cause you can find another job with healthcare doesn't mean you won't be unemployed for t a time where you can't afford to purchase medicine for yourself. You are assuming good employees hust walk on out and instantly get a new job with care that is in effect that day</p></div>		</li>
