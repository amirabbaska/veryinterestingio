			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a benefit to crossing eyes? Not really. However, people with binocular vision issues (as in seeing the same object twice instead of one image with depth) can benefit by strengthening the muscles through visual training</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eye strength isn't nearly as important as eye stamina.  Eye muscles never need to carry increased weight (like straining crossed eyes).  Eye stamina can be increased through speed reading training.  Speed reading is limited by the stamina of eye muscles in addition to the brains ability to process the information.  That's the closest thing I can think of to eye exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Affix your focus onto an object in the distance.  Rotate your head in a circle, while maintaining focus on said object.  Congratulations, you are exercising all six of the muscles affixed to each eye that regulate the movement of your eyeball.</p>
<p>Isn't that amazing?!</p></div>		</li>
