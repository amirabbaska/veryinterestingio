			<div class="markdown"><p>Find a store that sells detergents to professionals (hotel / restaurant owners). P&amp;G has a dedicated &quot;pro&quot; business line for those. They would typically sale +10 kg bags or +5l bottles of detergent. When buying those you will save on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Packaging. Less visually appealing (cheaper) less packaging per kg of product sold. </p>
</li>
<li>Perfume. Professionals don't like it and it's a pretty expensive ingredient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whitening variants have more whitener (e.g. for bedsheets to look like new).  Stain removal components are pretty strong as well though more targeted. When using those you need to stick to the recommended dosage. Going above may destroy the fabric. </p>
<p>Alternatively, go for the cheapest laundry powder you can find. If you notice that it cannot handle certain stains, make a one-off purchase of stain remover (Vanish or Ariel Professional / Stainbuster) to deal with those stains. Than proceed back to the cheap stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a small time detergent manufacturer.  We don't have much in the way of marketing, but I know for a fact that our &quot;free and gentle&quot; formulation is as strong as our other products, just without the fragrances and dyes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a great reply. I found the bit about regional variation to be fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually according to consumer tests, most germans do overdose. Plus we also have a lot of laundry detergents filled with microplastics or something to make it look like more in comparison to the compact products on the market. But you might be right that we overdose less than in other countries and have stronger formulas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I admit I generalized a lot. Your clarification is spot on. Also, certain packaging is specifically designed to encourage consumers to overdose, for example fabric enhancers dosing cups. </p></div>		</li>
