			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the bigger problem will be exploiting these resources in a way that the environmental costs are minimal. As sources get less and less efficient there's likely to be more places that you need to exploit to maintain the supply, this is going to increase damage to the environment more than having one efficient source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is honestly why I hope moon mining becomes a bigger thing in the coming century. I’ve seen whole mountains taken out in some giant mines (Baghdad, Arizona is one that always comes to mind). If we mined on the moon we really wouldn’t need to worry about the environmental ramifications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a geologist -- this would only solve part of the problem. We wouldn't have to be so careful about extraction, but unless we're setting up smelting/beneficiation processing plants on the Moon (which will require ungodly amounts of the resources we'd theoretically already be running low on to start with), we will still have to deal with a lot of waste materials from the Moon materials once we process the ore on Earth, and disposing of them safely and effectively just like we are now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire Salt Lake valley is scarred by the active Copper mine on the west side, what used to be a nice mountain view has now been replaced by a disgusting pile of tailings as big as the mountain used to be.  They couldn't have at least started from the other side? The pollution has affected the neighborhoods at the base of the mine as well, ordinances that say you are not to grow fruit trees or vegetables in you yards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a science teacher explain methane capture from the ocean bottom could fuel the world indefinitely. </p>
<p>The big problem however is if methane is released and not captured, it could cause severe catastrophic greenhouse gas release into the atmosphere and thus why we don't mine the ocean floor for methane.</p>
<p>(The silt is a fragile membrane that keeps it from escaping currently)</p></div>		</li>
