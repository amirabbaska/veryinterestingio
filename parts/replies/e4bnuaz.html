<p>solar wind induced auroras were posed well before Parker's theory, by Christian Birkeland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They were suggested even before Birkeland was born, by Balfour Stewart; see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/97wd5p/how_where_auroras_explained_before_eugene_parkers/e4bn42m/" target="_blank">my comment</a> above. Birkeland certainly advanced the field a lot, but the first clue that aurorae were connected to solar magnetism came from the Carrington Event of 1859.</p></div>		</li>
