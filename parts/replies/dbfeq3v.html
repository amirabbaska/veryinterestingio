			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly there is very little about the Stanford prison experiment that was worthwhile.  The pool of subjects was tiny and racially/economically homogenous and yeah, Zimbardo was heavily biased and interfered. No one should take the findings seriously in the slightest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, that was kind of my point in a round-a-bout way. In order to get sensational results Zimbardo is celebrated for, one would have to not only ignore ethical concerns but scientific/experimental integrity as well. But then you'd be FAMOUS! Certainly one guy thought it was worth it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zimbardo. I met Phil Zimbardo at an APA conference when Abu Graib was a current event. The Stanford experiment was relevant to our understanding of what happened at Abu Graib and Zimbardo gave a talk on that. I was a teeny bit starstruck at meeting him. </p></div>		</li>
