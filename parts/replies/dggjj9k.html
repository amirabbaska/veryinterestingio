			<div class="markdown"><p>This analysis is <strong>horrible</strong> and shame on people for upvoting this.  If you think this is a great write up, you are ignorant of American economic history.  And after reading this, you are even more ignorant. </p>
<p>Blaming broad economic shifts on nefarious &quot;the racists&quot; is the most 'I'm 22 and really deep' thing I'm going to read this week.  The balance is the result of spending wayyy too much time on reddit and not having a well-founded understanding of American economic history. </p>
<p>Absolutely none of what this guy wrote 1) is accurate, or 2) actually addresses anything related to OP's question.  This is like a r/latestagecapitalism fever dream. </p>
<p>Some highlights (lowlights):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No mention of unions losing power/membership as the US lost its relative manufacturing advantage to (mainly) Asia starting in the mid-60s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of union entrenchment and corruption leading to <em>their own members</em> stripping them of power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of the global devaluation of labor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of the economic impact of women entering the workforce in masse increasing <em>household</em> income across the board</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of 'asset creep' - the idea that the average house in 2017 simply isn't comparable to a house from 1950</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of service specialization versus the commoditization of labor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of technological productivity enhancements becoming a substitute for human labor</p>
</li>
<li>No mention of the relative devaluation of college education as <em>everybody</em> has access to higher learning. </li>
<li>&quot;The Savings and Loan system collapses, and the barriers between the three types of banks (commercial, investment, and housing consumer) disappear.&quot; --&gt; no only do you not understand the S&amp;L crisis, your timing is off and you simply don't understand the link between S&amp;Ls and the broader banking system.  Jesus Christ....</li>
<li>&quot;The private institution of higher education has always been a thing, but with deregulation of student loans...&quot; This is just wrong.  Student loans were never deregulated.  The pool was expanded and tuition rates have increased in parallel with the 'value' our society places on higher education.  This is basic shit. </li>
</ul>
<p>I can keep going.</p>
<p><strong><em>TL;DR:</em></strong> <strong>we are all stupider and less informed for having read this.  And I'm certain its going to be on r/bestof later today.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention the fact that while yes, <em>some</em> people did have a two-car garage on one salary it was far from the norm. This perceived golden age is also the age of proper inner city slums with 7 sleeping in one bedroom. We tend to forget the bad and remember only the good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they're taking a segment of the population and making it seem like it was the norm. At best union membership was 25% of the workforce, the other 75% certainly didn't enjoy high wages and great benefits as a rule. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response --people are always referring to how much money autoworkers were making after WW2 as a benchmark for how everyone else is doing. Wages have actually remained largely the same over the last 100 years for schoolteachers for example. </p>
<p>People referring to a golden age, are referring to a temporary boost in manufacturing, which was unprecedented at the time. A comparable industry today is technology, app development and fields like UX. Many people with little experience but a high tolerance for risk-taking and the ability to learn new skills have jumped into these industries without formal training and make 6 figures after a couple of years. I have seen it many times over in my personal circle.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable; these high wages in these fields will eventually normalize and become the low wages of autoworkers today. It may take 30 years, but it will happen as a natural result of the economics playing out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for refuting.  I stopped reading at &quot;the racists switched.&quot;  Racism doesn't even fucking come into it.  The top answer right now (supply/demand of labor analysis from /u/SMURGwastaken) is probably the most correct one.  I think you mentioned a lot of <em>symptoms</em> of that underlying cause, but at the heart of the matter it's simple economics.  Automation and women in the work force drove up the supply of labor while demand has not caught up.  I would say that the only thing /u/SMURGwastaken missed is the global economy factor, where you now have factories in third-world countries producing goods at a fraction of the cost of other countries (see: any piece of clothing you're wearing) and supplying them to first-world countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol - I'm starting to see this confirmation bias in alot of my Millennial generation and under. Are they actually being taught this stuff in schools? Do they not go read literature or history that would lead them to a greater understanding of the circumstances of the past? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Racism does play in to it as it was purposefully stoked to turn workers on workers and get a switch from Democrat to Republican. This is pretty well understood and written about, and the strategy itself is found within Republican election plans. </p>
<p>However, there is a fuck of a lot more going on as well, and claiming it to be the most important factor is ridiculous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you say racism didn't come into it??? Have you heard of the Southern Strategy? Aka how Regan, and the Republican Party in general, openly exploited racial fear to get poor whites to act agains their own interests? If you think I'm being hyperbolic there are direct quotes that say as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy cow this thing lacks any historical perspective.</p>
<p>You don't think the US being a massive economy in the post world war 2 years has anything to do with the relative success? Every other major country in the world with cities bombed to shit, and a non trivial percentage of their workforce dead - and the US with tons of resources, tons of space, and also missing a lot of working men. I mean Great Britain was still rationing until the end of the 50s for context. It's not really surprising that for a generation, anyone who put a bit of effort in could easily buy achieve a relatively stable social status.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at now as some particularly shit time, let's look at the early decades of the 20th century.</p>
<p>1900s and earlier  - you couldn't buy a house. You were probably a farmer, in which point you grew up and stayed in the family house, or you may have been a maid/city worker, but unless you were extremely wealthy and part of the elite social class you weren't buying a house for yourself that wasn't a farm.</p>
<p>1910s - First World War. In Europe you're probably conscripted or a woman/child/too old. At home you're rationing like crazy. US enters the war in 1917.</p>
<p>1920s - social classes are starting to be eroded. Economies great (post war). Probably not so much that non wealthy families are buying homes yet.</p>
<p>1930s - depression. No ones buying a house, until Second World War starts, </p>
<p>1940s - US enters the Second World War, and it ends, everyone's recovering.</p>
<p>1950s - UK still rationing and recovering, baby boomers are replacing all the lost men.</p>
<p>So it's not that baby boomers ruined everything. No other generation really had the opportunities they did. That's the unusual time in history. We live in a much more normal time now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So with the individual rights people, the unions, and the businesses all in the same pile the Republicans started dismantling what they'd built for the individuals. Their social support agenda, their actual pro-worker mandate, and their successful Social Security and Welfare programs were not in the interests of their new business buddies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of this post is wrong, but this is straight /r/badhistory.</p>
<p>Democrats and Dixiecrats experienced a divide before the Dixiecrats switch to the Republican party.</p>
<p>Social Security, Medicaid, huge swaths of workers rights legislation had all come from the Democrats during the New Deal, not the Republicans.</p>
<p>The fact is that the exceedingly pro-business Republican party of the 1920s effectively died during the 30s and 40s, because of FDR's success. The next Republican Presidents were all far left of Hoover and Reagan (Eisenhower, Nixon).</p>
<p>In fact both parties had both conservatives and liberals during this era. Truman was a conservative Democrat, JFK was not, etc.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation to the question is that Americans were unprecedentedly rich for years after WW2 because of a lack of industrial competition, and that those benefits were passed down to the workers because of the strong social programs built during the 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>Once Europe reindustrialized American wages declined (this was early 70s).  <em>Then</em> the Ronald Reagan years accelerated the income gap by dismantling or impeding social programs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He (/u/BitOBear) also said Ayn Rand died on welfare. I'm not even a fan but that is a straight out lie. Totally false. </p>
<ol>
<li>She was effectively a millionaire on paper which would make being on welfare illegal.</li>
<li>She died on Medicare and Social Security, both of which she paid into. Government took money from her in exchange for a promise. She claimed on that promise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Something that seems to be overlooked here is when Republicans rant against Welfare, they're not talking about Social Security and Medicare. If they were, they'd never win an election because both are extremely popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And yet they attempt to &quot;privatize&quot; and otherwise limit, raid, and dismantle Social Security and Medicare all the time.</p>
<p>So it's a matter of what they don't say while they rant against &quot;welfare&quot; compared to the programs they damage.</p>
<p>The main reason to dismantle Social Security is to avoid having to pay it back the money that's been borrowed from it during the Borrow and Spend raids.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unlike al those moochers who also paid into those programs, because that's a requirement for getting the benefits.... </p></div>		</li>
