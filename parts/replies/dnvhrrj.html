			<div class="markdown"><p>Great job in your weight loss, it sounds like you've worked so hard. Have you done any work with a therapist? Usually depression and weight issues need to be a two-pronged approach: one side behavioral (what you are doing with weight loss and mindful eating) and one side is emotional (underlying causes in addition to genetics which usually play a role). Working with a psychodynamic or cognitive behavioral therapist can help target some automatic thoughts and feelings you may be having but are not aware of. Almost 90% of our thoughts are unconscious and therapy helps bring them out so that you can slowly retrain your brain while receiving support and positive feedback. The voice of depression is loud and helping to hear it as depression and not you can be life changing.</p>
<p>Your coping skills may not change, but you don't really want them to because the root will be the same. It's called symptom substitution and it may sound appealing but is just as harmful in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My approach to therapy is more related to talk therapy than biological roots, so I would let a psychiatrist field serotonin questions. I would try some psychotherapy to have someone to bounce ideas off and help retrain your brain to healthier thinking patterns.</p></div>		</li>
