			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, Ben had no way of knowing for sure which way the current was actually flowing; it came to a 50/50 guess.  He arbitrarily chose one and happened to guess wrong, and that's what we've been stuck with.  But you're right, fortunately it doesn't matter much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's arbitrary. They could be called A and B for all it matters, it just conveniently denotes them as opposites. As for which one is which, 50/50 guess again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could make an argument that Ben had precedence because he he put a sign on electrical current before the electron was discovered.  If we had assigned a positive charge to electrons and a negative charge to protons, then Ben's current would be more intuitive and 'correct'.</p>
<p>As it is, the sign of the electron's charge is arbitrary and the sign of current is arbitrary, and it's unfortunate that we developed conventions for both before we realized how they interacted.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. The electron wasn't discovered yet, so he had no way of knowing but to guess. His guess was the wrong one, and we proved that once the electron was discovered.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That is entirely the point the two people above you are discussing. It was arbitrary. It makes more sense to call them positive, but Ben guessed incorrectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very designations negative and positive are also entirely arbitrary.  We could fix things by calling electrons positive and protons negative too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems plausible, as Ben is credited with realizing that there was only one type of electricity, and that what looked like two forces was actually a surplus or deficiency of a charge.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-1/static-electricity/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/chpt-1/static-electricity/</a> on the topic of generating static electricity by rubbing things (glass and silk, say) together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some experimenters speculated that invisible “fluids” were being transferred from one object to another during the process of rubbing, and that these “fluids” were able to effect a physical force over a distance. Charles Dufay was one of the early experimenters who demonstrated that there were definitely two different types of changes wrought by rubbing certain pairs of objects together. The fact that there was more than one type of change manifested in these materials was evident by the fact that there were two types of forces produced: attraction and repulsion. The hypothetical fluid transfer became known as a charge.</p>
<p>One pioneering researcher, Benjamin Franklin, came to the conclusion that there was only one fluid exchanged between rubbed objects, and that the two different “charges” were nothing more than either an excess or a deficiency of that one fluid. After experimenting with wax and wool, Franklin suggested that the coarse wool removed some of this invisible fluid from the smooth wax, causing an excess of fluid on the wool and a deficiency of fluid on the wax. The resulting disparity in fluid content between the wool and wax would then cause an attractive force, as the fluid tried to regain its former balance between the two materials.</p>
