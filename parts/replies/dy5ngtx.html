			<div class="markdown"><p>So you’re saying there’s a chance....</p>
<p>J/k...in all seriousness, thank you for your explanation. What my 5 year old brain got out of your answer is while there may possibly be a rogue photon and primordial black hole which fits my scenario, it is more likely to take place after about 377k years when the universe is no longer opaque and light starts to exist?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there are loads of photons from 377k years after the big bang and time doesn't pass for them. They aren't that hard to detect - apparently, if you can dig out a really old analogue TV, the black and white static on an untuned channel is about 1% made up of Cosmic Microwave Background photons!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Man that made me feel old. I still have a drawer full of coax cables... even a few 10BASE2 NICs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I am just learning  this at a 5 year old level, maybe I can explain it as such. I’m sure I’ll get crushed with inaccuracies but it’s a start.</p>
<p>There are two different types of time dilations that occur, both dealing with the only constant in the world, which is the speed of light. One has to do with an object’s speed, and the other has to do with gravity.</p>
<p>The first situation I am still trying to comprehend and I’m not completely there yet.  Everything boils down to Einstein's theory of relativity, which basically is everything to do with speed and time is relative to the beholder. So if we are on an airplane going 400mph and you throw a baseball to me at 10mph, it is 10 mph to us on the airplane; however if a guy was watching us with an X-ray telescope on the ground, the baseball looks like it's traveling 410mph. This is where my understanding starts to break up (someone please fill in), but basically something traveling at an extreme speed, time is slower, while whatever it is relation to (a person standing on earth for instance), time is “normal.”</p>
<p>The other event is due to extreme gravitational situations. I.e. close to a black hole, where space-time literally bends due to the effect. Imagine 2 trampolines and we each are going to walk across at the speed of light, except mine has a 500lb weight in the middle bending it down. We each travel the same distance at the same speed, but it takes me longer to get there because of the bend, thus slowing down time relative to the beholder of a person in a less extreme gravitational situation. This is why in Intersteller when Cooper goes down to that planet near the black hole, he only spends a few hours but the guy let in his ship outside of the gravitational force, it was 20 something years.</p>
<p>Thus my original question: to us the Universe is 14 billion years old, but that is OUR time. Is there somewhere out there, where time is so slow it just happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, physicist checking in here.</p>
<p>The hadron epoch occurred at the end of the first second; that means that quarks formed protons and neutrons (and presumably more exotic species) and protons will have had a process similar to to electron capture occur, giving off an electron neutrino; being so light and unreactive, the idea of one of those neutrinos being fired through space forever is not an impossible one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is some talk that someday we will be able to detect the cosmic neutrino background from this first second. It probably won’t happen for many decades though because neutrinos are really hard to detect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe photons can orbit a black hole long term due to frame dragging as all black holes must have at least some angular momentum. Ergo they will either lose or gain orbital height. Even if this process takes millions or billions of years there is no stable orbit around a black hole due to frame dragging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kerr black holes aren't escapable from within the event horizon but there is a region called the ergosphere where time is all kinds of messed up around the equator, you can escape from here and in fact you are likely to, it's the entire reason you can theoretically make black hole bombs (reflect light through the ergosphere repeatedly and it will gain KE until it has more energy than a typical supernova).</p>
<p>Schwarzschild black holes don't exist to our knowledge because even background radiation would immediately give them some angular momentum, this also means that singularities other than the one that caused the big bang also probably don't exist (although there are solutions to GR that occlude a singularity from being the cause of the big bang as well).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frame dragging doesn't change their height, it just changes the radius of the photon sphere. But the orbit is unstable independent of the rotation - photons can't orbit there long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frame dragging transfers momentum to the photons, either decreasing or increasing their orbit height, think of it like swimming in a pool aboard a ship, you get extra momentum from the boat even though in your frame of reference you're only swimming in the pool, but the frame itself is being dragged forward.</p></div>		</li>
