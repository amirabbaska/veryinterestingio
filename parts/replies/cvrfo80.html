			<div class="markdown"><p>I once fostered a dog, a boxer/lab mix and he was he most jacked dog I'd ever been around. Other than walks and the occasional running around at the dog park he just laid around all day. His diet consisted of dog food/treats and he was still crazy muscular. Genetics are powerful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And then runs 0-45 mph in about 3 seconds if there's something to chase, including other greyhounds. Holy shit. Genetics. </p></div>		</li>
