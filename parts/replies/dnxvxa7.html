<p>Trace is just what is referred to as the visible trail left by the round as it distorts the air.   It's only really visible from the perspective of the shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respectfully, I disagree. I am not a sniper, but I am a shooter and hunter. My favorite big game rifle is a Remington 800 chambered in 7mm Remington Magnum. Perhaps professional snipers can maintain eye contact with the target, but I can't, and I think most people can't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it off 300wm under good environmental conditions on a number of occasions at the range.  This is like 20% of the time under ideal conditions at the range. </p>
<p>Also, probably need to be shooting at a decent range, like 400+</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, ideally you would not want to be so out of focus that you can witness your own bullet's vapour trail.</p>
<p>Plus a spotting scope has much higher magnifications, so shots out past 600 yards are much easier to see.</p>
<p>For really long range shots, it would be difficult to watch your hits with most any long gun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point, you want a first focal plane optic that you can zoom out a bit.  If your field of view is small due to being super magnified you can't really see trace.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The spotter never loses sight of the target, and can tell the sniper what corrections he needs to make. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would the spotter know that?  He can't see the path of the bullet either.  </p></div>		</li>
