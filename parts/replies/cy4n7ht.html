			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, in norway we drink alot of this energy drink called &quot;burn&quot; from coca cola company, is it not so used in other countries?</p>
<p>Edit: burn is by far and beyond my favorite energy drink, we have red bull, monster and all the big names here so i heavily advice you to try it out given the opportunity.</p>
<p>Edit2: It also have a neat open and close mechanism (<a href="http://imgur.com/2MKlr3u" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/2MKlr3u</a>) which clearly makes it the best energy drink if i haven't already convinced you :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've drank all of them. Burn has its unique taste indeed, when i was in hungary they had it in 3 different tastes: the regular, a blue variant and a pink one. In belgium i've only seen the regular one though. They all had a different taste but i'd say burn in general is more fruity. I think they stopped selling burn in belgium because i cant find it in any supermarket anymore :(</p>
<p>Monster is widely available in europe and is distributed by coca cola if i'm correct. All monsters have a different taste and there's no comparable drink in taste. Recently they took away the khaos version from the shelves, cant seem to find it anymore. We have the regular, zero, assault, doctor, ripper and rehab if i didnt forget any.</p>
<p>Pricewise, burn and nalu (both cocacola owned) cost about 1.15€ for 25cl in belgium. Monster costs about 1.25€ but comes in 0.5l instead of 0.25liters so its cheaper. They all have the same amout of caffeine which is the maximum allowed 32mg/100ml in europe. And ofcourse there's the expensive redbull with its unique taste :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regulations on that changed a few years ago. They didn't used to be allowed to add caffeine to soft drinks other than cola (&quot;Energy Drinks&quot; are regulated as natural health products not food so the rules are different). Since 2010 it's been legal and since 2012 it seems that regular Mountain Dew in Canada has caffeine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heh, my first Dew when I moved to the US, I didn't sleep for a week.  (I don't drink caffeine)  At first I thought I wasn't sleeping because of the move!  It wasn't until I complained about not being able to sleep to a friend... </p></div>		</li>
