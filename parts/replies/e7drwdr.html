			<div class="markdown"><p>OP mentioned that 'the satellite orbits at the same speed as the planets rotation' which I took to mean they were both tidally locked to one another.   That would mean that the only way the satellite could stay at the planet-star L1 would be if the planet was tidally locked to the star as well?  Is this a more likely scenario than a natural satellite hanging out at L1?  </p>
<p>It doesn't seem to me like that scenario would even count as perpetual eclipse if the planet was not tidally locked to the star, being something more akin to a daily eclipse at whatever latitude the shadow happens to hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't conceive of a scenario where two tidally locked bodies could rotate and have the line connecting their centers never be perpendicular to the incoming solar rays.  So that sounds to me like there is some amount of non-eclipse time for the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd go with a lot of smaller satellites. Sure the big one is impressive on an engineering scale, but the small ones are cheaper to get into orbit, and more fault tolerant.</p>
<p>I'd probably program them to adjust position like a flock of starlings. With a manual reset option in case they get stuck in a feedback loop due to a weird corner case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible but difficult. Once you add in the radiation pressure from the sun on that shade the Lagrange point becomes unstable. You would constantly need to send extra fuel to the shade so it can do course corrections</p></div>		</li>
