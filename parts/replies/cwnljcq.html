			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, I have the best effect with the opposite behavior and I believe my explanation makes sense.</p>
<p>If I look at the cup while I'm walking I'm likely to spill it. If I don't look at the coffee I'll get to where ever I'm going with every last drop.</p>
<p>I believe that watching the cup, being active in trying not to spill it, causes you to use more muscle and movement than is actually needed. However, if you just rely upon your innate ability to walk and not spill your body will take care of it for you. You get feedback from the weight of the cup in your hand, you know where you've been moving, where you are going, how quickly; all of the knowledge you need is already there, without adding in your eyes and conscious attention. It's the same way you toss something to someone or catch something tossed to you. You don't need calculus to throw your socks at the hamper, you just do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. When I would train new waitstaff, I would tell them never to look at a cocktail that is filled to the brim. Stare straight ahead at the table and you be fine. </p></div>		</li>
