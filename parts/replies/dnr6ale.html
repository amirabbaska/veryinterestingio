<p>To some degree, being scared about it led people to deal with it, which can look like The Boy Who Cried Wolf.  It is kind of the definition of a thankless job.</p>

<p>Exactly this. Had people not worked hard to fix the systems, then the dire &quot;cry wolf&quot; warnings would have come true. However, by fixing everything they did, Y2K seemed like much ado about nothing to everyone who didn't work on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit nvm at that point, but 2038 could cause a lot of problems for unix-style systems that use 32-bit integers for time and date epochs. Similar problem to Y2K and the potential for 2025 you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our company created some software, which is still widely used by the older sites, on a certain date and all current more dates are worked out from the date. I'm not exactly a programming whizz (I'm the guy installing the server and entering IP's) my knowledge of how it works involves fairy dust, hope and dreams but the intelligent folk assure me that this more or less legacy software will fall on its arse in 2025. I assume (dangerous I know) that programs work upto a strict set limit and are unable to count past that figure so say you set the start date that all future dates are worked out from (1/1/00 + 123 days for example) the program can only count + so many days ours being in 2025? I would also assume (dangling your boys/mammeries in front of an open fire dangerous now) to change this date would be alot of work as thefe are many many entries throughout the code of date = 1/1/00 + 123 days? If anyone could explain it to me I'd be grateful for you saving me the embarrassment at work as I simply replied with, &quot;oh, like the millennium bug&quot; and got knowing nods!</p></div>		</li>
