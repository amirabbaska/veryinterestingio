			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that... &quot;good&quot; weather is usually warm, not sweltering hot.  It's the weather that you can go outside in shorts, visit the beach, have a BBQ, <em>not</em> get rained on, etc.  Colder weather may be nicer day-to-day, but true cold weather is miserable, and something that you have to wear special clothes in, lest you freeze.  That hasn't changed.  Where most people on Earth live, the worst of the summer isn't as bad as the worst of the winter.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but cold weather is when I can go outside in layers and wear interesting outfits, carry more on my person thus be more comfortable, walk as far as I like without sweating, explore locations with fewer people and crowds around and so on. From my experience, there are just as many people who prefer these things as the things you've mentioned.</p>

<p>I don't know, I live in the UK and for me summer has a few really crappy months, winter is never that bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what OP pointed out, though, is that yours is just one perspective. Many people do not like shorts, the beach, BBQ, and do not mind some rain. Many people prefer snow activities. Many people prefer having to put on a coat to stop the cold than having to rush inside to air conditioning to stop the heat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or, rather, where most people on Earth live, the worst of the summer is <em>far</em> worse than the worst of the winter. . . because there <em>is</em> nothing that can be fairly described as &quot;winter&quot; there. It never freezes. Ever. Or basically never. Maybe once or twice a year, if that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also honestly still holds up today depending on your life style.  I work in IT and spend the majority of day to day inside.  My brother works for my town's Public Works Department, and is outside 40+ hours a week, regardless of the weather.  The weather doesn't affect my life that much, but he hates the winter with a passion. </p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that you have to spend 40+ hours a week outside, every week as part of your livelihood.  Yes, the summer brings a lot of sweat, bugs, and sun burns.  It's still a lot easier to deal with than standing in knee deep snow in 10 degree temperatures for 8 long hours each day.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it could just be the wrong part of the world. Where I live it regularly gets to 115° F in the summer. Those are not good days. People say it's hot and they won't come out until the sun goes down, those that do work out in the heat are miserable all day. Hot does not equal good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, OP worded the original question poorly, but I think it's understood that no one thinks the ideal temp is in excess of 100 degrees F.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure where to put this but whenever it's a bit lower than 30°C (say 25°C) the news presenter here freaks the fuck out, calling it &quot;cold&quot;. </p>
<p>I know not all people feel the same about this but come on, stop being biased. Some of us love cold weather.</p></div>		</li>
