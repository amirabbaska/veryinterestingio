			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely true for power utilization, at least for lithium ion cells; as soon as you switch over to CV charging (somewhere above 70%), the waste fraction will start going up and the efficiency of what's &quot;going into the battery&quot; will start going down. You can probably even notice that a phone charging at 90% gets warmer than one charging at 40%.</p>
<p>It's also worth keeping in mind that deep discharge is <em>really</em> hard on contemporary LiIon tech, though. You can literally trade half of your overall battery life (on a milliamp-hour basis) if you're regularly sucking the thing dry.</p>
<p>Even when inefficient, the actual power used in recharging most portable electronics is very small and cheap, so optimizing for that is rarely the most prudent focus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's &quot;sucking the thing dry&quot;? On a daily basis my phone battery gets used until 12%-15% while I'm at work. I then swap it out for my spare battery, recharge both overnight and repeat the next day. Am I going to be looking at buying new batteries sooner than normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earlier, maybe, but if it doesn't intersect where you'd replace the batteries before you just have a different device entirely, it's not a huge deal.</p>
<p>Depth of Discharge has a curve associated with cycle life that normalizes to a fairly linear decline in overall life. &quot;Optimal&quot; behavior to get every amp-hour possible out of a battery is likely to keep it topped off (or at least in the upper range; things get screwy at the very edge of capacity), but batteries aren't terribly useful to anyone if we only use a few percent of them!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually makes sense because my iphones car charger will flash a light when it is done charging, and I've noticed it flashing around 85% and not 100% lately. The light must be activated once the current drops.</p></div>		</li>
