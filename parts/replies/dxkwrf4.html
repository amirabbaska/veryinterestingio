			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fully expecting to get downvoted for this, but this is one of the reasons that privatization can help improve educational outcomes. Private schools don't have these problems, because they run their school like a business; unlike taxpayer-funded schools, private schools <em>are</em> selling a product (that product being education).</p>
<p>Obviously it's a policy decision at the end of the day, but I would suggest that we don't necessarily <em>need</em> public schools to ensure access to education, for the same reason that access to food is effectively universal in America despite the fact that there are no &quot;public grocery stores.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the food example you gave is a good one, because it really highlights the problem with privatization.</p>
<p>Access to food may be effectively universal (though some may disagree) however the <em>quality</em> of food is no where near universal.  There are vast swaths of this country getting by on ramen noodles and the McDonalds dollar menu.  That might be okay for food (though not really) but it's definitely not OK for education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.norad.no/en/front/about-norad/news/role-of-education-in-ending-extreme-poverty--taking-a-global-lead/" target="_blank">Education is the best way for a person to escape from poverty</a>.  But privatizing education ensures that this will not happen.  Under a privatized system, if you can't afford a decent education, then you won't have the means to escape the poverty that put you into this situation... and it's a perpetual cycle. </p>
<p>This is already a problem we're facing.  Privatizing schools will just exacerbate the issue.</p>
<p>And really, the solution is so much simpler.  Congress simply needs to see schools <a href="http://sites.utexas.edu/humanitiesinstitute/2017/02/24/why-public-investment-in-higher-education-is-good-for-the-economy/" target="_blank">as an investment for the public good</a>, and allocate them a bit more money.</p>
<p>I know it's borderline treasonous to even suggest a cut to military spending, but just look at <a href="https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/discretionary_spending_pie%2C_2015_enacted.png" target="_blank">this pie chart</a>.  Seriously.  Even shaving a few % off the military's discretionary budget could provide more than enough to schools and end this whole debate.</p>
<p>p.s. no downvotes here.  You're certainly allowed to have an opinion, or an idea.  Even if I disagree with it.</p></div>		</li>
