			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Anti-protons and anti-electrons (a.k.a. positrons) have a non-zero electric charge. Thus we can confine them using electric and magnetic fields. At the forefront of antimatter &quot;confinement&quot; is the creation and confinement of anti-hydrogen atoms. It turns out that neutral anti-hydrogen atoms have a non-zero magnetic moment, so we can still confine these atoms using electric and magnetic fields, it's just much less efficient to do so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two further questions: </p>
<p>1) When you say &quot;neutral anti-hydrogen&quot; do you mean a non-isotope atom, i.e. one with as many anti-protons as anti-electrons? </p>
<p>2) what is magnetic moment in terms a lay-person can understand?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They're called magnetic bottles.</p>
<p>Basically you're working with as pure a vacuum as you can create, with a twist of magnetic fields in the middle. You steer your antimatter (created in particle accelerators or via radioactive decay products) the same way you steer any charged particles (with strong magnetic fields) straight into that rats nest of magnetic fields, then change one field to block the point of entry.</p>
<p>You create a situation where going any direction is &quot;uphill&quot; in the field so you mostly consistently contain the AM in that region.</p>
<p>Obviously some will escape, and some other particles will be captured (a true 0 vacuum is essentially unachievable)</p>
<p>But if you're talking SciFi levels here, if you're containing 99.999% of your antimatter over the course of a day, 50g of antimatter would lose 1mg of &quot;fuel&quot; a day, destroying 1mg of your equipment, and releasing about as much energy as a 1kT bomb every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not Capture the energy and generate electrical power to run the linear accelarator to produce more antimatter to replace the amount that escaped? It could be self sustaining. Of course that assumes you can open the magnetic bottle and add to the contents without anything escaping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just theoretically possible, it's in practice now! :) It's just a regular magnetic field! I actually knew more about the storage/containment of antimatter than I did it's creation when I asked this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ALPHA collaboration recently performed spectroscopy (looking at colours) of antihydrogen they looked at one transition (colour) and it matched the transition you'd expect in hydrogen. So both theory (CPT symmetry) and experiment so far would say that antimatter would look the exact same as matter. </p></div>		</li>
