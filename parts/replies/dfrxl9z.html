			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, semantically it does reduce the size of data within the folder prior to being decompressed. As less overall bits are required to express the same information, then it will physically occupy less space than the uncompressed data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a zip file is not functional until it is unpacked.</p>
<p>Even so DNA is not like zip at all in that it requires three pairs for every single amino acid.</p>
<p>You're equating it closer to programming code than a zip file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really cool. </p>
<p>So, could DNA serve the same purpose that chromosomes are if it was extended? Or is the chromosome adding functionality? </p>
<p>I ask because in typical compression you are sacrificing processing speed for space. If the chromosomes can operate in ways DNA can't, it's more like a translation or additional function than a compression. </p>
<p>Is there a theoretical limit to how large DNA can be? Is it a constraint on organism complexity? I'm kind of curious if an algorithmic compression mechanism (rather than a physical one), where a sequences of DNA pairings is represented by a single pairing, could arise, or even need to arise, along with the structures required to 'interpret' it.</p>

<p>In some sense this is true for DNA as well--DNA that is compact and wound around histones can't be read and translated into RNA. It needs to be opened up first. This isn't really how digital compression works though (a better example is the example /u/pickled_dreams gave of alternative splicing).</p>

<p>It turns out &quot;complexity&quot; has little to do with the amount of material DNA in an organism. Human's have a funny definition of complex which usually can be summed up as &quot;human-like&quot;. The Paris japonica plant has 50 times the DNA as the human genome... and it's a flower...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the potential &quot;limits&quot; to DNA size is that everything has to be copied whenever a cell divides, which takes both time and energy to do, so there is selective pressure to keep it relatively efficient. A second limiting factor is that the DNA copying machinery isn't 100% accurate, so you end up with errors whenever DNA is copied despite the presence of error-checking processes (better in some organisms than others). So the with longer DNA you also end with more potential for errors. Cancer is primarily caused by this buildup of errors (though it's also the basis of evolution).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, longer DNA can also [sorta] reduce the incidence of mutations. Having extra, <em>non-coding</em> DNA (such as large introns that aren't used in alternative splicing or chunks of regulatory DNA) actually reduces the percentage of any particular <em>coding</em> sequence having a mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics gets really complicated really fast but I'll try and keep it simple. If you imagine a book as a chromosome, then the text is the DNA. Each chapter corresponds to a gene which codes for a different product. There may be extra information in the book between chapters which isn't required for making products but that's ok. The book not only takes up less space than having loose sheets everywhere it helps organise the recipes. Having an organised book makes it easier to make exact copies of all the text when you need to.
Now DNA already has sequences of  pairings represented by a single letter. Three base pairings equals a codon- which codes for an amino acid, which the smallest base unit of a protein (the product which DNA codes for). The codon is translated by the ribosome of the cell. Start codons and stop codons are certain combinations which when translated tell the machinery to start/stop making the protein product! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even I'm getting confused by your analogy here. DNA is copied and proofread letter for letter. The &quot;books&quot; are important for ease of movement during cell division  and also during crossover where &quot;books&quot; or even collections of proximal &quot;books&quot; are exchanged between homologous chromosomes.</p></div>		</li>
