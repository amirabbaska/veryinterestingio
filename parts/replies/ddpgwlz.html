			<div class="markdown"><p>How come when I press &quot;request desktop site&quot; on my phone it often just reloads the mobile site? It seems as though the website is intentionally stopping me from using the desktop site and forces me to either use their useless mobile site or to go find a computer. </p>
<p>I get that it's easier to make a shitty mobile site than to make a good mobile site, but wouldn't it be even easier to not make a mobile site at all and just let me use the desktop site?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first question sounds like it is just a bug. To answer your second question: The people that own the site want a mobile site and they want it by a certain date so the dev than makes the site as fast as he can in order to make the deadline. The dev than plans to make the site better but the money starts to dry up and the dev moves on to a new client. </p></div>		</li>

Almost all ads on Google now consider mobile before desktop and websites that are responsive have a better chance of ranking higher than websitea that aren't</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would say, primarily, that they're always trying to maximize advertising revenue.  They also prefer good UX to bad UX but that's a distant second, at best.</p>
<p>Almost every webpage I visit has ads on it.  Every single one could be massively improved by removing the ads -- and there are lots of browser extensions which attempt to do just that.</p></div>		</li>
