			<div class="markdown"><p>The science in this is fairly odd since, as you can see just from this thread, most scientists think this is a closed case. Your response seems to be one of the few that knows something about the current research in this and I think you highlight something very important: the question isn't whether there is enough energy to do this or that but whether it's biologically active (ie, able to interfere with cellular functioning).</p>
<p>My understanding is that Code 6 (Canada) was drafted without much research into it. Moreover, as you go to different countries there seems to be a lot of variation with respect to exposure thresholds (standards in european countries are very different than Canada, etc) suggesting that there doesn't seem to be a consensus about this. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This particular study that you linked has been popping up a lot lately. The problem I have with it is that it has not been peer reviewed yet, since the study has not yet run its course. They say they expect to publish somewhere around late 2017. </p>
<p><a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/results/areas/cellphones/" target="_blank">Here</a> is the study itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rodents were exposed for 10-minute on, 10-minute off increments, totaling just over 9 hours a day from before birth through 2 years of age.</p>
<p>NTP found low incidences of tumors in the brains and hearts of male rats, but not in female rats. Studies in mice are continuing.</p>
<p>The complete results from all the rat and mice studies will be available for peer review and public comment by the end of 2017.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's worth waiting for the study to be completed and for it to be peer reviewed before we start drawing conclusions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, I'm not going to trust a headline that says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>National Toxicology Program Finds Cell Phone Radiation Causes Cancer</p>

<p>before that study has even been reviewed. </p></div>		</li>
