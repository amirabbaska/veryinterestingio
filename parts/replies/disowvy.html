<p>I always figured they just flew randomly to increase the chances of obor detection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to be nitpicky but the Lévy distribution is a continuous probability distribution, rather than an algorithm. The paper the article seems to be based on - &quot;Free-Flight Odor Tracking in Drosophila Is Consistent with an Optimal Intermittent Scale-Free Search&quot;, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831497/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831497/</a> - actually refers to Lévy <em>flight</em> which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight_foraging_hypothesis" target="_blank">Lévy flight foraging hypothesis</a> suggests  as an accurate model for predatory foraging as opposed to Brownian motion.</p>
<p>Sometimes popular science writing seems like they are playing a game of Chinese whispers in terms of the difference between what the actual science is about and what gets printed in the end.</p></div>		</li>

</ul>
<p>Levy flight can be thought of as going off in a random direction, and sometimes not turning for long distances. Then, the hypothesis is that this is found in foraging behavior in animals because it is mathematically a better strategy for finding things than purely random walks (called Brownian motion).</p></div>		</li>
