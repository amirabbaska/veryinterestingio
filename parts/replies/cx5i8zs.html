2014 Washington Post article stating &quot;widespread methane leakage coming from hundreds of vents on East Coast ocean floor: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/25/widespread-methane-leakage-coming-from-hundreds-of-vents-off-east-coast-ocean-floor/" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/25/widespread-methane-leakage-coming-from-hundreds-of-vents-off-east-coast-ocean-floor/</a><br />
Arctic News from 2013 stating methane has reached 1800ppb: <a href="http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2013/06/mean-methane-levels-reach-1800-ppb.html" target="_blank">http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2013/06/mean-methane-levels-reach-1800-ppb.html</a>
Arctic News article from 2015 stating methane has reached an average of 2370ppb: <a href="http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2015/03/methane-levels-early-2015.html" target="_blank">http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2015/03/methane-levels-early-2015.html</a>
&quot;The global methane increase was substantially faster during 2014 than during 2007 through 2013. Similarly, the atmospheric burden of nitrous oxide has increased at faster rates in recent years.&quot; <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html" target="_blank">http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome, thanks for the good reply! Maybe it's best to just prepare for the worst and do what we can to try to help mitigate any effects of climate change. Though if the clathrate gun hypothesis was completely accurate, it sounds like it would all happen far beyond our control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember awhile back reading about the clathrate gun idea, it seemed like most of the references went back to N. Shakhova, kind of the same way the speculation about hyper-hurricanes mostly went back to papers by K. Emanuel.  I wonder if the body of literature has broadened out in recent years.</p></div>		</li>

Most of the methane from the ocean is scavenged by bacteria in the water column before reaching the surface. Only methane sources in shallow waters (&lt;100 m depth) will have appreciable fluxes to the atmosphere (cf. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1029/2005JC003183/abstract" target="_blank">McGinnis et al., 2006</a>). Recent (<a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm14/meetingapp.cgi/#Paper/27715" target="_blank">Pohlman et al., 2014</a>) measurements from neighboring regions don't show nearly as much methane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would happen when ocean acidification kills off the bacteria?</p>
<p>EDIT: Perhaps I shouldn't have said &quot;all&quot;.  A better way to put it is; what kind of effects would the loss of the majority of ocean bacteria have on the ocean 'food chain', and how would these effects affect human civilization?</p></div>		</li>
