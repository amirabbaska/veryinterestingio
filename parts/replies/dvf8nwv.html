			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who just upgraded to electric, I prefer analog. I bought a Mercedes and the electric dimmer doesn't filter the blinding light from the new style headlights (<del>HID I think they are now?</del> LEDs, thank you u/saadcee). I miss my little flip tab on my rearview. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, thank you.</p>
<p>Is that why I can actually see two different reflections in my mirror sometimes?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and you'll really pick up on it better when it's overcast or you're in a parking garage or something. Normally the FULL mirror's light is so bright it overpowers the transparent glass's reflection... but when it's dark there's less contrast between the two reflected light levels and so you'll see the second reflection stand out a bit more.</p></div>		</li>
