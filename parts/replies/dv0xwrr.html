			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey There thanks for your interesting opinion.</p>
<p>Since you work at in cancer therapy, any idea why countries like USA and Denemark have high rate of cancer but then another rich country like Japan have a lower cancer rate ? </p>
<p>I'd assume (but not sure ) that JP people have an access to easy treatments too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. I'm not sure - that has more to do with population studies. I can confirm that Japan has an excellent cancer program, probably better than the US or Europe even. </p>
<p>What I do know, is that there's genetic, environmental, and individual factors involved. Obesity is a risk factor, the kind of food you eat, the quality of the water, alcoholism causes cancer, and some cancers are more prevalent in some ethnicities than others. </p>
<p>Whether that's the reason for Japan in particular, though, I can't really say. I can say that's the reason for the third world countries though - we hear stories of people who go over there and try to help out, what kind of conditions they work in. </p></div>		</li>
