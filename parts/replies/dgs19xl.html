“The temperature 300 km above Earth’s surface jumped by 3000°C and the data revealed a 25 km-wide ribbon of gas flowing westwards at about 6 km/s compared to a speed of about 10 m/s either side of the ribbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 300km we're talking about the f-region of the ionosphere.  That's the most dense region of the ionosphere, but density is still very low.  To give you an idea, the electron density in the region is something like 10^12 electrons per cubic meter.  Comparing to something you might be more familiar with, at sea level, there are about 2-3 x 10^25 particles of air per cubic meter.</p>
<p>That is to say that the ionosphere is un-dense enough that thinking of temperature in terms of &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; is not very intuitive anymore.  While the particles are &quot;hot&quot; there is not as much energy flying around as you might think, simply because there are so few particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As 1976dave said at those heights, for most people it doesn't make sense to talk about atmosphere, the generally accepted range at which space starts is 100km, the density of particles at those distances is so low that's pretty much vacuum for most people, as such what you would call a huge jump on temperature doesn't work in the same way as it would here on earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>300 km above the Earth the atmosphere is very thin, so there would be very little (in mass) gas of that temperature.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highly diluted gas in this layer can reach 2,500 °C (4,530 °F) during the day. Even though the temperature is so high, one would not feel warm in the thermosphere, because it is so near vacuum that there is not enough contact with the few atoms of gas to transfer much heat.</p>
