			<div class="markdown"><p>so if that is the case, couldnt the CIA determine who gave the info, as well and when and where? i mean if someone is able to extract the emails, than surely the folks at the CIA with their massive spy software and shit would have a handle on where all this info is being leaked from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only tracks the original source and not who forwards or copys it. I haven't looked at the recent cia leaks but I am assuming they are looking at  internal emails. </p>
<p>How and who got them off their email server and shared them wouldn't be known by DKIM.</p>
<p>I have no ideas on the capabilities of the CIA either. I'd just assume they can do the unimaginable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CIA has methods to determine who is leaking what. One of those is a canary trap. You send out info to your recipients, but each recipient gets their own copy of the info with something small redacted or otherwise changed. If you see the info leak and it has some specific thing changed, you know exactly who leaked it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Presumably WikiLeaks anonymise the other data saying who it was sent to if necessary. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and no, Wikileaks doesn't publish everything it receives and they've been quite forward about publishing things at specific times to achieve political ends. </p>
<p>Further, how many people actually read what WikiLeaks posts? The majority of readers just wait for news sources to interpret what WL said, which introduces the same supposed bias right back in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What they release is more accurate and trustworthy than MSM. There is no questioning that. </p>
<p>Now if they publish everything they receive for political reasons we will never know. They have smeared the hell out of Republicans in the past and now recently Democrats have been the target. This could be a due to a ton of reasons. Fact is, we will never know the truth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Releasing selective information (even if the e-mails are &quot;authentic&quot;) can be just as dishonest as releasing falsified information. Elected officials still cite Wikileaks' climate change sham (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy</a>) as though it is some kind of evidence of a global climate conspiracy.  It was simply a misunderstanding of what was being stated in the emails because context to the conversation was not given.</p>
<p>Wikileaks choosing to release only select portions of email discussions is extremely dishonest, and is in fact more damaging to public understanding because they can hide behind the idea that their post is &quot;authentic&quot;.</p>
<p>I think calling them accurate and trustworthy is more than a little bit naive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real question here - if we're dealing with a world power (say Russia for instance) with known abilities to hack systems that are pretty well protected could they edit the DKIM with sufficient well qualified personnel? </p>
<p>Then they could covertly give the information to wikileaks who would then release with no provided proof that they are authentic. </p>
<p>Assange has been reliable in the past at releasing unedited documents. Lately, however, he seems to be releasing only information with a political bent particularly in the US, rather than releasing all information about all political parties. That doesn't go to the authenticity of the documents at all, but does support a particular political ideology who benefits from the release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail#Overview" target="_blank">DKIM Overview</a></p>
<p>Basically, they take some part of the email (sometimes just the header, sometimes the full body), create a hash, and encrypt it with their private key. </p>
<p>The recipient's mail server can calculate the same hash, then decode the included hash using the sender's public key, and see if they match.</p>
<p>The public key is retrieved from DNS, the same system that lets your browser find the server IP address when you type a domain name. (They use special record types to serve up their public key(s).)</p>
<p>So, if you have control of the DNS service of the recipient's email servers and the emails going through, you can do a Man In The Middle attack. This isn't hard to detect, though, if you compare emails on another channel.</p>
<p>DKIM is mostly an anti-spam thing, not a security thing. If you want security, you'll want to use end-to-end encryption with pre-shared keys.</p></div>		</li>
