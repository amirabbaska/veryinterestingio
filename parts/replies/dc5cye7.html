			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the flavoring is concentrated orange flavoring, like orange zest, etc take from some oranges. So you are getting OJ, it's just taken apart and put back together with a little more O than J. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But!  Milk producers don't want to include the sugar on their ingredients because it'll ruin their image of being wholesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correcy, but that's not usually found on items sold as orange juice. That's something you usually see on, like, gummy fruit snacks. They can't specifically call their product &quot;Juice&quot; in it's name if it's not 100% juice. Can they add other juices like apple or white grape as &quot;filler&quot; juice? Yes, but it's still juice. If they say &quot;100% Orange Juice&quot;, then it has to be 100% orange, but it can be additional orange concentrate added to the orange juice recipe, zest, etc...but all orange. If it's &quot;100% Orange Juice&quot; it's all orange juice. If it's &quot;Orange Juice: 100% Fruit Juice&quot;, it'll likely have apple or white grape or some other sort of juice...but again that's not common with orange juice. But then there are all sorts of verbiage hoops you have to jump through if the fruits listed in the name of the beverage make up less than half of the total juice content (like if you say it's  Cranberry Raspberry, but it's 51% apple juice, then you have to say it's &quot;flavored apple juice&quot; somewhere on the front of the label...and there are even font size requirements for these declarations. </p></div>		</li>

We are going to tell you like it and make it cheap so your momma buys it and also tells you it tastes good.

Lots of people preferred the lower quality corn syrup because that's what they grew up with. Many didn't even know pancake syrup and maple syrup where two different things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I stopped eating fast food burgers a while ago, tried to start eating them again, and they taste like crap.</p>
<p>I started eating artisan burgers and now, if I can't get it cooked medium, I won't be eating it (unless I'm at a cookout). But I've craved artisan burgers more often than fast food burgers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look to see if they bring the oranges out of a white bucket or one of their kitchen bowls, or if they come right out of the cardboard boxes. If it's the latter, they haven't washed the fruit and the juices that rush out of the oranges run over the surface of the oranges, washing any contaminates off the skins into the juice. There are typically more pesticides used on oranges than on melons. </p>
<p>I used to work in a produce department in a grocery store and we thoroughly washed EVERYTHING that we prepared (pre-cut melons, pre-cut veggies, etc). I don't have confidence that this is done anymore, but I can't prove it except when I actually see them open a brand new box of oranges and just dump 'em right in the hopper. The open-air hopper...usually kept near product department...where there's generally as least some fruit flies...and they love exposed, sticky orange juice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. We have a Bristol Farms that has the same machine. The juice is unbelievably good. I went to go pick some up this morning and the machine was broken so I had to buy the regular orange juice  :-(. It is amazing how good the fresh squeezed juice is. It has a completely different taste. </p></div>		</li>
