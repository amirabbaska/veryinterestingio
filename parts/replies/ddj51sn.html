			<div class="markdown"><p>For a repetitive half hour youtube video with no graphics and no resolution it is remarkably compelling listening.  Somehow it keeps a tantalising sensation of being right on the brink of a breakthrough alive for the entire length of the call.  I wonder how much longer one could keep going, moving through one employee after another, constantly edging the blue balls of the listener's intellect right up against the possibility that someone - <em>someone</em> - will be bright enough to understand that you don't suddenly call dollars 'cents' just because the number is small.  I reckon at least three hours.  I mean, I sat through that much of <em>Titanic</em> and never felt half as compelled as I am by this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legibility explains a lot of conventions, including some that have fallen out of use as digital data formats make it less of a concern. </p>
<p>Older electrical schematics for example are notated as: &quot;3k2&quot; for 3.2k (3200) or &quot;1v5&quot; for 1.5v (1.5 volts). And if you've seen older handwritten schematics, not just the text/symbols but the low quality they were stored/copied/distributed with, you'll be happy you weren't searching for a decimal point in there. </p>
<p>Even our modern typefaces with (for example) lowercase a's that look nothing like a handwritten a are a symptom of the same problem. In the early days of typing you couldn't rely on the letter being fully/correctly printed/displayed, so the handwritten a would be mistaken for an o. With modern computers and printers this isn't much of a concern and with the available equipment, we could read the handwritten style a just fine. But we already do it the other way </p></div>		</li>
