			<div class="markdown"><p>Increase the oxygen pressure of the air that gets to your lungs, by way of a pressurized oxygen tank for instance. There's nothing that you can do to breathe more 'efficiently' in an atmosphere with normal oxygen levels because the respiratory system is built around CO2, which is a waste product of the body. Notice how you breathe heavier and faster when exercising? That is to get rid of the CO2, had nothing to do with oxygen. Breathing faster and heavier will do nothing to your oxygen levels, it just fucks up your acid-base balance in your blood.</p>
<p>Unrelated to the question: Inhalation of CO (carbomonoxide) is suuuuper deadly and a silent killer because CO molecules binds so much easier to red blood cells (oxygen carriers in the blood) than oxygen molecules do. A smoke/CO alarm is a VERY good investment</p>
<p>EDIT: increase your red blood cell production and take maximum advantage out of your lungs capacity. Best way to do this is aerobic training at high altitude</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exercise.  Forcing the entire system (the body) to work harder sometimes makes it more efficient overall.</p></div>		</li>
