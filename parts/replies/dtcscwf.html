			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and this is what eventually led to the discovery of Ar.</p>
<p>Through careful analytical experiments, Rayleigh and Ramsay noted that the nitrogen evolved from chemical reactions was lighter than when nitrogen was isolated from the atmosphere. This led them to remove all of the nitrogen and find an additional, nonreactive gas.</p>
