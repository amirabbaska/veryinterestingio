<p>Now do your gear changing in a traffic jam.  Never reaching 20 mph, and stopping every 30 feet.</p>
<p>1st gear, 2nd gear, stop, 1st, stop, 1st, 2nd, stop.</p>
<p>Might as well have automatic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Driving manual gets broken down into a series of habits just like driving automatic does. </p>
<p>Also just swapped my transmission for a fresh one for $650. Try that in an automatic:)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it isn't anymore, but that's a fairly recent (i.e. less than 20 years) thing, isn't it? </p>
<p>I've seen statistics for Germany claiming that market share of automatic transmission has risen from 10% in 1999 to 25% in 2014. Could that be a result of increased fuel economy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that actually the case? My understanding of that is that the automatic transmission is just heavier and there's no way around it without drastically changing how they operate. What has changed recently that might impact that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that American suburbia developed as a result of US housing, lending, and schooling policies and practices that promoted sprawl rather than a nebulous preference for suburban housing.  That's a super complicated and important topic. </p>
<p>Without going too deep, I think it's important to realize that our housing structure, including the absurdly high level of segregation in America, is the result of conscious and deliberate decisions made by politicians and real estate business and lenders.  It is not just reflexive of people wanting &quot;nice houses with yards.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
