			<p>I live in northern Canada. It doesn't get dark between the beginning of June and the end of July. Leaving a bar at 2:30 am and walking out into daylight is an interesting experience the first time.<br><br>There is however a flip side. The middle of December until the beginning of January is basically perpetual darkness. <br><br>Both situations result in a lot of drinking :P</p>		</li>

			<p>The sun wouldn't appear to spin in the sky the way it does when you are close to the north pole enough that you don't have night. It would appear stationary in the sky if you moved, say a camera with a fixed perspective, around the pole at the right speed. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well... the question doesn't actually mention time ZONES at all.  So how &quot;time&quot; is perceived here is actually subject to interpretation.<br><br>If you travel around the world at the speed of the terminator, the sun is effectively frozen in the sky and &quot;time stands still&quot;, which seems to be the gist of the question.  At the pole, it's rather moot, from this point of view.</p>		</li>

			<p>Besides 1960s politics, this is why we launch most rockets in the US out of Florida, to try and get as much of the 1000 mph boost as possible. It means smaller rockets or larger payloads, both of which help make the economics work.  </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tom980" target="_blank">tom980</a>
			<p>Timezones are determined by the earth's spin. At the equator the surface is spinning at 1000 mph eastwards. If a rocket is launched directly eastwards then relative to the earth it will be moving at 1000 mph. This means that less velocity is needed from the rocket to obtain an orbit because of this starting lateral velocity.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Europeans take this to the extreme by launching in French Guiana in South America which is very close to the equator.  This has the added benefit of already being close to the inclination of geosynchronous satellites so fewer course corrections are required to get it in the right orbit.</p>		</li>

			<p>Another interesting factoid: Israel launches satellites to the West. For a unique engineering reason? No. Because they don't want their neighbors to think they're launching missiles and starting a war.

			<p>Just to be annoying: There are no official time zones in Antarctica, so you just kind of pick what ever time zone you prefer. This can end in one of three conclusions. 1, the answer you gave is satisfactory, 2, there's not way of answering the question for Antarctica and 3, you don't have to travel at all since you can just sit on your fat ass and just decide on a new time zone each hour.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well if you are talking about political timezones, the whole enterprise would be a bit more complicated at any virtually any latitude, wouldn't it?

			<p>If we're talking timezones it's impossible. There is no point on earth that stays e.g. 5pm. All timezones advance. If you could do it then you'd see the date change every time you crossed the intl date line. But you could stand where all the timezones meet and have parts of yourself stay the same date and time for up to 48 hours.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are actually a lot of timezones in antarctica, with the exception of mcmurdo, palmer and southpole they are traditionally set by the discretion of the station/party leaders, not their governments, much like ship time. For instance during the 80s/90s vostok station was set by the station leader by going outside midsummer and looking at a stick to estimate solar noon, so for a long time it was estimated as +6 but the reality was really different.<br><br>If you were to use shiptime the quickest way to circumnavigate the world and cover all timezone would be to be a ships captain at the northpole or party leader at the southpole and make the decision to change the timezone 24 times and record the change in the logbook.</p>		</li>
