			<div class="markdown"><p>Which makes sense right? Since the earth is spinning around 1000 mph, you would have to travel at that speed to keep your relationship with the sun, or in this case, never change time zones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides 1960s politics, this is why we launch most rockets in the US out of Florida, to try and get as much of the 1000 mph boost as possible. It means smaller rockets or larger payloads, both of which help make the economics work.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be annoying: There are no official time zones in Antarctica, so you just kind of pick what ever time zone you prefer. This can end in one of three conclusions. 1, the answer you gave is satisfactory, 2, there's not way of answering the question for Antarctica and 3, you don't have to travel at all since you can just sit on your fat ass and just decide on a new time zone each hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you are talking about political timezones, the whole enterprise would be a bit more complicated at any virtually any latitude, wouldn't it? Some countries refuse to adopt TZs consistently or pick odd offsets (India). So you would be adjusting your speed to traverse these areas and remain at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since timezones are discrete and time itself is continuous, there's no way to do it following political time. I assume the question was about solar time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're talking timezones it's impossible. There is no point on earth that stays e.g. 5pm. All timezones advance. If you could do it then you'd see the date change every time you crossed the intl date line. But you could stand where all the timezones meet and have parts of yourself stay the same date and time for up to 48 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually a lot of timezones in antarctica, with the exception of mcmurdo, palmer and southpole they are traditionally set by the discretion of the station/party leaders, not their governments, much like ship time. For instance during the 80s/90s vostok station was set by the station leader by going outside midsummer and looking at a stick to estimate solar noon, so for a long time it was estimated as +6 but the reality was really different.</p>
<p>If you were to use shiptime the quickest way to circumnavigate the world and cover all timezone would be to be a ships captain at the northpole or party leader at the southpole and make the decision to change the timezone 24 times and record the change in the logbook.</p></div>		</li>
