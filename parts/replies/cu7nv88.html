			<p>Very spot on. I think the only thing I'd add is that a key point in the process is the alignment of these phonetic units to the audio. Many people ask in the thread how the recognizer knows where the boundaries between the phonetic units are. If they're willing to go a little deeper, I'd say that the acoustic model models sequences of units across time <em>in addition</em> to matching the most likely phonetic unit (or a bucket in your description) to a frame (piece) of audio. So the speech recognition decoder, or search, <em>also</em> tries to match different alignments of the same sequence of phonetic units until it comes up with the most probable one at the end of the audio. </p>		</li>
