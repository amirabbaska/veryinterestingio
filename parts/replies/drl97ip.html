<p>This causes the playlist to be less random, but &quot;feel&quot; more random.</p></div>		</li>

At the end of the day it plays the same 10 songs out of a 1000 song playlist :/ </p>
<p>One thing thay works: Disable repeat, that way it still plays the first 10 it thinks you like best, but then it also plays the rest of the songs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good point. Games aren't meant to be realistic. They're meant to be fun/engaging/challenging/rewarding. Decisions about a game's design that were made just because &quot;it's realistic&quot; have no place in a game's design.</p>
<p>Randomness sucks. There are <em>very</em> few cases where actual randomness is preferable to &quot;modified&quot; randomness in a game. When someone gives something a &quot;20% chance of happening&quot;, they don't actually want a 20% <em>chance</em>, they want it to happen 20% <em>of the time, with some variation</em>, which are totally different things. It's entirely possible that the thing happens 5 times in row, or doesn't happen 20 times in a row, which is far from what's intended. What you want is to &quot;tighten&quot; or even to &quot;cap&quot; the bellcurve of possible outcomes by increasing the chance on each failure, decreasing it on each success, and possibly guaranteeing an outcome after a certain number of failures or successes.</p>
<p>Many games do this and you don't even notice because it works out exactly how the players expects it to work, <em>even better than reality does</em>, which is all that matters. League of Legends, for example, does this with critical hits, which is actually the only major source of randomness in the entire game. World or Warcraft increases the chances of getting loot from a boss with every time you got nothing, up to 100% after enough tries. Examples in X-COM and TF2 have already been mentioned. (It's debatable whether X-COM should have RNG at all, but that's a different story.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've heard this opinion before, but I don't understand it. How would it work without RNG?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on the game you're trying to play. If you want to play a deep strategy game about making the best decisions, then randomness reduces the impact of your decisions. There's a reason Chess has no dice. How can you make the &quot;right&quot; move if the &quot;right&quot; move could fail and the &quot;wrong&quot; move could succeed? How can you rely on a 90% hit chance when a 90% hit chance still has a 10% chance of missing and permanently killing your character with nothing you can do about it?</p>
<p>But if you're trying to play a game about struggling through an alien invasion where things <em>will</em> go wrong no matter how hard you try and lives <em>will</em> be needlessly lost, and you just have to accept that and do the best that you can, well then that kind of experience isn't possible without randomness and unpredictability.</p>
<p>So are you trying to play a deep strategy game about making the right decisions, or are you trying to play a tense, immersive, alien invasion game filled with risk and unpredictability and loss. I don't think those two games mesh very well, which is a bit of a fundamental problem with the game and other permadeath strategy games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure its a fair assessment that they aren't using real random numbers or care about randomness but rather it sounds like they weigh the outputs differently depending on the current game state.  For instance:</p>
<p><code>if(ammoCount == 1) { return baseCrit * 15 * randomNumber;} else {return baseCrit *randomNumber;}</code></p>
<p>I'm still using random numbers but changing the game's probability models.  I totally get the point you are making, but they aren't mucking with the actual RNG, just the weighted probabilities of a certain thing happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. However I think in the game the last bullets went to p=1 and +dmg%. Which sure is also just changing the probabilistic table but changing it to the point that random loses its meaning.</p>
<p>Anyways I think you raise a valid point, but I think the core of mine was centered around the players perception of said randomness and its perceived bias, and that game design focuses more on that than in a mathematically proven model of randomness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. For most games, its not necessary to generate a truly random number, nor practical. It's sufficient enough to create an experience of unpredictability.</p></div>		</li>
