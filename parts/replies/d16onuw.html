			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get some interesting behaviours in binary systems as well- for example, accreting white dwarfs (aka cataclysmic variables):
<a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/snr/images/dwarf.jpg" target="_blank">http://chandra.harvard.edu/edu/formal/snr/images/dwarf.jpg</a></p>
<p>In AWDs, one of the pair of stars has turned into a white dwarf and run out of hydrogen and helium. When the other begins to grow old and expand, then if the two are close enough together the outer layers of the star will be more strongly attracted to the WD, and get pulled onto its surface. Eventually, the WD 'accretes' enough hydrogen/helium to start fusing like a normal star again... briefly shining bright. Hence, the name 'cataclysmic variables'- their brightness varies wildly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember reading about how one of the stars of the system can actually absorb the other and it keeps orbiting inside it. How is this possible? Shouldn't they just crash into each other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be talking about a 'common envelope' stage. Here's an illustration:

<p>It tends to happen when stars age. Stars can expand hugely as they age, but become much less dense- and if they expand enough, they can envelop their companions. This hot but not-very-dense plasma isn't much of an impediment to the other star in the envelope, which can still hold itself together under its own gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The outbursts can last very different periods of time. They classify them by speed that way. Can be just days to months or even years. The initial brightening of the faster ones is on the order of hours, IIRC. Then they gradually fade.</p>
<p>They can recur, with the same white dwarf accreting more matter after an outburst, until years later it's ready for another bang. Eventually it could accrete enough to go supernova.</p>
<p>RS Ophiuchi erupts about every 20 years. Last time in 2006, so it's about halfway reloaded. It's rather faint to the naked eye even when at the height of an outburst though. T Coronae Borealis is brighter, but erupts more rarely. It was active in 1866 and 1946, so with a little luck we could get both that and RS Ophiuchi in 2026.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Systems. For some hard-data, we've just learned (from research done at my institution :D) that approximately 28% of all M-dwarf systems contain multiple stars. M-dwarfs are, by far, the most common type of star; around 75% of all stars reside in the M spectral class.</p>
<p>Multiplicity rates actually rise as you go bluer on the H-R diagram, getting up to 80+% for O-class stars. However, these stars represent only a fraction of a percent of our galaxy's stellar composition. Most stars are the tiny red guys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean there is a minimum circular orbit equal to the sun's radius plus the difference between the barycenter and the center of the sun? Any smaller circular orbit would impact the surface opposite the barycenter. If the barycenter is indeed near the surface then this circle could be quite large, on the order of twice the diameter of the sun. Seems to be an odd restriction since satellites can orbit the earth at a fraction of its diameter.</p></div>		</li>
