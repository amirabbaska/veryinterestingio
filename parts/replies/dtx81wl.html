			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. This happens to me also. But even the slightest bit open and they dry. So there’s a possibility you don’t look creepy. I know a couple people that can sleep with their eyes wide open. Now that’s creepy. Haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moment my (now) husband and I announced we were engaged, my siblings blurted out in unison, &quot;she sleeps with her eyes wide open!&quot;, to freak him out. Hubby just laughed. &quot;So she's a wizard, like Gandalf!&quot; I married him so hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother used to sleep with his eyes wide open, when we used to share a room I'd look over and see them open and ask if he was awake.... That's when I found out he also talked in his sleep as he never remembered our conversations haha. Used to freak me out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC I think I did. Waved my hand in front of them but no reaction. I thought they were intentionally not reacting and wanted to ask them when they wake up. I end up forgetting to follow up every time</p></div>		</li>
