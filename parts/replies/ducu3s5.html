			<div class="markdown"><p>I think bomb calorimetry it awesome! All you do is light the food on fire and measure the how much it changes the temp of water and you know how much energy (calories) our food has. It's so simple yet so elegant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but you hear bomb calorimetry and you expect something, <em>anything</em> more than what you get. Basically stare at a metal box and then after you have data. Especially in chemistry, wjere shit is usually cooler</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously: multiple ways, but an easy one is, They use an electricity to ignite/heat things.  They can accurately measure exactly how much electricity is used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You add an accelerant to the food to make it easier to burn.  As long as you know the exact calorific value of the accelerant you add, you can remove that value from the total you observe when burning the food + accelerant mixture.  And you'll be left with the calorific value of the food you added.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re measuring heat <em>flow</em>. They slowly add energy until combustion begins. At that point the stored energy in the food is released, which causes a spike in heat flow. So you subtract the rate you are adding heat from rate that heat is being generated by whole system, then take the area under that curve to get the total heat generated by the substance. </p>
<p>Still fairly imprecise for food purposes because not every single c-c bond is broken during the break down of food. Really only a fraction account for the total caloric gain, which more sophisticated methods account for. </p></div>		</li>
