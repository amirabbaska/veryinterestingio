			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a Rainbow Gathering out in the mountains many years ago and was told not to expect anyone to have salt (or any other seasonings).</p>
<p>Trying to prepare, I filled an old film canister with salt.</p>
<p>By the end of the first week, I found myself craving salt so much that I'd lick my finger, dip it into the canister, and suck all the salt off.</p>
<p>Now, usually that sort of thing would disgust me (who the hell eats plain salt?), but my body was craving it, so it became the most delicious elixir to me.</p>
<p>Amazing how our bodies can tell us just what they need, when they need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to look this up, apparently there's plenty of food, and free too (at least if you don't mind cooking too apparently). What the fuck is in there about &quot;we can't have food with salt&quot;, my god, looks like 99% of them are vegan, are they just trying to kill themselves on purpose by not even using salt? Water is gonna be next, it deprives the fish and plants of a much needed resource, fuck people who drink water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't that they're vegans. The problem is that Rainbow Gathering is the most concentrated collection of stupidity and delusion in the modern world. It's not surprising that some of them end up deciding to ban salt. They also ban any currency but allow trading which is then standardized with common food items (that they purchased before they came), e.g. coffee or chocolate bars. Nobody seems to realize bartering, or paying for labor, in terms of &quot;5 chocolate bars&quot; is about the same thing as bartering with 5 dollars, except that it's less efficient because the recipient will have to go barter with someone else if he doesn't actually want the chocolate bars. The whole thing is just retarded social signaling about how cool they are for not engaging with &quot;commercialism&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That gold Sundae just pisses me off, there isn't even the pretense of taste that you see with most extravagant foods, the point is just to show how rich an ass you are. </p>
<p>If won the lottery I could see myself buying some dumb shit, but literally eating gold just seems disrespectful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is probably one of the best conduits of for the wealthy to relieve themselves of money.</p>
<p>That's good, because an economy doesn't run well when the wealthy decide to hoard money. Kind of like if one cylinder in an engine decides that it needs <em>all</em> of the oil. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously spending money on gold is preferable to locking it away and throwing away the key, but those aren't the options. In modern economies savings and investment are closely correlated, especially among the wealthy. The rich guy isn't going to stuff that money into his mattress he's going to put it in a hedge fund. </p>
<p>The question is whether investing the money is better for the economy as a whole then using it buy gold plated ice cream. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Luxury goods are a good way of extracting some money from the rich, but it's not enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The economy is not a zero-sum game. Them having money does not deprive you of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>To be fair, pepper is actually a great food addition and useful in a variety of recipes. Saffron had the same or greater status symbol, but has fewer cuisine applications.</del></p>
<p><del>Pepper was also great for food preservation and has anti-bacterial properties, much like salt. Curing meats allowed for extended protein storage in hot climates, which is important for feeding armies. If two condiments, salt and pepper, meant that my armies and people would have greater food security, then I'd definitely go to war to have access to it.</del> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold plated food isn't completely outrageous. You can buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edible-Gold-sheets-Loose-Type/dp/B005P9561O/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480855719&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=edible+gold+leaf" target="_blank">gold leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DeiAurum-Edible-Gold-Flakes-0-100g/dp/B00QLFZAO4/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480855719&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=edible%2Bgold%2Bleaf&amp;th=1" target="_blank">gold flakes</a> on Amazon. If you're using one sheet per desert, it is only adding $2/desert (they're big enough for individual servings, 3&quot;x3&quot;).</p>
<p>The problem is this sundae is just add whatever expensive shit together without any coherence. It's not expensive because it's good, it's expensive because it has expensive ingredients. The gold adds nothing. Those chocolates aren't going to be good in ice cream because the cold changes the texture, and they are meant to be eaten on their own. And caviar? I mean I like caviar but give me a fucking break. Even if you omit the salt it still tastes like fucking fish.</p>
<p>If I'm spending a grand for a sundae I want some hand churned ice cream from the cream of a well fed cow, in house candied fruit, chocolate syrup made with really good chocolate, etc. Use gold flake sprinkles on it not a big solid chocolate leaf flower that probably tastes like ass.</p>
<p>That sundae reminds me of Trump's living room. Lot of random expensive gold plated shit just to look like something poor people imagine rich people like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a culinary perspective pepper is also incredibly versatile. It adds flavor without completely overpowering it, and can be added individually after cooking. Could you imagine a cumin shaker? To strong for many dishes without the mellowing process of cooking. </p></div>		</li>
