			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking of bass, catfish, carp, etc. that I tend to think about in American fresh water streams.  I thought the reason they were that color was for camouflage, but it I don't understand why tropical fish wouldn't be camouflauged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fish you mention are typically in more murky waters. So from an evolution point, investing in bright colors most likely did not yield considerable benefits (like easier access to food or sex) .
Vs tropical fish which are typically found in more clear waters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many tropical species use their bright colors to identify each other and form a shoal. Bass, carp, etc are more solitary. Bass in particular are an ambush preditor so camouflage is helpful. Schooling fish don't hide, they find safety in numbers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rainbow and cutthroat trout, Bluegil and Sunfish can be pretty colorful fish found in American waters.</p>

<p>Colorful though they are- they pale in comparison to what you will see in tropical waters.</p>
