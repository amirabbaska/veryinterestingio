<p>As with any electrical system, try and dump the electricity first and wait for 5-10 minutes if possible to let the electricity drain.</p>

<p>Some of this advice is really concerningly incorrect. Trying to 'dump' a 60+kWh battery could mean you vaporize whatever you're shorting the battery with, igniting any of the wires you're shorting, or even sending the battery itself into thermal runaway and creating a far worse situation. </p>
<p>Sulfuric acid is only present in lead-acid batteries, which are only in traditional car batteries. Electric cars tend to not use lead-acid batteries as they're heavier and less useful.</p>
<p>Where do your guidelines for these things come from? What kind of documentation are these based off of? As others in this thread have mentioned Tesla has an excellent first responder guide that clarifies some of these things: <a href="https://www.tesla.com/firstresponders" target="_blank">https://www.tesla.com/firstresponders</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a professional standards office which come up with these guidelines. Some guidelines are a national standard (thru say NFPA or ICS or UL- there’s a million different standard agencies that have input in every departments SOG’s)</p>
<p>Some guidelines are written with input from all of us (unique situations or past incidents we learn adapt and apply) </p>
<p>As for draining a battery, it’ll never happen, we won’t do it. It says that in our guidelines, but unless we have someone on scene who actually built the car, we will not follow that step. </p>
<p>We would pull the big orange handle under the back seat and go from there</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a LEAF and I'm holding onto a Model 3 reservation waiting for a AWD.  Every electric car I know has lead-acid for the 12V accessories.  Generally the only thing running off the main battery system should be the traction motor (and the DC-to-DC converter to keep the 12V charged.)</p></div>		</li>
