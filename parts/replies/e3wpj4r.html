			<div class="markdown"><p>Bulleit got their rye from MGP in Indiana, and their bourbon from Four Roses.  That doesn't mean they are the same product, they are blended to different profiles.  They have opened their own distillery and are barreling their own make at this point, although I don't know if they have begun bottling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the case for Bulleit, but what usually happens is that new companies will make custom blends out of other aged whiskeys to create a flavor profile unique to them. Then, they'll create that flavor profile with their own product. It's not really rebranding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is the correct answer. Prior to having their own aged alcohol they buy it. I have also see a lot of local &quot;distilleries&quot; be just mixing centers buying from the big guys.</p></div>		</li>
