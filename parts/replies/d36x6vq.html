<p>Same reason people counted to 12 (6x2) on their hands (based on the knuckles, not the fingers). </p>

<p>I tried and still can't see how you would do this. </p>
<p>Also, have any sources to back up your entire post? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it goes up by 360 to add up to one of the next unit, then it's base 360 if anything, not 60 (360's not even a power of 60, so you couldn't argue it just skips an exponent either). Yes, minutes and seconds of angle are base 60, but that doesn't make the circle base 60 any more than 3 teaspoons to the tablespoon makes 2 tablespoons to the oz base 3.</p>
<p>If you're going to use &quot;base&quot; to refer to unit-unit conversions as if digitis places (which is fine, lots of people do), then it would go:</p>
<p>Angle: bases 60, 60, 360 by units in order</p>
<p>Liquid volume, imperial, comparison example: bases 3,2,8,4,4 (teaspoon, tablespoon, oz, cup, quart, gallon)</p></div>		</li>
