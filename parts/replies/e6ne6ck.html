			<div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that ethanol is actually formed during physiologically normal biochemical process in humans, as a byproduct of fatty acid synthesis.  Because of this, there is already a “plan” in place to get rid of it.  In general, the plan to remediate <em>any</em> toxic substrate is direct elimination (pee and poop) or breakdown by enzymes.  There is a whole family of enzymes dedicated to the first step of breaking down alcohols, and humans have a version that is particularly great at handling ethanol.  This likely reflects the biochemical necessesity to get rid of it.</p>
<p>I am not aware of a necessary biochemical process in humans that makes methanol as a byproduct.  That doesn’t mean there isn’t one, but I remember looking this up a few years ago and not finding anything.</p>
<p>At least one reason that methanol is different than ethanol in terms of toxic effects has to do with what they are broken down into. Specifically, methanol metabolism produces formate, which inhibits a necessary process in mitochondria.  This isn’t true of ethanol, which is a larger molecule and can be degraded piecewise, with each step producing compounds that the body can handle or that are less acutely toxic.  </p>
<p>What’s interesting is that the mitochondria is essentially a kidnapped bacterium.  It’s been stripped down a great deal, but the fact that it can be choked by methanol so easily suggests that there isn’t a widespread process that makes it in healthy cells, bacterial or human.  That explanation is consistent with the facts, but it’s not a required conclusion... it is just a nice hint that it could be true.</p>
<p>Ultimately, like the quote says, nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution.  Here, the biochemistry and evolution line up.</p>
<p>And this might be petty, but the explanations of why some metals are toxic... they’re either so vague as to be kinda meaningless or incorrect where they are specific.  I would not put a lot of stock in what has been said so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, methanol is a byproduct of our body breaking down ethanol. It’s one of the causes of hangovers, and why hair of the dog makes you feel better temporarily. Breaking down methanol produces byproducts and makes you feel bad, basically.  Our liver priorities ethanol processing over methanol, so you temp stop feeling bad until later, when hopefully some of your other hangover symptoms have been alleviated.</p></div>		</li>
