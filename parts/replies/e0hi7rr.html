			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to tack onto this, &quot;active calcium&quot; refers to a form of calcium, either as an ion or in a complex, that is able to be absorbed into the body. I'm not too sure as to the mechanism of absorption, so maybe someone else can expand on that. </p>
<p>Similarly, mercury (Hg) metal isn't able to be absorbed into the body, so it's relatively inert and fairly non-toxic. But when it's formed into a complex, or combined with ligands, it becomes extremely toxic. </p>
<p>Similarly, early antibiotics was an active form of arsenic, with specific ligands attached to make it more selective towards bacteria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Famously, this is how mercury drop electrode came to be. Solid state Electrochemistry had to deal with the surface of the electrode getting oxidized and fouled up. The idea is that a mercury being drip out of a capillary will act as the working electrode. As the mercury emerged from the capillary, it's surface just contacted the solution and is fresh and unoxidized. As electrolysis occurs, it's surface starts getting oxidized but at a certain size, the drop drips off and a new drop start forming. </p>
<p>This type of EC is known as polarography and is a old technique. Nowadays, we have better carbon based electrodes that has a wide potential window that won't get it oxidized or fouled up so polarography became a niche application.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It looks similar to how molten aluminum will develop an oxide layer on top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding has always been that mercury vapor is what is toxic. Liquid mercury is actually ingested as folk medicine in some cultures, particularly in Latin America. IIRC, the vapor is ionized and that makes it more reactive. It’s similar  to most heavy metals as far as toxicity from what I remember as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vapor isn’t ionized. Elemental mercury is dangerous in large amounts or chronic exposure, but where it gets scary is when it forms water soluble compounds, especially organic compounds. Methyl Mercury is what is commonly talked about in chronic mercury poisoning. Dimethyl mercury is insanely toxic. Inorganic mercury salts were used to treat gonorrhea and syphilis before  the advent of antibiotics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury alloys (aka amalgams) also were and are still used as dental fillings. They're extremely good for fillings, because they're malliable enough to precisely shape into the patient's cavity, and unlike resin fillings they don't shrink (resin fillings shrink slightly when they cure and can pull away from teeth and leave small gaps) and they're less brittle. They do leach small amounts of mercury into the body but you'd get more from eating tuna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, when Lewis &amp; Clark set out on their expedition to explore North America and find the Northwest Passage, they were given big mercury pills to ingest. Now, ingested mercury metal may not be readily toxic like in vapor or some salt compounds, but that doesn't mean your body likes it. These pills would cause you to evacuate your bowels...hard.  </p>
<p>The route that L&amp;C took can actually be traced by finding latrine sites with unusually high mercury content.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is ultimately, but elemental mercury has very poor absorption through skin or mucous membranes etc.</p>
<p>You have to vaporise or soluble-ise it in some way to be at significant risk of toxicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably with some kind of safety valve against terms that are misleading. With a very narrow interpretation of misleading.</p>
<p>Like all those pots and pans that are wrongly labelled &quot;titanium&quot;. Because they are made of metal and metal is strong so it's kind of like titanium which is also strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP never said &quot;liquid calcium&quot; appeared in the ingredient list. It may just have been on the front label (eg. &quot;Now with LIQUID CALCIUM!!&quot;). Since toothpaste isn't a food, I don't think they need to have a full ingredient list like on a box of cereal. I <em>think</em> it may be regulated more like a drug, so they might have active ingredients (eg. flouride), but I don't think they have to list all the ingredients.</p></div>		</li>

Most toothpastes fall under OTC Cosmetic regulations, but some basic simpler formulas could fall under cosmetic regulations. Both absolutely require full accurate ingredient lists as declared by the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients.
