			<div class="markdown"><p>That might have been true 20 years ago, but subsurface scattering has been used in films since at least the Matrix Reloaded in 2003. I remember them discussing this in the commentary that came out with the animatrix shorts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, SSS is almost trivial today. There is far more advanced things that go into rendering realistic humans, such as <a href="http://gl.ict.usc.edu/Research/skinstretch/" target="_blank">skin microstructure deformation</a> and slight changes of color by simulating blood flow under the skin.</p>
<p>I don't think it is a technological problem any more, it is an artistic or creative challenge.</p>

<p>A computer game is always going to be behind the corresponding movie tech because it has to be rendered in real time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a note, since the previous comment brought up games, and your example was movies:</p>
<p>Movies can be dramatically better than games when it comes to this sort of graphics since they can take longer than X seconds to render a X second scene.</p>
<p>In games (aside from cutscenes) everything must be rendered in real time.</p>
<p>I don't have actual numbers, but something like subsurface scattering may be easy to do in movies, but not yet possible to do in games with non-simple scenes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Games already have sub-surface scattering. However, because we can't have infinite mesh or texture resolutions, or infinitely detailed animations, we still cannot create realistic people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I just think it's different for everyone. Maybe a CG person in the background of a movie may not be spotted, but for me, if it's in the foreground, it's usually gets spotted.</p>
<p>The thing about your link is we are already lead to believe they're CG and not real humans so it's hard for some people to look at them as if they're human.</p></div>		</li>
