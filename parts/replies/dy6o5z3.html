			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know about that… I worked as a nursing assistant in long term care (retirement home) and when I started out we had a patient who was demented to the point of being essentially vegetative and also somewhat obese. She was concious but essentially a rock - made almost no movement on her own except for some minor things (she would eat by herself if you gave her the time and space to do so - took her about an hour for a slice of bread) and barely responded to stimuli. We had to turn her to the side in bed to complete the full body wash and it required two people for the prodecure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For someone who is unconscious, it's not too difficult to roll them. Imagine a patient laying on their back, you'd pull one arm across their body, and bend the knee of the leg on the same side. Then either pushing or pulling (depending on what side you're standing on) from the hip and under the armpit and they'll roll quite easily. From there you'd straighten the bent leg a little to add some support, place a pillow between the legs to help prevent pressure areas, and one behind the back for extra support.</p>
<p>Try that position out yourself, it's pretty comfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in an Intensive Care Unit as a registered nurse, and all of our intubated/sedated patients get this care. repositioning happens at least every 2 hours.  Oral care is also every 2 hours. Linen changes happen at a minimum of every 24 hours. full body baths take place generally with the linen change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's also to prevent pneumonia in intubated pts, studies have shown that good frequent oral care and cut down on infection rates. we have little kits that hook up to the wall suction, there is a hollow tube with a sponge on the end so you don't get fluid down the throat, there is a minty paste you clean with then usually a antibacterial mouth wash </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More often then not moistened mouth swabs are used to prevent the bubbles. It's not as thorough as brushing but it does help. In intensive care suction swabs are used. They are really cool. They are attached to the wall suction and dipped into oral care solution (a lot like mouth wash). You cleanse the mouth and can suction when needed by covering a hole with your thumb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the suction swabs that RNs use, patients in a coma are usually intubated and on a ventilator - the tube that they are breathing through has a small balloon around it that sits at the opening to their airway and prevents any and all secretions/liquids from sliding down their throat so it would be next to impossible to drown them.</p></div>		</li>
