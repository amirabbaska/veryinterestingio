We're talking about several to many orders of magnitude more power than our current global energy consumption, as well as a mature and developed space manufacturing and transportation industry also many orders of magnitude larger, cheaper, reliable than our combined space industry.</p>
<p>Consider our inability to terraform Earth where it's easy: the surface is already not just habitable, but prosperous and all of your resources and infrastructure already exit. Even after centuries of non-stop economic activity, we can't convince a significant portion of the population to agree that we've had any impact at all on the climate. And of the ones we have convinced, we barely have the economic or political will to try and reverse it given our current level of technology. Simply changing (or preventing) the temperature of our planet a few degrees is outrageously difficult; imagine trying to recreate an entire atmosphere. And this is all of course before we consider the completely unknown effect of building a self-sustaining biome from the ground up.</p>
<p>It's not physically impossible - given enough time and perseverance of course you could bombard a planet with enough scavenged space material to do what you want, but trying to meaningfully change the climate of an uninhabitable on human timescales is just impossibly far beyond our capabilities. It would be vastly easier to improve our spacefaring technology and find a habitable planet rather than attempting to modify one.</p></div>		</li>
