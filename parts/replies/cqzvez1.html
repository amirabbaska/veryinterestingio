			<div class="markdown"><p>But artificial lights are a problem. The reason why is they developed and evolved in a natural world. at night the only natural LIGHT SOURCE of any consequence is well ..the moon. By keeping the moon in a single spot (which is always relatively stationary) you can navigate and follow straight lines using simple bug algorythms to keep the moon in the same relative spot.  </p>
<p>Now if you add artificial lights which are ...by comparison to the moon ...appear to MOVE relative to you ...then when you try to keep the light in the same orientation to your primitive bug eyes what happens? you fly a CIRCLE.</p>
<p>its actually trying to navigate in a straight line, and the natural way for it to do that is keep the light source (the moon or sun for example) in the same position.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Moths use the moon, moths really dont fly around in circles like idiots unless they're looking for a way out....or beating themselves against artificial lights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but artificial light has been around in some form or another for tens of thousands of years, maybe half that if you only want to consider stationary, consistent light sources like mounted torches and candles and lamps. Still, given the lifespan of the average house fly that's (probably) millions of generations they have had to adapt. I think &quot;bugs have evolved to be random&quot; makes more sense/is a much more important factor than &quot; bugs have not evolved to adapt to artificial light yet&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>For bugs that fly at night. Which is - I'm just guessing here - not all bugs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, insects are programmed to be random in their movements.</p>

<p>What's the mechanism for this? It sounds like it could be really interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea. We had a behavioral entomologist come and speak in our medical entomology course for a few lectures, and he was able to develop an algorithm that replicated the exact movements of insects (based off of years of observations of their behavior -- dipterans to be specific). He kept refering to the insects as being programmed to behave this way, yet he even admitted the true driving force or mechanism behind this is yet to be determined. SUPER interesting stuff. For real. Insects are fascinating! I would love to learn more as well! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely understand where you are coming from, however, I think with our limited views as humans it's tough for us to really pinpoint the origin or exact mechanism as to why they behave in these patterns to begin with. Super interesting! If you understand it on a better level than I do, I would love to hear more! </p></div>		</li>
