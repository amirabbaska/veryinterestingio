			<p>So many people in this thread are saying &quot;yeah, it's cuz of artificial lights&quot;. Your answer actually makes sense. </p>		</li>

			<p>But artificial lights are a problem. The reason why is they developed and evolved in a natural world. at night the only natural LIGHT SOURCE of any consequence is well ..the moon. By keeping the moon in a single spot (which is always relatively stationary) you can navigate and follow straight lines using simple bug algorythms to keep the moon in the same relative spot.  <br><br>Now if you add artificial lights which are ...by comparison to the moon ...appear to MOVE relative to you ...then when you try to keep the light in the same orientation to your primitive bug eyes what happens? you fly a CIRCLE.<br><br>its actually trying to navigate in a straight line, and the natural way for it to do that is keep the light source (the moon or sun for example) in the same position.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Flies are not night hunters.<br><br>Moths use the moon, moths really dont fly around in circles like idiots unless they're looking for a way out....or beating themselves against artificial lights.</p>		</li>

			<p>pretty much all bugs fly around like idiots if they get indoors though too because of those mechanisms they are like Dori.<br><br>OH LIGHT <em>bang</em> hey that hurt ...OOH LIGHT <em>bang</em> </p>		</li>

			<p>but artificial light has been around in some form or another for tens of thousands of years, maybe half that if you only want to consider stationary, consistent light sources like mounted torches and candles and lamps. Still, given the lifespan of the average house fly that's (probably) millions of generations they have had to adapt. I think &quot;bugs have evolved to be random&quot; makes more sense/is a much more important factor than &quot; bugs have not evolved to adapt to artificial light yet&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Bugs havent evolved much for millions of years it SEEMS...according to the data and its interpretation. <br><br>Also its not a huge evolutionary problem because the insects who succumb to areas with artificial light to a level it impacts their reproductive ability and life cycle are a very small percent of the population when you consider any individual bug species pretty much out numbers us a trillion to 1. Even if 1,500 gnats and house flies die every night PER purpose built bug zapper  thats like 0.0000001 percent of their total population. <br><br>There is no selection pressure and no reason for them to adapt, so they die. Big deal. there are trillions more to take their place the next day. Even given this major flaw to the INDIVIDUAL bug with artificial lighting it does not affect the species survival the a point where it would select &quot;Artificial light resistance bugs&quot; to take over the gene pool. there is no reason to because even given this flaw it doesnt eliminate enough genetic competition. <br><br>Which means ..bugs as a lifeform are still succeding quite well! its still a flaw though. <br><br>-At any time, it is estimated that there are some 10 quintillion (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) individual insects alive.<br><br>Source <br><a href="http://www.si.edu/encyclopedia_si/nmnh/buginfo/bugnos.htm" target="_blank">http://www.si.edu/encyclopedia_si/nmnh/buginfo/bugnos.htm</a><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Quick additional expounding:<br>The selection pressure acts on the gene distribution, rather than the species, and unless there are alleles that don't suffer from that behavior that are more effective among the breeding population that those alleles are found in, selection pressures will prevent those alleles from increasing in their population distribution.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you accept that basic assumption too it also explains bio luminescense and its influence on mating behavior. If we look at bug behavior as &quot;Code&quot; driven and the code is based on the assumption <br><br>&quot;Bright thingie = keep it in the same spot&quot; <br><br>&quot;Bright thingie in same spot = fly straight line&quot; <br><br>This would be &quot;default mode&quot; Purpose being, to cover ground until certain triggers are met. Flying in a straight line is the best way to cover distance. <br><br>Covering distance is the best way to encounter &quot;new&quot; triggers. if you dont have complex reason. <br><br>So essentially the bug is trying to cover ground so it can execute more specific programming. Using light source as point of reference it will cover the most ground until it ..picks up a chemical or a pheremone. Which overrides and takes precedence ..it snaps out of default/ travel mode and takes on other behaviors as qued by the chemicals. <br><br><br>So if you were a fire fly for example ... you would be quite advantageous. Since you are by default hardwired to cover distance by keeping a light source stationary to yourself until otherwise instructed ...a MATE releasing their own light has an interesting consequence. <br><br>you begin to &quot;circle&quot; the mate because its just a light source ..and you are trying to fly in a straight line. <br><br>but this keeps you in the vicinity long enough to activate other chemical triggers, since evryone is operating on a set of programming where they want to maintain a constant orientation to light, it forces or rather arbitrarily results in congregations of light emitting creatures to STAY together ... <br><br>Its fascinating. Life ..is fascinating. Btw im just a high school drop out. Im not qualified to be giving any actual opinions. I dont even study bugs, I do love studying human behavior though and bugs just seem like a cake walk by comparison. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Fireflies also release a stink ass chemical when they do their lighting up thing.<br><br>I stopped collecting them when I discovered that, and honestly haven't seen one in over a decade. Whatever happened to them?</p>		</li>

			<p>One suspected reason for dwindling firefly numbers is increasing light pollution. Hard to find a mate when there are so many artificial light sources washing out their signal.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Also, insects are programmed to be random in their movements.<br><br>What's the mechanism for this? It sounds like it could be really interesting</p>		</li>

			<p>I have no idea. We had a behavioral entomologist come and speak in our medical entomology course for a few lectures, and he was able to develop an algorithm that replicated the exact movements of insects (based off of years of observations of their behavior -- dipterans to be specific). He kept refering to the insects as being programmed to behave this way, yet he even admitted the true driving force or mechanism behind this is yet to be determined. SUPER interesting stuff. For real. Insects are fascinating! I would love to learn more as well! </p>		</li>

			<p>I completely understand where you are coming from, however, I think with our limited views as humans it's tough for us to really pinpoint the origin or exact mechanism as to why they behave in these patterns to begin with. Super interesting! If you understand it on a better level than I do, I would love to hear more! </p>		</li>

			<p>Instead of individuals and environment, look at their interconnected relations, and how these relations form favorable or hard or fatal conditions for sustaining life &amp; reproduction, on a geological time scale.<br><br>That's a very obscure way of describing evolution, but I'm no expert and almost asleep;)</p>		</li>
