			<div class="markdown"><p>The ancient Babylonians created it. Equal time hours of day and night at the equator were observed where the oldest traceable calendar making began. They were pretty observant because they were on to something. This breaks down into smaller units. The finger theory has been there but the calendar and time have been worked on by many civilizations. It makes sense that smaller numbers would be used in a pre-calculator society and then when astronomy and star tracking started happening more and more systems were developed. The Julian calendar is where you want to look as it condensed down many previous calendars. When the sundial and math started to be invented they began to develop the concept as time as far as we know it. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2011/11/15/3364432.htm" target="_blank">http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2011/11/15/3364432.htm</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit that's genius. Use your left hand (fingers) for the 12s and right hand (segments) for the units (counting left to right and base to tip). In which case 45 would look like 3 fingers on ur left hand and up to the base of ur pinky on your right hand</p></div>		</li>
