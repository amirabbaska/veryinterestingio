			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger, I heard several people say over the years that the clouds refract and amplify the UV rays so it’s easier to sunburn on an overcast day. </p>
<p>Really though, it’s just that you don’t FEEL the heat you’d normally associate with a burn, but plenty of UV rays are still penetrating the cloud cover. You tend to not seek out shade, and stay exposed longer and/or without sunscreen because you don’t think you’re going to get burned, so you end up getting a worse sunburn than you likely would have if you’d been in direct sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluffy white cumulus clouds make sunburn more likely because of the lensing and reflecting they cause, similar to snow and open water. Overcast clouds significantly decrease the amount of UV radiation getting through, so sunburn is less likely but still possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is personal experience, but I would still like an explanation for it. I heard since like forever that UV penetrates clouds and you can get sunburned even when it's cloudy, but I have never put on sun lotion when it's cloudy and I never got a sunburn. </p>
<p>Under what circumstances is it that UV light can penetrate clouds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The uv light is <em>always</em> penetrating clouds.</p>
<p>It's possible you were exposed less than you think (lack of obvious sunlight vs shade, you may have spent much of your day in at least partial shade).</p>
<p>It's also very likely that you just don't burn that easily. I can burn easily but i can also tan. When I'm tan I don't burn as easily. So maybe I spend 2 hours in sun today and get a bit red. And in a month or so i might spend 3 hours in the sun without any problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I think you need to be translucent for this to happen. Visible light penetrates clouds too that's why you can still see but it's a lot less light. Look at the this <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water#/media/File%3AAbsorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water#/media/File%3AAbsorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png</a> if you could see ultra violet only it's be a lot darker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could swear that I can feel sunburn happening. It doesn't feel like the heat of the sun, more like the pain of getting too close to a fire. It can happen on a cold, cloudy day as much as a sunny day. Sometimes it'll start within minutes of going outside. Other times I can be in the sun all day and feel nothing.</p>
<p>If I ever ignore the sensation, I <strong>always</strong> get sunburnt, and I've (almost) never been sunburnt without feeling it first. Is this all in my head?</p>
<p>For context, I'm in New Zealand where UV levels are particularly high (due to our proximity to the ozone hole). It seems like every tourist learns this the hard way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I can also feel myself getting sunburned. Its hard to really know, since I pretty much always get burned if I'm outside, but what you said sounds familiar. For me though, my skin feels really prickly, almost as if I already have a sunburn.</p></div>		</li>
