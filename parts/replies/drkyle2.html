			<div class="markdown"><p>Doc here. I think the emphasis should be on utilizing the muscles you will use during your workout / sport on a small scale before jumping into using them on a large scale. By utilizing a muscle group in any way, doing some light motions repeatedly, the small capillaries will dilate and the blood flow will increase perfusion of those tissues — bringing the muscles and connective tissue to a state in which all the fibers and proteins (like actin and myosin) have a good supply of oxygen and good clearance of lactic acid and CO2. Once you’ve got good perfusion to a muscle group the tissues are ready to work and far less likely to suffer injury by being in a “dormant” state and unable to react well. Muscles in particular are in a constant state of activation and inhibition to create smooth movement, and when not all the tissues are “awake” (don’t have good blood perfusion yet) then they will flex wrong and be more likely to pull or strain. Stretching does not accomplish this and in my opinion warming up the muscles you are planning to use with some amount of pre-workout movement is a very good idea. Hope that answers your question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>40 year old guy here. “Warming up” and “stretching” has come a long way since I was a kid. Back then it was “jog for a bit then do several static stretches”. By static stretches I mean hold a position and stretch the muscle. Maybe throw in some whirling of arms and a few jumps. This was for soccer, tennis, rugby.</p>
<p>Having now started sports again there seems to be a lot of “dynamic” warms ups like you describe, where you’re doing movements that are similar to what you’ll use in the sport. It seems to be a lot more effective at getting the blood flowing and getting the body “ready” to play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I refuse to do almost any warmup that isn't just a low energy version of my actual workout. If it's running, I just jog slowly. I do rowing and all I will do for that is a light row on an erg. If there is any real downtime between a warmup and the actual exercise, I find it pointless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As st314 mentioned: warming up the muscles which you'll be using during the activity. </p>
<p>For running, as an example, we warm up with &quot;dynamic&quot; exercises that mimic the movement of running. High steps, criss cross pattern, high knees, lunging...as we move down a 50metre distance and back. Dynamic just means we're moving rather than, say, sitting on the ground and stretching, which is not as effective.</p></div>		</li>
