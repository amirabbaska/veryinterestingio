			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just the doctor, but at least in the US insurance companies dictate when you can get your perscription refilled. You have to wait 28-30 days from the day you initially picked up your first prescription to get a refill. If you need to take it every day, you literally have no way to put extra in your system unless you buy some illegally or forget to take some on another day. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And pharmacies don't like to keep too much of these controlled substances in stock, so when I go to fill my prescription which I do every single month sometime they have to order it and then I run out, if I can't get it at another pharmacy.</p>
<p>Sometimes the real pharmacist is at lunch or not there and the technicians can't open the super secure cabinet to give me my meds so again I have to wait or come back. </p>
<p>It also doesn't help that I have to see my psychiatrist every single month to get a prescription since it can't be refilled. I've had some doctors that have written me post dated prescriptions but this guy doesn't and he gets a $50 copay every single month. I couldn't afford to abuse this stuff.</p>
<p>The best is when he half-asses it though and writes half my prescription and has his assistant fill out the menial stuff like my name and birth date and when when I get to the pharmacy they hassle me about how there's how there are two different sets handwriting with different pens - like I had anything to do with that. </p>
<p>I mean, I understand that this is a controlled substance so people gotta jump through hoops to get it but does anyone understand that the whole reason I take medication is because I have suffer a huge amount of difficulty jumping through hoops? Filling my medication is the most difficult thing I do on a monthly basis - there is literally nothing I can do to make it easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Switch psychiatrists if you can, and work on building a rapport with your pharmacy/pharmacist. If it's a bigger pharmacy, they're going to probably have a hard time remembering you, so it may be beneficial to switch to a smaller location</p>
<p>Don't try to fill early, because techs and pharmacists remember problem patients the most, but consider bringing your script in 2 business days early, and tell the staff that you know it's too early, but you just want to make sure there's enough to fill the script on the day it's due.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a tech in a pharmacy and also have ADHD, which I take medication for. The amount of schedule 2 (i.e., narcotics and stimulants) is extremely controlled by the board of pharmacy and the DEA. Legally there is only so much that a pharmacy can even order, and it’s usually based on ‘demand’ so to speak. It’s frustrating for both sides, especially because unless you work within the pharmacy structure you don’t have access to that type of information. But it’s not meant to be hassling and annoying, the pharmacy itself is restricted to how much can be ordered at all. The pharmacist is also legally required and responsible for restricting access to the narc safe at all times. Even if another pharmacist or a tech somehow gets into the safe and messes something up they are held responsible for whatever the mistake is, both within their position and with the law. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less the insurance and more the pharmacy. Pharmacists have corresponding responsibility with the prescriber that a patient is being prescribed a controlled substance for a valid therapeutic reason and they are not over/misusing it. Technically, even if the insurance did not pay for a prescription because it was too soon a pharmacy could fill it without the insurance. Just about every pharmacist would never allow that because there are few valid reasons for you to need an early fill on your controlled substance, however. Even if you do have a valid reason, pharmacists will often need to confer with the prescriber just to make sure everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>If you think about it, someone who fills their script for say Adderall every 27-28 days will have two to three extra tablets/capsules of their prescription every month. By the end of the year, this adds up to an entire additional prescription's worth of medication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I don't disagree with anything you said. Problem with the extra pills thing is that people with ADHD are prone to losing things..... I also tend to keep 2-3 in every backpack, in the center console of my car, etc. in case of emergencies (like I end up last minute staying at a friends). I know Ive also put off even getting a refill because i still had some pills left in the bottle despite it being well over a month (weekend without taking or drug holidays). But yes you are correct we <em>should</em> have extra, but that doesn't happen as often as you'd think. </p></div>		</li>
