			<div class="markdown"><p>Red LEDs are really easy to manufacture. Yellow and Green is a bit trickier.</p>
<p>But blue is really really hard and it took a really long time before they were even able to make them at all. And when they did it was a much more expensive process at first and just recently have we been able to really get costs down for that.</p>
<p>The white light we get is a mix from all the colors and we need blue to get white light.</p>
<p>The reason why red is so easy and blue is so hard is that red is a lower energy state and blue light is a higher energy state.</p>
<p>Take a metal rod for example, if you start heating it up it starts to get warm and radiate infrared light. Then it gets hotter you get a red light. And as you keep heating it up it gets more and more white as more colors are mixed in as there is more and more energy in it.</p>
<p>Now LEDs work similarly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really bad example here using black body radiation to describe the colors mixing.  Incandescent bulbs are best described this way, modern white LEDs are not a mix of RGB, they are in fact blue LEDs with a phosphor coating.  This is similar to how fluorescent bulbs work as they produce ultraviolet light which converts to white via phosphors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My biggest complaint with LEDs is how poorly they mimic &quot;black body radiation&quot; and you're using that as an example which doesn't exactly match that.</p>

They run on low power, they are bright, and they have already captured a big part of the market. LEDs were more expensive, but also didn't offer much more than the traditional power saving bulbs. They needed time to be developed further and become a competitive technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>7 years was what was advertised here for CFL life.</p>
<p>I got 2-3 out of them.   Then there's the buzz from the ballast to contend with.  Also, warmup time for them to get bright.    Don't put them in a garage door opener or anything where you'd run them for less than a few minutes at a time.  That wears them out even quicker.</p>
<p>I see them more as a stop gap tech between incandescent and properly bright enough and decently coloured LEDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CFLs definitely were cheaper, but CFLs have a lot of downsides LEDs do not. </p>
<p>CFLs have dramatically lower lifespans if they're rapidly cycled on an off. In a place like a hallway or bathroom or closet or garage where a light may often be on for only 15-30 seconds, CFLs may last for less time than an old incandescent bulb and effectively require more energy to provide the same light once you count the manufacturing energy requirements. LEDs don't show nearly as dramatic loss of life from rapid-on-off cycles.</p>
<p>The light quality for any run of the mill CFL bulb is also inferior compared to LEDs and incandescents. They do not provide immediate light and take a while to power one and reach their full brightness. The cheaper bulbs have a very poor blueish light. LEDs in contrast provide instant high-quality light that exceeds incandescent. You can get them in whatever color you want.</p>
<p>CFLs also have a lot of mercury. Nothing for a typical home user to be worried about as long as they don't break or eat the bulbs, but if we're thinking about the net environmental consequences of manufacturing and disposing a lot of them, it is a big deal.</p>
<p>Thankfully decent LEDs have fallen drastically. Better light, less energy and a longer lifespan? Sign me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost: LED's are better but costly to produce. That's now coming down with economies of scale and greater drive towards reducing energy consumption, but it was slow to happen. It was particularly slow with &quot;bright&quot; LEDs... that's why LED's have been fairly common as small indicator lights on TV's etc for a long time, but have only recently started to be used as bulbs etc.</p></div>		</li>
