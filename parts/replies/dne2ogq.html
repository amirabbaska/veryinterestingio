			<div class="markdown"><p>How does it compare in difficulty to teaching AI to stereotype in the first place? To see a flat surface with four legs and assume, &quot;chair&quot; or &quot;chair-like&quot;? And to recognize that these features sometimes overlap with multiple categories of objects and that sometimes you can use a chair as a table or a stepping stool?</p>
<p>I'm supposed to be starting classes on machine learning within the year and frankly the entire field seems like the most daunting task humanity has ever undertaken because of how blurry but precise everything about our cognition is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;This issue is a major concern for AI studies...&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah - philosophers have kinda been working on this for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Maybe Philosophy just needs to be re-branded as &quot;Intelligence Studies&quot; or something. Or &quot;Intelligence Science&quot;. Oh yeah, that'd be cool. Instead of saying &quot;I'm a Philosopher&quot; and getting laughed at, I could say &quot;I'm an Intelligence Scientist&quot;. Yes.... that has a nice ring to it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems as though you haven't heard of cognitive science, which is an interdisciplinary field that includes both philosophy and artificial intelligence, as well as psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, and anthropology. While it is true that philosophers have been working on these kinds of problems forever, it is only recently that they have been incorporating empirical science.</p>
<p>Our philosophy department is very cognitive science oriented. About 1/3 of the faculty in our department are part of the Neuroscience Institute at our university. I think one professor also holds joint appointments with the philosophy and psychology departments.</p>
<p>All that is too say, I usually tell people I study cognitive science, and don't mention the philosophy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I'm well aware of CogSci, but it is a branch of philosophy (and the other disciplines you mention) and I'm talking about rebranding philosophy as a whole. This might help remind even those philosophers who are into CogSci, etc, to reevaluate their dismissiveness of broader philosophy as being &quot;intelligence studies&quot;.</p>
<p>And in response to this: &quot;While it is true that philosophers have been working on these kinds of problems forever, it is only recently that they have been incorporating empirical science.&quot; - I would gently remind you that philosophy is the base and origin of the &quot;hard&quot; sciences and so your statement is misleading at best.</p></div>		</li>
