			<p>and yet 99% of high school students are told that they should go to college/university.  LOL NO.  That's supposed to be for exceptional (or rich) individuals.<br><br>I graduated HS in 1994, and from year 9 to 12 the &quot;Dumb&quot; kids in class were sent to vocational school to learn autobody and machine shop work.  Jobs that now easily pay $25-35/hr and can support a small household, and triple that if they start their own operations/small businesses.<br><br>The &quot;smarter&quot; kids who were pushed to college to presumably enter the white collar workforce?  Maybe 5% of them go on to white collar jobs.  If they don't, they're WAY behind the ones who learned to practice a real trade.<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I disagree. Employers expect five year experience for entry level.  Five years is not entry level. Period. Employers also do not want to train people, they want those people to be all ready to go before they step in the door. </p>		</li>

			<p>I agree with you.  As a young guy who is just starting out.  However I have so much student loan debt.  My wife can't find a job with her masters degree in something that matters.  I need more money just to afford to do things.  So I see why my generation is asking for more and wanting to move up, because moving up means more money.  <br><br>And since every raise is based on %, the old and rich people make more and more every year but the younger and poorer people make less and less.  Does a % based raise really make sense when your company is trying to cut down on costs?  When a 5% raise to an older worker may equate to a 25% raise to a younger worker?  In the end, to a company, its about the money it has and the money it makes.  The % doesn't really matter except for people with the crazy idea of growing forever.<br><br>Nothing like graduating college and still living like you are in college for another 10 years, minus all the fun.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do you have student loans?  Are you married with someone with student loans who can't find a job even though they have their masters in social work from a top school in the nation?  <br><br>No...<br><br>Ok then.  Talk when that happens.  I have an electrical engineering degree and work for a great company.  But since the SO can't find a job because of the market I have to work in, it doesn't matter.  <br><br>The sooner you realize that you are lucky you like something that pays well, the less of an asshole you will appear to others.<br><br>Plus you were able to live with your parents.  During school, my wife and I were not afforded that luxury even when we were single.  Appreciate how lucky you actually are.  If I could live at home for just one year to save up money, I would in a heartbeat.</p>		</li>

			<p>That was actually the whole point behind my post; there was no need to get this defensive; I wasn't gloating but merely sympathizing on how things can be different depending on circumstance.I didnt chose to like something that pays well; I made sure to make a career out of something that will pay me well.I was originally planning to complete an elementary education degree but the prospect at the end were terrible so I did not continue.</p>		</li>
