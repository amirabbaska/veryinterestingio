<p>because we don't find e.g. <em>ph₂-, </em>méh₂-, <em>bʰréh₂-, and </em>dʰugh₂- as separate morphemes,</p>

<p>That's exactly what made me wonder about this. (I just didn't know the particular PIE corpus).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would seem -ster  used to be the feminine version of -er. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>-ster
Old English -istre, from Proto-Germanic *-istrijon, feminine agent suffix used as the equivalent of masculine -ere (see -er (1)). Also used in Middle English to form nouns of action (meaning &quot;a person who ...&quot;) without regard for gender. </p>
<p>The genderless agent noun use apparently was a broader application of the original feminine suffix, beginning in the north of England, but linguists disagree over whether this indicates female domination of weaving and baking trades, as represented in surnames such as Webster, Baxter, Brewster, etc. (though spinster probably carries an originally female ending). Also whitester &quot;one who bleaches cloth;&quot; kempster (c. 1400; Halliwell has it as kembster) &quot;woman who cleans wool.&quot; In Modern English, the suffix has been productive in forming derivative nouns (gamester, punster, etc.).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Dutch, -ster is still used as a feminine suffix. For instance &quot;medewerker&quot;, literally &quot;coworker&quot; but it kind of means &quot;employee,&quot; might be a male form, and &quot;medewerkster&quot; the female form.</p>
<p>This is an interesting example, because it seems Dutch society is slowly but steadily moving toward gender-neutral words. An ad might ask for a &quot;medewerker (m/v)&quot; or just &quot;medewerker&quot;, and assume people understand any gender is welcome to apply.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about this trend in Belgium, they speak Dutch down there too but in a slightly different way, also it's another country, so any trends may be different.</p></div>		</li>
