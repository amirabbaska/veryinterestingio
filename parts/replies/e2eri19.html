			<div class="markdown"><p>Everywhere. The MRI scan for one body part costs between 140€ and 350€, if you take several angles it's easily 600€+.
Doing a full body scan would be exponentially more expensive and probably not be covered by insurance due to lack of solid evidence for the need of the scan.
CT is about the same, but you have exposure to radiation which is always something you want to avoid.</p></div>		</li>
