<p>Indeed, a synovial joint (cartilage + synovial fluid) is possibly the most frictionless material we know of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So will we see cartilage-build mechanical parts before we see mechanically-build human joints?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I think the goal would be a mechanically built prosthetic that mimics the properties of a cartilaginous joint.  Cartilage is a living tissue that needs nutrients to survive; I wouldn't know of a way to maintain it outside of a biologic system.  The problem is that true hyaline cartilage within joints does not regenerate, but when damaged is replaced with fibrocartilage. </p>
<p>I've read very briefly about attempts to place grafts into joints (following debridement) of morselized articular cartilage and cancellous bone to try to promote formation of articular-like cartilage rather than fibrocartilage, but I'm unsure if it's proved effective or if that's used at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>really? is there a source for this?<br />
It would be really cool to see the data between human joint system vs something man made, WD40 maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two major difficulties with cartilage design are material and mechanical constraints. An ideal cartilage prosthetic must mimic the compression, tensile, and shear forces of the original in order to function properly. Attachment sites are a major consideration in these prosthetic designs. For example, spinal disc replacements must be designed using bone screws to fixate to the discs above and below it. Knee replacements need porous material like high compression ceramics to bond well. While metal prosthetics are very strong they also carry the risk of metal poisoning. Biocompatibility, mechanical function, durability, material properties, and cost all factor into the engineering of prosthetics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does it have to be that precise though? If the compression (for example) isn't exact, wouldn't that mean that you need to exert more (or less) force to bend your back? If that's true, how much of a problem would that be?</p>
<p>Wouldn't this be a good time to experiment with different values to try and improve, instead of mimic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes otherwise it would just break when in the body and then you have the complication of a broken bit of cartilage rolling around in a joint doing even more damage.</p>
<p>It's not a matter of bending it's a matter of bwing able to withstand the mechanical stress of the human weight, something even more important in overweight patients</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body's rejection of foreign objects is the biggest problem in this field. This is one of the things that Synthetic Genomics and United Therapeutics are collaborating on by trying to grow DNA matching tissue (in this case lungs) in a pig. This way, when the tissue is placed into your body, it won't be rejected.
ELI5:  They are trying to get pigs to grow an exact copy of your lung. Then the lung gets put in you. Your body is cool with it and you don't have to take pills for the rest of your life. </p></div>		</li>
