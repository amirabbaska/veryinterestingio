			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine's normally around 97.6.  It's nice to hear you say that, since I'm that way too.  I wasn't sure if I was just a whiner or if I really did feel feverish at 99.0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I currently have flu and had to get the duty GP to actually look at my record when she phoned me (to triage) on day 2, because &quot;38.2 isn't that high&quot;. Er, for me it's <em>raging</em> fever with hallucinations. (And the official NHS guidelines say 38.3 is high so ner.) I run at 36.1 or so usually. </p></div>		</li>
