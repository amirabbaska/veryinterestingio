			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's exactly it!  Also, human physiology enables (in our native environment of eastern Africa) endurance hunting, one of the most successful hunting methods in the animal kingdom.  We chase something for hours, pacing ourselves against animals that can outrun us, but not for as long as we can chase.  Eventually they collapse from exhaustion and our ancestors have food for a week.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;the habit of eating cooked rather than raw food permitted the digestive tract to shrink and the human brain to grow&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breaking down complex molecules like proteins or fats is a difficult and fairly inefficient process, because it takes so much energy to do so. To help us get the most energy out of food, and put the least energy into digestion, we break down many of those molecules with heat. By effectively jump-starting the digestion process before taking the first bite, we can get more energy out of the same amount of food, because it is easier to digest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've heard about proteins being denatured by heat and causing them to be less helpful(?) to eat. Is this not true? Does heating only help break them down for digestion, or is there some kind of middle ground? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure what you’re what’ing. The process of digestion uses energy to break down food for its resources, with a net gain of course. Cooked food is easier to digest so it takes less energy, and so it has a larger net gain.</p></div>		</li>
