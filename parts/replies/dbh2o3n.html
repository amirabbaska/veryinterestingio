			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAP but I believe creation of matter involves the creation of equal and opposite antimatter, so there shouldn't be an asymmetry. I've heard it said that antimatter decays more rapidly, so some small amount decayed before annihilating with matter. Leaving the relatively small amount of matter that we observe.</p>
<p>Don't know if any of that is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the initial amount of matter plus antimatter because we can still see the energy released when most of it annihilated. The total asymmetry has to be larger than the effects we found so far in the lab.</p></div>		</li>
