<p>And if you think about it, we do use it; we avoid poop and moldy/foul smelling rotten foods. We just don't really think about it so much.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays we have expiration dates on stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be able to tell who was home based off smell when I was really young(7 or 8 was the last time I can remember consciously doing it).  Both my parents smoked(dad regular, mom menthols) so they were really easy to smell, and my aunt who lived with us had a really distinct smell(almost a blueberry smell).  </p>
<p>I can remember waking up on Saturday morning and deciding if I should go out to the living room based on the smell.  If it was just mom and my aunt I would stay in my room because they would control the TV.  If my dad was home I could get a share of TV time and he would cook breakfast so I would go out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm somewhat face blind and tend to get confused by different clothes and haircuts. I wonder if this sometimes happens to the olfactory sense of animals too or if animals with that variation don't get the chance to procreate, for example because they die in unfortunate accidents or are too socially awkward to find a mate.</p></div>		</li>
