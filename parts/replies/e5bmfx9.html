			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they could jump off... I mean, you'd need a lot of astronauts to make an appreciable difference, but it'd work, no?</p>
<p>Or a slightly less dark scenario, they could jump off and jet back on...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The total angular momentum of the systen always stays constant. It's newtons third law but for angular momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;In a closed system, no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque. Hence, angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved).&quot;</p>
<p>You can change the angular momentum of certain parts of the system though.</p>
<p>Edit: I have problems too though to imagine how you are supposed to spin the station with a treadmill if momentum is supposed to stay conserved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the total angular momentum is fixed, if the belt of the treadmill starts rotating 'clockwise' on some plane, then inevitably the rest of the station will rotate counterclockwise on the same plane (though quite slowly - the mass of the rotating treadmill parts is much, much less than the mass of the station).</p>
<p>Assuming that the station isn't rotating in the beginning, if you spend an hour on the treadmill and stop, then the station will stop rotating again, but during your run it will have been slowly rotating, so it will be in a slightly different orientation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A different orientation could lead to a larger cross section of the station.</p>
<p>The effect of humans on the orientation is completely negligible, however. The ISS orientation is unstable on its own and needs gyroscopes to stay as it is anyway.</p>
<p>Edited for clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS does in fact experience a very small amount of atmospheric drag that causes its orbit to drop, so it requires a boost periodically. It loses about 90 meters of altitude a day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is most definitely not negligible (at least on a long timeframe, like say, a month). In fact they were able to save a pretty hefty amount of propellant when they started putting the space station into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Glider_mode" target="_blank">&quot;night glider&quot; mode</a>, where they moved the solar panels (such that they were parallel to the ground) when not in sunlight. The solar panels have a huge area, which caused a lot of the drag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect of orientation on drag is not negligible. The solar panels are feathered into the apparent wind while on the night side to reduce drag. This saves about 1000 kg of propellant per year, that's significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting fact:</p>
<p>The ISS needs to be boosted around once a month, as even the thin atmosphere decays the orbit. Without the boosting, it would fall into the atmosphere and burn up.</p>
<p>The ISS used to be around 350km up in order to be low enough so the space shuttle could reach it. As they have since been retired, the altitude has been increased to 415km. This decreases the frequency and amount of boosting required to keep the ISS in orbit.</p>
<p>I believe the Progress module now provides this boosting functionality now that the shuttles are gone.</p>
<p>The ISS also used to change inclination to make it easier for the shuttle to launch at more convenient times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, since nothing is leaving the system of the station the momentum is conserved and the center of mass will remain on an inertial path.</p>
<p>Similarly someone floating in space would only easily be able to alter their trajectory by throwing something (like a baseball) or by venting gas (like spacecraft maneuvering jets).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Attaching and detaching modules like a Soyuz or Dragon affects the mass part of the momentum equation though by a non insignificant amount. I wonder if they just balance it by the amount of attaches and detaches balances out and don't use too much fuel to adjust for each one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if crew members start to run around in circles they act like a giant gyro. Which, as we know, are capable of rotating spacecraft. Of course as soon as they stop running everything is fine again.</p></div>		</li>
