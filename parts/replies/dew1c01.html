			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the city has known the condition of the river for a very long time and knew there were business, etc getting water from it and did nothing. Either using the river for drinking water should've been verboten long ago, or they should have started treating/cleaning it long ago.
It's been a powder keg since long before they failed to treat it properly <em>after</em> they decided to start pulling city drinking water from it.</p>
<p>That decision shouldn't have been made in the first place, but to me the larger problem is that we had a poisoned river flowing through our city longer than I've been alive and no one has ever done anything about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing your story. It's pretty awful to think that people had to grow up and live in those conditions.</p>
<p>It's also very telling that we are able to tell ourselves that we've solved our pollution crisis when problems like these not only existed, but have in fact never gone away.</p></div>		</li>
