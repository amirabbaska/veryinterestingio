			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, you got my time beat by a mile. Did you find a good place to land or just endure the best you could? I finally said fuck it and got out when I got laid off so the owners daughter with no experience could work off the cost of totaling her 75 grand car.</p>
<p>I was getting paid too much and it upset his sensibilities I guess. The labour board told me there's no such thing as seniority when getting laid off if you're not unionized, just that they had to give me a chance to come back before hiring someone else. Like I wouldn't have another job by then?</p>
<p>So used my cooking experience to move into baking and never looked back. Still damn hard work, but much less stress comparatively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, cooking is the only profitable skill I have and I've been too lazy to make the leap into a new career. I finally started making moves to get out of the industry (drivers license, degree, etc) I'm 36.
Don't be lazy kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your last line before I left the company I was a Service Trainer for we had a total of 6 grill operators in 3 years. Two quit, one due to a cocaine addiction and the other for heroin. I only ever saw a grill op quit once but one guy worked duper overtime... Found out he had a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>You are so right the stress is high, I did fill in (since I was trained) for one hour and I'd rather not grill commercially ever again.</p></div>		</li>
