			<div class="markdown"><p>Having grown up with Quarter Horses all my life (49 yrs), I very much agree with miosgoldenchance's #3 answer as the primary reason. Horses are squirrely animals, and while they are beautiful animals, they seem hell-bent on killing themselves in any way possible. They will find a sharp edge on a perfectly flat wall and slice themselves open, they'll paw and tear a feeder off a wall and somehow break a leg or cut themselves with it, or they'll spaz out and rear-up putting a ton of weight on whatever is behind them, usually ending up on their back and breaking something in the process. It the reason that we always had wood-rail fences for our animals... Wood rails will give-way before an animal gets injured significantly, although we did have an animal impale himself on a wood fence post once.
So given a significant leg fracture, a horse's innate behavior prevents it from keeping its weight off that leg which prevents the break from healing. The horse will constantly attempt to use the leg, never giving it a chance to heal. Contrast this with a miniature Sicilian Donkey which will happily limp around with a leg cast for a couple of months allowing it to heal, and even let you remove and replace the cast to doctor the injury during the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep... they're just nuts lol. I once saw a horse at a show try to climb out of his stall because he hadn't been turned out for a couple of days, it took hours to get him out.</p>
<p>One of my professors was talking to us the other day about head injuries and said a common thing he's seen is a horse getting its head stuck in a round bale feeder meant for cattle. A cow will just say &quot;oh shoot I'm stuck better wait for the human to come around&quot; while a horse will go &quot;oh my god oh my god it would be better to rip my head off than be stuck here for a second later oh god&quot; and will end up taking half his face off, getting a hoof stuck somewhere and then colicking. They're silly things... I learned recently that their heads are seriously like 70% air.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nothing is more true than this. Semi-related anecdote: my mare colicked one day, worse than I'd ever seen in a horse in 20 years. Throwing herself down, having seizures, everything. I was convinced I was watching her die. 2 minutes before the vet shows up, she shakes her head, stands up, and looks at me like &quot;what the fuck is your problem?&quot; And walks off like nothing ever happened. The vet said they call that a &quot;fart stuck sideways&quot;.  That mare has taken so many years off my life :/</p></div>		</li>

<p>Horse was fine in 10 mins and we still went on the ride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my professors in college described a gelding that she thought was going to die colicking. Heart and respiration rates through the roofs, sweating all over, white gums, the whole nine yards. Horse gets trailered to the vet school at the University and &quot;farts himself healthy&quot; (her words) on the way, and arrives at the vet school fine as could be. </p>
<p>Colic is a weird thing. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have owned 30+ horses in my lifetime and worked/trained many more. I never had a case of colic in ANY of them.  I think, like people, some are more prone to certain issues than others.. So I disagree that ALL horses colic easily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was hyperbole. In 30+ years in horses and across a dozen barns (from high end H/J to woo woo natural horsemanship) I've seen less than 10 colics out of the hundreds of head I've worked with/cared for. The homicide/suicide is more spot on. I just happen to have one of those horses who likes trouble and disaster more than others, and she has been managed damn near impeccably her whole life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya I have to agree, worked at a barn, riding for decades, have known hundreds of horses, only one or two colics and many of them lived long healthy lives not injuring themselves and still being ridden and worked well into their twenties. I think there must be somewhere that breeds and raises horses with brain damage and they're all on Reddit posting about it. Also, most horses can be trained without 'blinkers' to be pretty unflappable, look at police or riot horses for a contemporary example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A poster from the something awful forums put it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I personally guarantee you a dog will never in this life hear a bee then have a heart attack out of fear, dying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know about anyone else, but I know for a fact that horses are stupider than shit and WILL kill themselves if you don’t take an absurd amount of precautions and adorn them in the right silly accessories so that they don’t scare themselves and fall over dead, and even then at best you can reduce the chances that they will do that, but they’re still absolutely going to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With horses, there is no such thing as a natural death at any point in existence: they’ve strictly only died from stupid shit. Saw water and passed away</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As someone who grew up with a couple friends into horses and fucking dressage I can say that if anything you are being way too easy going on them. Its like their survival strategy is to break their legs or kill them selves at the slightest sign of danger, or a noise, or a change in humidity.</p>
<p>My friends barn had to install a big fence because they were next to a turkey farm and despite the horses seeing these birds every single fucking day, any time you’d ride past them most of the horses would briefly flip out and hurt them selves or throw their rider when the turkeys came into view. You could literally ride in a loop for an hour and every single time the horse would “scare” at the turkeys.</p>
<p>Maybe wilder horses are smarter but dressage horses are more fragile and stupid than a baby that just learned to crawl. They will jump onto fences and cut them selves in half, they will get stuck between buildings, they will randomly for no reason at all break their legs. If there is a way to kill or hurt them selves they will find it. And people drop 50k or more on these idiots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Babies grow up and that’s okay, it’s like, sometimes a great meal is worth a lot of prep, for example. Horses only get more likely to die from a stupid reason as they get older. Oh poor ol’ Freckles, thought of ants and died</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't leave any kind of equipment out in a field with the horses because they <em>will</em>, somehow tangle themselves up in it in ways you didn't think physically possible.  </p>
<p>They're like magnetically attracted to stationary combines... </p>
<p>The worst I personally saw was a horse that ran over a large stick and disemboweled itself (and survived), and a horse that ran head long into a bush for no reason and put an eye out (never found the eye), then coliced while we were treating the eye (and also survived).  </p>
<p>But lots and lots of leg cuts from &quot;Oh, there's a sharp thing, I'm going to go walk across a 5 acre field and randomly run into it because there is literally no where else I can possibly stand.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much! Once did lessons long term with a retired racer (he was about 12 so he'd been gelded out of the racing scene for a while) and while he was fairly mellow, still the jumpiest horse I ever spent time with. And athletic as fuck. He once jumped a five-foot fence from an upright standing position.</p>
<p>Sadly I never went to show with him. I loved that horse. Prettiest chestnut color, too. Miss you, Joey, ya big pup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. If somebody lets loose a wet fart at ringside, a horse will spook. If the wind blows a toy around a little too much, horses will spook. If someone starts their car, a horse will spook. </p>
<p>It makes sense when you look at it from a evolutionary perspective. We've never really been able to breed their strong prey instincts out of them. Which is why you should never not wear a helmet when riding them. </p></div>		</li>
