			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that the limitations of current <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~gf/Research/Volumetric%20UI/3-D%20Displays%20A%20review%20of%20current%20technologies.htm" target="_blank">volumetric displays</a> mean that at this time, reproducing the &quot;help us Obi Wan Kenobi, you're our only hope&quot; scene from Star Wars is still a pipe dream.</p>
<p>We can make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoWi10YVmfE" target="_blank">tiny dots of plasma in air</a>, and scale them up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfVS-npfVuY" target="_blank">large noisy dots</a> (and be sure to listen for the annoying, insect-like whine). The hurdles for moving this beyond flashy, noisy dots include complexity -- multiple projectors/beams/mirrors would be required to project more voxels, and plasma impurities -- how do we create colors within the plasma.</p>
<p>Of course, for fairy lights, the intensity of the laser is highly controlled by using incredibly brief flashes of laser light. The images can be touched. On the other hand, with the larger display I linked to, the beam intensity required means you would emerge from your holodeck badly burned. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation in the video at your link is superb, especially beginning at <a href="https://youtu.be/1aAx2uWcENc?t=32" target="_blank">0:32</a>.  To add to what you've already said, their lasers actually <em>drag</em> the dust to where it needs to be in order to reflect the <em>right</em> light off said dust and into your eye.</p></div>		</li>
