			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The solar system could pass through a molecular cloud and while there would be some increase in the local particle density in the inner solar system, it certainly wouldn't be enough to cause practical problems like the earth heating up or the Sun's light being blocked from reaching us. It would make astronomers' lives much more difficult, because of the serious blocking of light from outside the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, even if it was a million times more opaque we would be fine - the dimming effect with regular interstellar gas/dust is still small enough to hardly effect light coming from many stars, even ones millions of times farther from us than the Sun is. Even in the densest of nebulae you can still see through tens of billions of kilometers of space - the reason many are opaque is because they are several light years thick (one light year is about nine trillion kilometers or five trillion miles if I remember correctly).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to put that into units that are more relevant to blocking our sun's sunlight as seen from Earth, 10 billion kilometers is about 67 AU (i.e. 67 times farther than the average distance between the Earth and the sun), which is 69% farther than the distance from the sun to Pluto. One light year is about 63,000 AU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read that the density of a typical nebula is about 1kg of mass per Earth volume. </p>
<p>Put it another way, the orion nebula is fuckin huge, like billions of miles wide, or several light years across. 24 according to wikipedia. But you can still see stars thro it, from 1500 or so light years away. </p>
<p>Now in Scotland you cant even see the Sun from 8 light minutes away most days. The clouds above Scotland are a few miles thick at most, and they are dense enough to block out the sun, yet you can still fly a plane thro them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that even asteroid belts are no where near as dense as they are <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-media.venngage.com/256093-4960e0a49ea6ca26613f473f9ceff0ff.jpg" target="_blank">depicted in movies</a>. In reality, individual asteroids are so far part from each other that it's hard to picture it as a belt while standing on any single one. </p>
<p>Is this true? How far apart are asteroids?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The average separation of asteroids kilometer-sized or larger is on the order of a million kilometers. Standing on one, you most likely couldn't see another without a telescope. On the nightside, possibly, if you know where to look. Smaller rocks, dust grains, etc. are more populous but still, when sending spacecraft through the Marsâ€“Jupiter asteroid belt you generally don't need to worry that they hit anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you call asteroids. If you went to a random location in the belt, there probably wouldn't be any rocks more than a foot in size within a few thousand miles of you. If it was anywhere near that dense, we wouldn't be able to send spacecraft like Voyager 1 and 2 through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you can get an asteroid belt with the density of a planetary ring.  Would have to be much closer in, obviously.</p></div>		</li>
