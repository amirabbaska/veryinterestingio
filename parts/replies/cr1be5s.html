			<div class="markdown"><p>ok so I think what you said helped me understand Veritasium's &quot;balancing a stick&quot; analogy. If the stick is perfectly straight up it won't fall over. In the same way if the object was spun perfectly it wouldn't have this effect. </p>
<p>The intermediate axis is unstable (like a stick being balanced) so if there is any additional spin in another axis it will loose it's &quot;balance&quot; which causes this effect. And in the real world this is almost always the case.</p></div>		</li>
