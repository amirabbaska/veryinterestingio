<p>Nintendo and Apple and the like use obscure screws to make their products as unservicable as possible.</p>
<p>Also don't use a Phillips head on a Toyota, it looks the same but it's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've really only seen the security screws in bathroom stalls.</p>
<p>My question is, who the hell is going around stealing bathroom-stall doors?  How is this such a large problem that we're putting security screws on them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably a bigger problem than you think, one you don't notice because it's standard to use security bits.</p>
<p>Hell, in elementary school I sort of did it. Our bathroom stalls were just plywood screwed together with cheap hardware store hinges. One day, I noticed a key could turn the screws. Over the course of a few days I carefully loosened them enough that the door was just barely hanging on. Then, later in the day, someone flung it open, it flew off the hinges, and they got in trouble for &quot;purposefully destroying the door&quot;. Slam dunk prank in terms of elementary kid logic. </p>
<p>Now I'm thinking of how many vandals probably roll through rest stops, and how &quot;hilarious&quot; it'd be if someone took the doors off all the handicapped stalls for a 20-mile stretch of road. So I'm pretty glad it's tough to get the screws back off.</p></div>		</li>
