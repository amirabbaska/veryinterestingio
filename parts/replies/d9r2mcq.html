<p>At sunset, our eyes are daylight adapted and may even be a bit weary from the day's toil</p>

<p>Isn't this proven to be completely false by a camera? I can pull out my phone and take a photo like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ww4aW72.jpg" target="_blank">this (unedited) photo I took the other day</a> and the lighting was captured exactly as I saw it. </p>
<p>Without me saying the time or you knowing the location this was taken, can you tell whether this was sunrise or sunset based on the color alone? </p>
<p>I feel like I can, but that could just be my bias from knowing the context of the photo. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This could be a neat subreddit. Take OC images of Sunrises and Sunsets and post them up for debate without any context. Let the commentors hash it out for a bit and see what the most guessed or well-backed up responses are to the time of the image. Then have the OP reveal the actual time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit:  I've now looked through comments and see it was taken at sunset.</p>
<p>Very interesting.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that Sunrise has gotten so many guesses. To me it looks like a Sunset through and through but that is because I was there and took the photo, so I have a memory attached to it. There could actually be some legitimacy to this though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think sunrise. The darker sky at the top is lighter than I would expect from a sunrise, and it's hunting season, so an early photo makes more sense than a later one. Also, it feels more like the sunrise photos I've taken. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting, both you and /u/Nickosaurus_Rex had a similar idea but it is actually Sunset. There could be some truth to the statement above. </p>
<p>This was taken at 6:27 PM on Oct 22nd in Southeast North Carolina, right on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway looking Southeast. This was the beginning of a late night fishing trip, pretty close to peak low tide I believe. Didn't catch anything, but sitting on the bank through this sunset was worth the time.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;When viewed from all latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north latitude), the sun always rises at an angle up and to the right, and sets and an angle down and to the right,&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if this screws with the sense of direction of anyone visiting the southern hemisphere for the first time. I'm so used to the sun generally being south of me. Imagining it traveling left across the sky is nuts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely screws with your sense of direction, at least it did for me when I lived in both New Zealand and Australia.  It was tough having to consciously remember where north was and that it was opposite where I subconsciously thought it should be. </p></div>		</li>
