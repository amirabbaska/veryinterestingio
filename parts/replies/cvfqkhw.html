			<div class="markdown"><p>Your student number is what professors are <strong>supposed</strong> to use when reporting grades, especially when posting them publicly.</p>
<p>The idea is that while your SSN can be useful for many things, your student ID is relatively useless, but it is still a unique identifier without giving away any information about you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends, could people other than those taking the class view it and/or is your school dumb enough to use SS# as part of StuID#?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently in that position too. Cannot tell you how many times i've had parents call about passwords. I've wanted to yell &quot;FERPA&quot; into the phone on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>However, we have a rather nice system where we have them answer the question &quot;What is your challenge secret?&quot;, which they set up when they first set up their account. THEN we require them to put in their last name, DOB, and last 5 of their social into a form online. Double layer of security baby!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just for fun, try calling up your company's help desk and saying you forgot your password and need it reset. If they don't have some reasonably foolproof way of authenticating you, then your company has no IT security.</p>

<p>Curious what the general opinion is on these &quot;what's your mother's name&quot; questions. I think they probably raise the security risk - since I'm forced to use them on various places. It seems like a bad second password that is allowed to override the secure normal password. I'm no security expert though - just never understood the idea behind these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hate those. Particularly when there's few choices. Those are worthless, since everyone you've ever met, is going to know the answers. They provide zero security, and can often make your security worse. Same goes for short passwords. Some places limit it to as few as 12. But I almost always use 20-30 characters. Great, now I have to truncate one of my password schemes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My mother uses her maiden name, <em>not</em> her married name, and that trend is only increasing (or people aren't changing their names when they get married at all). If there's several questions I can choose from, I never choose it. If it's the only one? Well... that's not going to be the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works in IT with a company of 400 or so, most of our repeat offenders at needing password resets are people we recognize their voice. Between their voice and their phone extension, we are responsibly certain (and that's the verbiage audits use) we know who you are. </p>
<p>That being said, we do have a system in place to confirm when people call in from outside lines and that we make new IT people use until they recognize people. We also have a system in place for when we cold call a person about a password issue so they can verify who we are. However, we just got done with having a company come in to hack us and test our security and they were able to hack us because of people in our company not following the procedures and actively giving out their passwords when the company called posing as IT. So...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>federal employee here.  left my ID card at home (that has a chip i use with a pin to login).  Called national help desk to have the PC and my account unlocked.  so that i could login with a user ID and password (vs pin with ID chip).  they did so without any validation.  </p>
<p>i've called maybe once in the last 6 years for a reset and maybe 2-3 emails for other issues.  doubt in an agency of 27000 a helpdesk can identify people by voice and i'm sure if they didn't ask me any questions, they don't ask anyone.  they wouldn't have access to our HR files and we've never submitted security questions to them.</p></div>		</li>
