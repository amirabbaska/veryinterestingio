			<div class="markdown"><p>To be specific, it is because the chemistry that depletes the ozone occurs on the surfaces of tiny ice crystals that only form in high enough concentrations at the altitude of the ozone layer during the late winter and early spring at the center of the polar vortex. In areas outside the center of the vortex the ice crystal are dispersed by the winds of the vortex, but in the center of the gyre, they tend to concentrate and form clouds. The ice crystals serve as a base on which <del>hydrofluorocarbon</del> Chlorofluorocarbon compounds condense and begin acting as a catalyst for the ozone depletion reaction. In effect, it forms a giant catalytic converter hundreds of miles wide, chewing up all the ozone that comes near it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like the above was not completely accurate. The chemicals condense on the polar ice clouds, but are not active until they are activate by the return of sunlight in the late winter/early spring. The clouds act as traps, gathering the chemicals into high concentrations. Then, when the sun strikes the cloud, they are all photochemically activated and released into the atmosphere in a large pulse that catalytically reacts with ozone, although at that point, no longer on the surface of the ice crystals </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there something we could replace that with, to promote ozone creation/recovery?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So yes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm at McMurdo station right now anxiously awaiting the nacreous clouds to arrive. From my understanding, the hole forms in the spring, peaking out around the equinox and then redistributes throughout the year to a point where polar ozone levels are on par with the rest of the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New Zealand has historically had major issues with the hole over spring/summer. The country has one of the highest rates of melanoma/skin cancer in the world, so there is some connection.</p>
<p>Fun fact: At festivals and outdoor events during summer, free sunscreen is always provided, due to this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that a lot of Australians seem to believe that the ozone hole is centered over Australia.</p>
<p>In reality the hole is centered over Antarctica and the southern parts of Argentina have the worst ozone hole out of any country.  There is also less ozone over New Zealand than there is over Australia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe it's seasonal expansion causes it to reach either Australia or New Zealand, but both countries are close enough to the &quot;hole&quot; to have UV issues (skin cancer, car paint deterioration and so on). </p>
<p>FYI....The South island of New Zealand is south of the most southern part of Australia, and thus closer to the &quot;hole&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The barriers only exist for some of the year. When they're not there, the atmosphere mixes slowly, so CFCs (and ozone, oxygen, nitrogen, etc) are distributed throughout the atmosphere.</p>
<p>So there're CFCs in the vortex when it forms, it doesn't need to get in.</p>
<p>(ShiningPate suggests why the centre of the vortex is a particularly good place for the ozone destroying reaction to occur)[<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4uhxpu/why_are_there_holes_in_the_ozone_layer_as_opposed/d5qb1j8" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4uhxpu/why_are_there_holes_in_the_ozone_layer_as_opposed/d5qb1j8</a>].</p>
<p>Their post seems to suggest that ozone depletion only occurs at the poles. I don't know if that is true or not. Other posters in this thread seem to suggest the reaction occurs elsewhere too.</p></div>		</li>
