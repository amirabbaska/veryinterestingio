			<p>Why is it that I had to scroll so far to find this? I'm a millennial. I have no interest in buying a house. The baby boomers were all about suburbanization. The millennials are enjoying a large urbanization and invigoration of cities across the U.S. We are content to rent, it's far more fun than owning a home off in the suburbs.</p>		</li>
