			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for being one of the few people to actually answer the OP's question correctly and simply.  I think I too now have a better understanding.</p>
<p>I guess a corollary to that idea would be that since the speed of light is a finite number, that implies that spacetime offers some kind of &quot;resistance&quot; to photons, right?  Similar to how the speed of sound is determined largely by the medium through which it propagates.  I know the speed of light is defined as being the speed of light in vacuo, but if the speed of light in a vacuum is finite, that would imply that spacetime itself is a &quot;medium&quot; through which the light is propagating, correct?  And thus, if it takes zero force to move a photon, and if spacetime offered no &quot;resistance&quot;, you would expect a photon's speed to be infinite, right? </p>
<p>Or is the speed of light simply an intrinsic thing that has nothing to do with spacetime's &quot;resistance&quot; or lack thereof, and is what it is simply because that's the nature of light, and there's no particular other reason?</p>
<p>I guess the question I'm asking is, what determines the speed of light--why is it what it is, rather than, say, 1 m/s more than it is?  Ultimately perhaps, I suppose the answer might be &quot;because it just is&quot;--but I'm wondering if something about the properties of spacetime itself determines the speed of light, or whether the nature of light itself determines the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well first off, he speed of light is not an infinite number. It is exactly 299,792,458 m/s (commonly simplified to 3x10^8 in calculations). This is, as you said, the speed of light in a vacuum. Light slows down in a medium because photons are absorbed and then  re-emitted by the atoms of the medium. This absorption  and re-emission process causes a photon to take slightly longer to reach its destination. We observe this as a change in velocity (which is distance/time). So while the photon itself is not actually slowing down, it's path is being interrupted. In space, this hardly ever happens as space is mostly empty, and thus very few atoms to absorb and re-emit a photon.<br />
Sound is different in that there is no such thing as a sound &quot;particle.&quot; Sound is a mechanical disturbance of a medium, like when you throw a rock in a pond. Without a medium to disrupt, sound cannot travel. This is why space is silent.<br />
You are on the right track in your last sentence that it is a property of nature that makes light as fast as it is. Over the last few hundred years, scientist have had a hell of a time trying to measure the speed of light. I will link a good post detailing some of the methods they used below.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  I know the speed of light is finite, not infinite--in fact, I know most of what you just posted here.  I don't think I expressed my question very well; I can see where I might have come across as needing that kind of explanation.</p>
<p>What I mean to ask is: Which of the following two possibilities causes the speed of light to be what it is, rather than some other speed....is it the inherent nature of light (the &quot;it is what it is simply because that's what it is&quot; explanation)?  Or is it because light would ordinarily be an infinite speed, but some inherent quality of the vacuum of space (rather than light itself) &quot;slows light down&quot; to the speed that it has (i.e. the &quot;medium of empty space&quot;, through which light travels, has an almost friction-like effect, in its own inherent nature, that slows light down to the particular speed that it's at)?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh? and why not? Light behaves as a wave when you treat it or measure like you would a wave. It behaves as a particle when you treat or measure it as a particle. I was trying to answer the man simply without having to bring in linear operators. Its not a perfect approximation at relativistic speeds true, but its not like I'm trying to teach the man quantum mechanics. The basic idea is still the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because &quot;photons&quot; are particles in the QFT sense, they have very little in common with the Newtonian concept of particles. </p>

<p>Wave-particle duality has been outdated for a hundred years, no physicist takes it seriously. </p>

<p>Well that would not help, standard QM is unable to treat the electromagnetic interaction. You're thinking about QFT.</p>

<p>It's not, &quot;Photons&quot; are not being accelerated (whatever that's supposed to mean). They simply always &quot;travel&quot; at c due to the massless nature of the EM field. This in term is due to local gauge symmetry.</p>
<p>Granted, I have no idea how to make this ELI5. In my opinion certain things are just impossible to faithfully explain without good knowledge of the prerequisites. </p></div>		</li>
