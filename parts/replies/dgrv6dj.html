<p>[Steve] is not an aurora as it does not stem from the interaction of solar particles with the Earth's magnetic field.  </p>

<p>Does that mean SWARM will not be the ideal candidate for researching this further, since SWARM measures Earth's electromagnetic field (according to /u/medley56)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Steve (may) not strictly be an auroral event because an aurora is driven by particles precipitating into the ionosphere, which excites the emission of the light that we see.  Early looks at Steve events suggests that it isn't driven by particle precipitation and therefor is not techincally an aurora. (I say may because this is still up for some debate and more events need to be studied, to my knowledge).</p>
<p>That's not to say SWARM may not be a good tool to study Steve.  SWARM is equipped with instruments that measure electric and magnetic fields, as well as particle instruments and accelerometers.  Steve may not be a strict auroral event, but it could still have localized currents, conductivity gradients, etc which may be able to be seen with the instrumentation suite aboard SWARM.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On mobile, I hope this link works.   I saw Steve last year, took these photos.  You can see the white Steve, and green aurora &quot;leaves&quot; hanging of it. Very very cool, I did not know it was that rare at the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I'm not so sure HAARP would be useful, but something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dual_Auroral_Radar_Network" target="_blank">SuperDARN</a> or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dual_Auroral_Radar_Network" target="_blank">Incoherent Scatter Radar facility such as EISCAT or PFISR</a> and/or a <a href="http://mirl.sr.unh.edu/projects_ulf.html" target="_blank">ground based magnetometer array</a> could be useful!</p>
<p>These facilities can measure particle densities, flows, convection, currents, etc, which could help us get a better handle on what we're seeing and what's driving it.  That's of course not to mention the plethora of satellites we have whizzing around that could provide clues, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way... neon lights are bulbs filled with mobile gasses, when electricity is sent through it, the mobile gas (since it does not bond with anything, which uses energy) glows because of its newly-increased energy.</p>
<p>In this case, the observation is that it is glowing because of a similar reason, but what is it made of and how did it get excited?</p></div>		</li>
