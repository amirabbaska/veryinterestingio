<p>Can confirm. This is how I almost broke my neck the first time I attempted an unassisted flat-ground backflip. I had practiced a lot (Trampoline/foam pit), so I wasn't even all that nervous, but when I went for it, my body tried to abort mission halfway through (without my consent), leaving me upside down mid air, fully extended, and no longer rotating. </p>
<p>Took me 3 weeks to recover full range of motion in my neck, and I consider myself lucky. Screw that weird autonomic override reflex. And rememsfca/ber kids: always have a spotter when attempting backflips.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes you learn something like this and think, &quot;Goddamn, our bodies are <em>amazing</em>.&quot; Another one that never ceases to amaze me is our immune function. Unless there is some kind of dysfunction, these systems are intrinsic to every member of the species, and in many times, the entire genus, no matter your race, creed, social status, or location on the planet. </p></div>		</li>
