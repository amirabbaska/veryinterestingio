			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, good explanation!</p>
<p>I’m in a neuro PhD program now, and I remember being taught just that in undergrad.</p>
<p>A key point though is that in order for SSRIs to work you NEED a change in gene expression. Only after chronic use do you desensitize (downregulate) presynaptic serotonin receptors. Long story short this causes enhanced postsynaptic receptor activity which ends up being the therapeutic response.</p>
<p>With that said, these drugs only work on part of the general population. It’s been recently found that there is a polymorphism (genetic variation) in the gene SERT (it encodes 5-HTT) where individuals with the short allele show increased activation in the amygdala (anxiety center of the brain). So the thinking is that depending on your genetics for that one gene, you respond differently to stress, and it doesn’t matter if you’re on antidepressants. In fact there are studies showing serotonin depletion does not cause depression.</p>
<p>The paradigm shift in the field is to now try Psilocybin (magic mushroom active compound) and ketamine, whose single administration is thought to cure depression for months even in severe cases. There’s even a non-psychoactive version of ketamine in trials now ((2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey!</p>
<p>I don't usually contribute to these threads, but I just wanted to write about a significant part of the mechanism of action you forgot. Quite a majority of scientific community nowadays seems to support the idea that the therapeutic response to SSRI's is actually not caused by the direct action of the drug on serotonergic transmission, but rather by the ability of the drug to induce neuroplasticity. Thus, the serotonergic effects of the SSRI drugs could be only a &quot;side effect&quot; in the beginning of the treatment, because the therapeutic effects of the drug appear only after weeks from the beginning of the treatment. Neuroplasticity is mediated through various growth factors and agents such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26519901" target="_blank">BDNF</a>, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17585940" target="_blank">increased by antidepressant treatment</a>.</p>
<p>You mentioned the ketamine, and the effects of that drug on depression are caused through NMDA receptor-mediated effects (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-007-0063-1" target="_blank">Link 1</a>, and <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725809000783" target="_blank">link 2</a>). It only has a slight affinity on serotonergic receptors, which are not thought to significantly contribute to its therapeutic effects. NMDA receptors are also closely associated with the modulation of neuroplasticity, and thus, it could be another and more rapid route to increase adaptability in the brain in comparison to SSRI-induced BDNF-mediated plasticity.</p>
<p>In the light of current evidence on the antidepressants, the SSRI's have only slight direct effect on depression. Sure, they give many patients more energy in the beginning of the treatment, but the therapeutic effect comes from the drugs [ability to make the brain more adaptable](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186711" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186711</a>. The &quot;cure&quot; for depression could then come from using this plastic state to the patients advantage through therapy, exercise and other healthy lifestyle choices both psychologically and physically - thus learning out of the depressed thought patterns. Indeed, the SSRI-induced plastic state appears to be incredibly powerful, even making it possible to recover from traumatic physical <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18420937" target="_blank">brain damage</a>. It's insane, the ability of the drug to restore partial vision after severe damage to visual cortex through neuroplasticity!</p>
<p>These are just a couple of possible known ways to alter neuroplasticity, and I am confident the commercial pharmacological therapy for depression and neurodegenerative disorders will utilize them in one way or another in the future.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm happy to discuss more about this either in here or through messages. There's a lot of misconceptions about SSRI's and their use, so I just wanted to chime in what I know about them so maybe someone happens to read this and gets interested on the subject! I know my personal and professional interest on this was born on internet message boards.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the individual variation in response to both ketamine and psilocybin it varies considerably, adding further complexity to this puzzle, but you're right it is likely the best solution to date for depression. Ketamine is a powerful fast-acting anti-depressant that we simply didn't ahve in our arsenal with anti-depressants, which normally take a month before their action seems to work. Psilocybin is very similar to a basic molecular chain of serotonin, and seems to act on this neurotransmitter in a variety of important areas in the brain but nobody has rigorously tried to distill what the downstream effects are of this yet. Certainly an important area though.</p>
<p>I work at Mount Sinai and there's a guy here who pioneered Ketamine's first use named Dennis Charney. If anyone is interested in learning more about Ketamine he's a good pub resource. Did not know a non-psychoactive version had been developed that's really cool!</p>
<p>I question whether doing the same for other psychedelics (if it's possible) is actually smart though. If you look at the psilocybin research the most robust treatment effects came from individuals who reported significant 'spiritual experiences', and that this experience mediated long-term outcomes essentially shifting the person's identity and sense of being int eh world. Will be an interesting debate down the road I&quot;m sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would this apply to me? I was walking around in a persistent state of terror but was able to act normal. I was down to watching the disney channel because I couldn't handle anything negative because it sent me to even more terror and anxiety.</p>
<p>I'm fine now on duloxetine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have almost always have upregulation of cAMP whenever there's LTP.  NMDA channels let in calcium, which induces upregulation of cAMP.  So do D1 and D5 dopamine receptors in striatal pyramidal neurons.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you typically have upregulation cGMP when there's LTD.  For example, due to some metabotropic receptor activation and D2 and D4 dopamine receptor activation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmm dopamine receptor activation. Funny in a way that that statement is the long and the short of why im on antidepressants.</p></div>		</li>
