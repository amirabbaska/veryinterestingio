			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always wondered if we know where the big bang happened, i.e. its point of origin.  If everything is supposed to have exploded outwardly, including radiation and mass, couldn't we deduce the origin point? Do the gravitational and other forces that have affected the universe disrupt that path so much we cannot trace the origin of the big bang?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to butcher this explanation but the origin of the big bang wasn't a point &quot;in&quot; the universe, rather the entire universe was contained within the origin point. So the origin was both where you're sitting now and a billion light-years away.</p>
<p>If you're now thinking &quot;Then where is the center?&quot;, as far as I understand it, we don't know, and we also don't know if a center exists. The universe may very well be infinite, and where is the center of a numberline that goes from 0-âˆž? Or in 5 year old terms, where is the center of the surface of a ball?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's literally everywhere. Things did not &quot;explode outwardly&quot; in a classical sense, like gas in a bomb detonation, or expanding a box by moving its walls. The space itself that is expanding, from everywhere and to everywhere.</p>
<p>It gets easier to imagine if you reduce a dimension; space expanding is the 3D equivalent of the 2D surface of an inflating balloon. If you draw a matrix of points there, you can't define a center of expansion, because every point is distancing itself equally from all others.</p>
<p>So, if you trace it backwards in time, eventually all points in the universe become one and the same, a singularity. Hence, it happened here, there, and everywhere else. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation I've heard is that there's no origin point.</p>
<p>Think of the surface of a sphere and try to imagine where the centre point is.  There is no centre point.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has always confused me however - surely if everything is expanding and moving away from each other, we can just reverse the direction of the star's movement?</p>
<p>So if we know the sun is moving XYZ, we go in the opposite direction, then if we get another star that's moving away from us faster than all of the other stars, and reverse that, then repeat with all known starts that we can measure distance from, we should have a starting point surely?</p></div>		</li>
