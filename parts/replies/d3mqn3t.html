			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you dealt with the differences between healthy people and tourette patients? I'll be doing an md thesis within a group project that's proposing a new explanation for tic generation etc.. I've been reading and I've stumbled over snippets that mention that tourette patients seem more easily influenced by watched actions, therefore they mimic movements or words. Do you happen to know of any research dealing with tourette and mirror neurons? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Contrary to popular belief tics do not seem to stem from a lack of impulse control. As a matter of fact it has been shown that TS patients have <em>higher</em> control, wether they do inherently or as a coping mechanism is still unclear though. In our group we propose a new model for tics based on the &quot;theory of event coding&quot;. </p>
<p>This basically states that actions, objects or events and their respective properties are not stored seperately but together in one &quot;file&quot;. Retrieving one part the file activates the rest as well, faster than if all were stored independently. However, this also leads to errors when there is overlap between files and time cost when a file has to be deleted in order to form a new one. </p>
<p>In our model TS patients have stronger than normal &quot;binding&quot; of files. This should show in several ways within the experiments I'm going to do. I'm really stoked about this as it is consistent with a number of things that could not have been explained before. For example it has been noted that TS enables some people to learn motoric routines (e.g. playing violin has been a famous one from a Sacks book iirc) faster compared to healthy people. Above average binding of action files would explain that! On the other hand a stronger binding might be the reason why tics cant be interrupted once they're started. </p>
<p>A collegue from our group has recently shown that compared to healthy controls TS patients did not suffer time loss while ticcing if they were shown a video with a incompatible action. So for example controls were tasked to raise their eyebrows on a signal and were shown a video of someone puffing their cheeks. This resulted in a slower reaction than if the video showed eyebrowraising. Tics on the other hand were unaffected! </p>
<p>I hope this didnt bore you but I think it's very exciting and I cant wait to actually get going with my project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I've never personally come across Tourette's research but it sounds a very interesting area. Maybe there is some dysfunction in the regulatory process that inhibits ideas from executing  actions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the function of dopamine in movement regulation? Parkinson's patients are known to lose dopamine due to dopamine neurons loss. Can they think about an action, yet because of the lack of dopamine, their brain cannot translate it into movement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In Parkinson's the dopaminergic neuronal loss is in the substantia nigra, part of the basal ganglia, downstream from the motor cortex. The basal ganglia helps with action filtration. If you can imagine a brain without the basal ganglia, the motor cortex neurones would have an almost unimpeded route to their associated muscle groups. Brain activity is very noisy. This noise would be conducted down to the muscle causing constant twitching and disrupt movement. The basal ganglia acts as a flood gate, only allowing an action to occur if there is sufficient co-ordinated activity. In Parkinson's the flood gates start failing to open making action initiation difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I see. Very interesting. The mechanism behind it is much more complex than just a lack of dopamine!</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation.</p></div>		</li>
