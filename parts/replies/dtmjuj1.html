			<div class="markdown"><p>When the provider routes an incoming call to a device, it would have to pulse every cell tower in the entire network (read: country) with a &quot;where is this device&quot; kind of signal to try and find it unless the device reported its own location/nearest cell periodically.  You could make this slightly more efficient by only asking cell towers where the device was known to be recently, or common towers where it has been, etc. but still, it's much more efficient to have a device report its whereabouts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but why does it send that signal even if there is no tower around? It would be sufficient to check if a tower is there and <em>then</em> tell that tower that it is there. If there is no tower, the phone is offline anyway, any signal is wasted</p></div>		</li>

<p>You would hope that being in range of a tower is the more common occurrence.  You would flip the fast drain scenario to your battery dies quickly when you are in range of the tower (due to all of the &quot;I'm  here&quot; messages you would be sending) and your battery would last longer when you were out of range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to follow on: if you need to charge your phone in a hurry, and aren't expecting any urgent calls, put it into &quot;airplane&quot; mode. It will stop trying to find connections, and use a lot less power while charging. </p></div>		</li>
