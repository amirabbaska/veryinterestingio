			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone who actually understands the issues at play here. The cartel and organized crime has played a role in Mexican society for decades, and it won't be stopped or lessened by legalization of narcotics. It is the way the society is structured and sadly most common people are okay with it. The devil you know, over the one you don't right? Not to mention the government, even at the root, is corrupt.  Only the military, and that's not even true in all cases, can really be trusted. Imagine living in a country where you don't have police to call upon for help, because for all you know they're dirty and the majority of them are. Point is there needs to be a hell of a lot more to drive change in a system as corrupt as that. Although the riots over the 43 students assassinations is a glimmer of hope, it's really up to the people when it comes down to it.</p>

<p>The reason you can't wage a war on them right now is because they have a multi billion dollar cash flow from selling drugs to the US.. If drugs were legal in the US, it would be ugly for a few years to a decade, but they would probably get tired of dying if the ones that lived weren't making billions of dollars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that simple.</p>
<p>You're forgetting that drugs is only one of many things the cartels do for a &quot;living&quot;. If drugs were suddenly unprofitable (let alone legalized), they'd still kidnap, extort, or simply intimidate anyone that gets on their next business venture. The US would still have a drugs issue (consumers won't go away just cause one country doesn't produce them anymore), and the cartels would still be terrorizing both countries.</p>
<p>The solution is not to just let them be there and hope for the best, the solution is to prevent them from growing.</p>
<p>Think about this for a second. You're from a very low income family, with just a few work opportunities. You went to school, but your parents couldn't afford to get you past elementary. Your options are small jobs that don't pay much, and you're increasingly poorer as your expenses keep getting higher. You one day see this person walk into a restaurant, get himself a huge meal, perhaps he also pays for other people's meals, and when he leaves the place you see everyone immediately attending to his every need before he gets inside his huge car and leaves. What impression d'you think this would leave on you? Probably you'd ask around who the great fella was, and people would probably tell you you're better off not knowing.</p>
<p>This is the image that many people have of the cartels, they see people with money, power and respect. When they find out what they do, they see that their activities aren't that much harder than what they currently do (at least the &quot;menial&quot; ones).</p>
<p>They have heard of &quot;honest&quot; work, which unfortunately they are simply unprepared for to even start from the bottom. They lack the education, the money, or even the looks (cause yes, racism is also a very sensitive issue in Mexico).</p>
<p>They have also heard that these cartel folk are sometimes hiring people for tasks as simple as keeping post in a certain place, to later tell others if they see something unusual. These tasks pay as much as their &quot;honest&quot; activity tenfold, or at worst just as much as cleaning floors all day for a local store.</p>
<p>One day they're confronted with all kinds of problems that ultimately come down to money. They cannot afford to pay for food, rent, transportation, clothing, anything. So when they have to think of a solution, what d'you think it will immediately come to their minds?</p>
<p>Of course that is an extreme example, it all depends on how bad their situation is, but many people experience it at various degrees. Unfortunately the culture also plays a big factor (one that's too used to depend on the government's and other institutions' aid for their daily lives), so it's easy for them to see the cartels as something much simpler to dedicate themselves to.</p>
<p>You're right that the drugs problem would be ugly just for a while, as things would be increasigly controlled, but if the cartels stopped dealing with drugs, they'd find another activity to keep themselves afloat. If they stopped drawing more people to their ranks (both from the US and Mexico), the problem will eventually disappear, but for this to happen, job opportunities and quality of life has to increase on both countries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No it isn't.  It's because they sell drugs to the US, South America, Central America and domestically within Mexico.   They also sell guns, prostitution, engage in kidnappings for ransom, and &quot;security&quot; for corrupt politicians.  <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/21/marijuana-legalization-wont-crowd-out-cartels/" target="_blank">Marijuana legalization would just cause them to diversify to other things</a>.  </p>
<p>The problem is that Mexico's economy is very poor (cough cough NAFTA) and people have been struggling for a long time to survive, and the government is too weak and corrupt to do anything.  People don't become drug-lords and start cutting off heads when there is a good economy and decent paying jobs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No one thinks legalizing/decriminalizing drugs would make cartels into law abiding citizens.  The point is to weaken them by taking away large chunks of their profits, not turn them into good guys.</p></div>		</li>
