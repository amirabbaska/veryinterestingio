			<div class="markdown"><p>Star size but very bright, star size in the sky is due entirely to brightness (as our eyes could not possibly resolve their actual size) so it may appear larger than any other star</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very far away so actually to your eye it wouldn't get bigger just brighter. </p>
<p>But actually that's a good question. Maybe with some telescope (interferometer) we could get details of the explosion, as I do believe we have managed to resolve it's surface already!!! This is a very special case mind you, as we can't normally resolve stars other than our Sun, but this guy's just close and really big. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is rare, but with some stars it works. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VLTI_reconstructed_view_of_the_surface_of_Antares.jpg" target="_blank">This is a picture of Antares</a>.</p></div>		</li>
