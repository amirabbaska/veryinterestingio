			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine said &quot;I recommend any toothpaste with the ADA (American Dental Assn.) logo.&quot; A lightbulb went off in my head: 9/10 dentists recommend Crest. Those same dentists would also recommend Colgate or Sensodyne or Arm &amp; Hammer or any other fluoride-containing toothpaste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dentist seems to think there is Sensodyne, and then everything else.  I guess it's good if you have sensitive teeth based on what he has to say.  Doesn't do shit for me though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get terrible canker sores ( aphthous ulcers) if I use anything (toothpaste/mouthwash/etc) containing Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. So I have to use Tom's or Sensodyne without this ingredient. </p>
<p>I've tried to cut it out of everything I use (hand/body soap, etc) but it's surprisingly difficult since it's what manufacturers use to give you that 'squeaky clean' feeling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I have to use sensodyne because I'm prone to canker sores and most toothpastes have an ingredient that is known to increase their frequency. I think there's other brands as well that have certain SLS-free products, but almost all of sensodyne's are so that's what I use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could substitute any consumer product for toothpaste in that quote. Even in fully-developed Western countries, supermarkets are a lot smaller and only contain two or three choices for any type of product.  In the developing world, the choice would be whatever they managed to source that day/week/month. </p></div>		</li>
