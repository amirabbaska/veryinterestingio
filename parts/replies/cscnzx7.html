			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree on the unmodified football helmet proposal -- even if it's mostly going to protect against knives/swords, it'll get pretty badly beaten up quite quickly.  Adding a (relatively thin) steel layer to the outside shell will drastically improve your longevity and make those blows do actually nothing rather than mostly nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are really good helmets. they got to be in order to protect the wearer against a pretty heavy piece of &quot;rubber&quot; flying at great speeds along the ice. or a head-smash against the ice for that matter.</p></div>		</li>
