			<div class="markdown"><p>The H5N8 avian flu that was circulating in Europe last year was rife in migrating waterfowl, but as said above they don't show many clinical signs and they generally survive or die during migration. Poultry species, however, were extremely susceptible to H5N8 last year and once it got into flocks of Turkeys and chickens or game birds it it killed them within hours.</p>
<p>The problem with avian influenza (much like human influenza) is that it is constantly circulating in wild birds and mutates very easily. Migrating birds follow certain routes eaxh year, so you'll typically have different strains of AI circulating in different parts of the world. Where migration routes cross and birds meet, different versions of the virus can mix and mutations occur. This means the same strain of the virus (H5N6 for example) can actually be very different in different parts of the world. The H5N6 circulating in Asia is zoonotic (Meaning it can infect humans) but the H5N6 cases found this year in Europe do not have this zoonotic trait!</p>
<p>Much like human flu, birds are regularly exposed to a variant, get sick, grow a resistance but then the virus adapts and next time the bird encounters it it may become sick again.</p>
<p>As for why water fowl have good resistance yet poultry don't, it could be that water fowl are exposed to AI so often that they have a much greater tolerence for it, whereas commercial poultry are not regularly exposed to wild viruses. Additionally, commercial poultry often live in cramped conditions so the virus can spread much faster than it would in the wild.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How can you estimate this with such precision?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're saying, &quot;They either survive, or they migrate and die en route, thus obscuring their death being related to the flu.&quot;</p>
<p>They're saying they don't normally drop dead and it's obvious locally, they migrate and thus scatter to a degree before dying; dying is unlikely, but if they do they don't just fall over like poultry in a few hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Influenza A and B viruses have two types of spikes that cover their surface – the haemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N).</p>
<p>Viruses attach by their haemagglutinin onto receptors on the surface of cells in order to infect them, like a grappling hook. And the neuraminidase removes these receptors from infected cells at the right time to allow newly synthesised viruses to escape and spread.</p>
<p>Among influenza A viruses there are 17 different types of haemagglutinin, from H1 to H17 and nine different types of neuraminidase, from N1 to N9. Each virus has one type of H (such as H1) and one type of N (such as N1).</p>
<p>So it's a way to categorise the method the flu strain uses to infect cells. The receptors affect how infectious it is, which animals it can infect, and the composition of the vaccines used in that year's flu shots. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And if a pig gets both, their cells can be infected by both viruses, both adding stuff into the cell’s DNA</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is false. While it's true that many theorize that pigs infected with bird and human influenza strains are the genesis of many modern pandemics, <strong>it has nothing to do with cellular DNA.</strong> </p>
<p>The viruses themselves are actually made of <em>RNA</em> and the new pandemic viruses are borne of a process called <strong>genetic recombination</strong>, during which parts of the virus' genetic material are exchanged between strains, and new particles are made that are chimeras of the two &quot;parent&quot; strains. </p>
<p>One can imagine such a scenario where the parts that make one virus strain super excellent at replicating, are exchanged with a strain whose other proteins make it really good at infecting human cells. Such a mutant resulting virus would be bad news for the human race, and in fact has been in the past.</p>
<p>But influenza does not exchange genetic information with the host, it creates no DNA, and bears no DNA in its genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a bit of detail, every gene in the influenza genome is on a separate strand of RNA (though there may be two genes on one of the strands). This makes the recombination possibilities that much more complex, though most of these genes don't affect pathogenicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask why it is that virus particles exchange genetic material? Is this something that's coded into their structure, to actively exchange material, or is it more of a happenstance collision?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's closer to happenstance, especially if we're just talking about reassortment and not crossover. Imagine you have a pot of broth (your pig cell) and you throw in 8 chunks of potatoes (influenza virus 1) and 8 chunks of carrots (influenza virus 2). Without looking, you dish 8 chunks of vegetables into each of two bowls. Now each bowl has an assortment of vegetables, like the new influenza particles have an assortment of genes from the two &quot;parent&quot; strains. </p>
