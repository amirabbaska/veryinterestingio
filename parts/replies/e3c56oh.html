			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the response that came to me. Subtitles someone’s ruin scenes for me because they come up a few seconds before someone says/completes the line or the subs might point out an action before it happens. I prefer them off. </p>
<p>They do help when I’m practicing a different language because I can tune my future ear to what they are actually saying versus the gibberish I heard initially </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible this was once a tendency that's now been drilled into a hard-to-change pattern? I watch tv with subs for my non-native husband. After many years, I find it uncomfortable to watch tv without subs, even by myself, because i'm brain has redirected resources elsewhere (has got lazy). My brain has learned that it needn't decode both auditory and visual information, and now just focuses on the on that's easier - in this case the written word. Or at least I think that's what's going on. I have no indication that my hearing in general is getting worse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my guess. I think the first things most (non-impaired) people learn to read subs for are foreign language films/shows. It takes a little getting used to, and kids (some adults) might find it a pain. But you quickly learn to do it if you want to follow what's going on. The text is critical and audio less so. </p>
<p>That training might then apply to same-language subs (or if you're fluent in both languages).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt your hearing is any worse, and this was the point of the question. Something about how the brain works CHOOSES text over audio/visual stimulus. It's interesting to see that others have the same experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>The other answers about psychological/brain factors are probably true too, but IMO this is the biggest factor. If the subtitles came after the audio, you'd probably be less likely to read the subtitles.</p></div>		</li>
