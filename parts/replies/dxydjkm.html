			<div class="markdown"><p>To ask the question in another way, how deep could the sand be before the weight of it compresses the bottom layer into sandstone?  (Is that how it works?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are asking about <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/sed_rx.htm" target="_blank">lithification</a>, the process by which sediment turns to sedimentary rock. Because wind-blown (eolian) sand grains tend to be very well rounded, they do not compact a whole lot (compared to clays, for example). The main variable of interest here is the cementing agent--which depends on groundwater chemistry and the position of the water table. If the water table is relatively high, for example in intermontane basins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artesian_aquifer" target="_blank">artesian springs</a>, the water table could be quite shallow (a few meters below the surface) and if the chemistry is right, carbonates or iron oxides might start cementing the grains together. If the water table is super deep (hundreds of meters or more), then the sand might stick around for a very long time and remain unconsolidated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if it gets cemented it can be cemented to varying degrees depending on the concentration of carbonates or iron oxides in the water and length of time spent saturated. Last summer I was hiking through some fairly weakly lithified sandstone of the Milk River Formation (85Ma) that would crumble into fine sand very easily. The softness of this rock helped it form into hoodoos very quickly after the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet compared to hoodoos in the American southwest which are harder sandstones and much older. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to remember when to use each, (though these are based on Latin), is by pretending that i.e, stands for &quot;in essence&quot; and e.g., stands for &quot;example given&quot;... unless you know Latin, then do that instead.</p>
<p>In this case, since Antarctica is an <em>example</em>, e.g., is appropriate. If you had said something like, &quot;dunes are generally formed of a granular silicate material,&quot; following that with &quot;i.e., sand&quot; because we aren't talking about one of many options, but instead we are giving a simplified term that sums up the essence of the longer description.</p></div>		</li>
