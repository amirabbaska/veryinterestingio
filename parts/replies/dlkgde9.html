<p>We always are. Super volcanoes, Tsunami's, Asteroids ... all fast moving, little notice events that we can do didly to stop.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think I agree, overall, but I do argue that super volcanoes give fairly significant warning. Volcanologists are able to track many variables that give clues to pending eruptions of volcanoes. Seismic activity in the form of seismic swarms indicate magma movement and hydrothermal activity. Using INSAR and GPS they can track land deformations; swelling and subsidence. GeoChem gives us further insight to possible future eruptions based on the content in fumeroles. There are many other methods, such as magnetic detections, gravity fluctuations, and tiltmeters. We can use all of these methods in concert to make pretty good predictions about possible eruptions. I will, however, also argue that it's still mostly guesswork and even the best predictions can be wrong. Also, evacuating <em>millions</em> of people around the Yellowstone supervolcano would be a tremendous undertaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm skeptical of this answer, it seems to disagree with what was reported about the volcanoes, and provides no evidence for its claims. I understand that isostatic rebound is slow, but isn't that a separate issue to the effect on volcanism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the crust rebounds it deforms and very well could lead to a reduced pressure which had been preventing the volcanoes from erupting. However, to be honest, I haven't read the report (and probably should have before commenting!).</p>
<p>Edit: After reading the linked article; the West Antarctic ice sheet is 2km thick... that's a lot of ice. It'll take quite a long time for any significant amount of that ice to melt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I understand that, what I was thinking though was this; lets say the ice has melted and there's less pressure on the underlying rock. Do the volcanoes start erupting straight away or do they start erupting in a few thousand years time after the ground has rebounded? Obviously that's a huge simplification, but that's basically what I was curious about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well you provide zero evidence for all of them.. so all of them?</p></div>		</li>
