			<div class="markdown"><p>While I don't doubt that fueling more cells is part of it, surely the bigger factor is the basic Intro Physics fact of the matter that it takes more energy to move more mass, no?</p>
<p>Especially when you consider that a good chunk (most?) of the &quot;more&quot; cells are just fat cells and aren't really doing much work anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, just sitting as a lump on a bed burns well over a thousand calories a day, even in an average-sized person.  And more for larger people - a 200 pound person (still a healthy weight for many heights and builds) burns nearly 100 calories per hour sitting still.  As much as you burn through work and movement, basic cell respiration still counts for most of your daily calorie usage, unless you're a very, very active person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on lifestyle.  A very active person will burn about the same number of calories through work as resting rate, but even a sedentary lifestyle burns about 1200-1500 calories a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of true, but mostly not. When a thin person adds fat, they increase the number of fat cells they have. When they lose weight, the fat cells shrink, but don't disappear. This is one reason why it's hard to keep weight off. The fat cells in a formerly fat person are just sitting there, almost empty, waiting for some fresh lipids to store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, fat people and thin people have the same number (roughly) of bodily cells, but the fat cells in larger people are distended, like those little sponge creatures you can buy as a kid that expand in water. While they do have to consume more fuel to get around, it's because of the increased strain required to move their mass around by their muscle cells. </p></div>		</li>
