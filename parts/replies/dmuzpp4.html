			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one controlled substance in my lab that needs to be in a locked cabinet at all times that it isn't being used. Every order needs to be approved by our site safety manager. There is a log book for any time  the material is used. The bottle must first be weighed and verified that the weight matches the previous weight recorded. Then, after it's used, it must be reweighed and recorded how much was used, what the purpose was for, and signed by the experimenter. All of this needs to be done for a 10% iodine solution, because anything greater than 5% magically becomes a controlled substance because iodine is a catalyst to make meth. Like I get it for pharmaceutical grade opiates and stuff, but I'm just trying to do Karl Fischer water percent over here, cut me some slack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Ketamine is a CIII, while cocaine is a CII.</p>
<p>CI - no recognized medical use by the us govt.  Marijuana, heroine, etc</p>
<p>CII - medical use, but highly addictive.  Requires the most amount of recordkeeping.  Percocet, cocaine, Adderall.</p>
<p>CIII-CV:. As you go up in number the risk of addiction is less. In some states CV meds can be sold over the counter.</p>
<p>Some examples:
CIII: Many anabolic steroids, fioricet, butrans</p>
<p>CIV: Benzos, Ambien</p>
<p>CV: Some codeine products as long as the strengths aren't too high</p></div>		</li>
