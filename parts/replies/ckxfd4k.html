			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the primary issue. There is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; with infectious diseases where they are particularly lethal to large populations. If an organism is too virulent it quickly infects and kills off available hosts. So the fitness of the host is important for an infectious agent to be passed along to other hosts. An organism that is too lethal kills off it's available hosts too quickly and then burns out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing preventing ebola from becoming less virulent over time. </p>
<p>Worst case scenario would be that it evolves a way for the host to shed viral particles during the pre-symptomatic stage (which can last weeks).</p>
<p>I work at the CDC, and some are currently investigating post-recovery transmission pathways. It seems that Ebola remains in vaginal fluids and semen for quite a long time (up to 9mo). To my knowledge, we're not yet sure if those viral particles are infectious...and if so, for how long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the virus could be transmitted in this way, it would give the virus a method of transmission that could challenge the conclusions of said &quot;sweet spot&quot;. In other words, the evolution of the virus could be less effected by the mortality rate of the host because it has developed a method of transmission that increases the number of transmissions per host that survives the initial infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So out of curiosity what is the primary evolutionary &quot;aim&quot; of a disease? If you require a host to survive, wouldn't that mean killing off hosts is a terrible survival strategy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not useful to think of aims, even &quot;aims&quot;. I think it has worked so far (because it hasn't gone extinct) so it will continue that way.  Obviously not ideal to kill your host, but if they can get by doing so there is no imperative to change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's  certainly true that they found viruses in semen, meaning this is possible, the last I heard this mode of transmission hasn't really been seen much or at all in past outbreaks (this was from the latest &quot;This week in Virology&quot; podcast).   I'm not sure why that is, but perhaps transmission through that route isn't as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>At any rate, in a first world country it should be possible to avoid that route since recovering cases should be known and warned of the possibility.  It's definitely something to keep an eye on, but probably not a huge problem.</p></div>		</li>
