			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that mental illness are considered to be curable by willpower alone. I do think that if I held a delusion that I was a great character from history and truly believed it, people would consider that a mental illness because clearly I am not a great character from history. If I consider myself a woman when all evidence points to the fact that I am a man, that seems to be more acceptable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You should take a look at the Wikipedia article for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure" target="_blank">brain structures in transgender people.</a> To summarise it, a number of studies have found that transgender people actually have brain structures resembling their identified gender, and in conflict with their birth sex. Considering that you are your brain, when a person raised as a boy comes out as a transgender woman, it is actually more accurate from a medical view to say that they are a woman with an inappropriately male body than to say that they are a man with an inappropriately female mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ie. They're born in the wrong body. They have the brain of one gender, but the body of another. Some people start joking about &quot;feeling like a dog&quot; or something. You can't be born with the brains of a dog. &quot;I feel black!&quot; There's no difference between white or black brains. There IS however a difference between a male and female brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way. How likely is it that a person who thinks they're Napoleon has all of the DNA required to be Napoleon? Even a direct descendant would have a low chance of that. Napoleon was a specific person, and as far as I know, DNA doesn't carry the experience of your ancestors. Even if you were cloned from Napoleon, I'm not sure it makes sense to believe you are him. </p>
<p>Maybe believing you're a dolphin is more plausible? At least dolphins have more genetic diversity than one individual human. You don't have to recreate one exact DNA sequence, you just have to be close. How many generations would you have to go back to find a common ancestor between a human and a dolphin? We're talking hundreds of millions of years, right?</p>
<p>What about race? What if a white guy thinks he's Asian? Could he have a genetic basis for that? Does he have any Asian DNA? I suppose if you go back hundreds of generations to one of the recent ice ages you could find an ancestor that is a genetic link between a white guy and Asian DNA. </p>
<p>That white guy's mom is a woman, though.  He carries his mother's DNA, one full copy including that all important X chromosome. These &quot;female&quot; genes are in every cell of his body, but are suppressed by other genes or in most cases just by hormones. He carries them in order to be passed on so that his offspring could possibly be female. If he didn't carry all of the information needed to produce a female human, none of his descendants could be female. </p>
<p>Thinking of it that way, doesn't it make sense that if genetic abnormalities, mutations, or quirks of gene suppression happen, those things would have some real chance of affecting sex and gender in a wide spectrum of ways? Every person has an opposite sex parent, so 50% of your DNA directly comes from the opposite sex. It seems much more far-fetched for a random genetic mutation to produce a spectrum of racial variance or species variance, since individuals are usually so far removed from another race or another species in the DNA they've inherited. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Playing Devil's Advocate here:   </p>
<p>If carrying the X chromosome can have so many quirks on a male, what accounts for a female
who wants to transition to male, as she does not carry her father's all important Y sex chromosome?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad analogy because there can only be one of those people in existence so its obviously impossible for you to be them. </p>
<p>THe body isn't perfect so it is reasonable for something to become messed up in your genes where your DNA gets garbled directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scary thing about mental illness for a lot of people is that it affects the brain and your brain is supposed to be you. Your body is just your vessel, so you get a cold, you get cancer, etc, whatever. It's not you, not your personality. It just happened to you.</p>
<p>So you (the person with the mental illness), are diseased as a person. I'm not saying I agree with this, but that's why mental illness is so hard to understand for a lot of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transsexualism is a documented illnes. They have done research on it and the brain scans show how abnormally similar to the other sex the brain looks in a trans person. being Trans also comes with intense emotional discomfort/ body dysphoria which is another thing that makes it an illness.</p></div>		</li>
