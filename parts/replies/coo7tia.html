			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth be told, if this is like any other colonization attempt in history, you'll probably want to be in the 3rd or 4th wave. That way you're assured that the colony will at least survive, as opposed to the first wave where they could all lose communications with earth and die after resorting to cannibalism.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might not be aware that there has been suicide pills onboard since the first manned launches into space.  If the situation is grim, there is always a more dignified way to go, where you do so on your own terms and decision, than eating everybody from allowing animal instinct or hunger to dominate your being.</p>
<p>Edit: To address the replies, airlocks work, but the right pill will take half the time and knock you out first and might be more accessible depending on the situation. Nasa declined to have them handy for their crew members, go Russia?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I believe port of origin laws still apply on the spacecraft, and you know America is going to either claim the colony as it's sovereign territory, or at least have political relations with it if it is it's own territory, but you're right, they would have to remove all liability before any of this happens. </p>
<p>Apparently it goes against the Outer Space Treaty for America to take territory. So it will probably be self governed.</p></div>		</li>
