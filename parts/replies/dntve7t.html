			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case the cancer was in my blood itself (acute lymphoblastic leukemia). I don't think most patients want cancerous blood cells introduced into their system. </p>
<p>All remission means is the level of cancerous cells is incredibly low. They may totally still be there. I'll never be cured, but it's statistically unlikely to recur.</p>
<p>I am actually super disappointed about this situation. I consumed so much blood over the course of my treatment (yummy) I really wish I could give some back. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Eh, don't sweat it. We give blood for just this sort of situation, among others. No one begrudges it. </p>
<p>You want to give something back, go volunteer somewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My stepdaughter also has ALL. She's got about ten months to go with her treatment.  I didn't realize that she wouldn't be able to donate blood (she's a teen, and has also taken lots of blood - during the first phases, she was frequently pale, and she's usually nocturnal, anyway - so she jokes that she's a vampire).  </p></div>		</li>

<p>To the average person it won't matter, the cancer cells are foreign and will be destroyed by the immune system of the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not neccesarily. One of the biggest changes in cancerous cells is they loose a bunch of their cell surface markers, which basically makes the cells 'invisible' and prevents the host immune system from attacking it. It just looks like a generic human cell to everything, which is why tumors that start in one part of your body can grow, go malignant, and spread to other parts of your body. There's a handful of other little tricks cancer has to protect itself from immune systems too. In theory, this means cancer could absolutely be transplantable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with stage 3b melanoma in April of 2015. After surgery and a years worth of treatment Ive had scans twice a year and I'm totally a NED. But I just found out I can't donate blood anymore. Which makes sense. I honestly didn't think about it until today when I tried to donate for the Las Vegas victims. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Cancers like melanoma can travel through the vascular (blood) system, so cancer patients cannot donate. </p>

<p>Wait, so technically certain cancers could, in fact, be contagious?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. A healthy human body will reject another person's cells as foreign bodies, and this includes the other person's cancer cells. However, there is one strain of cancer that is contagious among dogs that has been around for at least thousands of years, and one that is contagious among Tasmanian Devils that was discovered in 1996 and had probably been around a year or a couple of years when it was first discovered. I don't know how the dog cancer spreads, but if I remember right, the tasmanian devil cancer spreads by tasmanian devils biting each other in the face.</p>
<p>There are only a small number of known contagious cancers out there, and none of them have been known to infect humans.</p>
<p>Edit: Originally said there were only two known contagious cancers, but there are a few.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I might be a little off; all my information comes from reading a few academic papers about the tasmanian devil cancer a few years ago for a class. Here's a wikipedia article on transmissible cancers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonally_transmissible_cancer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonally_transmissible_cancer</a></p></div>		</li>
