			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but you spend more time driving as well so that skews the numbers as well. Plus s/he didn't say how far someone lived from the the airport, what country they live in, and how long of a flight they're boarding - all of which make a huge difference. </p>
<p>That being said, let's say you live in America, live 30 miles from the airport, and are flying 400 miles. According to the <a href="http://www.airlinereporter.com/2010/09/flying-is-safe-and-i-am-going-to-prove-it/" target="_blank">same source</a>, you have a 0.000040% chance of dying on the car ride and 0.0000031% chance of dying on the plane ride. So you're about 13x more likely to die on the car ride than the plane ride. </p>
<p>Whereas your method came up with 16x. So, I guess you weren't far off after all :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember though, the rough odds include all conditions and decisions.</p>
<p>Those odds of an accident while driving include people who were drunk or tired, or driving too fast, or in a car with bad breaks or other safety defects.</p>
<p>I'm in control of my car and my driving to such an extent that I can make the choices that lower that risk substantially. If I'm sober, obeying traffic laws etc, my risk of dying in a given ride is far lower than that.</p>
<p>Hell, just by wearing a seat belt, I drastically reduce my chance of death.</p>
<p>Hard to do the actual numbers without finding and processing a lot of separate sources. The biggest one would be what percentage of deaths are caused by other drivers. At least one hint of that is that more than half of all accidents with fatalities in every state are single car accidents. It seems very possible though that doing everything right could lower risk of dying in a car accident by that order of magnitude difference, meaning that good drivers may indeed face less of a risk in a car than a plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a lot to do with the sense of control that people feel they have over the risk.   People dont fear driving because they believe they are in control while they fear flying because they have no control.   In reality, we have no control over all the other drivers on the road and can often be distracted or otherwise not fully in control of our own actions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.</p>
<p>I'm a senior reactor operator and I have no fear about the plant I operate when I have control room command. But when other people have command and I'm acting as an accident advisor, it makes me a little uneasy because I can't give orders in that role.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  People think they understand cars and driving so they feel in control, even though you're normally gunna die because some dude you never saw coming was drinking and slams through a red light at 80mph into your skull before you even can react.</p>
<p>But most people can't tell you how airplanes even fly, let alone how they're piloted, how the engines work, etc.  So the additional loss of control and needing to trust a stranger makes the danger feel more palpable.</p>
<p>Take that problem x100, and you have nuclear power.  People somewhat understand &quot;dig up coal, put coal in fire, make steam, turn turbine, make electricity.&quot;  But nuclear is just baffling to anyone but a group of people probably even smaller and more specialized than commercial airline pilots, and that contributes to the fear even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While OP makes a good point attributing this question to engineering and you point out the obvious psychological dilemma associated there is also, most likely, a third party involved.  My emphasis is not on the human element but the economy.  I don't doubt that the Swiss have had zero issues with nuclear and will probably continue that trend (or rather, could) but other energy industry providers may have pressured the gov't into removing nuclear.  Whether it was for safety (perceived or otherwise as you point out), financial gain, or something else entirely, I don't doubt a major energy provider was behind the push.</p></div>		</li>
