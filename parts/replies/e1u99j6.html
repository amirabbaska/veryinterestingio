			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, to my understanding, the information translated is related to the number of peaks/frequency... the more peaks, the more 0's and 1's that can be transferred, which is why higher frequencies can transmit more data. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I came across the Friis Transmission equation on research. It says the aperture of the antenna is the reason power is related to frequency [0]. Do you think a large spherical antenna covering the entire space around the source will make the power at that point indifferent to frequency?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked up Friis Transmission Equasion. If I'm understanding it correctly, it is stating that the power that you measure at the receiving end is a product of the power and frequency of the energy sent from the transmitter, and the size of your receiving antenna.</p>
<p>To answer your question, no, a large spherical antenna would be omnidirectional. To receive the same power (read: &quot;similar power&quot;, you will never receive exactly what you put out because of attenuation) you put out from the transmitter at the receiver you would need a highly directional antenna. i.e. Yagi and Log-periodic. </p>
<p>Also most &quot;spherical antennas&quot; I know are actually just coverings for directional antennas to protect them from weather and extend their lifespan. So I'll admit I don't know much about true spherical.</p>
<p>Sorry if I misunderstood your question.</p>
<p>Edit: If you are interested in RF and live in the USA, I recommend touring the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. It is home to the largest fully steerable antenna in the world, and the people there are very knowledgeable about RF and space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for the effort. The way I see it, Friis equation says that attenuation exists even in free space.[0]. Is this right? And sadly, I don't live in the US. :(</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that bandwidth analogy isn't quite right. It'd be something more like having a thin red straw and a wide blue straw. You can transfer more liquid through the straw at once because it's wider, not because it's blue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In all seriousness, the reason that you can transmit more data at 5 GHz is that the amplitude is shorter and thus given that we're trying to send 1s and 0s, you can fit more of them in at once. So the semi versus car analogy is not bad in this sense, since you fit more data on the semi. It's bad in the sense that the 2.4 Ghz is more like the semi because it penetrates more objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't the reason for higher bandwidth that it was simply chosen to be higher?.</p>
<p>I mean 2.4ghz only goes from 2412 to to 2472 MHz, but 5 GHz goes from 5100 to 5800. So you got 700MHz available in the 5 GHz standard, but only 60 MHz at 2.4 Ghz.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It has nothing to do with amplitude at all. The 5GHz signal is &quot;faster&quot; so you can cram twice as much information into it and still tell what is being said on the other end. </p>
<p>Amplitude doesn't matter at all, SNR does for a wifi signal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A shorter amplitude would imply that you have a smaller signal to noise ratio, which would in fact reduce your data rate (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem#Implications_of_the_theorem" target="_blank">see Shannon-Hartley theorem</a>). I'm know you mean wavelength, but that isn't accurate either. If our metric for <em>fast</em> is how much data is being transmitted, it is directly related to bandwidth and signal to noise ratio(SNR). My straw example was attempting illustrate that if the SNR (the driving force, so to speak) is the same, a wider bandwidth will push more data through at once. To get in to the communication theory a little bit more, you are sending more symbols on the extra carrier frequencies within your bandwidth. It doesn't have anything to do with the frequency of the wave, you're sending more data at once.</p></div>		</li>
