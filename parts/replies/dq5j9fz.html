			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps something that might also be important to note is that normally during sleep, the body filters less fluids and re-absorbs more. </p>
<p>With less urine, you won't need to go to the toilet because your bladder won't fill up as fast.
The main driver for increasing this re-absorption is something called Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH).</p>
<p>Funnily enough, alcohol reduces how much of this hormone is released. This means your kidneys keep working at full force, even while you sleep, so you end up with a full bladder</p></div>		</li>

<p>It makes perfect sense that your kidneys are going to keep working full tilt when you have poison in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, that's the strange thing. In the case of alcohol, it's mostly dealt with by the liver, and in this case, all that the ADH is going to do is let you re-absorb more water. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm unfamiliar with the mechanism behind why alcohol affects the kidneys, so I can't really explain what exactly happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's indirect. Alcohol is metabolized in the liver, but it obviously has effects elsewhere. Alcohol suppresses some brain functions - ADH secretion (produced in hypothalamus and stored and excreted from pituitary) being one of them. So if Antidiuretic hormone isn't being secreted, your kidneys filter and expel dilute urine (pretend there is a Diuretic Hormone, the opposite of ADH, but really it's just a lack of ADH) due to diuresis. Diuresis is the primary cause of hangovers -dehydration. </p>
<p>People with certain brain conditions (like hypothalamic and pituitary tumors) can get Diabetes insipidus and expel an alarming amount of urine in a short amount of time - primarily due to lack of ADH production and/or secretion. ADH causes the collecting tubules and ducts in the nephron to be more permeable and reabsorb more water in the efferent arterioles - excreting concentrated urine. Lack of ADH does the opposite. It's not really that your kidneys are working harder in the presence of alcohol. It's brain hormones (or lack thereof) altering permeability of collecting tubules in the nephron. But I'm no Neuro-Nephrologist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey good question. I think what happens with this is that the child has a bladder that is immaturely linked in a neurological sense to the brain that would normally wake them up to tell them to go to the bathroom. I believe this would happen within deeper sleep cycles, but not 100% sure if it would happen during REM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little-like around 2 or 3, I can remember I’d need to pee, then dream I had gone to the bathroom and was sitting on the toilet.  The wet would make me wake up.  This made me really miserable til I figured out that I was dreaming unless the toilet seat was cold.  That’s how I was able to stop wetting the bed.  - Don’t know why I never dreamed about a cold toilet seat, but I didn’t.</p></div>		</li>
