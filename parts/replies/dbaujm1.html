			<div class="markdown"><p>But they are coming back up to the same pressure it was dissolved at. Nitrogen only bubbles out if it's breathed in at higher than sea level pressure then the person ascends to a lower pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bends is actually more based on depth exposure time than it is actually breathing. While yes humans who scuba also can't shoot up rapidly holding their breath (gasses expand with lower pressure) or they'll die. But the bends is from being underwater for prolonged time. Nitrogen gets absorbed into the bloodstream at a microscopic level as tiny bubbles, the longer and lower you are the higher the concentration. Aquatic mammals can stay at depth for quite some time which still gives them nitrogen in their blood just not quite as much as divers get.</p></div>		</li>

<p>sometimes they get it when theyre fished up rapidly. </p>
<p>Its believed that under normal circumstance they are ok but sometimes 'accidents' might occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans can also survive high blood carbon dioxide levels for long periods without ill effect too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_hypercapnia" target="_blank">Permissive hypercapnia</a> is successfully used as a ventilatory strategy in Intensive Care to protect patients' lungs from high ventilation pressures â€”and has revolutionised the treatment of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome over the last 15 years or so.</p>
<p>The problem is that hypercapnia is an extremely strong trigger to breathe for humans. The overwhelming unconscious need to take a breath occurs long before it's physiologically necessary. Whales on the other hand are conscious breathers and can choose to hold their breath far longer than we can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe in a sense, but probably not, most deep diving whales actually expel all the air from their lungs (moreso than humans can) so that they can reduce their buoyancy for the glide down into the deep. They only need bigger lungs when they come back up for air and need to re-oxygenate. Its why they push the oxygen into the blood and muscles, where it doesnt create a huge airpocket. </p></div>		</li>
