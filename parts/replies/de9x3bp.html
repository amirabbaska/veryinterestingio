			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a little bit confused... You said that non-rotating and rotating black holes are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>1) Suppose I have a non-rotating black hole. Now a body with angular momentum falls into it. The black hole acquires the angular momentum. And then.. it loses its singularity? Is this correct?</p>
<p>2) I think in the real world, it is not possible to have &quot;zero&quot; angular momentum. So a real-world black hole would always be rotating, right?</p>
<p>3) Is it mathematically ok for a black hole to transform from non-rotating (singularity) to rotating (as you called ringularity)? I mean... &quot;something something different topology etc.&quot;?!</p></div>		</li>

<p>/u/rantonels was talking about the standard black hole solutions of general relativity. These are idealized systems which describe eternal black holes. These are very useful solutions because the exterior of real black holes very quickly evolve to look like the exteriors of these eternal black holes.</p>
<p>The interior of real black holes is basically a completely open problem, all we really know is that the interior of a real black hole won't be the same as the interior of the rotating eternal black hole (because it is unstable).</p>
<p>Questions 1 and 3 are very much about this open problem so there isn't much one can say. For the third question I can tell you that yes, if something falls into a non-rotating black hole and gives it angular momentum you end up with a rotating black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This sounds intriguing. Would a rotating eternal black hole's rotation slow over time by radiating gravitational waves?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You sure <em>can</em> have zero total angular momentum.  Many subatomic particles such as mesons have zero angular momentum.  In some mesons for example, the spins are oppositely-aligned such that they cancel each other out, and the bound state as a whole has no angular momentum as a result.</p>
<p>Also, the Higgs boson is a fundamental particle with zero angular momentum (the only known one).</p>
<p>A black hole would simply need to absorb as much angular momentum in one direction as the other.  This is of course exceedingly unlikely, but not impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's certainly there somewhere, but it would take many times more energy than the entire universe contains to find it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this to say that the &quot;black hole paradox&quot; we've read about is actually solved, and it's a &quot;firewall&quot; such that GR fails and an object entering the horizon is indeed incinerated and from their reference frame does not &quot;fall forever&quot;? Also, your blog is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not a firewall, it is only a firewall if everyone sees it, including who falls. Instead in this membrane paradigm (aka the stretched horizon) the observer which falls does not see the membrane, but rather falls unscathed through the horizon and meets a smooth interior. The hot membrane that destroys him is only what you, far away observer, see. The interior and membrane are holographically dual. This is the black hole complementarity principle solution to the BH information paradox.</p>

<p>Thanks, then stay tuned because I'm about to drop a bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does Hawking radiation play into this?  I would think a falling observer would have time slow down to the extent that before they cross the event horizon the black hole has decayed (say it takes a trillion years in outside-observer time), seeing as their acceleration asymptotically approaches the point where GR would give time dilation as infinite.<br />
Am I missing something here, am I wrong about the time dilation due to acceleration at the event horizon?  Is there a way in which the duality you speak of extends to sort of semi-quantum models with Hawking radiation? </p></div>		</li>
