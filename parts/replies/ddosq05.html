			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay but. </p>
<p>I have a lot of anal sex with my girlfriend. Not everyday or anything, but pretty regularly. It's relatively spontaneous, never any enema first. </p>
<p>And I almost never get shit dick. It's maybe 5% of the time. If the walls are coated in it, how is this possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you have a remarkably courteous and well-prepared girlfriend. </p>
<p>Also has a lot to do with your diet. And the fact that there's definitely shit on your dick, it's just not big brown globs of it. </p></div>		</li>
