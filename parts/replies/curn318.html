<p>So what happened, then? Did you end up passing a stone through your salivary gland, or did the lemon drop just break it up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me too. Didn't know what to do so I went to the walk in and they just put me on antibiotics. It ended up clearing really quick. Didn't even need them I don't think because when it started happening again I just drank a ton of water. It's harmless nothing passes thru and it didn't hurt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something similar happen. It was the middle of summer and our air was broken. I was dehydrated and not eating a whole lot (because the heat made me sick). A stone formed in my salivary gland. The stone was irritating the nerve on the side of my face, so my whole left side of my face was in severe pain. That was a fun 4th of July. </p></div>		</li>
