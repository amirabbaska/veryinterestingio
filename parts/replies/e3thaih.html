<p>It's a nice quip but I've seen some people take issue with it, and try to change it to &quot;extraordinary claims require evidence&quot; or &quot;extraordinary claims require ordinary evidence,&quot; because otherwise it might sound like people use the claim to dismiss claims that have <em>some</em> evidence by saying they don't have <em>enough</em>, which usually isn't the case. People don't dismiss young earth creationism because there isn't <em>enough</em> evidence, they dismiss it because there is <em>no</em> evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, by <em>Ad Ignorantiam</em>, &quot;Absence of evidence is not proof of absence,&quot; which is the common argument for agnosticism. Not knowing does not necessarily default to &quot;untrue.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Belief is a Boolean value, truth is not. </p>
<p>Belief that something is &quot;untrue&quot; is a positive claim. It asserts a truth value. Disbelief is a null claim. It asserts an absence of truth value, e.g. I do not believe it is true or untrue that there is a teapot orbiting Jupiter. </p>
<p>This is not <em>argumentum ad ignorantiam</em>, which asserts that in the absence of <strong>contrary evidence</strong> the asserted truth claim <strong>must be true</strong>, which as you can see is a truth claim, not a statement of belief.</p>
<p>The null hypothesis is the default position, the claimant must move the position of the interlocutor from null to positive. Because one can't believe and not believe something at the same time, but they can withhold the assertion of truth, disbelief with a withheld, or null truth value is the default position.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If prior evidence suggests that mustard does <em>not</em> spontaneously appear in orbit, then the lack of contradictory evidence suggests that Russel's mustard bottle did not spontaneously appear in orbit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reality and is the most common misconception among redditors.</p>
<p>If someone claims <em>there is</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>a teapot orbiting the sun</em> then I too can dismiss that claim, because there very well might be a teapot orbiting the sun. And with how much space junk is out there, and how we might define teapot, I would not be surprised if there was one. </p>
<p>Anyone, making any positive <em>or negative</em> claim, needs to substantiate it. Otherwise, the default position is &quot;I don't know&quot;</p>
<p>So if someone claims there is <strong>not</strong> a God, they need to substantiate there. The default position on any subject is that it may or may not be true, until evidence is presented. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with that.  There are many good reasons to believe such a teapot does not exist based on logic, regardless of specific evidence: primarily, there is no rational way for it to get there in the first place.  </p>
<p>In order for such a teapot to exist, it would need to be put there by means of a rocket.  If such a thing were done, logically you would think someone would know how and why a teapot was launched into space, because launches of rockets are well documented generally and this seems like a notably weird undertaking.  Since no such explanation exists, the most reasonable conclusion is that it never happened.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>sure... but the claim there is not a God is only based on the premise that another formed that God exists initially.</p>
<p>I mean surely I could walk up to you and claim God doesn't exist and you could ask me to prove it.  </p>
<p>I could also argue that there are not invisible pixies who control us and you could ask me to prove it.  But said arguments serve no purpose on their own.</p>
<p>The argument that God doesn't exist is a response to the argument God does exists <strong>AND</strong> the lack of evidence of that existence.</p></div>		</li>
