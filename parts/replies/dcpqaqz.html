			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily true since every time you flush your toilet there is an aerosol spray of microscopic water droplets containing small amount of feces, urine, and other bacteria from your toilet released into the air.  Since most bathrooms have the toilet practically right next to the sink &amp; people generally have their tooth brushes out next to their sink, this aerosol spray coats your toothbrush every time you flush (unless you put the lid down).  </p>
<p>The main reason why you don't usually get sick from using the same toothbrush is due to the fact that the bacteria on your brush are in such small concentrations your immune system will almost always take care of anything that can cause harm to you.  This is slightly similar to how you don't get sick from vaccines, one type of vaccine utilizes live bacteria in small enough concentrations that your body is able to fight off the disease without actually contracting it and getting sick.</p>
