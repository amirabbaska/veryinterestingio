			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is they can't.  Most aerial photos are taken from low altitude airplanes with a camera.  Things like tracking are done with electronic methods and triangulation. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.landinfo.com/geo.htm" target="_blank">One of the best imaging satellites can nearly make out a human with 0.5 meter resolution at 700km away.  But that human would only be about 4 pixels tall.</a>  The moon is about 500x farther away, and the resolution for that would be about 250m per pixel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the best commercial satellites for earth observation, but it probably isn't close to the best among all earth-observing satellites. Its main mirror is just 1.1 m diameter, and as you point out its closest point of approach is 700 km. For comparison, in 2012 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_National_Reconnaissance_Office_space_telescope_donation_to_NASA" target="_blank">NRO offered NASA two left-over 2.4 m space telescopes from the 1990s that it considered to be obsolete</a>. Later satellites in the same NRO series have had main mirror diameters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-11_Kennen" target="_blank">2.9-3.1 m</a>. As the latter article shows, the orbits are also much smaller than the 700 km of GeoEye-1, typically coming as close as 250 km. Such a low orbit is much more expensive since the high drag there severely limits the lifetime of the satellite. The last factor determining resolution is the wavelength of the light being observed, but here GeoEye-1 is pretty optimal, as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Atmospheric_Transmission.png" target="_blank">practically no light with &lt; 400 nm wavelength makes it through the atmosphere</a>, and GeoEye-1's smallest wavelength is 450 nm.</p>
<p>Together these factors result in a factor 8.4 improvement in resolution in the diffraction limit, taking us from 41 cm resolution to 4.9 cm resolution. That's a pretty big improvement - a person flat on the ground would <a href="http://folk.uio.no/sigurdkn/nro_kh11_resolution.png" target="_blank">look something like this</a>.</p>
<p>Larger spy satellites may have been developed since then. There are several classified programs following KH-11 Kennen, such as Misty, each with several billion dollar budgets. A satellite with a main mirror the size of JWST (6.5 m) at 250 km altitude would have a 450 nm diffraction limit of 2 cm. But a mirror that large at such low an altitude would probably be outside even the NRO's budget.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The James Webb telescope has a relatively small aperture.</p>
<p>Upcoming Earth-based telescopes will be much larger, but even the EELT would have trouble seeing the largest features of the lunar landing sites. The previously proposed OWL, which would have had a 100 meter aperture rather than the &quot;mere&quot; 39 meter aperture of EELT, would have had a decent chance of getting a very blurry image of the lunar descent stages and maybe the rovers.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh yeah, and the James Webb Space Telescope is going to the Sun-Earth L2 point, so it's actually going to be further from the Moon than the Hubble Space telescope in Low Earth orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also it will never actually be able to point at the Moon without destroying the optics, because the Moon will always be viewed as close to the Sun.</p></div>		</li>
