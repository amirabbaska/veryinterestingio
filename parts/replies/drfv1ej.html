			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. It doesn't make shit appear out of nowhere, it just alters what's already there. So you're not gonna see like a bear with three heads but more like fractals and moving patterns. I think this is a common misconception about LSD. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Back in college, I remember taking 'shrooms and everyone's face was kind of warped &amp; distorted.  Coupled with the mental distortions, I thought my RA was a bird - not because he was <em>really</em> a bird but because his nose looked <em>way</em> too long and he started taking on a &quot;bird form&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ate acid at work once ( I'm a carpenter) my boss at the time was this really cool old guy with a beard. He was talking to me about my responsibilities for the day. Something I was unable to pay attention to at the time. All I could think, and visualize is, &quot;this guy would look so cool if he smoked tobacco in a pipe.&quot;</p>
<p>The rest of the day was a shit show but I kept my job</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/9UtbCY98Gn8" target="_blank">This is the most accurate depiction of the visuals you get on acid I've seen.</a>.  It's really impossible to make a &quot;LSD simulation&quot; video though.  No matter how accurate they get the visuals, it can't show what acid does to your state of mind so you're not getting the full picture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty close, except with the right dose for each person it is fully controlable! Thats what I enjoyed, i can turn it on or off. My face hurt from smiling for 6 hours though and I had a headache from so much brain activity!</p></div>		</li>
