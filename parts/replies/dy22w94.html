			<div class="markdown"><p>Make the OK sign with one hand and then take turns finger banging it with your fingers and thumb on the other hand. It's odd, but it is the best way. I used to use a glow in the dark powder on my hands, wash them and turn off the lights for students to see. But only after they each did it their own way.</p>
<p>I also let the ones who prefered sanitizer to use that because it demonstrates that while it may &quot;sanitize&quot; your hands, the bacteria and viruses are still left on your hand. It's better to wash all the living stuff off than to kill 99% of it but leave it all the dead germs on your hands with that still living .1%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for the NHS in the UK (I'm non-clinical) and as part of my induction 5 or so people (out of 25/30ish) had this UV stuff on their hands then went around shaking everyone's hands. After they showed us how fast it spread from person to person.
Then they got everyone to go wash their hands just like you said. You could see how some people had no idea how to wash their hands properly / didn't do what the people said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so important. Using hand sanitizers work on a lot of bacteria by breaking apart their cell wall. However some bacteria, like C. diff., form spores or a protective capsule that prevents the effectiveness of just hand sanitizers. Actually scrubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds helps significantly in stopping the spread of C. diff.</p></div>		</li>
