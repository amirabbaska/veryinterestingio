<p>I don't think so. They make the problem way more complicated, and current state of the art machine learning hasn't really caught up yet and have gotten by with a big bag of tricks to &quot;factor out&quot; the time components, but I think it's pretty widely believed that there are limits to these techniques for certain kinds of data. There are also things like recurrent neural networks that do take time into account (in terms of discrete time steps)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i dont think you understand what I mean by timeseries here. I am talking about the nature of data. Most of what we want to know is static. It doesnt involved time series data (even if the data actually is time series) the point is a machine simply has to learn towards one answer. It rarely has to be able to learn, forget, then relearn in different ways. Sure you can just keep running to convergence, but that isnt really learning in a practical sense. Doesnt mean it is too hard, just not usually a trait thats desired. </p></div>		</li>
