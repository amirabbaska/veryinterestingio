			<div class="markdown"><p>Understood, but if a higher paying customer would be guaranteed a spot for carry on luggage, it would seem they would want to spend as little time as possible in the airplane. At least I sure would. Less time on airplane the better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The customers tend to value the prestige of being able to do something before everyone else (getting on board) they also do not have to worry that the overhead space is clogged up. Lastly, long haul flights tend to use the second door for boarding and not the first, this is generally(but not always)where they split the first and business or business and economy classes. This means more prestige and less dealing with the economy masses. What you are referencing front to back is for short medium haul on planes like an A320 or auch. Also, sometimes airports have shitty infrastructure and don't have the ability to board to the second door, so everyone walks through first and business class to get on board. But I think most business customers secretly like that the poor bastards in the back get to see them in their expensive seats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I flew business class last month for the first time. </p>
<p>My thoughts 2 months ago before knowing what business class was :</p>
<p>If I get a business class ticket, I would rather have the privilege to be loaded last to spend minimum time in that plane, less time people kicking my seat, asking me to stand up to get their headphones or pills...</p>
<p>My thought now :</p>
<p>Please open the doors, so I can lay down on my cosy seat with a glass of champagne and some warm almonds, while the air hostess is taking care of hanging my suit. Nobody will touch your seat, nobody will ask you to stand up. You can relax and forget everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a variety of cases studies in business on this stuff, and airlines used to discuss it in their ops and business situations, calls, questions from analysts, etc. but it's kinda been a settled matter for so long that it's just normal procedure now. As you can imagine though, the details and numbers justifications each companies uses are internal only financials. If there are any airline finance guys around they can, if it doesn't destroy ndas walk you through their airline stuff</p></div>		</li>
