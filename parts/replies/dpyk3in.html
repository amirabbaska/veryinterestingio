			<div class="markdown"><p>If we compare a supercar to a bus they are designed for two different functions and can't do the same things.   But that gets me thinking, could one design a 747 sized fighter jet that could do what a f15 or su35 could?  Maybe there are less common examples like the Blackjack Tu-160.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a mass vs force thing. A higher mass leads to larger forces required to turn quickly (F=ma). Since you need bigger wings to create that force, the average force is exerted further away from the fuselage, meaning that the bending moment (and therefore strain) at the wing root is increasing with an exponential function.</p>
<p>As the other guy said, the current materials we have available to manufacture airplanes are just not strong enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fighter jets are insanely heavy aircraft though, an f15 can easily fly heavier than an unladen 727.</p>
<p>Materials strength is fine, you don't need big wings to move fast. You need big wings to move efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The reality is that when you double something's size its weight increases 8 times over.   But the building materials cannot bear anymore pounds of pressure per pound of material.   Because of this scaling effect the requisite safety factor (aka over building it so it doesn't break) needed to make sure the heavy plan doesn't rip itsself apart starts to get closer and closer to the plane just being effectively a solid billet of aluminum.  </p>
<p>The same effect is why a cat can fall from 10 stories up and live, while a human is a bag of shattered bones, and a cow would be splatter all over the place.  </p>
<p>Now this could change if we discovered a material that was both lighter and many, many times stronger than aircraft grade aluminum alloys.  And no carbon fiber is not that material.  Its better, but not even 2 as good, let alone the 100 times as good that would be needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in a house on the final approach to runway 36. About 200m (650ft) from the start of the runway lights and about 0.75km (2400ft) from the start of the runway. Soooo...pretty close.</p>
<p>When the bigger commercial jets came overhead about 5 minutes after they passed we could hear the vortices whipping through the tops of trees. It sounded like creepy whispering or...like a very loud version of the noise you make when trying to get a cat's attention. </p>
<p>When I was younger it scared me cause I didn't know what it was. When I got old enough to understand it was coming from the planes, it became something pretty cool.</p>
<p>Sidenote....it's strange how you become normalized to this sort of thing. When we first moved in we would feel like we had to yell as the jets came into land. But later on...conversations either paused if it was a DC-10 or just continued normally. </p>
<p>Worst/weirdest/most awe-inspiring was when the <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160511141711-antonov-an-225-3-large-169.jpg" target="_blank">Antonov</a> came into land prior to air shows. That thing looked like it was going to squash our little house for certain. It's....obscenely big and looks like there's no logical reason why it should fly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally get this.  When I was in high school, the school was pretty much at the end of a runway that serviced F-111s (loud).  We called it the &quot;Lakenheath Pause&quot;.  Strangely, the same sound a little further from the runway helped sleep at night. </p>
<p>After my dad retired from the military I missed it very much.  Later in life, I bought a house that is on the glide path to the local Naval Reserve Base and a Lockheed assembly plant.</p>
<p>I sleep well and love floating in my pool watching a huge variety of jets land right over me.  Watching a C-5 Galaxy do touch-and-gos, is pretty damn cool.</p></div>		</li>

Honestly I think part of the reason it's done is for a lot of people that is the pinnacle of public recognition they will ever get for something they said.
