			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, no: their anger is being suppressed by other systems in their body, so they aren't normally feeling anger.  I was just showing the two extremes people can go to; most people fall somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>It can all come down to something like how efficient someone's thyroid is as to what happens to their emotions when alcohol enters the bloodstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just means that they were very likely angry before becoming drunk that specific time. Alcohol tends to increase whatever emotion the person is experiencing at the time, so if they're happy before becoming intoxicated, they'll be a happy drunk... that time. If they're sad before becoming intoxicated, they'll be a sad drunk... that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy said you are either an angry drunk or a sleepy drunk.</p>

<p>I believe that yes angry drunks are angry people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if someone (definitely not me) tends to fall asleep but then becomes angry and sleep cusses out anyone attempting to wake them? What if they were to constantly say &quot;thank you, fuck off&quot; to whom ever tried to wake them after drinking and falling asleep? Once again this is obviously an entirely hypothetical situation related to no one in my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then their body obviously tries to find equilibrium while suppressing consciousness, but this reaction doesn't prevent the emotions from running amok.</p>
<p>Of course, the anger could be totally justified, as someone is trying to pull you (er, them) out of a state where your body is frantically attempting to repair itself.  If I had a gaping wound and had finally fallen asleep and was getting better, I'd be annoyed at the person who woke me up too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always get sleepy when I get drunk, but now when people ask me about it I'll have to lie or risk looking like some &quot;holier than thou&quot; kinda person</p></div>		</li>
