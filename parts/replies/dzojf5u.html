			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you someone that actually knows what im talking about. I got 5 hours of sleep last night and had to go to work this morning. Felt like shit all day and went to look it up and no answer as to why this response happens only that it does happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad had something very similar (maybe even the same?) and it absolutely ruined him emotionally, because he could never find treatment all his life and was basically dragging himself through his working life while battling an invisible disability that nobody recognised, let alone accommodated.</p>
<p>My dad having the same problem makes me think that perhaps it is either genetic (like Dysautonomia or auto-immune disease) or something that can be spread within a family through bacteria or a virus (Epstein Barr or something like that). I'm honestly too tired and exhausted to go on pestering doctors to test me for outlandish things like that (they don't really take you seriously because they can't understand what you are really talking about). Considering that there are no therapies for either of these possible conditions, it would be a purely academic endeavour anyway, so I don't bother. It sucks... sorry you are cursed like that too :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would check all the serious medical things first like sleep apnea.
It sucks theres nothing they can do for chronic fatigue - its literally ruining my life so I feel ya.
Do you find exercise or big days make it worse?/ need increased sleep?</p>
<p>I find that I cant actually exercise, because it has the same effect. If I have one big day, I have to counter it with 3 small days afterwards - which include over 9 hrs of sleep plus naps.
Anyway, turned out I have Lyme disease. Theres nothing they can really do for that either. Lame.
Just have to moderate life tightly.</p>
<p>But I would highly suggest doing an in hospital sleep study.  The take home ones arent as good. Plus full blood test. Plus exclude gluten from your diet, Ive been told its advised for any fatigue sufferers.
Also before you start smoking cannabis, talk to someone about melaton pills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, long days or exercise need me to nap for 3-4 hours and overall increase my fatigue. Apart from the increased fatigue, exercise does make me feel quite good though. Lifts some of the brain fog and just makes my body feel like it's &quot;working normally&quot; (idk how to describe it, like I can feel how my body is finally &quot;justifiably&quot; tired from activity and going into proper recovery-mode) rather than constantly attacking itself to the brink of exhaustion. I do light yoga and swimming on weekends. Running is out of question, it causes me weird asthmatic fits even though I have good stamina during swimming and don't have asthma (was tested for it a lot as a child because I would regularly collapse wheezing and unable to catch my breath in PE). </p>
<p>I've had sleep studies before, but no indication for sleep apnea. Thanks for mentioning Lyme disease, I shall explore this further! All the best to you :-)</p></div>		</li>
