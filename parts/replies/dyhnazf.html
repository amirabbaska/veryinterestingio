			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been told that the reason there are few to no records of arachnid or fauna like that is that flora from the early stages of life on Earth were incapable to produce sap, therefore impossible to trap random animals for posteriority.  </p>
<p>I've always found that to be an interesting fact regarding the lack of evidence from a certain period, could anyone confirm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it's more likely that sap only preserved critters crawling around on trees, and primitive spiders were more likely in holes, shrubs, ferns and the like.</p>
<p>People tend to greatly overestimate the completeness of the fossil records. The environmental requirements to have ANYTHING preserved in a recognizable state are staggering. </p>
<p>It's reasonable to believe we only have a tiny fraction of the full picture of animals that lived that long ago, because the vast majority of animals didn't die next to perfect sediment filled riverbeds or wander into a sap of the right consistency that it became a preserving amber.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question directly.... kinda, but it was such an extremely rare event in the first place(considering how many animals have died vs how many fossils exist), it's really more of a surprise that we get any fossils at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is, for one, arachnids don't have hard parts, i.e. things that are hardy enough to survive undamaged through the fossilization period and resist decomposition. This is why we have amazing fossils of things like trilobites and ancient gastropods and mollusks. </p>
<p>Secondly, anything living on land is at a disadvantage of preservation due to the fact that erosion generally occurs faster than deposition. That's why the majority of fossils that we have are mostly aquatic critters.</p>
<p>The last condition for good preservation is for the critter to die in a low oxygen area, in order to halt decomposition long enough to be buried and fossilized. Again, land based animals are at a disadvantage due to high oxygen content, wheras in the ocean, oxygen is lower at the floor. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, insects and spiders fail at all three of those conditions. The decompose easily, they have no real hard parts like calcium carbonate shells or bones, and they thrive in high oxygen environments, as well as being land based. While the sap thing plays a part in it maybe, that's the real reason why there are so few fossils of them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>those secretions became more refined and the spiders could use it as a soggy kind of net by dragging it around the top of low grass or plants</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are there any examples of this kind of behaviour today? Today we have spiders that line their burrows with silk, and we have spiders that build webs. But I never heard of spiders that just leave a sticky mat on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of this exercise is to determine the origin of the silk, as complex mechanisms all have to originate in simpler forms. </p>
<p>While there aren't any spiders still that secrete mucus instead of silk, in nature mucus is pretty much everywhere. Insects, mammals, amphibians, fish, invertebrates of all types. Mucus is omni-present and has evolved separately in different lineages(Like how the pinhole eyes of the nautilidae evolved on an entirely separate track from our own).</p>
<p>While simple and effective, it's not hard to imagine a more controlled, firm, water resistant form would greatly benefit the survival chances of the spider over a sticky mucus. As such, the evolutionary pressures that developed it would be working hard to select for the more advanced form.</p>
<p>Another person in this thread mentioned Dawkins' excellent book &quot;Climbing Mount Improbable&quot; as a primer for understanding the selective pressures of nature, and I have to second that if this stuff is interesting to you.</p>
<p>I'd also throw in &quot;Evolution: The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. </p>
<p>My theory on there being no more mucosal spiders (that we're aware of) is that silk from mucus is one of the &quot;easier&quot; pathways of evolution that yields significant benefits, which greatly increases the chance that silken spiders would outcompete their mucosal counterparts pretty much every time.</p>
<p>There's a real possibility that in a cave or on an island somewhere a more primitive offshoot still exists, but given the many millions of years selective evolutionary pressure has been working on them, it's plenty of time for the old unsuccessful models to die out.</p>
<p>When's the last time you ran into a Neanderthal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't asking whether there are still spiders that use mucus. I was asking whether there were spiders that line the ground with webs.</p>
<p>You have described an evolutionary chain from lining the walls of burrows, to spinning vertical webs. With an intermediate step being a sort of &quot;ground webs&quot;. We still have living examples of the first step. Tarantulas line their burrows with silk. I see no reason not to have living examples of the intermediate step. It's a valid ecological niche, not in competition with spiders that make vertical webs to trap flying insects. </p>
<p>You can read Dawkins' &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; if you want to learn more about how a new species might split off to fill a new ecological niche, while the original species remains.</p>
<p>After some thought, funnel spiders might be an example. They cover an area of ground around their nest with sticky webbing, and small ground animals get trapped in it. This fits your proposed evolutionary chain well, as it's a natural extension from lining the burrow. </p>
<p>There's still a bit of a missing link in the intermediate steps going from lining the ground with webs, to stringing the webs up in the air. Maybe some sort of tree dwelling funnel spiders bridged that gap. If they already had the instinct to cover stuff with sticky webs, and the environment provided branches, then spreading the web between branches would be beneficial, and thus selected for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, just spitballing here..
step 1: live in burrows, ambush hunt from the burrow, bringing prey back into burrow to eat </p>
<p>step 2: develop secretions that helps the burrow from collapsing </p>
<p>step 3: as the secretions become more and more sticky (better for burrow construction), after some &quot;prey begin to get stuck&quot; stickiness threshold, the prey begin to get stuck on the walls of the burrow as the spider brings them inside to eat.  It annoys spiders at first, - so a spider leaves a prey item all caught up in sticky secretions on the wall and ambushes a fresh, clean prey that it senses right outside the burrow.  The spider getting fresh prey, ignoring the prey still caught in the secretions on the wall, until there is an ebb in prey availability.  Then the spider in the burrow notices the prey still stuck in the wall and eats it.  And survives better through the hunting ebbs.</p>
<p>step 4.  now after the &quot;prey begin to get stuck&quot; stickiness threshold is passed, the more and more sticky the secretions become the better their new &quot;saving prey stuck in the walls for hunting ebbs&quot; technique becomes.  So the secretions get really sticky.  insects that wander into the burrow begin to get stuck on their own.  </p>
<p>So then spiders that go crazy in putting secretions over their walls begin to outcompete others with less secretions on the walls.  The secretions then begin to fill the burrow up, but the spiders still have this increasing drive to spread secretions on surfaces, so they begin to secrete on the mouth of their burrows, so insects that are just walking over the rim of the mouth of the burrow begin to get stuck.</p>
<p>So the spiders that secrete on the mouth of their burrows begin to outcompete.  So then the more a spider secretes outside the mouth of their burrow outcompetes those who just secrete a little. etc.</p>
<p>step 5:  then it is more about refining.  They now have mats of secretions on the ground around the burrow, and over millions of years those that survive better have more refined mats, the silk becomes silk and not just stick spread out globs.  </p>
<p>step 6:  spreading a sticky mat away from the burrow, then up on a plant, then up in a tree... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like very much where your head is at with this. </p>
<p>The only modification I would make is some wording regarding the changes from step to step. I feel like it might be assigning agency and decision-making to the spiders as opposed to representing the naturally selective pressures.</p>
<p>But that's just my inner pedantic Richard Dawkins. I like your outline a lot, and while we don't know anything for certain I feel that you're definitely on the right path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, any agency soundyness would be trying to ELI5. I do wonder though if anything like this is the way it happened, if there was a single spider that at one time looked up at an insect on its wall that got stuck there before by accident and made the decision to eat it. that would have been one decision by one spider that could have decided not to eat it.  can spiders make decisions?  i guess so.  </p></div>		</li>
