			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're talking about chips in the same generation, this is incorrect*. Each core in a chip of the same generation has the same baseline IPC. What makes an i7 better than an i3 of the same generation, which is more applicable to their question, is the features and number of cores on each chip.</p>
<p>Features - the i7 has a lot more enabled that may or may not be relevant to the average consumer. The only things that would make a typical consumer's experience better is hyperthreading and turbo boost. Hyperthreading allows each core to do 2 things at once instead of 1. Depending on what you are doing this can almost double the amount of work each core can do. Turbo boost is a feature that lets the chip overclock itself, increasing it's clock speed as far as the temperature will allow.</p>
<p>Number of cores - an i7 will often have more cores than an i3. An i3 will typically have 2 to 4. An i7 will typically have 4 to 6. </p>
<p>*If you do basic arithmetic each core in an i7 will have exactly the same IPC as an i3 as it fully negates the benefits of hyperthreading and increased cache in i7 chips as basic arithmetic operations chew up the entire CPU pipeline and is not dependent on memory operations. In this case the i7 is better than an i3 due to the number of cores and turbo boost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't heard to avoid HT, but oftentimes the performance boost from an i5 to an i7 isn't considered to be worth it for the price increase in a pure gaming rig. The difference would be noted with a rig that's also used for video editing, CAD, other applications that rely on CPU performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for IPCs within the same generation, different chips may have differing amounts of the highest level of cache, which can affect IPC a little. The more L3 cache it has the less often it will need to spend of clock cycles to access RAM. Accessing RAM can treasure hundreds of clock cycles, although modem CPUs do a good job of hiding this latency with things like prefetching, out of order processing, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. Memory and cache performance can make a huge difference when comparing modern processors because memory access is WAY more time consuming than computation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you say is not entirely true. Few things a processor does are solely math. Memory operations also make up a very large part of the workload. So the increased cache of an i7 vs an i3 does allow it to execute a notable amount more instructions per second for MOST workloads. The processor may be capable of the same IPC, but when memory comes into play such as in most tasks, a larger cache helps immensely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I mention it in the * section. Processor performance is complicated and dependent on the workload. I decided to skip over the cache differences to keep it simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems clear but could you ELI5:Laundry using CPU as comparison?</p>
<p>Seriously tho, one of best ELI5-answer this year.
Thanks, i've learned.</p></div>		</li>
