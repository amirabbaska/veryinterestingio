			<div class="markdown"><p>No, thank you for sharing.  I've been watching you and Destin on youtube since I can remember creating an account to subscribe to people.  Every day at 5pm I watch the Philip DeFranco show, monday's are dude perfect...but oh boy when I see you and Destin pop up in the subscriptions I sit down and take in the education!  It's great stuff, and my favorite was your series on twisting the dragon's tail man.  Fantastic work that should be shown in science classes everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
