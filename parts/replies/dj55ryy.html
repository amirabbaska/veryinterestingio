			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the detailed answer! When you say sudden increase in systolic pressure, I assume that a good example is exercise (as opposed to a slow increase in systolic pressure which might be a consequence of bad eating habits). Does sarcomere replication in this case create any noticeable heart enlargement?</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm not understanding correctly.</p></div>		</li>
