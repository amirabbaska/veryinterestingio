			<div class="markdown"><p>this is my understanding as well, as a pharmacist who has done compounding of &quot;bioidentical hormone&quot; products. they sound nice and all, and if your symptoms are relieved I'm all for it, but I think at least some of the benefit is placebo. most of the studies showing benefit I read were small scale and backed by companies with an interest in compounding those medicines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the review article in OP (which is almost the entirety of my knowledge on the subject), it sounds like what you're describing is the case.</p>
<p>I will mention that the review in the OP links to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076012002567" target="_blank">another review</a> that, in its abstract, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, current research demonstrates that phytoestrogens are effective in reducing the intensity of hot flushes, and some phytoestrogen combinations result in a decreased frequency. Certain phytoestrogens have also been shown to decrease vaginal atrophy, improve sleep and cognition, and positively affect bone health. Even though initial research was generally unconvincing, the more recent evidence reviewed here is rather positive.</p>

<p>I am avoiding things like oil in plastic bottles and chewing gum with endocrine disruptors, but it is really difficult to avoid it all. I wonder about the really vague and small effects, such as <em>middleaged men who lost all initiative and only want to laze on the sofa because of low testosterone</em> – do they also become affected by the amount and type of endocrine disruptors in our environment? If the population as a whole becomes 10 % more tired / energetic / aggressive / kind / whatever because of these chemicals, artificial or natural just more of them around us than before – does it change our society? To the better or worse? Difficult to measure, but important I think. </p>
<p>And hot flashes just takes out so much energy from you and disrupts sleep as well.</p></div>		</li>
