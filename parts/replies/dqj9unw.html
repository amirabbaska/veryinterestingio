<p>$3.84/40 people = ... ~10 cents.</p>
<p>There are 384 pennies in $3.84. But you're only sharing with 39 other people, not 390.</p>
<p>Or did you mean $0.384?</p>
<p>Or did I miss something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This Is great if we are only talking about direct cost, but there is a ton of other cost you have to take into account to get the true operating cost of that tower. There are dozens of other people involved in developing, implementing, maintaining, selling, and marketing the product. So while you give a great idea what the signal alone takes to produce, the cost to AT&amp;T overall would be higher. How much higher is anyone’s guess. I worked for AT&amp;T in project management for a few years, and their organization is vast, confusing, and just plain scary. I don’t know if even their best accountant can tell you the true cost of 1 gb of data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose this is apples and oranges but with logistics in mind for delivery of a parcel or data, no matter, individual jobs and work behind that doesn't ultimately mean that number is wrong.  The postal service pays mechanics, mail handlers, clerks, supervisors, managers, truck drivers, carriers, distribution facilities, processing facilities, as well as area offices to sort and deliver mail.  To mail one letter from california to new jersey, would involve just 33 individual people to handle that letter, whom all make salary, but in the way data is handled for consumer cell phones would carry the same concept that it's not handling just one letter or 1gb for one customer at a time, its handling the services for many many customers all at once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m with you there, not saying the number is wrong, just pointing out that production cost can have a ton of backend that is hard to calculate. It is always tough to calculate the “real” cost of any product. But the assessment above does a great job of breaking down the basic cost of production.</p></div>		</li>
