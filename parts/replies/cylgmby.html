			<div class="markdown"><p>That particular Japanese sentence isn't a good example because there aren't spaces in Japanese sentences, plus it's really short. So the second が is noticed immediately.</p>
<p>I'll post an entire paragraph (for context) with a superfluous character that can be easily glossed over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>世界最大の家電見本市「ＣＥＳ」が６日、米ラスベガスで開幕する。今年はは3600社以上が出展。９日までの会期中に15万～17万人の来場を見込む。「家電」の枠を超えて広がるテクノロジーの祭典の見どころを紹介する。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read this quickly then you wouldn't notice that I added a second は to the second paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>今年は<strong>は</strong>3600社以上が出展。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: I may have accidentally gamed this one by setting the word wrap in the comment box to separate the two characters.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you. You made a very valid point. The が was very obvious in the first example, but the は here is definitely less obvious. Whether I would gloss over or not would greatly depend on my concentration level though, I feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Native Chinese speaker here to answer your question:</p>
<p>Yes, we still notice it. In Chinese, writing a word more than once can, in certain cases, alter the meaning of the sentence, mainly when quantifying. Adding an extra character where there should not be will not go unnoticed, and may even throw someone who is not a native speaker off. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't speak for Japanese, but I would assume that it is a similar story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese here! (or half-japanese but I hope that counts)</p>
<p>First off I would like to clarify that OP's example isn't exactly ideal because, although &quot;が&quot; can be considered a word, it is also just one character so imo it's a lot easier to spot. The same way it is easy to sppot tthe addded chataccters inn this sentencce. </p>
<p>Otherwise I still think that japanese speakers wouldn't skip a word like that because as you mentioned adding a single word can have a very big effect on the meaning of the entire sentence.
Additionally I think that when reading in Japanese you read it character for character and you, at least from my experience, don't read the words around whatever you are reading at that moment, I don't really do the ignoring thing either. </p>
<p>Hope I made my point clear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Chinese doesn't have articles, like &quot;the&quot;.  It's a very dense language, and it's made even more dense by the way Chinese people often omit implied words, like pronouns, for example.  The English language, by comparison, can often be filled with superfluous words that don't add a lot of meaning, so we get used to ignoring them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the asian languages then not as susceptible to the &quot;using 10 words when 4 will do&quot; style of speaking that many of our western talking heads adopt?</p>
<p>I'm not fluent in any language other than my native English, even then that is sometimes in question, so I also wonder if other languages have that particular trait? I assume &quot;the languages&quot; of love can definitely be spoken in long eloquent verses that could be shortened to two word answers?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, Cantonese does have words equivalent to &quot;the&quot; in English. We use quantifiers without numerals to identify objects the listener supposed to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Korean has an alphabet like English, but basically letters make up each character. Each character is a single syllable, so of course one or more syllables make individual words.</p>
<p>So yes, you can &quot;parse&quot; it in much the same way as English when reading.</p>
<p>Source: Me speaky the the Korean.</p>
<p>Edit - Should note of course grammar is vastly different. But general parsing and the skipping of typos without noticin etc is similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about you, but I do find the written Korean that still occasionally trips me up when reading after all these years is English words represented in Hangul. Oh the irony. </p>
<p>Sometimes it's a bit of head scratch and I need to go slow to figure out what it is meant to be, especially when you factor in some English words are &quot;spelled&quot; with an American accent. For a Brit, the &quot;Hot&quot; of Hot chocolate becoming &quot;Hat&quot; is forever confusing :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's entirely possible to read Korean sentences without particles, and the current theory is that they are handy to avoid confusion, but most people (native Korean speakers) don't actually read particles when reading a sentence.  There is an interesting paper by 김태호, a professor at Pusan National University, about this very thing.  He built a corpus to study how and when Korean speakers drop particles in spoken and written language, especially informal written language (text messages, internet comments, etc.)</p>
