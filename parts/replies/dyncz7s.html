Change to an ssd, as I'm always doing the wrong thing on auto pilot (ie making breakfast in the evening when I just washed up a bowl to mix up some pizza base), and a larger capacity so I don't forget anything anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We call some computer models &quot;neural networks&quot; because they do in fact mimic biology. Our brains are really good at storage. We only keep what's different, and kind of refer to a pointer index in our brain to a previous event that is common. Think of it like driving. Most of the time you aren't paying attention because its routine. It doesn't mean you aren't actively paying attention, your brain just doesn't see the point in remembering something identical. Muscle memory is a thing for this reason. </p>
<p>I digress. CRISPR is attempting to modify our genetic code real time; removing genetic abnormalities as it goes. We are trying to integrate human and mechanical enhancements. Missing limbs is one example; enhanced eye-sight is another. Being able to wear a mechanical suite that makes you a Mech while being able to carry thousands of extra pounds is a reality. Being able to modify our genes, enhancing our mortal abilities, and extending those abilities with machinery at a biological level is in the works.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been suggested that what we know about metabolism doesn't explain the amount of processing a brain <em>would</em> need to do in order to produce the outcomes we observe at the speed they are observed.   </p>
<p>In other words saying that your brain computes the outcome might be somewhat less credible when we take what we know about the actual processing power of <em>n</em> neurons and the amount of energy it would require for them to make the necessary calculations to complete everyday tasks like driving or catching a ball in flight while also sustaining our general intelligence.   </p>
<p>For that reason there has been some thought into the idea that the brain is more antenna than computer and it follows the vectors through configuration space that have the highest entropy.   It doesn't calculate your actions,  it tracks your consciousness to the configurations that produce the same results as if it had calculated them.  </p>
<p>But also that could just be a thought exercise which is fine too.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To arrive at a practical conclusion about future events via <em>computation</em> it is necessary to run a physical simulation on your computing hardware and play it forward ahead of observed events.   </p>
<p>Computing isn't free, even in the mind and our brains do use a lot of energy (calories)  but running an accurate simulation of the universe on hardware like what our brains are made from may not be possible.  </p>
<p>So we may not predict future events by calculating them.   </p>
<p>Instead our minds may see a field of equally real futures and select one of them based on how coherent it is.    </p>
<p>That might be <strong>crudely</strong> compared to a surfer who doesn't have a planned path across the waves,  they only want to stay upright as long as possible and the path they actually follow reflects nothing more than shifting their weight to stay in the middle of the wave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he is saying that the brain is just a giant, complex lookup-table. Instead of calculating outcomes, the brain searches its database of experiences for something similar. This can happen in abstract terms so that after the brain saw that putting two bananas next to another one gives you 3 bananas, it predict the outcome of the same situation, but with apples instead for example.</p>
<p>To explain the vectors through entropy thing( if i understood correctly): Our journey starts in the visual cortex where the signals from the eye are compared to things that were seen before. The brain from this one step might be able to figure out that we are looking at apples. It also has connections that indicated that apples are objects. These connections with 'objects' might then directly or indirectly lead us to the part of the brain where our mathematical knowledge is stored. Here the brain can search for object addition. </p>
<p>We moved through the brain getting ever closer to finding a prediction for our situation without actually directly calculating anything. </p></div>		</li>
