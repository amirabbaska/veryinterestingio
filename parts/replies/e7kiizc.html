			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair,  the Sun isn't all that different.   The power density of the Sun is about the same as the heat generated from a compost pile.   That's why fusion efforts on earth need to achieve plasma temperatures and pressures much greater than that of the Sun's core to produce something useful. </p>
<p>Small power densities overt big volumes can still add up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the point though is it? This thread is about the energy at the Earth's surface, of which the Sun is providing several orders of magnitude more watts than the Earth's internal heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That comparison doesn't mean much, because people don't generally have an intuition for the heat of a compost pile. Compost piles can spontaneously self-combust if they are of the right size.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the sun has a max of 1000 W/m^2 at the average distance of earth, and after the atmosphere and other interactions you end up seeing normally 200-800 W/m^2, which is all still orders of magnitude greater than the mW/m^2 which /u/archlich quotes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the energy released from the core of the sun is similarly unimpressive - about the same as the radiation from the human body on a per-kg basis. It's just that there's LOTS of mass involved, so it adds up to a fair bit of energy.</p>
<p>In the case of the sun, it intuitively makes sense that the energy released shouldn't be insanely high, otherwise the sun wouldn't be able to shine for 10 billion years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, but with 510 trillion square meters of Earth surface, that's still firmly in the TW (Terra-watt?) range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but compared to the numbers in the infographic, that is 4-5 orders of magnitude difference.</p></div>		</li>
