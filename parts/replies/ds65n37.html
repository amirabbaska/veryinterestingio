<p>for the first few years, they would just buy commodity whisky from other distilleries, bottle &amp; label it, and sell it under their own name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also happens a lot in the wine world with estate vinyards selling off excess grapes, and wineries selling off excess juice and even bulk wine that either doesn't fit their flavour profile or is leftover.</p>
<p>It's interesting that it happens in the wine and spirits world but doesn't really happen in the beer world. I guess the closest thing would be contract brewing where a brewery has excess fermentation and brewing capacity and &quot;sells&quot; it to another company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Finland, the market-dominant K-Market supermarket chain's store brand &quot;Pirkka&quot; lager is the local Olvi brewery's B-grade product relabeled, which is why it always tastes a bit different. It's whatever didn't quite hit the flavor profile for Olvi's own lager, so it's off the mark in various different ways depending on which batch you get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to state what you said a little more clearly for the masses:</p>
<p><strong>An overwhelming majority of craft/micro-distiller whiskey you see on the shelves is rebottled spirit that was bought from another, much bigger producer.</strong> And of that, a humongous portion is all coming from one place. Outside of the standard Kentucky and Tennessee distillers that have been around for decades, there are fewer American distillers producing their own high quality, decently aged (6+ years) whiskey than you can count on one hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleh. I don't want this. It seems disingenuous. What questions should I be asking to identify these distilleries? I'm interested in getting into distilling but not if this is the game. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of them say &quot;distilled in Indiana&quot; somewhere on the label, which means they come from MGP. </p>
<p>The thing is that MGP actually makes really high quality whiskey, which is part of the reason why these brands continue to exist and be successful. But it's important to know what you are buying. And it's also important to know that you'll see an MGP whiskey at $50 sitting right next to another, almost identical MGP whiskey at $25 with a different label. </p>
<p>Scroll down to Midwest Grain Producers in <a href="http://recenteats.blogspot.com/p/the-complete-list-of-american-whiskey.html" target="_blank">this list</a> to get an idea of just how many brands use their spirit.</p></div>		</li>
