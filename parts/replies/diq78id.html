			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly back into space, although technically some gets absorbed into the water as heat. You can think of thin clouds like thin blankets or sheets on a fort. A thin sheet still lets a lot of light through, just like thin clouds. But add more layers to your fort and it gets darker, even if you're only adding a thin layer.</p>
<p>The clouds on top reflect back the most, but some light gets through. Then the next layer of clouds reflects more back up into the sky. And so on down through the cloud. The more cloud there is, the darker it gets. </p>
<p>Naturally, the clouds aren't in distinct layers the way that blankets are, but it works the same way for the most part. Clouds that are denser just have more &quot;layers&quot; for the light to pass through, and thin wispy clouds have a lot less. The biggest part of why rain clouds are so much more noticeable with regards to their color is because they tend to be a lot bigger. </p></div>		</li>
