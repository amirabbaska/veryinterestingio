			<div class="markdown"><p>Well...</p>
<p>For most of mankind history the life expectancy at birth was in that ballpark (if not even lower). It wasn't until VERY recently that we could increase it substantially.
Of course, the data is difficult to analyze, basically is you survive until 18 you had a good chance to get to 60 but many died young so the average is what we [get] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy</a>). Maybe is the same is for the other animals. Not sure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, even the wikipedia page you cite ends with saying that the theory doesn't hold when you do proper stats (correcting for confounds).</p>
<p>Heartbeat needs to be faster for smaller animals to ensure adequate blood flow. If you don't take that into account, what looked like a fascinating scaling law just becomes the trivial observations that large animals live longer (by the time an elephant is fully matured, you can grow 50 generations of mice).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory just seems totally wrong. The human age is way off, it has obvious exceptions in birds, and has no predictive power. </p>
<p>It is a lot more likely that it is just the fact that larger animals tend to live longer, likely because they do not need rapid generations to survive, and they are just misatributing the statistical correlation. It would also explain birds, which have wings,  and so are harder to kill, and large ones with short lifespans, like elk, which are usually prey. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, &quot;theory&quot; doesn't mean &quot;hypothesis.&quot; This is a statistically confirmed trend. Human age isn't <em>that</em> off. Primates tend to buck the trend a little, but not too much. And while some birds provide exceptions, many others fit the bill just fine. Birds also tend to have longer lifespans in general, which would indicate something unique occuring in their evolutionary history. What's interesting is that the majority of animals do follow this trend and when exceptions do occur, they are typically found in specific clades (meaning a group of species that can be traced to a single common ancestor), something that indicates unique biology.</p>
<p>The main thing is this isn't considered an absolute, perfectly predictive law. It's just a confirmed trend that is interesting and worth examining and probably applies to the original question.</p></div>		</li>
