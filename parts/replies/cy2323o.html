<p>There's also been zero evidence to support any of the CISA amendments will actually help stop terrorism or cyber threats.  </p>
<p>And for all of the people who say &quot;Oh well our government will never be THAT bad and persecute people like that&quot;, it's worth remembering that the US has a terrible history of being terrible civil rights abusers. </p>
<p>So far, in our short history we've managed to persecute: </p>
<ul>
<li>african american/blacks (segregation, slavery)</li>
<li>gay/lesbian people</li>
<li>native americans </li>
<li>suspected communists (McCarthyism)</li>
<li>Japanese (internment camps)</li>
</ul>
<p>The US doesn't exactly have a stellar track record of respecting human rights. Why would we want to give our government the data to push more abuse on more groups of people, when there's zero evidence to support that it will actually make a positive difference? </p></div>		</li>

<p>America has a problem pulling the trigger too quickly. (See what I did there?) We don't seem to ponder the ethics of (insert any topic here) and just have knee jerk emotional reactions we take actions on. It's easy and all too human. </p>
<p>I think the Chinese should make the list due to their treatment between 1850s to 1950s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You all are touching on something so close to what the real issue is, but it's not quite there. The issue isn't even what could be done with this stuff. It shifts the balance of power. That's what the american governmental design was all about, balancing the power so no small group of people had power over another. These sorts of actions shift power away from the common man, the voter, into the hands of the federal government. There are a million reasons why this is bad and a million reasons it's 100% happening here. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Or worst, that is what is already happening with our politicians.  Why has Obama done a 180 on so many of his civil liberties positions.  Why the hell are Republicans and Democrats agreeing on this crap when they don't agree on anything and would love to have a &quot;wedge&quot; issue to beat the other side with.  It doesn't seem like a corporate buyoff since so many huge corporations are against it and there is no reason why they would want to build backdoors into their own applications.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously. There was testimony from someone involved in the surveillance that they were looking at Obama while he was a senator, they're demonstrably not above blackmail (granted, MLK was a while ago, but there's no evidence for improvement), and 50% of people (politicians included) cheat on their spouses. It doesn't even require a conspiracy, just someone using their power to keep their job.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Best part is, if only they have access to the data,  they can make stuff up, and you have no way to fight it. Just look at the cluster fuck the no fly list is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This bit scares me the most.  You can made a patsy for anything they want just be claiming 'you torrented some terrorpedo pornbombs or whatever and its completely legal how we came to have this totally genuine information, although no one else has any way of verifying it.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had a redditor disbelieve a story I told about my sister being shot in the neck, so he dug WAY back into the comments to find another instance in which I mentioned the story, but some minor detail was slightly different (I think it was the amount of the medical bill or something).</p>
<p>Then he went even further and started looking for news stories, and eventually got my sister's first and last name and said something like &quot;Unless your sister is [first name] [last name],&quot; you're lying. Yeah, he doxxed my sister to win an online argument. </p>
