			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the &quot;handle&quot; is attached to what looks like a metal clothesline in the plane.  Parachuters stand up, hook up, and then jump, as they fall, the cord is pulled by their weight and the parachute is deployed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ejection seats also use explosive charges to deploy the parachute---which is absolutely critical for the pilot during a zero-zero ejection. I believe they use the term 'ballistic spread' vice 'aerodynamic spread' with regard to parachute inflation, but I'm not an AME.</p></div>		</li>
