			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a LOT of things that are attributed to BP, blood vessel length is just one of them. It doesn't mean all obese people are going to have higher BP, but it is a contributing factor.  Thankfully there are a lot of checks and balances in the body that help to regulate BP.</p>
<p>In your case, it might be an issue of low blood volume, low viscosity, or even inappropriate vasodilation. It's probably best to keep an eye on it and keep visiting the doctor. </p></div>		</li>
