			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have it in front of me, but I once read about a study in which people of various age groups drank water sweetened with increasing measures of sugar until they felt it was too sweet. Adults liked it to be somewhat sweet but on average wanted it less sweet than the other groups (but there were individual outliers). People in their late teens and early 20s liked tthings sweeter than adults but still had a limit. Most of the young children had to be cut-off because they never told them to stop, even at something like double the sugar in the sweetest one any other group accepted.</p></div>		</li>
