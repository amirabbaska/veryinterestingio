			<div class="markdown"><p>A slight correction on the physics: carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 via beta decay, not into &quot;bog standard&quot; carbon-12 (which would involve losing two neutrons without losing any protons, and I'm not sure if that's even possible). It makes little difference for this purpose, however.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A more recent approach is to look not at the pigments but at little calcite concretions that sometimes form on top of cave paintings, like mini stalagmites. </p>

<p>Is interesting. I know you cannot use the rate of their growth, because that is way too variable. It is affected by pH, temperature, water cycles, humidity, etc. I used to explore caves with my buddies in Northern California in college. We found old mines ~100-150 years old that already had substantial Stalagmite and Stalactite formation in that short a time. The most amazing one I found was a fly that was partially encased in calcite. </p>
<p>So I would still say those methods could have a large variability.</p></div>		</li>
