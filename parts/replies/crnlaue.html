			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this a little bit, there is a number called &quot;penetration depth&quot; of the metal (EDIT: source- given as &quot;Skin Depth&quot; in Griffiths EM, page 394). There's an exponential decay of the intensity of light when it passes through a material, so the penetration depth is like the 'half-distance' (by analog with half-life for exponential decays in time) for the intensity of the light to decay. For those who want more jargon, it's essentially an optical attenuation length. </p>
<p>I briefly worked with nano-films, and we'd deposit films of gold of about 20 nanometers to about 100 nanometers on glass slides for our experiments. This is about 100-1000 atoms thick. The 20 nm films were translucent with a yellow hue but the 100 nm films were almost opaque because the penetration depth was comparable to the thickness of the 20 nm film. Anything substantially thicker than &quot;nanoscale&quot; would be completely opaque because of the absorption of the material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the light actually penetrate the metal though, or is the coating so irregular that there are lots of empty areas where it can pass through?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I frequently fabricate gold films and investigate their optics. Even continuous smooth films which are thin enough transmit light! Below 50 nm thickness, the light transmitted through gold is green (imagine all the colours that aren't reflected are coming through - the green would normally be absorbed in reflection). At 20 nm the gold is still a continuous film mostly, and transmission of green light is still substantial. Below this, additional light is transmitted, but achieving a continuous film is harder!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is a little bit of both. I wouldn't call the coating irregular, but in any material there is actually quite a bit of empty space. For a photon (light particle) to be absorbed by a metal particle, it must strike it just right. In a thin film the probability of this happening is fairly low and the photon might pass by many metal particles without incident. As the material gets thicker, the probability of such a collision increases exponentially according to the Beer-Lambert law. </p>
<p>I would say instead that in a metal a very even and regular coating has a lot of empty areas, molecularity speaking, where light can pass through. </p>
<p>The difference between the metal and a truly transparent material is that in the transparent material does not absorb photons in the visible spectrum, no mater how it strikes the material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least with the samples I was using, the deposition techniques (and the post doc who made them) were quite good. They would have an error around +/- 5 nanometers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a few years doing research on graphene and nanowires. I did ebeam lithography using gold as part of both of these projects and did both thermal and e-beam evaporation of metal films as part of the lithography.</p>
<p>100 nm was definitely opaque.</p>
<p>10 nm of Cr or Ti was visible, but barely. It was translucent, bordering on transparent. This didn't conduct well though, so it wasn't a continuous layer.</p>
<p>Going with 5 nm of Cr and 45 nm Au produced something that was again opaque and conductive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you're talking about something that could plausibly be picked up as an individual particle or aggregate under SEM. You'd need TEM to really see them but it would absolutely be visible. Depending on beam intensity and voltage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, a coating of about 50 nm is opaque at Sun's brightness. Let's take that as an absorbance of about 2 (very inaccurately). How many (n) additional 50 nm layers we need? A supernova is about as bright as a galaxy or 1e11 Suns, so we need a transmittance of 1e-11 at solar brightness. Take the logarithm of Beer-Lambert law to get to the equation -11 = -2 × n, so n = 5.5. That is, we need 50 nm × 5.5 = 275 nm of metal. This is an order of magnitude calculation, since someone should go and take the 50 nm coating to a spectrophotometer to measure its actual absorbance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And you don't need to go as far as electron microscopy to have good use of (semi) transparent metal coating.</p>
<p>Coating glass with metal may filter unwanted wavelengths - the most famous example being astronaut helmets, which are coated with gold to protect from radiation, but is still transparent enough so that astronauts can use see through it: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an example even more commonplace than astronauts' visors, take a blank CD-R or a CD without a label printed on it, hold it right up to your eye, close the other eye, and look at something bright.  </p>
<p>The data-containing part of a CD is film of metal sandwiched between layers of plastic, and it is thin enough to see through. OP does say &quot;transparent,&quot; however, and this is only translucent, not transparent.  </p>
<p>Same goes for solar filters for cameras and telescopes. <a href="http://astronomyonline.org/solarsystem/Images/Eclipse/solarfilter.jpg" target="_blank">Looking <em>at</em> a solar filter, especially under bright light, you would swear it's just a disk of metal.</a> But hold it up to the sun, <a href="http://starizona.com/acb/basics/images/sunspots.jpg" target="_blank">and suddenly,</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used them extensively in the lighting industry when I worked in it.</p>
<p>Basically, you deposit the coating so that it reflects every wavelength of light except the one you want, and you get a really nice deep saturated colour coming through.</p>
<p>You saw them most inside automated fixtures, because you want something that's compact and long lasting, which the dichroic filters fit really well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting story.. A professor at the university i attend collected 20yr or something like that of random gold sputtered waste..( a non negligible amount ends up on the walls of the chamber during sputtering), extracted the gold residues and smelted it into a wedding band to renew his vows to his wife...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One man in my family worked with gold in a plant. Everything was carefully controlled and monitored of course. One of his tasks was to use cloth to wipe gold bricks or rods (see it coming yet?). He would take the rags home and burn them, eventually collected enough gold dust to make one piece of jewelry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My lab in college had a deposition chamber that was literally flaking precious metals on the inside. Mostly gold, some platinum and palladium. They covered the viewing port in a plastic sheet or else the glass would get equally coated in gold. Every few depositions they would change the plastic cover but just toss the old one in the garbage.</p>
<p>Nobody ever seemed interested in recovering the gold even when we calculated the amount thrown away was non-negligible.</p></div>		</li>
