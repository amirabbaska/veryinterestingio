I've already provided a map with statistics. I just couldn't help notice the big difference in numbers and wanted to know why. Please don't be offended!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have a few hazardous spiders, but most of them have fairly limited ranges (e.g. the Sydney funnel web) and/or readily available antivenom.  Bites tend not to be too common either, which is a plus, and you can avoid some of the nastier ones by not poking around in crooks and crannies outdoors when you're in their range.</p>
<p>Crocodiles are, admittedly, an issue in some parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory - but they're pretty easy to avoid if you keep away from swamps, rivers, etc., and the removal of problem crocodiles to special farms has reduced the risks too.</p></div>		</li>
