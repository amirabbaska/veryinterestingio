Another thing that help this scenario work is almost prickish in nature.  How does dust settle on a fan blade?  The only way it can.  I'm sure it has to do with a couple of the ideas posted so far.  The static gives it some attractive force, the trailing edge not only has the closest wind to blade speed ratio, but also the lowest pressure around it (due to both speed of air and the fact that the air is&quot;free&quot; after the blade passes).  Also coming into play is the fact that A LOT of air is being moved over/filtered by the fan.  It's always the smallest pieces that stick first, giving the next piece something to hold onto.<br />
It all hangs on by the virtue of the fan running at similar speeds in the same direction over long periods of time.  This becomes painfully evident if you've ever reversed a ceiling fan without cleaning it first.</p></div>		</li>
