			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who is also in Tech, I can confirm that all sorts of great features get pushed back indefinitely in favor of other &quot;more important&quot; things. In this case, my best guess is that they are working overtime on trying to get all the features and products working that are monetized. Most people don't realize that Youtube is not (at least last I checked) profitable yet. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that hundreds of hours of video is uploaded to youtube every minute. I honesty have no idea how they can even sustain this. They probably have their hands full constantly, just to keep it all running.</p></div>		</li>

I'd also like to add that the more features something has, the more work it takes just to keep it in its current state due to changing browsers, operating systems, hardware, web standards, and a dozen other things that can change out from under you, so after a certain point you need to cut things out to be able to reasonably add something else (or get more people, but on a funds-constrained project that's not a likely outcome).</p></div>		</li>

It's convenient to leave a music video playing while searching for the next song, which is why I think the feature is prioritized on mobile versions of the service.</p></div>		</li>
