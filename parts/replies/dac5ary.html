<p><a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/192110_en.html" target="_blank">ALTITUDE</a> is a working group under the European commission working towards finding alternatives to ITO.</p>
<p>Apparently some alternatives already exist such as <a href="https://www.research.a-star.edu.sg/research/7491/transparent-metal-touchscreens" target="_blank">metal mesh</a> or <a href="https://www.cambrios.com/technology" target="_blank">silver nanowires</a>, but they are not widely used because ITO is simply too cheap and easy to use right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we keep using lithium, then possibly. I'm not super knowledgeable, but <a href="https://www.metalary.com/lithium-price/" target="_blank">the price of lithium has been increasing drastically the last few years.</a></p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to add, lots of research work on sodium and other element based ion batteries. Lithium has the highest energy density by far, but sodium for example could be a cheaper option in cases where high performance isn't necessary (i.e. you can sacrifice battery size/weight, potentially for energy storage comparable to the tesla powerwall or something like that, not a good option for cell phone batteries, electric cars, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>When demand will drive prices high it will be economical to dig up old slag heaps (slag and dust) around Zn/Pb/Sn (current and historical) processing areas and leach indium from them , together, of course with other metals present.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(Talking about aluminium's abundance is admittedly slightly misleading, because refining its ores requires tremendous amounts of energy; but if we're talking about a future in which solar panel production has been massively scaled up, then that shouldn't be a limiting factor.)</p></div>		</li>
