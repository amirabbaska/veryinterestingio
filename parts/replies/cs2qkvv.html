			<div class="markdown"><p>He explained it beautifully, but I'm not sure the concept itself is really all that complex.  (That is to say, weather is extremely complex, but there are certain general concepts that are very easily described, like wind and storms are caused by heat differentials)</p>
<p>I think the PHD thesis complexity comes from providing the evidence that proves this simple explanation is valid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when i used to go diving in the marshall islands i would frequent a spot called the sandy flats. <a href="http://www.wallpapersdb.org/wallpapers/beach/underwater_sand_1920x1200.jpg" target="_blank">it would just go on and on</a> (not the actual spot be very similar) and on those really calm days it was just the most serene thing to just sit there and listen to the ocean noise. I could see this happening in one way on Uranus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally off topic but Freshman year of high school I thought astronomy was the coolest thing and wanted to study it so badly in college, sadly I went on to study criminal justice. Everything you just said and explained made me remember how cool astronomy is and wish I had studied it instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar here. </p>
<p>I always was fascinated by astronomy, and was gung ho to pursue it as a career. But my highschool only had one optional science program. In grade 10 you take biology, in grade 11 you take chemistry, and in grade 12 and 13 (Known as OAC) was Physics. Each was a prerequisite for the next, no skipping allowed.</p>
<p>All the Universities required OAC sciences for Astronomy programs, and at the time, I was too squeemish for Biology. I got a 96% in Grade 9 science, but in grade 10 I tried Biology and had to drop it, so I was never able to progress that path.</p>
<p>I tried to go straight with Math, and see if I could get in through the back door, but it was slammed in my face. I needed the Science. I was so disheartened, I never did wind up going to University. Did a few failed stints in community college.</p>
<p>Now I'm almost 40, have a desk job in a big city where my telescope can't see crap, but the rare times, every couple of years, I get out beyond the light, when I get a chance to stare up at the heavens are when I feel the happiest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing wrong with maintaining an astronomy hobby.  You can keep up with the cutting-edge research at a place like arxiv.org, you've got your telescope, and a great purpose for trips out of the city.</p>
<p>I'm an experimental astrophysicist, I do my work with a big telescope (for now, at least), and I still get more excited over watching a meteor shower than my day-to-day work.  </p>
<p>I love what I do, but work is work, and even if you love it, it's never going to feel as good as when you're setting aside time to just enjoy something without any kind of responsibility attached to it.  Plus, getting into the guts of this stuff sort of &quot;demystifies&quot; it as you get into the nitty-gritty of making measurements and fitting data to models, etc.  </p>
<p>Just looking at awesome APOD pictures or reading summaries of recent breakthroughs isn't really work, but it's still the part the tickles that little kid sense of wonder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way too much. I play with no mods, because I consider that cheating...at least after you've taken graduate level orbital mechanics, anyway.</p>
<p>I still can't quite get a manned return mission from Eve, though, which may have led to a few rage quits in my time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although I'm not the guy you replied to. I highly recommend it to him. Now I know a lot about orbital mechanics. To sum up what I learned: Orbits are <em>very</em> weird.</p></div>		</li>
