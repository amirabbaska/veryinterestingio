			<p>Most math teachers are hard to understand because they are old and not actual teachers.<br><br>If a teacher is young and not an actual teacher, he still has this freshness of how hard it was to study the subject, and as such can relate with the student. But as he grows old and more master at his area, this memory is clouded by his new learning and thus he ends up not as good at teaching, and usually more and more exigent. <br><br>A teacher that actually studied to be a teacher keeps fresh his ability to teach through knowing how learning works and how to explain stuff orderly and calmly and as clear as possible (stuff the masters tend to forget).<br><br>My best teachers up to this point were: my High School math teacher: he was young, a good guy and whatnot, but he understood my position and knew how to approach my learning; my college Math 2 teacher that would congregate most students from the other teachers under his command in his classroom, as only he was good enough teacher for students to answer the tests, most other teachers left awful blanks; finally it was my Calc 4 (the one that doesn't introduce new math but rather use the other 3 calc to reach cool results) teacher that was both young and a teacher project, he graduated as a Math Engineer and devoted his time to teach as what he most liked to do, and was damn good at it (I barely passed but I did understand most of it).<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think age has much to do with it. Older teachers have more experience. But ability to teach means nothing toward their careers, so the old professors are generally good at other things. There is no reason to be a good teacher when you are (90%) judged by output.</p>		</li>

			<p>He explained it beautifully, but I'm not sure the concept itself is really all that complex.  (That is to say, weather is extremely complex, but there are certain general concepts that are very easily described, like wind and storms are caused by heat differentials)<br><br>I think the PHD thesis complexity comes from providing the evidence that proves this simple explanation is valid.</p>		</li>

			<p>Similar here. <br><br>I always was fascinated by astronomy, and was gung ho to pursue it as a career. But my highschool only had one optional science program. In grade 10 you take biology, in grade 11 you take chemistry, and in grade 12 and 13 (Known as OAC) was Physics. Each was a prerequisite for the next, no skipping allowed.<br><br>All the Universities required OAC sciences for Astronomy programs, and at the time, I was too squeemish for Biology. I got a 96% in Grade 9 science, but in grade 10 I tried Biology and had to drop it, so I was never able to progress that path.<br><br>I tried to go straight with Math, and see if I could get in through the back door, but it was slammed in my face. I needed the Science. I was so disheartened, I never did wind up going to University. Did a few failed stints in community college.<br><br>Now I'm almost 40, have a desk job in a big city where my telescope can't see crap, but the rare times, every couple of years, I get out beyond the light, when I get a chance to stare up at the heavens are when I feel the happiest.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's nothing wrong with maintaining an astronomy hobby.  You can keep up with the cutting-edge research at a place like arxiv.org, you've got your telescope, and a great purpose for trips out of the city.<br><br>I'm an experimental astrophysicist, I do my work with a big telescope (for now, at least), and I still get more excited over watching a meteor shower than my day-to-day work.  <br><br>I love what I do, but work is work, and even if you love it, it's never going to feel as good as when you're setting aside time to just enjoy something without any kind of responsibility attached to it.  Plus, getting into the guts of this stuff sort of &quot;demystifies&quot; it as you get into the nitty-gritty of making measurements and fitting data to models, etc.  <br><br>Just looking at awesome APOD pictures or reading summaries of recent breakthroughs isn't really work, but it's still the part the tickles that little kid sense of wonder.</p>		</li>

			<p>This sounds strange, but as of 2010, a lot of heliophysicists have been going through something similar when it comes to the Sun. Since the launch of SDO in 2010, heliophysicists learned more about the sun during its first three years since the start of recorded history. So apart from gorgeous pictures, SDO has contributed so much to heliophysics and I hope it continues to do so for many years more.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't get why people find this a strange or even an unexpected phenomenon. The idea of accelerating returns while not yet accepted by most as a fundamental law, is perhaps the best encapsulation of the &quot;force&quot; behind evolution at an informational level. It's like truly believing in evolution, or accepting that we live in an accelerating universe, when you get it -- of course there are accelerating returns. We are truly at the phase when we might step up to a type I civilization and that's amazing but the idea that we are learning more... that should be expected unless we are doing something stupid like a dark age.</p>		</li>

			<p>The last frontier. We are learning so much about space today, that new fields are being created like astrobiology. When people talk about  stagnacity in science, it's often social sciences though biology is seeing some loss in reproducibility especially as it is applied in areas like pharma (which by pointing to this, is to challenge the &quot;scienceness&quot; of the practice). More so, I am pointing to a phenomenon where modern biology is more computational than ever before, so &quot;core&quot; sciences become inter-disciplinary sciences with haste. Many people would say mathematics isn't rapidly developing but it was still developed enough that Einstein was able to look for the mathematics he needed, instead of having to invent it. <br><br>However, understanding the cosmos is an every-expanding pursuit and even more so, when you really accept the conclusions of an &quot;accelerating universe&quot;. It's really hard to &quot;clear up&quot; anything though (even Max Planck points to this issue in science), so until we get better education about the nature of the cosmos (issues like teaching plasma in k-12), then there is little hope that the average person will see the real &quot;leaps&quot; that are occuring. Many people would still say we live in an &quot;infinite&quot; universe and lack any mathematical understanding that such a universe is actually less interesting than a &quot;finite but unbounded&quot; universe (that is the universe reflected by our current scientific models). That's fundamental -- just teach people the universe really isn't infinite and cannot be based on the axioms of our theories.<br><br>EDIT: That's all I am saying, teach people to follow axioms to their logical conclusions and thus then as I said, the concept of &quot;accelerating returns&quot; is already assumed.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, previously, the problem was that the builder included zero statistics on the weight, and delta-v of each stage, and the combined rocket. <br><br>So you basically had to guess, or copy someone's existing ship (NO thank you!). I think newer KSP has that built in now, but I remember when I first got a mod that showed the delta-v as you built it and all a sudden I had more than enough fuel to get to Mun and back. That's the only mod I used.<br><br>The other thing is that stock doesn't give you any ideas about atmospheric density/drag, so you have to read the wiki for the &quot;ideal&quot; maximum speed for an altitude--which differs from Earth because the KSP solar system is differently scaled.<br><br>I didn't realize I was burning up a ton of my fuel just trying to get up as fast as I could. I thought &quot;the longer you sit there hovering, the more fuel you waste&quot; but that's only without wind resistance. There's a sweet spot between too much resistance, and too much wasted energy from &quot;less than max throttle&quot;. <br><br>I'm sure you know that latter part, but a passerby reading my comment might not.<br><br>Oh, and lastly, IIRC, KSP rockets are all vastly under-powered compared to NASA rockets so people have more &quot;fun&quot; trying to learn to make good ones since money was limitless (till somewhat recently). So if you had a multi-trillion dollar budget, and NASA rockets, you really could go anywhere in the solar system pretty easily if you didn't mind casualties.</p>		</li>

			<p>[comment has been rearranged]<br><br>I believe the system is smaller because they ran into precision issues with the floating point numbers. Floating-point numbers kind of explode when you have astronomical distances and thousands of tiny increments of distance (velocity and acceleration). <br><br>(KSP runs on Unity, so it's possible they couldn't switch to something like fixed-point numbers.)<br><br>For example, a ship at 1 billion miles from the sun, incrementing 1 foot/second/60 frames-per-second game logic rate means a very tiny number is being added to a very large number, and floats are adapt at measuring ONLY either a large, or a very small number. <br><br>It extremely explodes if your algorithm is dividing by a difference of two large numbers. Two numbers could be equal, but with tiny rounding error, you're now multiplying your number by almost infinity. The numbers cancel, but you're left with something like 0.000000000000002301.<br><br>It's really interesting stuff how two formulas that are algebraically the same, can produce wildly different amounts of error propagation depending on the order of computation.<br><br>Also, KSP doesn't support &quot;true&quot; gravity. The solar system is running on hard-coded paths and objects experience gravity only towards the closest spherical body. They call it &quot;Sphere of Influence.&quot; It simplifies the problem of solving for those positions, but you lose some subtle things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point" target="_blank">Lagrange points</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>Another large reason for a scaled down universe is playability. With a huge solar system travel times and waiting times take 3x-4x longer for everything.
