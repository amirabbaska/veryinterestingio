<p>Are there any sort of, quirks of the universe that either would or wouldn't be around due to this effect, or does it just essentially amount to an oddity? Essentially, are there any consequences of this phenomenon beyond the obvious &quot;even-Z just tend to be preferred&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The odd-even effect is far less pronounced, where it's even visible. So the answer is, yes, pairing is an energy effect, but it doesn't dominate nuclear binding energy differences. Why energy doesn't dominate abundance is the next interesting question.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok, so I'll ask it. Why not?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's is a completely accurate statement, yes.</p>

<p>Some unstable nuclei might've been stable, some stable ones might've been unstable, etc. I can't think of anything bigger than that off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>only 5 have odd Z and odd N</p>

<p>Four of them are for Z=1,3,5,7 (deuterium, lithium-6, boron-10, nitrogen-14). The fifth is ^(180m)Ta which is strange anyway... Is there anything that makes lighter OO elements more likely? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to make a nucleus unstable for a ganeral mass number, assuming you are the &quot;hands of god&quot;, is to create a lower-mass nuclide in the same isobaric chain.</p>
<p>Just as an example consider the A = 3 isobar, you've got two nuclides which have a realistic chance at being stable. One of them (^(3)He) has a lower mass, therefore the other (^(3)H) can beta decay into it. </p>
<p>In this particular case, it's an even-Z/odd-N nucleus which is the stable one and an odd-Z/even-N nucleus which is unstable. But the point is that at low masses you've got less &quot;chances&quot; to be stable along each isobar.</p>
<p>If you were to look at something like the A = 100 isobar, there are many nuclides which could potentially be stable. So the chances of an odd/odd finding itself at the bottom of the valley of beta stability is smaller.</p>
<p>At least that's what I can come up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true but misleading. The stability difference between even and odd proton-numbered nuclei doesn't explain their relative abundances in the Universe, which differ by a very much larger margin than the differences in their stabilities.</p>
<p>Rather, the difference is almost entirely due to the history of fusion inside stars. Hydrogen fusion is very much easier than other kinds of fusion, and this proceeds until most of the Hydrogen has been used up in the core. After which, it wouldn't matter whether a fusion product with an even or odd number of protons were more stable as there are simply fewer routes to produce odd-Z elements inside stars. Even-Z elements are built up with Helium nuclei and other heavier nuclei fusing. Odd-Z elements are produced with the occasional proton fusion or more likely through neutron bombardment with fusion produced neutrons during the star's lifetime or from the heavy neutron flux during a supernova.</p></div>		</li>
