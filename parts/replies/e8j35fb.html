			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose the counterargument is you can have a very highly charged capacitor that is charged to tens of thousands of volts, or indeed, get shocked by static electricity which can also be tens of thousands of volts, and survive.  There just isn't enough stranded charge in either case to deliver consistent amperage or to heat things up high enough.</p>
<p>You need current for long enough to disrupt heart rhythms or severely burn flesh to kill someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! I (still) am an electronics hobbyist. Back in the day of tubes and high voltages I was zapped by 800 volts from a fully charged capacitor the size of a beer bottle. I do not recall anything while getting zapped, but afterward, when the capacitor discharged, every muscle of my body ached. I was more careful after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to teach a class where we built van de Graff generators out of simple parts, and we always had a bit of friendly competition to see who could shock me the hardest. We would have students stand on foam insulators and hold each other in a high voltage chain, and the person on the end would zap someone with a finger. One time someone built a Leyden that shocked me so bad, I swear my heart skipped a beat. I started to be bit more careful after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ouch I can imagine that really hurt, I touched a 325VDC bus cap and ended up discharging it, that was bad enough. It was discharging at the time as the device was off so not the full 325VDC but probably in the 200VDC range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. There is also alot if amps flowing when discharging a capacitor. It just doesn't have much energy. Its volts times amps times time that kills you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue here is that we often spec open circuit voltage (a taser can hit 50,000 volts unloaded) but that's not the number we care about. We care about the voltage under load and many devices that generate high voltages can't provide the expected current once loaded(tasers are ~1200V when on a person)</p>
<p>On an infinite ideal source across a resistor (your body) current and voltage are related, but with current limited supplies they tend to diverge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: Way above ELI5</p>
<p>Tasers are in a weird category. The reason the initial open-circuit voltage is so high is to induce dielectric breakdown in the air gap between the barbs/electrodes and clothing/skin. Essentially, this causes an arc and establishes the circuit for current to flow.</p>
<p>After this is done, they switch to a fixed-charge pulse (100uC @ 19-20 Hz) with a duration of about 5 seconds to limit sustained current. During this time, the voltage floats to whatever is needed to maintain the fixed-charge pulses. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gadgets/how-a-taser-works" target="_blank">[Source]</a></p>
<p>Of course Tasers can't deliver sustained current at 50kV off of battery power (and the numerous safety mechanisms that are built in), but it wouldn't take much to make an electric gun that could cause serious injury, if one desired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it's power that kills.  Enough power, delivered by enough current through your high-resistance body, driven by a sufficiently high voltage from a source with enough power to sustain this whole process.</p>
<p>Basically, this whole idea is wrong and I'm sick of hearing the expression.  It was never true and I don't know why it caught on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem with power is it covers a lot of range in variables. P=IV. </p>
<p>Its possible to have a very high voltage system with low current and vice versa... The biological effects of each is not the same. </p>
<p>So as a generalisable/reductionist number; power may not be helpful at predicting an effect as it needs the context you described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd agree that power alone doesn't tell you much.  You need a sufficient, sustained current, which requires a sustained voltage, which requires a source that has sufficient energy and power to sustain said voltage.</p>
<p>Power is just one part of the equation.  But so is voltage. And so is current.  You can look at current as the symptom - if you get a sustained current sufficient enough to injure... then that means everything up-stream was in place.  But that's only a retrospective look.</p>
<p>Power is bad to mention independently.  But so is voltage, and so is current. That's precisely my point; the whole expression should just be done away with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats why I prefer to use the voltage as the number to determine how much danger I'm putting myself in.</p>
<p>As long as I'm not fresh out of the bath these numbers make sense to me:</p>
<p>50v is perfectly safe to put your fingers across</p>
<p>70v will start to tingle and feel uncomfortable, but not dangerous</p>
<p>110v will make you jump, but still really unlikely to cause harm providing youre dry</p>
<p>230v gives you a bigger jolt and might make you jittery for a minute, but again, if youre dry and dont have a pacemaker you'll be fine.</p>
<p>400v is a bit nasty, I've had it a couple of times. If your clammy its slightly dangerous</p>
<p>600v I have had once and would not recommend.</p>
<p>Anything above 400v is pretty dangerous across your heart.</p></div>		</li>
