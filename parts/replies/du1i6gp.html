			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat from the house is a key factor.  After we got better insulation in our attic, and sealed air leaks from the conditioned space into the attic, we now have a lot less icicles than our neighbors, whereas they used to be similar.  </p>
<p>If you are getting substantial icicles, not only does that mean you might be losing heat from your house and wasting energy, but it also means you run the risk of water damage from <a href="https://www.byggmeister.com/our-world/blog/ice-dam-it-dont-get-mad-get-insulation-and-air-sealing" target="_blank">ice dams</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, except it isn't necessarily the icicles melting causing them to drip. It's water from the melting snow on the roof. If you have icicles it's because it's below freezing outside and the ice slowly forms like a stalactite in a cave. As the water flows off the warm house it hits colder air and freezes. Most of the water will drip off with a small percentage freezing to the surface of the icicle. So an icicle dripping isn't necessarily an indicator of the icicle itself melting and losing water. </p></div>		</li>
