<p>Your body has determined a clear ballpark limit of how long it has to survive, and the preprogrammed cell division hierarchies make sure that any cell has enough telomere length needed by that lineage to do its function for that lifetime.</p>

<p>So does it mean that taking good care of our bodies does not make us live longer, but rather not die prematurely?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I loved the write up, but do have a question that you lightly touched on. When you talk about ‘developmental programs’ turning on that allow you to live longer, in order to better take care of your offspring, and their offspring, is it truly switched on mid-life, or just a built-in consequence from the benefit they provided in previous generations?</p>
<p>What I’m trying to ask, is how could/ does your body know whether it has successfully reproduced, and “done it’s job”, versus just ejaculation? How does the “grandmother hypothesis” kick in? I think I might be misinterpreting what you meant, but it seems odd that your cells could suddenly reprogram themselves to start working towards longer life. Doesn’t the natural selection pressure get locked in at birth? So to say, if the DNA from your parents “says” that living longer is a benefit, won’t the child’s cells aim for long life right from the start, instead of kickstarting at an arbitrary point down the line?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers; the grandmother hypothesis works on a species level: because living longer can be beneficial to your offspring, the species as a whole has evolved to live beyond reproductive age. So the developmental program that you’re born with already says that you should live past your reproductive age irrespective of whether you reproduce or not. </p>
<p>However it is also possible that your body can decide to live longer half way through your life and this has been observed to happen during calorie restriction (where you don’t get enough food, so the body decides it’s better to live longer until better times come by, and starts going overdrive with systems designed to make you healthier). So yes, both methods are possible and your body employs both  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what he meant, no. If that were the case childless people would have much shorter lifespans than their siblings with children, and they don't.</p>
<p>The hypothesis is that people that just happened to have genetic traits that let them live a long time past reproductive age were able to provide care for their grandchildren, increasing their success and thus producing a selection pressure favoring people with those genetic traits.</p>
<p>Eventually everyone has the &quot;grandmother&quot; genes.</p>
