			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have point out, this isn't strictly true. But, if you weighed 100 kg, stood in Kansas, and converted to pure energy, you would obliterate everything from the Rocky Mountains to the Appalachian Mountains. The yield would be close to 2200 megatons of TNT (the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated, Tsar Bomba, was &quot;only&quot; 50 MT). So you could definitely still do some serious, serious damage </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really crazy and totally unexplained is why inertial mass = gravitational mass: why is it that we use the same number for calculating the strength of gravity and for calculating accelerations due to forces? There's no good reason for them to be the same, and it leads to interesting consequences like gravitational fields giving the same acceleration to every particle. For example the charge/mass ratio is different between, say, a proton and an electron, or an electron and a quark - an electric field gives all of these different accelerations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full storage won't be higher actually. Computer storage is not stored as trivial as &quot;present&quot; versus &quot;not present&quot; with the implied assumption that not present would be a 0, but it usually contains balanced bit patterns that encode an equivalent of a number, with the guarantee that it has at least a minimal amount of bit transitions (to make the signal self-clocked) and that it is balanced between number of low and highs read.</p>
<p>So that would mean that the average disk weighs exactly the same empty and full.</p>
<p>SSDs on the other hand, that may actually be a thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is this mind blowing? You fill it with light, which is energy and therefore mass, and so it is &quot;heavier&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In that case, then LHC had its big thing about finding the Higgs Boson, the part of a thing which is supposed to give it mass if laymen reports are to be believed. If thats the case and your answer is right then that seems to suggest the Higgs is responsible for confining energy in some way, is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, exactly right. The higgs field is the force responsible for confining particles that have weak hypercharge. You can think of it being like a force that exerts pressure from all directions simultaneously. The higgs boson is the detectable manifestation of this field that you get when you dump enough energy into it, which is how we demonstrated that it really exists. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kixAljyfdqU" target="_blank">Again, a relevant Space Time episode!</a></p></div>		</li>
