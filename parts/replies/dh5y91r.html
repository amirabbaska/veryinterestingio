			<div class="markdown"><p>You're the second person to mention the &quot;runner on third, fly ball strategy&quot;.</p>
<p>What does it mean to tag up? I was under the impression that if someone catches a fly ball, play is dead and no one can score.  Is this not the case?</p>
<p>Edit: It would appear that play ends much less often then I had assumed.  It seems that while play may not be officially dead, it would just be really dumb for the offensive team to make a move at that time.  Thank you for your clarifications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.</p>
<p>When a fly ball is caught, all the runners on base have to touch the base they started this play on. But once they've done that, they can try to advance if they want to.</p>
<p>If the fielders can throw the ball to a runner's &quot;starting&quot; base before he gets back there, he is out. But once he has &quot;tagged up&quot;, he is just like any other runner: the fielders can try to tag him with the ball to get him out, and he can run to the next base before they catch him.</p>
<p>When the fly ball is caught at the far end of centre field, and the runner is on third base, he only has to run 90 feet before the ball is thrown about 400 feet and a tag applied. Usually he can make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add that the average professional athlete is going to be able to sprint that 90 feet at an average speed of 15-17mph. The average distance to home plate from a fly ball where a runner is attempting to score will vary from 280ft to more than 400 feet. When a fielder throws the ball, they are throwing it about 75-80 mph average speed in a parabola, so the distance the ball is traveling is quite a bit more than just the straight line distance to home plate. </p>
<p>Many outfielders can throw high 90s if pitching, but lack the control, movement, or consistency necessary to be a pitcher (the most important player in terms of outcome by far). They have very strong arms in general, but not always.  This leads to inaccuracy often making a tag-up successful. It's extremely difficult to throw a strike from 300 ft with very little run up. The ball must be released quickly or the batter is at home before you even release the ball. Sometimes this pressure means that in certain spots a fast runner will challenge a fielder from a shorter fly ball distance and the fielder has a chance to throw out the runner. If a ball is hit 400ft, generally anyone drinking beer in the stadium would be able to beat the throw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, &quot;tagging up&quot; means the runner must be touching the base when the ball is caught for an out. Then the runner may leave the base to try to advance to the next base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Play is only dead when its the 3rd out that is made. Everything before that includes tons of strategy on both sides. </p>
<p>There are two great examples from yesterday's Cubs-Phillies game. </p>
<p>Situation #1: <a href="http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/05/04/1352680783/1493937509255/asset_2500K.mp4" target="_blank">Video Link</a></p>
<p>A rare 6-9-3 Double play. It was the bottom of 12th inning, Cubs had bases loaded with only one out. Any hit that made it to the outfield would end the game. Even a pop up to the outfield would end the game, since the runner on 3rd could tag up and run home for the win. The Phillies knew this, so they pulled their Right Fielder into the infield, giving them FIVE infielders (instead of the standard 4). They were hoping IF the ball was hit, they could turn the double play and end the inning. This is exactly what happened. </p>
<p>Situation #2: <a href="https://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/mp4/2017/05/04/1352690383/1493938168225/asset_2500K.mp4" target="_blank">Video Link</a>  </p>
<p>Bottom of the 13th inning, runners on 1st and 2nd, one out. Szczur hits what LOOKS like an easy double play ball, they turn the first out at second, but the Shortstop over throws the first baseman trying to get the double play, allowing the run to score to end the game. If you look closely, the runner would have been safe anyway, but they tried to end the inning with the double play, and it cost them. If they just took the out at second, they would have had runners on 1st and 3rd with two outs, and the game would have continued. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In professional baseball, play is rarely &quot;dead.&quot; Things like foul balls (that aren't caught), ground rule doubles, or play in which a player accidentally throws the ball out into the stands will stop play and runners will not have the freedom to just run anywhere. You could have a runner on third sprint to  home as the pitcher is prepping to pitch. It wouldn't be the smartest idea but people have tried and some have even succeeded. Most of the time, when runners &quot;steal&quot; bases, they run from first to second as second base is the farthest from home, so it requires the longest throw from the catcher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this, the ball isn't even dead when the catcher returns a pitched ball to the pitcher.  It's rare, but the Braves won a game this way a few years back.  We had a runner on third, game tied at zero, and the opposing pitcher didn't see the ball in his glove when the catcher threw it back to him.  The ball ended up halfway between the mound and second.  Meanwhile the runner on third made a break for home and scored.  I was unaware that that could even happen.</p>
<p>Similar situation happened later on in that wild playoff game between the Rangers and the Blue Jays except this time the batter accidentally deflected the ball as the catcher was returning it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight hijack but is getting to a 'bases loaded' then going for a home run ever a viable tactic (i.e. last innings) or just a happy coincidence that bases may end up loaded?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally it's just a coincidence. If you are on second, your goal is to get home on any base hit out of the infield. If it's a shallow hit, or you're very slow, or an outfielder gets to it immediately, you might only make it to third, but in most cases you'll score on a hit.</p>
<p>Bases can get loaded via a walk, which can happen when &quot;pitching around&quot; a powerful hitter, i.e. just grazing the strike zone, not giving him very good pitches to hit, and ending up throwing four balls. That seems to happen late in close games a fair bit, I suppose.</p></div>		</li>
