			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation but I'd include what the method is used. It's called spectroscopy, the satellite looks at the spectrum of the light emitted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, can confirm the above comment is correct. Every element has its own unique spectrum which can be shown in a spectroscope either as an absorption (the entire spectrum is shown with black lines representing where the element absorbs some light) or an emission (coloured lines depending on where in the spectrum light is emitted). See here for an example using hydrogen: <a href="http://cronodon.com/images/Hydrogen_spectra.jpg" target="_blank">http://cronodon.com/images/Hydrogen_spectra.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question and I'm really curious about this one, but would it be possible to tell if a planet harbors intelligent life by observing it's spectrum? I never really thought about it, but take our planet for instance, if we look at it's spectrum is there anything in it that we know is the result from manufactured interference (like pollution)  I'm really curious if something like that is being used to determine whether there might be life on exoplanets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At present we can only directly observe stars. The light coming from a planet's star will occasionally go dim. With spectroscopy we can observe the reduction in certain spectral lines during this dimming. After verifying that the dimming is periodic, and the absorption pattern during the dimming is similar, we can reason that the dimming is due to the transit of a planet, and that the planet's atmosphere has materials corresponding to certain spectra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for sound, if you want to look at the frequency domain of a signal you'd use a Fourier transform. Is there an analogous method for light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing applies. I worked with molecules, not elements, so this analysis doesn't apply to elements, but you can put some substance in a box at a pressure low enough to make it a gas then you basically shine light at various frequencies then turn off the light and see what gets emitted as the molecules calm down. At the right frequencies the light induces molecular rotation and when you turn the light off they lose that energy and the specific frequencies you see tell you properties of the molecule. Anyway, you record the light coming back and donan Fast Fourier Transform on the signal to get the frequencies out. </p>
<p>So once you know the properties of the molecule you can predict what light you expect to see from molecules in space, then you give that data to an astronomer and they look at a nebula, figure it's temperature and figure out what molecules are out there. </p>
<p>The properties are the moments of inertia of the molecule as we model it plus adjustments that describe how the molecule shape changes as it spins with more energy. The bond lengths and angles change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The popular media takes these planetary &quot;hints&quot; and goes way too far.<br />
The guess on life is just how far the planet is from the star and the temp of the star.  If it falls in the range of liquid water they claim life is possible.  We have no idea what conditions are necessary for alien life.
They take a few guesses and expand them into an entire novel just to make a splash in the news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this.</p>
<p>But, if there are many elements in a planet's atmosphere, why don't their individual spectra overlap, resulting in a worthless spectrogram showing a composite of all of the wavelengths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do overlap. The thing is that molecules don't just absorb one wavelength. We know what wavelengths most compounds absorb, so we can just compare the wavelengths we see to tables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The absorption lines that are used tend to be very sharp, so there's not much overlap.</p>
<p>For a planet's atmosphere, astronomers typically look at infrared spectra that correspond to vibrations in the molecules.  A typical infrared spectrum has very sharp lines corresponding to the different vibrational modes.  <a href="http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?Spec=C124389&amp;Index=1&amp;Type=IR&amp;Large=on" target="_blank">Here's CO2</a>, for example.</p>
<p>For stars, astronomers typically look at the absorption or emission from atoms, which also produce very sharp lines (see the spectrum posted by /u/Jatexi).</p></div>		</li>
