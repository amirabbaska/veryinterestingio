			<div class="markdown"><p>The real problem is to keep it secret enough.
You need maybe 100 person involved, most of them are clever enough to understand what they are working on. </p>
<p>It's one stuff (even if you don't agree on your country security policy) to accept to give a hand on something they are not allowed to tell you about because it's to defend your country.<br />
It's another stuff to accept to be involved in a massive terrorism plan. Add that to the fact that people working on WMD have security clearance  so they usually have a minimal sense of the state interest</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehm, no it would not?</p>
<p>Constructing a satellite which has a artillery canon on board would be a monumental task if you want the cannon to actually hit anything with a payload that actually does anything. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Gaz this already happened  (someone told me that after the Tokyo attack he ran a simulation on the impact of a similar attack on our local metro. So governments are ready to handle it) </p>
<p>Missile starts to request some heavy industry and is not available to the average DIY terrorist. </p></div>		</li>
