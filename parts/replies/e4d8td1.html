			<div class="markdown"><p>Those high temperatures were in such a small space that it probably wasn't super applicable. </p>
<p>That being said, the surface of the sun is not that hot, relatively speaking. By that I mean there are conventional means of surpassing the 5700K temperature of the sun, not just controlled experiments. For example an arc welder can reach in excess of 10,000K or higher. </p>
<p>Again I think the difference here though is size. Ignoring the core and its ridiculous temperatures (15 million Kelvin) The sun is made up of essentially an ongoing nuclear fusion bomb that's thousands of times larger than Earth. That's not just a lot of heat but it's a lot of heat in a big area. Compare it to the downright ludicrous temperatures that they achieve in the LHC (trillions of degrees or more) and you might be surprised that we aren't in danger, but this is in an area of only a few atoms-width, and so it dissipates easier</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. And these heats are probably achieved only in <em>very</em> short little bursts, right? Are we talking a few seconds at a time, or milliseconds?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically there isn’t any, due to the way we define temperature the scale (in Kelvin) goes like this:</p>
<p>0, ..., 100, ..., infinity,-infinity, ..., -100, ... -0.0001</p>
<p>Of course, this is just due to the typical definition not capturing quite the definition we intuitively want.</p>
<p>For example some scientists propose “coldness” = 1/temperature which avoids the infinity issue, but more complicated alternatives also exist. Google the Wikipedia page “negative temperature” for more info if you want </p></div>		</li>
