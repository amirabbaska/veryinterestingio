			<div class="markdown"><p>Margins are very thin in the food service industry.  Profit is profit and as I said I'm paying down a mortgage that's become an investment I can hopefully sell one day.  I've also gained a ton of leadership experience which helped me acquire a great full time job in addition to some accounting and financial savvy, pride of accomplishment and it's fun!  It's not entirely about the money.  But that little margin pays for a vacation every year and maybe one day for a vacation home. </p>

<p>I'm ok with my little profit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not OP but I'm familiar with the food service industry. For many seasonal places like this, it's cheaper to just pay rent at a loss for the off-season than to have staff, cleaning, deliveries, etc. for the vastly reduced clientele. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily I own the real estate so I do not pay rent.  However, I do have a mortgage that I pay during the six months I'm not open.  I make sure to hold back enough to make those payments during the off season among many other expenses. </p></div>		</li>
