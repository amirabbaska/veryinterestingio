			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the truth is that we never really know how other people see us. But we're so hard on ourselves, it's unlikely anyone has ever seen us as badly as we feel at our worst. And everyone has their own complex beliefs and experiences and habits that inform how they see things. For everything you don't like about yourself, there's someone who loves it, or doesn't notice it at all. For everything you do like about yourself, there's someone who thinks it's annoying. And just because someone does or doesn't like something about you, doesn't mean it completely colors how they see you. My best friend is a complete slob and going to her apartment stresses me out. I judge the hell out of her for it, but I still love her more than anyone else in the world. My cousin has some of the coolest tattoos I've ever seen and great stories to go with them but he's still a fucking asshole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the most they probably just see you as more reserved and quiet, or more talkative and outgoing, depending I guess.</p>
<p>If you are usually at a low self esteem level, then likely it just looks like a good/bad day if it's even noticed at all.</p></div>		</li>
