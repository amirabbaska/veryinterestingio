			<div class="markdown"><p>I had Anxiety and it turned out what helped me was ADHD medicine because the anxiety was caused by feeling constantly frustrated and impatient because of untreated ADHD. </p>
<p>So in my situation, a stimulant actually helped my anxiety, which is usually not the case. Mental health is weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely enough my partner is currently going through assessment for ADD, and we believe that their long term depression and anxiety may be driven by that condition. It's well documented that ADD and ADHD can drive hypercriticism of yourself and others, and also frustration, as you've mentioned. We're hoping that medication will help - and as you've said, stimulants are the standard treatment, which is very odd! The brain is indeed strange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meds help you focus- but they're not a cure-all. Depending on how bad the anxiety &amp; depression is, you may still need additional help &amp; learn some ways to cope. The medicine will help you be able to effect those changes &amp; use those tools to get better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny how that works. ADHD medicine (Adderall) helped me for a while but I was still jittery and prone to panic attacks if I got too worked up. Turns out my anixety wasn't just from ADHD but an actual Anxiety disorder. Got put on Lexapro with Ativan for panic attack prevention about 2-3 weeks ago and I've had maybe 3 panic attacks since then compared to 4-5 a day.</p>
<p>I find even on days I skip my Adderall but take my Anxirty meds Im calm and able to think but I have no drive to do anything and my mind just wanders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What was happening in my case is that I was drinking between 300mg-400mg of caffeine each day.</p>
<p>I was self medicating ADHD with caffeine and it started to give me severe heartburn(which also caused me to not eat enough, causing hypoglycemia)</p>
<p>So what happened was I'd get heartburn and low blood sugar, and a reverse sympathetic reaction would happen. I started having panic attacks because I had chest pain from heartburn that felt like a panic attack, which triggered actual panic attacks.</p>
<p>Now that I've cut back to around 100mg of caffeine (and Vyvanse to pick up the slack), my heartburn is better, and now I don't feel as panicky because I'm not getting the sympathetic reactions.</p>
<p>What finally got me to suspect ADHD was how I felt after 6+ months of cutting back my caffeine usage. The withdrawal effects were gone, but I still couldn't focus like I did on the high doses of caffeine.</p>
<p>Good luck to you, try to keep your overall wellness as a priority. Eat high protein meals and stay mindful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on a lot of things - firstly, your depression or anxiety may not have an underlying chemical cause. In these cases, medication does not really work; psychological assistance is a better option.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's possible that the medication you are using is not suited to your particular brain chemistry. If that is the case, you will need to try alternative medications until you find the one that works for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It always comes down to a chemical cause, it just might be more complicated than regulating dopamine and seratonin release. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that it has to be comprehensive but how do the medications differ from each other? If increasing availability of neurotransmitters and reuptake is what they do then I'm assuming some must have alternative methods?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add what /u/togoboldly mentioned, it is also true that psychological intervention likely affects your brain chemistry (dopamine and serotonin) by changing your thought patterns, changing your behaviors, and interpersonal connections. Conversely, the medicinal intervention may change how you think, behave, and relate to others! It’s amazing! To some extent, therapy and medicinal interventions treat in the same way, just at different “levels”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other replies are oversimplified. The answer is we are not sure. Some people respond to some medications but not others. We may hypothesize a genetic or environmental variable. Otherwise the next move is to try a different medication, add medication, or add therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fairly old now, today a lot of people use SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors) as they are kind of the &quot;second wave&quot; of drugs in the category. The belief of some is the monoamines play a role, but in reality there isn't a lot of empirical data to show these pills work and many psychologists today believe it to be a simple placebo effect. </p>
<p>Further, there is an alternate belief that monoamines help with cell rebuilding and that things like depression or anxiety break down certain brain pathways. This is known as neuroplasticity and supposed to take a month+, so earlier gains could be placebo effect but longer term gains are perhaps from monoamine aid in neuroplasticity </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a valid point. Newer medications work in subtly different ways, but the brain chemistry is still altered in similar ways.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful that depression and anxiety are better understood in the coming years, because the chemicals that are focused on at present are likely not the only determining factors.</p></div>		</li>
