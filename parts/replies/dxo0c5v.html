<p>The consumer still drives a lot of emissions. Sure one individual doesn't make a difference, but collectively they make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Saying little can be done is basically helping those interests you mention. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The consumer ultimately drives all emissions, but that's not the point. Individual choice doesn't make a difference unless it is priced into the market. Global warming is not naturally priced so we have to do so through legislation.</p>
<p>Any pretense otherwise simply appeases peoples consciences and stops them from actually making a difference. As is backed by the data that we are having so little effect - and what difference has been made has happened in tandem with legislation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you think the demand for goods and services created by &quot;business&quot; comes from? Every time we buy anything we're consuming all the energy involved in creating that item and getting it to our doorstep. All the energy involved in &quot;business&quot; is accountable to individuals that value those goods and services. No one in this cycle is paying the damages / externalities created by this consumption and production. Corporations have to reduce their production, and people have to reduce their consumption, barring any earth shattering technological advancement. Everyone has to give up some standard of living or some profits if we're to see this through without major losses (of coastlines, that is).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Businesses force wealthy consumers to buy massive pick-up trucks for commuting in suburban areas to their office job or to the grocery store? Seriously, I work at an urban office building, the parking lot has dozens of extremely inefficient vehicles. Massive truck beds, 5 seats, all the hottest features, just for taking one person to an office.  </p>
<p>People don't care about climate change or their efficiency. To get them to change their ways, you simply need to tax carbon. With a carbon tax, the future generations' pain will be baked into every economic decision, and buying that truck will mean paying 1000's more for gas in exchange for the 1000's of damage inefficient vehicles' emissions will cause in disasters, sea level rise, and the other negative but &quot;far off&quot; damages of climate change. </p></div>		</li>
