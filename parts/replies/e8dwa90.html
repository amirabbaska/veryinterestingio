			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the liver and GI rest within the lower bounds of the ribcage as well. In obese individuals, the larger internal organs in the abdomen will push on the lower part of the ribs, making the base wider.</p>
<p>The spacing of the ribs may be slightly affected, as well as the spacing of the vertebrae (which the ribs are connected to). However, I don't <em>think</em> they'd just fan out more - rather they would just shift up and have the gut protrude more from underneath. Although, any answer will be pure speculation based on my knowledge.</p>
<p>One condition that we were taught that's associated with increased chest size is COPD. A classical sign is &quot;barrel chested&quot; indivuduals with much rounder chests due to this lung problem. It might be due to the inability of the lung to deflate properly during expiration. This is a slow, permanent change of the rib cage structure.</p>
<p>Barrel chests are also found in people with costovertebral osteoarthritis - that is, inflammation of the joints between the ribs and vertebrae. These joints are less flexible, and remain more fixed in the most open position, hence a rounder chest. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Women tend to build fat more subcutaneously.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>I can only give insight about my case.</strong></p>
<p>From 8th grade through graduating college, I was obese, if not morbidly so from last year of college until Nov of that year. &gt;325lbs 5ft9in guy</p>
<p>Started on a diet and over the course of a year and a half, dropped 132lbs and have plateaued since.</p>
<hr />
<p>On to answering the question:<br />
Over the course of my weight loss, there were numerous times where my breastbone “cracked” and moved inwards. While it isn’t the vertical space between ribs, which I couldn’t easily check, my body did have to physically adjust to the smaller size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a patient with a prior brain tumor resection, and they went back in to do more tissue removal. The remaining part was filled with &quot;fatty tissue.&quot; Not dense and fibrous like a scar, but also not coherent like a true hunk of adipose tissue - it was a bit loose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiologist here. I see this stuff all the time.<br />
Given enough time, any empty space in the skull will be filled with cerebrospinal fluid - you'll just have more than the average person, to fill the extra space.</p>
<p>If you have a big stroke and some of the brain dies, that tissue will very gradually be broken down and taken away, until there's nothing left but some residual fibrous webbing and the fluid. In the interim, the dead brain is still there taking up space.</p>
<p>If you lose some brain all in one go, like through surgery, the space will initially be filled with a combination of blood, serum and dead tissue, as well as CSF. These will all be gradually broken down and absorbed (at different rates) and the empty space filled with CSF.</p>
<p>The empty space should never be filled with &quot;fatty tissue&quot; (i.e adipose). Normal brain is pretty lipid rich, though, so while it's still being broken down, you could call that debris &quot;fatty tissue&quot; if you wanted to, but that might confuse people.</p></div>		</li>
