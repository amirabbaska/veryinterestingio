<p>Eventually the scar tissue breaks down.  The scar tissue &quot;remodels&quot; and embeds into the pre-existing muscle or soft tissue.  The muscle does not technically fire or function as it once did, but functionally or strength wise, you generally do not miss it. What happens is, initially, the scar tissue is a &quot;mix mash mesh&quot; of fibers.  After use of the muscle, the striations of the scar/scar tissue eventually align and embed into the striated (lines) of the muscle fibers.  Exercises (eccentric muscle exercises, or even just regular muscle use will &quot;re-align&quot; the scar tissue fibers into the muscle)  Think about a scar on your skin.  At first it is bumpy, crusty and raised.  Eventually the scar softens, embeds into the skin and forms a small scar.  Eventually, over time, that scar lightens and becomes a white mark, or in some cases dissapears - the same thing will occur in the muscle.     </p>
<p>Also, if you can't build more muscle, how do you build muscle mass when you work out?</p>
<p>You can build more muscle.  I suppose in my previous post I was not clear.  You can build muscle obviously, that's why body builders bulk up.  When body builders bulk up they train their muscles to be more efficient and quicker at lifting weights.  When weight lifting this is not an &quot;injury&quot; or sprain or strain.  It's not technically an injury or inflammation of the muscle, where it needs to be &quot;repaired&quot; with scar tissue.  </p></div>		</li>
