That actually describes progressing presbyopia, a loss of accomodation &quot;power&quot; of the lens resulting in increased difficulty to see nearby things clearly without reading glasses - by the time one get's older. What OP probably means is why his myopia/ shortsightedness keeps on getting worse. There are like a few possibilities for that while not all are fully scientific proven. To explain some reasons one first needs to know what factors cause myopia. First, the lens in the eye has to many diopters causing the light rays in the eye to focus before the retina (rays that don't collect directly on the retina always appear blurry!), second the eye might be too long in length leading to a similiar problem as above: the focused rays don't get as far to reach the retina. Other reasons are a higher index of refraction of the fluids in the eye, a cloudy lens due to cataract or also astigmatism (irregular shape of the cornea, completely common).
Now back to the reasons why myopia often keeps getting worse. I will concentrate on the most discussed and popular reason nowadays: Our eyes are highly influenced by our behaviour and environment. While people in earlier times used to do their work and stuff in rather mid distances and generally were outside quite for a long time when working, hunting etc., people nowadays (starting from child's age) are often used to work in near distance (crafts, office, school) and also continue this severe strain on the eye's accomodation function when using their smartphones for hours. Unfortunately our eyes react to this constant accomodation in near distance by increasing physical myopia factors. Let's just say that our body is quite lazy. Why accomodate all the time when I can just become more shortsighted so accomodation get's easier? That's propably a bit too easy explained but it makes sense for most of my customers in our optical store. Look at young children these days. They start using smartphones and tablets at too young of age and start wearing glasses at the same time. Some of this is also geneticly influenced by the parents, but you see reasons for this development everywhere around us today.
We often advise parents in this case to get their children play outside more hours a day so their eyes don't get strained too much after doing homework, spending time at the computer or smartphone instead the lens can relax some time as it doesn't need to focus when being outside and looking into far distances. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm not fluent in English. :) </p>
<p>Edit 2: Two more side informations.
Accomodation as I mentioned it a few times above is the process of our lens to adapt to differenct distances. When looking at a newspaper in 40cm the eye adapts by changing its shape to a more spherical one to focus near objects. On the other hand, when you are watching the city skyline the lens is basically not accomodating, its shape is as flat as possible by natural circumstamces to focus distant objects. All distances in between your normal reading distance and ~6m are compensated by more or less accomodation of your lens.</p>
<p>Second, you might wonder if this process of becoming more and more shortsighted ever stops. Yes. It does stop. At some point. While getting older, ears are getting longer, nose getting bigger but myopia doesn't necesserarily progress endlessly and in the same amount it did when you were young. You might even do something to slow the progress (not guaranteed, but it also doesn't harm you): when working on a computer etc have a look outside the window sometimes, don't check your phone too often as needed, keep awareness on how near you are looking at things. Get your eyes some rest as often as you can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>98% right according to current knowledge.
TL;DR for this comment</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if your lens is too thick you will be nearsighted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if your eye is too long, you will be nearsighted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if any of these things gets worse, your eyesight will worsen (more nearsightedness)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some people, long term change in glasses power may be determined a lot by their habits between ages 0-20. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is common for prescription to worsen up to a certain point. Often age 30ish. Then it will shift again, in old age when the lens hardens (presbyopia around late 40's).</p>
</li>
<li>children now are spending more and more time focusing on near things, your eye actually has to work to focus on near objects. Whereas focusing on distant objects is the normal relaxed state in healthy eyes. Over time your eye adapts to focusing on near objects so it doesn't have to work as hard. Usually this entails your eye getting longer.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>optometrist here. It's actually the corneal curvature (and/or axial length) that causes myopia, not so much the power of the crystalline lens. And it's true that prescriptions tend to stabilize in early adulthood, but i wouldn't say it's common for them to &quot;improve&quot; later in life. The most common cause of a refractive shift in mid- to late-adulthood is lenticular changes (like cataract formation or poorly controlled diabetes), but these things are just as likely to shift the refractive error more extreme as less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have astigmatism and near sighted. From she 9 to 26 Everytime I got glasses in two weeks my eyes would adjust to being just a bit blurry. At 26 I had RK surgery. My eyes adjusted to being a bit out of focus after a few weeks but I raised to get glasses. 20 years later I break down and get glasses. Now at 49 it is the same as when I was younger. Every time I get new glasses my eyes adjust. Is there something I can do besides just suffering with an old prescription and looking at the world with a bit of a blur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a hell of an odyssey mate! Well, we can't really influence or measure how fast our eyes change again even when wearing precribed glasses. How often did you need to check your prescription in the past? And what is your actual prescription if I may ask? That actually sounds a bit like there was something odd about the configuration of the lenses in the glasses in comparison to your eyes. The sharpest point of view of the lens should be directly on the point where you look through your glasses most of the time. If that's not the case, this can result in long term blurry and distorted sight WITH your glasses on. Did you visit different optical dispensers in the past? If not, try it out. Sadly it can make a huuuuuuge difference not only in price but in quality of sight where you get your glasses. :/ At our place we really take our time for each customer  and never give up before he has finally the best possible result. All in all, eyesight is something really precious to care for. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. But if you google for, &quot;age related <strong>nearsightedness</strong>&quot; you only get results for age related farsightedness. </p>
<p>Myopia (nearsightedness) is generally first experienced in young children:</p>

<p>However, age related hyperopia is caused by presbyopia:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that shirt sightedness was hereditary and long sighted comes with age (scientists believe but aren't certain, as with most things). Short sightedness is caused by the eye growing too much and long sighted due to weakness in muscles over time. Can't find one succinct source that explains both but plenty of articles on each after googling:</p>
