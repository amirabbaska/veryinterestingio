			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of sound dB generally refers to pressure, not power. (Though you can measure sound power level in dB too)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait negative ph acids would mean in a pool a x water particles there are 10x h30+ lol.</p>
<p>It is log of ionized per total water inside no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am but a lowly mathematician working on what I remember from years gone by... But my recollection is that it's basically the log of protons (in moles) per litre, which can be higher than 1. It's not the fraction of moles of &quot;stuff&quot; which are protons. If I'm understanding you correctly, you mean to say that it's a fraction of substance so it's negative log can't be less than 0?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I meant that. </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, it is - log(concentration of h3o+).</p>
<p>To get negative pH we need a postive log so the concentration would have to be over 10 times the solution(did I get that right?)</p>
<p>Oh well I guess I am too tired. In the meantime I googled this, and this says that is possible. <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/is-a-negative-ph-possible-603653" target="_blank">https://www.thoughtco.com/is-a-negative-ph-possible-603653</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Negative pH is a thing. You can also have a pH higher than 14. The paper below does a pretty good job of explaining it. </p>

<p>Oh well, I should have more time tomorrow to think this through. </p></div>		</li>
