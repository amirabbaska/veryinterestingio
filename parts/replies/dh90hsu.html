			<div class="markdown"><p>We believe the reason convection is no longer occurring is that the core has partially solidified to the point where it does not flow. Also consider that, even if the moon's core <em>were</em> convecting, its magnetic field would be puny. The moon is very poor in iron and nickel due to how it was formed, leaving it with a relatively small core. When Theia collided with Earth, most of the material which was blasted into space to eventually form the moon came from the matle of each body, with very little core material. </p>
<p>Because of this, Earth is approximately 30% iron by mass, while the moon is only around 10%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, according this model most of Theia's dense metallic core would have merged with our own in the collision due to its greater inertia, adding to the proto-Earth's original core volume, while most of its lighter mantle and crust were stripped from the core and ejected into space. (Some of that lighter mantle/crust ejecta was caught in Earth's orbit to accumulate as the Moon). So it's believed Earth gained a considerable amount of core material from Theia but little else, and as a result the core/non-core ratio is higher than it would have been if the collision never occured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It provides the best-fit explanations for many things we know to be true. Primary among those reasons is the obvious difference between the composition of Earth and Moon. The Moon is poor in iron and other heavy elements compared to other bodies at the same distance from the Sun, indicating that it didn't form as its own accretionary body at the same time as Earth. There are other lines of evidence which you can read about here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sheer mass of Earth forces it into a round shape. Even the Moon is large enough to experience this effect. There's enough gravity that any large enough &quot;mountains&quot; on the surface will be too steep to hold themselves up and collapse, rounding out the body into a spheroid. This is the reason all stars and planets are round and in fact, being large enough to do this is a requirement for being a planet.</p>
<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>, the huge crater that was left would've just caved in under gravity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, its proposed that our magnetic field comes from the liquid outer core having multiple convection cells within it.  Think of a bunch of columns of spinning liquid.  A lot of this spinning is in the same direction so you end up with a giant electromagnet. If the earth was cold enough for the outer core to solidify, this would no longer happen.  I think its key to understand that our core isn't a bar magnet, but instead is an electromagnet (which can both have similar magnetic fields!). That's just how I understand it at least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mars has little to no remaining magnetic field, as the core has cooled to the point where it is solid, and can no longer generate magnetic fields through the dynamo effect. Earth's fate would be the same if it cooled. Then, the lack of magnetic field would allow the sun to blast the atmosphere right off the planet, we would be bombarded with heavy solar and cosmic radiation!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Iron loses its ferromagnetic properties at 1043 K</p>

<p>Does that mean molten iron is not affected by magnetic fields? Or just that it can't retain its magnetic properties above this temperature?</p></div>		</li>
