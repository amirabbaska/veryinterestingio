			<div class="markdown"><p>They detonate them in the air, maybe not that high.  It's for maximum effect.  As an insurance measure, cruise missiles also contain a piezoelectric nose cap to cause detonation at impact in case it didn't detonate in the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked into this awhile back (because who doesn't, right?) and came up with the following <a href="https://www.quora.com/Bombs-Why-doesnt-the-blast-from-a-nuke-take-place-on-the-ground" target="_blank">informative discussion</a>. </p>
<p>The energy released by a bomb causes a rapid expansion of air around detonation. The heat generated from the explosion causes air to expand, pushing the colder air around it out of the way. Large nuclear bombs create 30-50psi of air pressure hundreds of meters away from the explosion, enough to warp and blow apart steel. Obviously less is needed to destroy concrete or an unfortunate human being. </p>
<p>If you detonate the bomb on the ground, the airburst below the bomb gets absorbed by the ground. By &quot;absorbed&quot; of course, I mean a crater. Craters are nice, but spreading the airbburst across a few hundred meters is better.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the bomb, it is detonated between 150 and 300 meters above the ground. </p>
<p>The detonation causes that huge rapid expansion of air, but quickly following the airburst shockwave, that pressure stabilizes. Stabilization means that all of that air blown out comes back towards the point from which it was ejected. </p>
<p>This is hard to visualize, so <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5gHFJyMQ6o&amp;t=1m35s" target="_blank">this</a> video of dry ice exploding underwater should help. It isn't a great example, since it is gas expanding in water (as opposed to air expanding in air with a nuclear bomb), but it will give you the general idea.</p>
<p>The gas expands and then is forced back in on itself due to the water pressure. Since the gas is lighter than the water, it moves upwards towards the surface.</p>
<p>Same principle with a nuclear explosion. The airburst expands and then the pressure equalizes, causing the air to rush back in. This air is superheated, and rises from the point of the explosion (relatively) straight up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-125/125-ExplosionsandRefugeChambers.pdf" target="_blank">this</a>  text, the human body can withstand large overpressures without severe direct effects (maybe because we aren't as rigid as a wall or steel? I don't know). The usual high fatalities at those pressures are usually caused by blunt trauma due to being thrown into objects or having the building fall over them, or due to penetration by projectiles thrown by the wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not density perse, but pressure.  The overpressure from the detonation pushes everything at the blast point outward.  When the blast is completed, there is a vacuum at the blast point which then sucks everything back (underpressure).  All the dust and debris from the blast radius gets sucked back to ground zero and rises with the heat caused by the blast.  As the air cools off, the dust settles downward creating the mushroom cloud effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a difference between nuclear and conventional though? As I understand, a normal bomb is a chemical reaction that produces a whole mess of hot gas which then expands out rapidly. A nuclear reaction doesn't produce that same gas but ridiculously more energy which then heats the gas already around it.  Do I have that right</p>
<p>If so, if there were a conventional explosion and a nuclear bomb that were the same size in terms of energy, would they produce the same cloud?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Plenty of large non-nuclear explosions have produced mushroom clouds. </p>
<p><strong>Low Explosives</strong> are essentially combustibles that burn. The heat and pressure results from the fuel molecules capturing Oxygen atoms, releasing heat in the process. Their blast waves are limited to sub-sonic speeds since Deflagration (burning) can't occur faster than the speed of sound. </p>
<p><strong>High-Explosives</strong> operate on the principle of Detonation, where the molecules literally snap apart, sending the individual atoms flying into nearby molecules faster than the speed of sound, causing a &quot;chain reaction&quot; of shattering molecules. </p>
<p>Usually the molecules are composed of normally-gaseous elements like Nitrogen, Oxygen and Hydrogen, whose atoms like to be very far apart. In the high-explosive they're locked together in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDX" target="_blank">tight structures</a> but once you start to break those bonds, they go boom. </p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Weapons</strong> can more or less be divided into two categories: Fission/Nuclear/Atom Bomb and Thermonuclear/Hydrogen, which I'll get to later. </p>
<p>So, remember how High Explosives released energy by letting gaseous atoms trapped in dense molecules suddenly fly apart at supersonic speeds? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_bomb" target="_blank">Fission bombs</a> do something similar, but on an even smaller scale. Instead of deconstructing molecules, Fission reactions deconstruct the individual atoms. This releases thousands of times more energy than a high explosive. Their yield is generally measured in Kilotons (thousand tons) of TNT. That means a 15kT Atomic bomb (Hiroshima) had the equivalent power of 15,000 Tons (30 Million pounds) of TNT. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon" target="_blank">Thermonuclear/Hydrogen</a> bombs use the heat and pressure of a Fission explosion to initiate a Fusion reaction, wherein  Hydrogen, Deuterium and sometimes Tritium literally fuse into Helium. Fusion reactions release even more energy than Fission alone, and thus Thermonuclear bomb yields are generally measured in Megatons (1 Million Tons) of TNT. </p>
<p>Nuclear weapons can also be designed to produce massive amounts of radiation instead of massive blasts, minimizing damage to civilian infrastructure. These are commonly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_bomb" target="_blank">Neutron Bombs</a> and achieve lethality primarily via extreme radiation poisoning. Every unprotected person within 900m (~1/2 mile) of the blast would be immediately incapacitated by a highly lethal dose of radiation and likely die within 1-2 days. About 1/2 of unprotected persons within 1400m (~3/4 mile) of the blast would receive a fatal dose of radiation and die within a few weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that the fusion reaction produces a great deal more energy, but introduces an enormous *fast neutron surge that bombards the rest of the flute, primary, and tamper. This allows for nearly complete fission of the Uranium and/or Plutonium fuel.  Conventional nukes are terribly inefficient at fission on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the initial energy source is largely immaterial. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/MtRedoubtedit1.jpg" target="_blank">Volcanoes</a> can also produce one, as should high energy impactors (larger meteorites and the like).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very-large conventional explosion and a very-small nuclear explosion could still be differentiated by their heat — nuclear is just waaay hotter. And that is reflected in the coloration of the clouds.</p>
<p>Whenever you see some conspiracy theorist post pictures of mushroom clouds and say, &quot;OMG NUKES ARE BEING USED,&quot; just take heed of the colors. If it is reddish orange at its brightest, it's not a nuke. Nukes start with searing white-hot and stay almost too white to see for several seconds, before they fade to red and eventually darker colors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVM9_attO1Q" target="_blank">Here is a 500 ton conventional explosive</a>. Which is to say, half a kiloton — easily the range of small nukes. Notice how the hottest it gets is yellow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yu7p9JhjVk" target="_blank">Here's a 1.2 kt nuke detonation</a> — itty bitty by nuke standards, but you can still see that initial moment when it is just a flash, just pure white.</p></div>		</li>
