			<div class="markdown"><p>Some variation of these illustrations always get linked in threads like this, and they are all just terrible. Dinosaurs are drawn the way they are because <em>that's how reptiles and birds look</em> and they are the closest references we have. No, not all dinosaurs had feathers, and even the ones who did were unlikely to have thick coats of them that would disguise their features. Give paleoartists a bit of credit. Their drawings are based on science and contextual clues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. The cat and swan illustrations make me want to barf. No one clueless enough to assume that a cat doesn't have esrs and a swan doesn't have wings should associate themselves with paleontological art.</p>
<p>Buzzfeed seems to have a huge market around the &quot;buzz&quot; generated from saying &quot;The world is doing it wrong&quot; The world is in almost all cases not doing it wrong. Please be skeptical of skeptics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you're understanding what the sketches represent.</p>
<p>Look at a cat skeleton: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pSMadIJ.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/pSMadIJ.jpg</a></p>
<p>If you've never seen an alive cat but instead only fossilized remains, you wouldn't know it had ears.</p>
<p>Same with the swan.  If you've never seen a live swan but only the remains of it, you wouldn't know that it had wings.</p>
<p>We've never seen dinosaurs so there is a possibility that the artist depictions are missing things.  OP doesn't say they are completely wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to think that a lateral thinking future alien biologist would hypothesize that elephants had a long prehensile nose based on the skeleton. How would an animal of that size get enough food into its mouth? Why is its nasal aperture so large and oddly placed high with a lot of bony support for the whole cranium? Why is the olfactory bulb so large (inferred from the brain case)? Maybe its nose was a sensitive muscular structure that could reach the ground...</p></div>		</li>
