			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and her family are from Gujarat, her mother is Brahmin.  She told me about how her mother would not let her play outside or tan as a kid/teen because it would make her skin darker.  This was once they moved to the US, so it must be deeply ingrained in their culture.  My wife always told me the reasoning was because lower casts worked outside and were therefore darker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't limited to India. Even in Europe (I think, or it was America), before Industrial revolution happened, people regarded those who worked outside as lower.</p>
<p>Then tanning came into fashion. Now, not having to stay inside and traveling in free time is regarded as a symbol of wealth.</p>
<p>But in developing countries (I have read/seen this about atleast in China and India), we still feel that office work is better than work outside because a significant portion of the population still works outside. Its to do with economic state, not the cultural state and certainly not the caste or colonialism.</p>
<p>There have been far weirder cases. Like Hawaiians of some time ago (don't know about now) regarded being fat as better! To them, it meant someone who could just consume. They even hired people who rubbed a certain animal product on their bellies to get fatter. It may be that 19th century capitalists were also fat, but I doubt it was considered a symbol of social superiority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told once that pre-colonial China had a similar standing among fat people. Being fat was a sign that you could afford a lot of food and did not need to perform physical labor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is truly insane.  You can't let someone do something that's entirely unrelated to the castes, because one of it's consequences might lead other people to think of them as <em>less</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, even tourists. African students and tourists have been beaten up in certain cities.</p>
<p>There are a few black as well as white natives. But there are very few to be of any consequence in 1.3 billion grand scheme of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the skin color, the last name, and cultural differences can be used to determine caste. Remember that the caste system, like any social stratification construct is based on differences that have a wide ranging social impact (economic, educational etc). And when that stratification system has been in place for thousands of years, the aspects of that distinction becomes quite discernible.</p>
<p>Of course, discrimination based on caste, creed, color is illegal but the social stigma around can become a factor in interactions when two people don't know each other. If you have good friend that is from the lower caste and you live in Delhi or something, it doesn't have any impact.</p></div>		</li>
