			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about whether to put this under anthropology or linguistics - I honestly didn't know. It's not <em>just</em> English though, calling siblings by their name is the normal in all three languages I know (I am aware that this isn't the case in Japan though, apparently, maybe this is just a European rather than an English thing). </p></div>		</li>

<p>So then why don't we classify it as sociology? I don't agree with your calling this a misclassification. It could well fall into &quot;motherese&quot;, which linguists talk about quite a lot. Or language development. Or several other linguistic specialties. Further, linguistics is quite inter-denominational, so to speak. Sociolinguistics is &quot;a thing&quot;. So is psycholinguistics. And even going with your angle, linguists and anthropology go hand in hand all the time. Sure, maybe there is some societal norm for calling parents by these terms, but it's also quite possible that these choices are tied together with language development. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR</p>
<p>Many things fall into more than one classification and it is ok to refer to whichever classification you are most interested to use for a concept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably fair to classify this as sociolinguistics or linguistic anthropology, two close closely related disciplines.  Duranti makes the distinction that the former uses social behavior to better understand language, while the latter uses linguistic behavior to better understand humans. </p></div>		</li>
