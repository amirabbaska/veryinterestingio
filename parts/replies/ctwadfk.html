			<p>I was wondering about whether to put this under anthropology or linguistics - I honestly didn't know. It's not <em>just</em> English though, calling siblings by their name is the normal in all three languages I know (I am aware that this isn't the case in Japan though, apparently, maybe this is just a European rather than an English thing). </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; the best answer, it's social<br><br>So then why don't we classify it as sociology? I don't agree with your calling this a misclassification. It could well fall into &quot;motherese&quot;, which linguists talk about quite a lot. Or language development. Or several other linguistic specialties. Further, linguistics is quite inter-denominational, so to speak. Sociolinguistics is &quot;a thing&quot;. So is psycholinguistics. And even going with your angle, linguists and anthropology go hand in hand all the time. Sure, maybe there is some societal norm for calling parents by these terms, but it's also quite possible that these choices are tied together with language development. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Linguistics is one of the four fields of anthropology. <br><br>Sort of. You'll hear this from anthropologists, but the reciprocity of the sentiment depends a lot on what a given linguist does. On the far end of the spectrum you have people studying the 'formal properties' of language, who could care less about things like social structure, or even the capacities of the human brain, and are much more akin to mathematicians than even other linguists in certain ways. Sociolinguists, documentary linguists, and linguistic anthropologists are often conversant with anthropologists, but I think even most of them (edit) don't see their work as a subfield of anthropology, and even resent this kind of disciplinary flag-planting.</p>		</li>

			<p>TL:DR<br><br>Many things fall into more than one classification and it is ok to refer to whichever classification you are most interested to use for a concept. </p>		</li>

			<p>Probably fair to classify this as sociolinguistics or linguistic anthropology, two close closely related disciplines.  Duranti makes the distinction that the former uses social behavior to better understand language, while the latter uses linguistic behavior to better understand humans. </p>		</li>
