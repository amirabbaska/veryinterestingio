			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really for me, it will trigger a shitty newfangled sort of captcha where I have to select cars or busses or roads or some shit and every time I click the squares containing these shitty busses or signs or storefronts I have to wait a shit ton of time before another fucking square loads, like literally five seconds for each square, so if the square that's loading has the thing you have to click on and if it happens four times in a row, which it does often, you're sitting there for half a minute waiting for squares to reload. <a href="https://youtu.be/WqnXp6Saa8Y" target="_blank">Why Google why the fuck</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Jesus christ I've never had a more random topic be so divisive against people, literally half agree with me that it's annoying and the other half agree that I'm a lazy idiot who doesn't understand computers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. The mouse click, if it is factored in at all, is not the only deciding factor. It takes into account your cookies and recent web activity to determine if your usage patterns look legitimate or not. If you were to go to incognito mode in chrome or a private tab in Firefox that does not have any tracking information you would get the challenge photos. Simply because it does not have any usage activity to base its decision on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably records multiple points of contact. I'd assume that the pattern of those points is either similar to a human mouse movement (erratic and hard to replicate) or no one has bothered to replicate it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Couldn't you get around it by recording a human movement into the box once and then have the bot reproduce the measured movement from the edge of the box? So the bot will have to detect the box, place the cursor on the edge  and then replay the human movement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>A lot of these and similar systems aren’t to perfectly weed out bots or bad behavior, but to increase the effort required. Just a little bit.</p>
<p>I liken it to The Club. This was an As Seen On TV device that went on your vehicle’s steering wheel. Prevent people from stealing your car! Except that it was easy to bypass. So why bother? Because it’s not about making your car impossible to steal. It’s about making it comparatively easier to steal your neighbor’s car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that there is actually a lot more checks going on in the background before you are even presented the checkbox; think your browser version, IP address and a bunch of other fingerprinting techniques. </p>
<p>Basically, if you are being presented the checkbox instead of a series of pictures it means that these heuristics passed and the system is already fairly confident that you aren't a bot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been public knowledge for quite a while as Google themselves have written about it, found this article from four years ago that references the original implementation (recaptcha v1). </p>
<p>They obviously don't disclose all the metrics that are used (and are probably adding more all the time) to keep up in spamming arms race. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Instead of depending upon the traditional distorted word test, Google's &quot;reCaptcha&quot; examines cues every user unwittingly provides: IP addresses and cookies provide evidence that the user is the same friendly human Google remembers from elsewhere on the Web. And Shet says even the tiny movements a user’s mouse makes as it hovers and approaches a checkbox can help reveal an automated bot.</p>
<p>&quot;All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves,” says Shet. “It’s a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot.” He adds that Google also will use other variables that it is keeping secret—revealing them, he says, would help botmasters improve their software and undermine Google's filters.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually incorrect. There's various papers on the internet showing that mouse events actually do not make a difference.</p>

<p>We experimented with multiple combinations of screen resolutions, and various mouse behavior configurations (the timing of movements and movement patterns).None of these had a negative effect on the risk analysis.</p>
