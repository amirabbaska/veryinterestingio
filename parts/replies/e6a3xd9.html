<p>...and it comes back up in some 3rd-world country before dinner that same day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the guy that was ripping and uploading //Drive when YouTube+ was a thing, because fuck subscriptions.  They would copyright takedown my stuff (it took days for takedown) and I would just un-hide another mirrored copy uploaded by a different account so it was all back within a few minutes.   Plus so uploaded torrents of it too. </p>
<p>It was satisfying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not their problem.</p>
<p>In the US (at least), there is something called the &quot;Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act&quot;, sometimes known as the &quot;Safe Harbor&quot; provision of the DMCA.</p>
<p>In short, it says that if you're a service provider that provides a dumb pipe into the internet, you're not legally responsible for what goes through it.  IIRC, if you start voluntarily blocking some content, that means you're &quot;taking ownership&quot; of everything you haven't blocked, making you potentially responsible for it.</p>
<p>Hence, the safest thing to do as an ISP is to say &quot;because it's not our job, we do nothing without a court order&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. It's not about the effort it would take, it's about the liability it opens them up to, and because they're never going to voluntarily spend money enforcing laws if they don't have to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So question. If that’s the case (and I don’t not believe you), why does Comcast sometimes send out nastygrams about this? My teenager downloaded something pirated - a game IIRC - a couple of months ago from a public tracker and within like hours I had an email from Comcast basically threatening me not to do it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because torrent sites aren’t illegal. Even in the US. Torrenting is a method of sharing data. You share data using email every day. Torrenting is just another way of sharing data. </p>
<p>It’s what they are allowing others to share that’s the issue. And shutting down a specific website that doesn’t care what it’s IP or domain is, becomes quite time consuming.</p>
<p>Mainly because they have to get a court order for every instance they stand up. What takes TPB five minutes requires an entire court process to take down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pirate bay doesn't host anything even remotely illegal (as much as the **AAs would like to claim otherwise).  They don't host any copyright protected material, they don't even host torrents.  They are more like a search engine for torrents.  And a torrent itself?  Just a handy list of people who might have some content that you're interested in.  The torrent itself ALSO does not contain any copyrighted material.</p>
<p>It's really not much different than doing this:

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are in a country where running a site like Piratebay, Silkroad, or Alphabay is illegal then it is very easy to take down the sites. In the case of the silk road, the guy was arrested in California. Alphabay on the other hand was a international effort between the U.S, Canada, And thailand. If canada had decided to not raid physical building that housed Alphabays servers, or if thailand had decided to not extradite the owner then it would likely still be up today. PirateBay has been taken down multiple times, but pretty much anyone can grab a couple cheap servers and host the site. The owner of PirateBay has changed so many times its not even funny.  </p>
<p>Technological prowess aside, there isnt much stopping anyone from starting the silk road again. The law might even catch on and arrest you, but nothing is stopping someone else from picking up the torch and trying to evade the cops. In fact if you want to go buy drugs or guns of the dark net its still just as easy as it was back in the day. </p></div>		</li>
