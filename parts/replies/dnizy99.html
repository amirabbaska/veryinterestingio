			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note a couple of things.  One is that a sovereign nation must be a party to a treaty to be &quot;bound&quot; by it.  It must be a signator which means that the country agrees to the terms of the treaty.</p>
<p>The Hague Convention of 1907 seems to be the treaty that sets out the conditions for a declaration of war.  South Korea is a party to this treaty but North Korea is not.</p>
<p>Finally, technically South Korea and North Korea are still at war.  There is an armistice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement</a> from the wiki and if I have read it correctly North Korea withdrew from that agreement in 2013, in that same year North Korea offered to enter into negotiations for a peace treaty to replace the armistice.</p>
<p>An interesting aside, I found this joint declaration by North and South Korea:<a href="http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/joint-declaration-south-and-north-korea-denuclearization-korean-peninsula/" target="_blank">http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/joint-declaration-south-and-north-korea-denuclearization-korean-peninsula/</a>  from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the Joint Declaration, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (ROK) agree not to test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy, or use nuclear weapons; to use nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes; and not to possess facilities for nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So clearly North Korea is in violation of this declaration, altho I suspect that in 2013 it withdraw from all armistice agreements with South Korea which would likely include this agreement.  I could not see any repercussions of defying the terms of this Joint Declaration, however.</p></div>		</li>
