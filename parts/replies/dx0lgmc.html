			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually general purpose bombs use lower-brisance, lower speed high explosives because that pushing or having effect is desired for destroying infrastructure. Common explosive fillers in aerial bombs are TNT, Tritonal and Comp B. ANFO is a dirty, inefficient, homemade low-brisance explosive so their shouldn't be much outrage centering on the type of explosive used compared to dropping unguided bombs on civillian targets from helicopters. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not to be rude but do you have a source on this specifically? Or just more information? My understanding was that most conventional/military explosives were capable of throwing quite a bit of shrapnel out to great distances, which seems counter to what you are saying unless I am mistaking something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have no specific sources (sorry) but, just as general examples, you can think about it like this: gasoline fumes don't explode the same way that dynamite does, right? Or consider a solid fuel rocket engine (which burns consistently and steadily) vs a grenade (which just explodes in one quick &quot;burn&quot;). Or even a nuclear bomb versus a conventional explosive. There are many types of &quot;explosions&quot; with different properties.</p>
<p>Or, a slightly more specific example where I actually have some deeper knowledge, is blackpowder vs smokeless powder. Blackpowder is what they used for firearms up until the late 1800s. It has a slower burn rate, and a different pressure curve. I think, if I recall correctly, this is mostly due to chemical composition and grain size (smaller/finer granules allow more material to burn at once, and thus ignites faster).</p>
<p>The result is that it's chemically inefficient, but also very easy to reload your own bullets with simple tools because a couple grams of difference in powder-per-bullet won't make your gun explode. However, smokeless powder is very efficient and very fast burning, and requires immense care to reload by hand because a few too many grams of powder can cause your firearm to completely explode.</p>
<p>There is some history and information on smokeless powder overtaking blackpowder here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder</a></p>
<p>I tried to find a non-wikipedia source but there was a lot of hee-haw gun magazine bullshit that I didn't feel would be a good example to send your way.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I hope that was informative!</p></div>		</li>
