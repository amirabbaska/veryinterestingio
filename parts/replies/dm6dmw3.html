<p>the human shape is an issue. So you want to look like the forest background, or grassland background, etc to blend in and break up your human shape.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most vests and orange clothing used when hunting something like deer where you have to hide from the game do have camouflage of some sort. For things like pheasant hunting where you want them to see you it's mostly solid color in my experience since it doesn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vest also is not a complete humans shape and it is usually surrounded by camo. It is possible that it is small enough, and there is enough passing in front of it, that it looks like a shadow to the game.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The deer family are specifically blind to red/orange. People reading that might think they just see everything in black and white, which is not true. </p></div>		</li>
