			<div class="markdown"><p>The different strains can really effect this for some people too. There's definitely a different feeling between a sativa and an indica, and I find that switching after getting used to one can feel a little off at first, which sometimes gives me a little anxiety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually (yeah, I'm being that guy right now) the subject of indicas versus sativas should really only be discussed by growers, as, outside of personal anecdotes, it generally has no actual bearing on the type of high you get. You can find sativa-dominant strains that act like what you'd imagine an indica doing and vice versa. </p>
<p>The real varying effects from different strains have more to do with the different levels of THC, CBD, and CBN present, as well as the different terpenes (flavors), and how they all interact together. </p>
<p>My understanding is that THC by itself is actually kind of a racy high; it's typically what leads to people's reports of anxiety attacks while smoking. CBD, meanwhile, acts like an anti-anxiety sort of deal, while CBN is generally the sleepy-time portion of the high. Knowing this, I personally like high CBD/CBN strains, as that's what I'm in it for: the chill and the couch lock. Some people prefer higher THC strains because they like that head-high; what would normally be associated with sativas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>indicas make you relaxed, sort of like a coach potato type person. you don't wanna get up and just wanna watch cartoons</p>
<p>Sativa is more outgoing and energetic, making you have a smile on your face.</p>
<p>They're almost opposites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never gotten angry with alcohol. I have gotten super duper paranoid with weed, to the point where I'm completely socially incapacitated and dependent on somebody else. </p>
<p>Everyone's different. Weed affects me more negatively more often.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more the sudden feeling of euphoria triggering a 'whoa, what's happening' reaction. Sort of like a plane taking off - many people feel anxious during the takeoff and ascent, but feel perfectly comfortable once they're cruising at 30,000 feet. It's the journey up there some people react to with anxiety, the sudden change in feeling.</p></div>		</li>
