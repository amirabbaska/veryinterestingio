			<div class="markdown"><p>Kelly here, depending on what form the bog is currently in. When wet we were finding dragonfly larvae, mosquito larvae, Giant waterbugs, leopard frogs, green frogs, etc. The bogs are also surrounded by Pine Barrens so there are plenty of White-tailed deer and many local birds (Crows, Warblers, Swallows, Jays, etc.). Dry cranberry fields were loaded with grasshoppers, spiders, and crickets as well.</p></div>		</li>
