<p>Southerns don't care how close blacks get as long as they don't get too high. Northerners don't care how high blacks get as long as they don't get too close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you're recommending <em>American Nations,</em> I also recommend one of the more scholarly books that <em>American Nations</em> cites repeatedly called <em>Albion's Seed</em>, which goes in depth into the religious, cultural, economic, and social differences between the various American colonies.  This includes everything from courtship practices to home building techniques, and how the colonists all drew from different parts of England.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived the first 20 years of my life in the northeast and the last 20 years in SoCal. It's absolutely, without a doubt, the 365 days a year of sunny, nice weather.  It's just relaxing. When I visit the northeast now I laugh at how serious everyone takes themselves but I also find east coasters to be better conversationalists as the sun hasn't melted away their &quot;edge&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
