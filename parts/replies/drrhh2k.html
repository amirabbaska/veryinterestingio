			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong but, IIRC gamma ray bursts are produced in the first few milliseconds of massive supernovae or hypernovae. Stars big enough to leave neutron stars or black holes.</p>
<p>I think Betelgeuse is the only imminent supernova near us and I don't think when it does go supernova it will produce a GRB big enough to worry about. Although it should be an amazing thing to witness. You will be able to see it in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the Wikipedia page on GRB and the page on  Betelgeuse</p>

<p>I realize this is a little off topic,</p>
<p>But any Hitch-Hikers Guide fan would consider it tremendously ironic if Ford's homeworld gets blown to smithereens before Earth via Betelgeuse going supernova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Betelgeuse will likely be a type-II supernova, so nowhere near big enough to hurt us but if it goes up while we're alive it'll be a hell of a light show (easily visible in daylight and about similar brightness to the full moon)</p>
<p>Nearest candidates for a GRB are Eta Carinae and WR 104, both about 7500ish LY away. Eta Carinae already did what some thought was a supernova in the 1840's becoming the second brightest star in the sky, but turns out that was JUST it throwing off 10 times the mass of the sun explosively. There's still another 100ish masses left there for when it decides to go boom.</p>
<p>Eta Carinae we know is angled wrong to be able to hit us with a GRB, WR 104 they don't THINK is angled the right way, but it's not being as obvious about it as Eta Carinae is (since on EC you can see the axis of rotation due to the globes of matter ejected in the 1840's still being there, showing it's about 45 degrees off from hitting us)</p>
<p>WR 104 is smaller, but spinning in such a way that there's a slight possibility that when it goes supernova it may become a long-duration GRB rather than a short duration hypernova GRB.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the atmosphere absorbs sunlight it gets warmer. Did you perhaps mean NO2 reflects sunlight?</p></div>		</li>
