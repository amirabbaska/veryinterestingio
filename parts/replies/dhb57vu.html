<p>The AHCA raised questions, but still not sure if they'll actually be exempt.  The fact that it's even a possibility though is astounding to me.</p>
<p>Edit: Replacing my mistake of the ACA with AHCA.  Thanks for the correction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the Congressional Republicans, the exemption was in the AHCA because they wanted to stay within the rules called 'reconcilliation' which only allow smaller policy changes. The reconciliation rule allows a simple majority (50%+1) which the house can do with votes only from their own party , whereas the normal procedures would require a 60% majority which would require compromise with some Democrats. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Congress would NOT be exempt from the AHCA because of a companion bill introduced by McSally, a Republican who supported the AHCA. The bill passed the House unanimously.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that &quot;remove exemption&quot; bill has to get 60 votes in the senate, which is very unlikely it will.  Someone could easily poison that bill further to make it even more unlikely.</p>
<p>So ultimately, congress may NOT be exempt, but most likely WILL.</p>
<p>They know this and hope the message of &quot;we wrote a non-exemption bill&quot; is swallowed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have an answer to your original question, but I just want to point out that only an early and unpopular version of the health care bill actually exempted Congress. Republican Representative of Arizona, Martha E. McSally, introduced a revised bill which (among other things) removed this exemption and that is the bill that was passed by the House.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. The initial bill that passed the house did indeed exempt lawmakers. It was McSally's subsequent legislation on the bill that removed the exemption. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/us/politics/fact-check-congress-exemption-republican-health-bill.html" target="_blank">Exact same source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but the ACA hasn't applied to them, ever. Even the AHCA applying to them is kind of a joke, because they get an all included Healthcare plan when they get elected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not accurate. The version of the AHCA that was passed did include the exemption. That's explained in the second paragraph of the article that you sourced.</p>
<p>McSally did not introduce a revised bill. She  introduced a second bill to address a defect in the first. Your source explains this as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A separate bill offered by Representative Martha E. McSally, Republican of Arizona, eliminated the congressional exemption from the House health plan.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's probably refering to how they voted to change the ACA for us, but the changes they've made won't affect them because they made themselves exempt.</p>
<p>Which really begs the question, if the ACA is so goddamned fucking horrible- why do they want to stay on the ACA? Really makes you think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was actually misread by just about everyone, and took off as a sensational headline without even being confirmed. As far as I can tell, they repealed the <em>exemption</em> and are therefore now actually subject to the law, which was not the case with the ACA. So it's (possibly, according to what I can tell) the exact opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it wasn't. They even voted to keep the loophole in before they voted on the acha because they claim they'll remove it before it sees the Senate. </p>
<p>Obamacare section 1312(d)(3)(D) requires legislators to buy on the marketplace. </p>
<p>On page 6 of Trumpcare section A(ii) , it lists groups who are waived from the amendments that Trumpcare makes, specially listing those in section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the ACA.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original ACA applied to them the same way it applied to everyone else, but they responded to the accusation that they were exempting themselves by taking away their employer provided plan and putting members of Congress onto the exchange. The critics responded to that move by ignoring it and continuing to repeat their original claim verbatim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is at least one reason for it that seems to make some sense: in the scope of their regulatory duties, congressmen will come into contact with information not necessarily available to the public. Therefore, it's impossible to fully prevent insider trading by congress unless they are prohibited from buying/selling stock, something that I would argue is worse. </p>
<p>But yeah, still shady. </p></div>		</li>
