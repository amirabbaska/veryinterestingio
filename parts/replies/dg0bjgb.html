			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus.  My parents are immigrants and have enough trouble understanding the A-F system.  My city in the USA had a separate system that came along with the normal academic grades that went</p>
<p>E- Excellent
G- Good
S- Satisfactory
U- Unsatisfactory </p>
<p>This system was for citizenship - Measuring if we were good in the classroom and met the teachers standards for behaving, but had no bearing on anything like college.  </p>
<p>EVERY report card when I was in middle school they gave me a whippin for having a E and misunderstood that it was in between D and Fwhen really I was behaving &quot;Excellently&quot;.
I fucking hated that bullshit so if I had your system I'd be screwed over.</p></div>		</li>
