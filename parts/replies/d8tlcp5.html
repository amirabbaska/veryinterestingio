			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you explain largely homogenous places like Japan having a decently high number of people with messed up teeth, so much so that it's actually considered attractive and women will have procedures done to make their teeth less straight. This theory seems pseudo-sciencey to me, I'd really like to see some studies on it. Anecdotally, my mom is basically your run of the mill American (Western/Northern European with a bit of Native American) my dad is Mexican and some polish and I have teeth so straight the dental assistant taking my X-rays a few years ago asked how long it'd been since my braces had come off. My younger cousin has similar teeth and apparently our 1/2 white and 1/2 Native American great grandfather did too. It's certainly genetics but I don't necessarily think it's as simple as being a product of homogenous populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole &quot;racial mixing causes crooked teeth&quot; thing had been thoroughly debunked by the time I was taking a graduate course in dental anthropology in the 1990s. It's similar to &quot;we only use 10% of our brains!&quot; in that it doesn't stand up to either academic or common sense evaluation, but somehow never seems to die. </p>
<p>Inbreeding does not lead to healthier populations, and that applies to dentition too. </p>
<p>Edit: A quick google search will reveal that sites still advocating this theory are predominantly white supremacist. </p>
<p>Edit 2: &quot;Inbreeding&quot; is the word I was trying to type. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also his chiropractor is full of shit, though they all are so I guess I'm not surprised that he said something so utterly stupid about the human skeleton. (Seriously, chiropractors don't go to medical school and chiropracty is not evidence based or derived from medical or scientific knowledge)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always get eye rolls when I say this stuff :/ people always tell me that chiropractors do know about the skeleton at the very least and are required to study it, so how can the whole practice be bogus?</p>
<p>I know that parts of chiropractic knowledge is baseless, but could a chiropractor simply not subscribe to those parts and just understand the body well enough to be useful? I never know what to say when people question me about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to have 4 adult teeth removed so the rest would all fit in my face. Three years of braces to straighten the remaining ones out and then my wisdom teeth barged in to fuck it all back up again. My jaw is so small that they had to use child sized mouth openers on me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here! Not only did I have 4 adult teeth taken out prior to getting braces, my wisdom teeth were delayed because of overcrowding and eventually top ones came out and bottom ones got stuck. Top ones overgrew because no bottom ones to oppose them. Guess what? I had to get all 4 wisdom teeth removed. And my teeth are crooked in the back. So much for braces...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sucks.  I had all 8 removed around the same time so the rest of my teeth haven't moved too much but they aren't perfectly straight anymore.  I should probably get a new retainer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Except I've never had mouth openers used on me. But I'm missing 4 adult teeth, and my wisdom teeth totally messed up my alignment after spending 3 1/2 years in braces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing for me to just learn, only now, at 48 yrs old, that I'm not the only person who purposely had four adult teeth removed.  I grew up poor and my mom took me to one of those dental school places, and they took out four of my adult teeth too.  I never knew why they did that, and assumed later in my life that it was some sort of fuck up, because it actually made my bite a bit too small, and I've have a slight lisp my entire life because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 14 because my orthodontist recommended it. This was 2001? 2002? My wisdom teeth weren't even fully formed yet - dentist said they were basically liquid once they drilled in to remove them. I didn't get to keep the teeth either. It's strange to me that your wisdom teeth weren't removed before your braces were, especially since shifting typically occurs once they come in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here.  My mother had a tiny little jaw and tiny little (very straight) teeth;  my dad had a bigger jaw and horse-sized reaosnably straight teeth.  I got the tiny jaw and horse-sized teeth combo.  Four adult teeth pulled, two years of a palate expander, and three years of braces.</p>
<p>FWIW, my mother was from an isolated village in Eastern Europe, and my dad was from a remote Appalachian holler -- maybe there is something to the different-populations-mixing theory.  </p></div>		</li>
