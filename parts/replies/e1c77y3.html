<p>I think we tend to forget that, as wonderful as modern medicine is, there is still so, so much we don't know. Especially about the brain. </p>
<p>Mary roach has a book called Stiff:the curious lives of human cadavers, where she talks about the history of medicine. She's hilarious and factual. All her books are great, but that one really made it clear to me how little we currently know. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think even in my lifetime I’ll be able to look back at our current treatments and see how barbaric they are compared to whatever modern technologies we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>an NDMA receptor is a N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which glutamate can bind to. Glutamate being an anion of glutamic acid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NMDA is the receptor. Glutamate is the ligand that activates the receptor. Glutamate binding to an NMDA receptor induces a conformational change that opens a pore and allows Na+ and Ca2+ ions to flow through the newly created pore and into the cell, depolarizing it. NMDA Receptors are a bit unique because they’re normally blocked at resting membrane potentials by magnesium ions. </p></div>		</li>
