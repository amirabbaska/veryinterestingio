<p>The water isnt insulating itself so much as there is just A LOT more to evaporate than a thin layer. You are attemping to evaporate a much larger volume of water and failing in the time period that everything stays hot enough to evaporate rapidly. </p>
<p>At that point you are just well beyond the amount of water the drying cycle was ever meant to evaporate. It was only mean to dry off the sides of the dishes. Plates are supposed to be stood up. Cups have to be turned down.</p>
<p>There are rules to how you put the dishes in because otherwise they would all just fill up with water. Those rules help keep the volume of water left over down to the level that can actually evaporate withing the drying cycle time or just with the total latent heat from the washing process, depending on your dishwasher I guess.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the question was not clear as to where the water buildup was or what the Tupperware was shaped like, but yeah most of them have grooves and or bases to make them stand up or other places for water to catch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant insulated from the contribution of heat from whatever dish material it's contacting. Water's much higher heat capacity, if it's collected in a pool, will limit how efficiently heat can propagate through contact with a dish material, making the heat capacity of the dish material a minor factor in evaporating the pooled water -- the pooled water's not going anywhere no matter the material's heat capacity. In cases where the water isn't pooled but just a thin layer over the dish (like a flat plate on its edge), I think plastic or ceramic or glass would be sufficient to evaporate all the water regardless of their different heat capacities.</p>
<p>In other words, the surface area:volume of water is what I was speculating as the main relevant factor in whether water is left over, not the heat capacity. If there's a pool of water, it stays; if there isn't, it evaporates. If there's some precise middleground where the material is relevant because of heat capacity, it will be a small distinction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think it's simply the physical process of having the greatest surface area available - so there's a higher chance that any individual molecule of water with a high enough energy to leave the liquid state is at a place where it can do so if it happens to bounce in the right direction. not so much about insulation from heat as giving those molecules their best chance. but maybe we're saying the same thing using different terms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: the ceramic coffee mugs, I noticed the other day that the cheap mugs I got from IKEA have a little slit cut into the side of the bottoms that allow for most of that pooled water to drain out. Simple but genius. Thanks, Swedes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more of the reason than Specific heat capacity IMO, for the main reason, as you said, that Tupperware curves will affect the evaporation more than the conductivity of the material. (Not that it isn’t a factor, but only a minor one). </p>
<p>Here’s what can happen. A Tupperware container will have a ridged edge for the lid. This will catch water and it will sit there. Like you said, the water can’t spread out and will pool and not evaporate well. The water can conduct the heat through itself instead of evaporating into vapour. </p>
<p>Also, have you ever noticed your Tupperware bowls being wet on the underside when flipped upside down? This has a little more to do with SHC and thermal conductivity but the main issue here is that the small amounts of water that do evaporate will actually condense back onto the underside of the Tupperware. This is because the plastic is more insulating and will not retain heat once it is used to evaporate water. The plastic cools the fastest and the moist air condenses on the plastic undersides no matter how well it had evaporated off earlier. </p></div>		</li>
