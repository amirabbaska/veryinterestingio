			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally if you were abandoning a well you would put a plug deep in the well and pump cement on top of that. No bladder. They do have inflatable devices for certain applications. I don't know where the leak is so I can't comment on everything. Likely they aren't rigging up on the problem well because of the leak. It's flammable and toxic. A relief well like they're doing would've been their last option because it's so expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds to me (based on the very limited reading I've done) that the leak is occurring in the annulus of production and intermediate string, and migrating to surface through channeling that has occurred in the cement. Under normal circumstances you could set a bridge plug, dump cement on top of that, and perforate in order to preform a squeeze with the cement. You are 100% correct that drilling a relief well is a last resort. The job mentioned above might have cost the producer $75k, however, drilling this relief well will be in the millions. I don't know what the going rate for a rig is in this market, but your typical land rig will cost around $25k per day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Separate the methane from what? I'm sure the gas is almost all methane. Maybe heavier HC components along with it. Regardless if they can't contain the leak at the surface then I really doubt they can route it to any vessel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, scrubber units are meant to remove heavier carbon chains from methane.  This well is sitting on top of a methane storage reservoir, so there probably isn't much heavier chains moving up the well.   </p></div>		</li>
