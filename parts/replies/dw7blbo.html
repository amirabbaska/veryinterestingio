<p>Generally speaking people don't want to ruin their lives by breaking their contracts, destroying their careers, and being sued into oblivion just to give people a free movie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty much the answer to most questions of this sort. It’s tempting to think, “With so many people, there’s bound to be a leak!” but it’s just not worth the risk for the vast majority of employees. Imagine you were in their shoes. A bit of internet notoriety, or your job?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some dimwit at a 3rd-party office that was doing QA for a game I was working on decided it was worth risking his current job and future job prospects in the industry by leaking a screenshot of something he was testing.</p>
<p>Being a dimwit, his screenshot also showed part of his windows desktop, including the time of day and a very identifiable desktop image, all the information required to find and fire him almost immediately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>films leaking are not really as much of a thing anymore.  I feel like in the late 00's a lot of films leaked.  Since then, studios have learned to better manage who gets what and use better DRM protocols. </p>
<p>Also with the advent of better quality, more reliable, and more secure streaming technology, they probably don't have to send out as many hard copies of screeners to people anymore.  This is a bit of speculation, on my part though.</p></div>		</li>

And then a passcode would get sent to them in email. He had stated that you could only play the thumb drives. In the specified times alowed and could only play it so many times.</p></div>		</li>

My brain is telling me that they actually had higher viewership for those specific episodes. My mind could be playing tricks on me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i worked on the props department for ‘exodus : gods and kings’ a few years ago, and the non disclosure agreement you have to sign is heavy on the penalties for leaking any information whatsoever. we were not allowed to take any pictures whatsoever, remove any items from the workshop or talk about the designs of any of the props. if you did, you were fired on the spot, escorted off the premises, were not paid, and would be taken to court with fines upward of £100,000. i didin’t get to put any photos of that work in my portfolio for over a year, when it came out on dvd and i could screen capture images of the film from the official dvd. it’s absolutely not worth the risk at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I work on Shameless and some other big shows and movies. Huge penalties and also even though I get all the scripts sent to me before we start shooting the episodes or movies (meaning that I know how the season ends months and months before it airs) they all are watermarked with my name across the script. Their system sends out the script to everyone with their own name across it. And when they send out the dailies (what we shot that day) and rough cuts, same deal. Watermarked with my name on it. Same thing happens to post production etc. Also not to mention that this is your career. And it’s a very difficult industry to break into. You will be found out sooner or later (you just robbed a giant media company of tens of millions of dollars. They’re going to hunt you), you will be sued and or put in jail. And then you’ll never be able to work in anything close to this industry again. Huge risk. Little reward. </p></div>		</li>
