			<div class="markdown"><p>They have fairly quick metabolisms, though slowish for birds, they reach age of maturity quickly relative to their life span, and are fully grown rather young, usually less than a year. </p>
<p>But they are the birds that live the longest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like all birds parrots have relatively fast metabolisms.  They also grow and reach maturity relatively quickly.  (Though slower than most birds).</p>
<p>But these are only general rules, some things are exceptions and there may not even be a reason for it.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible a species developed a mutation that allows a longer lifespan which was neutral (or mildly detrimental) to the individuals, but the same individual where that mutation originated also had a strong positive trait in terms of reproductive fitness.  This causes the neutral trait to spread simply because the two traits are linked in the population pool.  This is especially true if both traits present on the same chromosome and so are reproductively impossible to separate without another chance mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess its because they are very intelligent creatures that have language and form societies of sorts, which require experienced &quot;brain banks&quot; in the form of senior birds. &quot;Grandma&quot; parrots are thus useful from evolutionary point of view, similar to old humans, old elephants, senior great apes, or grandma whales/dolphins/orcas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The free radicals theory of aging suggests that aging is the result of oxidative damage build up in the cells. Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a result of leaks accross complexes I and IV of the mitochondria. These molecules can damage lipids proteins and dna in the cell. As this damage accumulates in the DNA you get a break down of systems.  The smaller a species the more metabolically active they are per gram of tissue (full body metabolic rate scales roughly with size). So smaller animals are producing more things like hydrogen peroxide per gram of tissue which is accruing damage faster.  We have an antioxidant response which limits the damage done. While I don't know about parrots specifically birds have developed very capable antioxidant responses especially in birds that migrate. So it may be that if this theory of aging is true, parrots are retaining some antioxidant capacity or DNA repair mechanism from their past. But honestly I don't know. Personally I think the theory helps explain why we see an increase in lifespan generally with size but it's not the whole story.  It has been implicated in diseases but to attribute all of aging to it seems premature. But I haven't heard any other theory that explains the relationship between aging and body size any better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially in respect to the age at maturity, animals that take longer to reach sexually maturity must be able to counteract and slow down the mechanisms of aging like cancer, telomere-shorting, and the accretion of replication defects. If an animal is able to reproduce at a very young age, they are going to allocate all their resources to be able to reproduce as fast as a possible. For example, a mouse won't use the resources it gathers to offset cancer because it produces at a young age with relatively large litter sizes. All the food and energy it uptakes will be used  mainly in reproducing. For humans, we reproduce much later in life and have much smaller litters and less reproductive episodes so in order to ensure that we pass on our genes we must take preventive measures to try to resist and slowdown the aging process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reproduction is actually huge in lifespan determinism, or at least somehow related. In flies selected for later in life reproduction, their lifespan increased. I'm not exactly sure what the specific mechanism or genes are but I do know longevity can be selected in a species for by selecting for those that reproduce/reach sexual maturity later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question doesn't really even make sense without much more clarification.  Defining a &quot;lifespan&quot; isn't that easy.  Here's a semi-related thing that shows why: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figuring out the oldest thing alive requires defining &quot;alive.&quot; That's not as easy as it might seem. If you want to be strict about finding the oldest living thing, you have to look for organisms that have been alive and active for their entire life spans — continuously metabolizing. A less rigid definition might allow for seeds or bacteria that have been dormant for ages but that can be revived. (Is a seed alive? Hmm…) </p>
<p>You also have to define what qualifies as an organism. Maybe you want to be stringent about it and limit your search to ancient individuals. Alternatively, you could count clonal organisms, like certain plants or fungal colonies. Those are made up of relatively young offshoots, but these are part of a continuously living being.</p>
