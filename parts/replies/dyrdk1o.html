			<div class="markdown"><p>I've taken part in a research programme that was supposed to measure if there's any significant benefit to taking cold showers, and it turned out that the cold-shower group had less sick days, felt happier and was more productive than the control group that took warm showers.</p>
<p>So there's more benefit than just being very awake.</p>
<p>Edit: The results are available <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/cold-showers-lead-to-fewer-sick-days" target="_blank">here</a>. The punchline comes down to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On average, in all the groups that doused themselves with cold water, people were absent 29% fewer days than people in the control group.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I didn't read the study, but isn't it possible that the only people who last are people who have BAT because they can handle the cold better? People with less BAT can't handle the job so they quit meaning there are a higher than average number of workers in Finnland with BAT.</p></div>		</li>
