			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans also build nests.  We just build them out of 2x4s and drywall and fill them with couches and beds.</p>
<p>And trust me.  Ladies are not impressed if your home looks like it was furnished by a dump raid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that harder? I mean, okay, I don't know how to make honey, sure. But if pressed I could probably very easily make hexagon shapes out of some waste product body makes. I wouldn't want to. But it doesn't seem impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honeycomb is the result of making equal sized round holes, making them fit together then making them as spacious as possible (thinning the walls). There is a lot of math behind honeycomb’s hexagonal shape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, remember, most birds fail on thier first several attempts at building a nest. I think it was Planet Earth, but it might have been a different one, showed the eggs falling out of the nest because there was a hole in the bottom. Another failed because it couldn't hold the weight of the eggs. Most of the first year adults (of that particular species) lose their clutches due to inexperience.</p></div>		</li>
