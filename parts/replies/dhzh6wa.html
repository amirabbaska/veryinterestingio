<p>Need a strong workforce to support the non-working population. Most European countries with low birth rates do MUCH more than just tax breaks. Offering 9-12 month maternity leave for mothers AND fathers, subsidized daycare after that, and financial incentives. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Japan's population is expected to decline significantly in the next few decades.  Other <em>fun</em> aspects of this are leading Japan to increase immigration (Japan is currently 99% ethnically Japanese), increase research and development in automation (cause they won't have human workers), and freak out economically because the crash we had in 2007-2009 they had much worse in the 80s-90s and again with us in the 00s but without the ability to throw people at the problem like we do in the West.</p></div>		</li>
