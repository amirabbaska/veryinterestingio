<p>Yes, most large buildings are made with expansion joints.  Not the same type you see in the picture above, but similar in concept.  The joints allow movement due to temperature variation while keeping the portions of the building connected.  </p>
<p>You can find them in floors and walls of most tall and large buildings, typically in long hallways. Look for the the strip of rubber (or other flexible covering) on the floor.  That strip of rubber is covering the actual joint.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The victorians did without as they used weaker mortar and tolerated the cracking as the building shifted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have some at work in the floor. Our floor is a mix of ceramic and vinyl tiles laid on a floating slab, and there are expansion joints running across it. They basically just look like long metal strips running across the floor maybe 6 inches wide</p>
<p>Also, next time you cross a bridge have a look. They have some too, running across the road</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. Come in just to say this. Expansion joints slow down the train speed, produce noise when the wheels pass through the gaps, and cause discomfort to passengers.</p>
<p>most of the modern rails that serve high speed trains use clamps to lock the rails at a fix position during rail installation. the rails are firstly tensioned before it's being clamped, which means the tensile strains in the rails is able to &quot;neutralize&quot; the compressive stress induced during the cold temperature.</p>
<p>continuous rail is one of the most important aspect in high speed train (over 300km/h), the traditional rails with expansion joints/gaps would have caused havoc to any train that travel at such speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat to have two experts here. Two questions out of curiosity:</p>
<p>Why are these expansion joints less commonly used? Is tensile preload generally less expensive?</p>
<p>Also, how does one &quot;stretch&quot; the rail while laying the track? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your stretch Ra√ºl with heat. Rail heaters are about the size of a pickup truck and a big propane tank with burners on the bottom. It walks along and heats the rail, and you monitor the temp, back up the heater if necessary. </p></div>		</li>
