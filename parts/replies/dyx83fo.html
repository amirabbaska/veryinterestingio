			<div class="markdown"><p>Until a particle reaches escape velocity, it's not lost. Indeed, statistically most particles that are ejected by solar winds (or just random temperature effects) will not have escape velocity and so their trajectory will be an ellipse that brings them back.</p>
<p>But the losses described in that link are those particles that are truly ejected - with escape velocity. That means they'll be in orbit around the Sun. Some will end up being captured by Jupiter, for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Space. If it wasn't lost to space, then it wouldn't be stripped away, now would it?</p>

<p>No, the Earth's atmosphere doesn't extend past the Moon. There are a few things you could be confusing this with.</p>
<p>First possibility. While the Earth's atmosphere doesn't continue past the Moon, air pressure does. There's no such thing as a perfect vacuum. Think about it, if the Sun is constantly giving off 'solar wind', then there definitely can't be no pressure no matter how deep you get even into interplanetary space. (This pressure is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_medium" target="_blank">interplanetary medium</a>.) So how much pressure is there at the Moon? Well, here's the most generous figure (at the Moon's surface, on the day side). 0.0000000001% (10^(-10)%) of the pressure on the Earth, at sea level.</p>
<p>Second possibility, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere" target="_blank">exosphere</a>. This is the region where the Earth's atmosphere merges with the interplanetary medium. The exosphere starts at the point where barometric pressure (being able to predict pressure based on altitude) becomes meaningless. Theoretically, the exosphere could extend as far out as orbits around the Earth are possible (well beyond the Moon). In reality, the exosphere ends where pressure from the solar winds becomes the dominant force. This is where the magnetosphere ends, sort of. On the sunward side, this is about half the distance from the Earth to the Moon's orbit. (The exosphere definitely ends here.) On the dark, the distance is utterly absurd, but the exosphere doesn't extend throughout the entire tail of our magnetosphere. Like a shadow of any moving body, it passes. And particles passing through the tail but still orbiting the Earth eventually swing back around to the light side. So, while the exosphere does bulge on the dark side of the Earth, the solar wind is still the dominant force on particle found in the distant reaches of our magnetotail. They're just momentarily shaded.</p>

<p>That's not how gravity works. Gravity doesn't just pull things down. Just because the particles become shielded by the Earth, that doesn't mean they lose their momentum. And, as mentioned above, anything in orbit around the Earth eventually comes out of its shadow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik we also gain like 40,000 tons of mass each year from solid matter crashing on earth.</p>
<p>I would assume that earth is growing, not shrieking - just because it has always been growing in the past.
Note that with all elements other than helium and hydrogen being created by fusion reactions - but most elements in solid form are actually created in collisions during supernovae.</p></div>		</li>
