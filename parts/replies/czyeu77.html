			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the first question I thought of as well. I wonder if these brains can somehow achieve consciousness? It's interesting to think about. Would it even be able to understand it was conscious if it didn't have any connections to organs that would give it any senses? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's interesting and bizarre to think about. If I'd never had the ability to sense anything at all, would I have existed as a person in any meaningful way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to say it would be like a constant state of dreaming, but then if there were never any memories of life with senses what would one even dream about? It does sound like a type of torture. The brain's self was ripped from the universal consciousness only to be thrown into a dark, empty place with no idea what or where it is.  But if it couldn't know what it was, would it be conscious at all? This is really hard to wrap my head around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, or maybe it could be pure bliss. It wouldn't know anything other than that, so it wouldn't really have a frame of reference right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it has no I/O. No eyesight, skin touch, taste, scent, hearing, motor reflexes etc. The brain itself can't feel pain. So its probably not feeling anything at all or having much to think about. Human brains don't seem to come prepackaged with a large suite of instinct programs like other animals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would a brain ten times the size of our own function any better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no doubt that you could connect them to some type of sensory input, but my question is would consciousness begin before or after the sensory input? Do we need senses to be conscious, or in other words do we need to have something external to be conscious of before we can be conscious of our self? Otherwise how do you know that you have a self if you can't relate yourself to anything else? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot. We really hope to reduce animal use in this field a lot. So many diseases of the brain, the safety of chemicals...
I am not a philosopher, but these little cell balls without any sensory input cannot from my point of view. They lack all the differentiation of the brain. What we observe is brain cell function in an orga-like environment, not higher cognitive functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was wondering. I thought the whole complication of creating a brain was giving it consciousness and awareness. Do we now know how to give something awareness? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do not attempt to produce such higher brain functions. We want to help finding drugs, which interfere on a cell level, by providing a more meaningful cell environment. Cells loose many important properties when not in their typical environment.</p></div>		</li>
