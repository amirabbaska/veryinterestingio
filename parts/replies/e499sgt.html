			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the balloon still has a center and everything seems to be expanding AWAY from it, hence why I didn't like that analogy alone. While the individual balls do have centers in my example, there is no &quot;center&quot; for the &quot;infinite ball pit.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So where is the center of the ballon surface? That’s what that analogy is limited to. The center cannot be inside the balloon. Distance is limited to ‘on the surface’. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why the analogy posits you on the surface of the balloon of which there is no center. Your just stepping down a dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the expanding happen quickly? Will it outpace the possibility of us traveling to other solar systems if it is constantly expanding? I don't know much about this stuff but it makes me a bit sad that everything is getting further away so it will only get harder as time passes for us to get to another system, or is that not true? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe doesn't <em>expand</em> faster the farther away it is, it just gets <em>farther away</em> faster the farther it is. </p>
<p>That is, the <strong>rate</strong> at which a distant galaxy is moving away is greater relative to things that are closer. If you use the ball pit analogy from the previous comment, you can imagine that at the beginning, there is a blue ball right next to you, and a yellow ball 10 balls away. Now, as all of the balls begin to expand, you'll probably still be able to touch the blue ball, even though its center is technically moving away from you, but the yellow ball will quickly move out of your reach because not only is it growing, but all of the balls between you and it are expanding as well. The more distance between you and a given ball, the more balls there will be between you, also expanding. That yellow ball is moving away from you faster than the blue one simply because everything in the middle is growing too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you’re saying, but what I don’t understand is how that makes sense in a “flat” universe. More specifically, how does a distant object move away more quickly than a closer one in a flat universe? I see how that would make sense in a spherical universe. Is this where dark energy comes in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a leak in the analogy.  It's supposed to be a perfectly symmetric balloon that is expanding everywhere at the same rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they don't, if you has a friend in the ballpit 1meter away and another 10 meters away they would be moving away from you at different rates Because the space between you is larger and the expansion has a greater effect over that distance.</p></div>		</li>
