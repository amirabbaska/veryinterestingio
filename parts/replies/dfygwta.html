<p>Ironically this wouldn't be terrorism by most definitions as the motive is personal, financial gain, not for ideological e.g. political or religious motives.</p>

<p>In the context of say, recent Islamist attacks, there is still logic in a twisted way to senseless killing. Compared to &quot;old&quot; styles of terrorism like the IRA or ETA there isn't a simple, logical goal to be achieved by violence, rather &quot;new&quot; styles of terrorism like Islamist ones are framed in the context of a kind of total religious war. A war against God's enemies, a struggle of all existence between the faithful and the unfaithful.</p>
<p>To put that all basically their &quot;message&quot; doesn't make sense because it isn't really based on a strategic, logical goal like, get out of this territory. Rather it's based on a twisted theological interpretation of religion that is at its heart illogical. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say they bomb a subway. Now, there are a lot of subways in the world, so a person's chances of being on the next subway they bomb are very, very small. However, many people aren't going to want to take that chance. So people stop taking the subway, which means more traffic, which then hurts the economy as people have trouble getting to and from work or other destinations. </p>
<p>It's not just about the bombing, it's about what all the frightened people do after the bombing. That's what people mean when they say things like &quot;If we do X the terrorists win.&quot; If they bomb a subway and you stop using the subway as a result, you've given them what they want.</p></div>		</li>
