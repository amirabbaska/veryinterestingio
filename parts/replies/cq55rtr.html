			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very interesting, but I have a follow up question that is kind of a devil's advocate type of question, but is of genuine interest to me. How does one actually know what it feels like to be male or female? Being male, I just look at myself and say &quot;this is me&quot; and I identify socially as male because of our genetic classification of &quot;male&quot; as well as sharing all traditional &quot;male&quot; interests and activities.</p>
<p>But I also believe that how one views the world, as well as every aspect of themselves, as a spectrum. I do believe that sexuality is a spectrum (likely a bell curve) so without knowing how if feels to actually be one gender versus another, how can one actually say &quot;I feel like a woman&quot; while being born genetically male?</p>
<p>I may not have articulated this well, and I talk with my sister (who is a lesbian, but has been with men, but prefers women, hence reinforcing the spectrum belief of mine) a lot about sexuality, but still do not understand how someone can state that they &quot;feel like&quot; one particular gender when they were not born that way. Men range in interests and activities all over the place, from gay to straight, feminine to masculine, etc, so what I do not understand is how someone can identify with something so far from what they are. And by that I mean I don't &quot;feel&quot; male, I check the &quot;male&quot; box on documents. The notion of feeling a gender is something I do not quite understand, hence feeling that one is really a different one seems even more odd to me.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not trying to offend if I used any terms or statements that may have, I'm not PC but I am respectful of others and have absolutely zero issues with anyone living the life they choose as long as they don't hurt anyone else, so I'm in no way judging, I'm trying to understand the notion better. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is a good one, and not at all Devil's Advocate!</p>
<p>Essentially, I <em>don't</em> know what being a woman &quot;feels&quot; like. I have an innate sense of wrongness towards most of my sex characteristics, and derive some comfort from the idea of having a feminine body. Nothing I can totally put into words as well as either of us would like. I guess the best I can think of is a memory of being young and hating my body, and seeing a female diagram in a sex ed book my parents gave me and thinking &quot;I'm supposed to look like that&quot;. Nothing to do with gendered interests or activities. Simply an issue with the physical body.</p>
<p>No offense taken!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Sentience is a cruel thing to have sometimes, particularly when one is young enough to feel consciously uncomfortable about their body. I guess it's one thing to hate it for being overweight, but with enough effort, that can be changed. Gender is another issue entirely. Thanks for the response, I don't think it answered my question as I don't think there is an actual answer (it's not a black and white situation) but at least I understand how you view it. And what's worse is the jackasses who just say &quot;They are different so I don't like them.&quot; </p>
<p>Thanks for the response, I appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the one you asked this question, but to add a bit.  The fact that you don't think about your gender is the big distinction.  It's much like someone who is straight probably never had to realize they were not gay, it's just the default assumption.  </p>
<p>An example I saw once went a lot like this, although I may be a little off.   Imagine you are a crab, and you live in the ocean.  You go about your daily life, and you never really feel great, always been ing a little bit uncomfortable, maybe a little itchy, but you don't know any better, so this existence is life.   Until one day you get swept into this nice warm sandy beach, and you get to feel the air, and it's amazing.  Suddenly you feel comfortable, and all the itchy feelings go away.  Your whole life is in the water though, and people will try to pull you back into the water, so you go back in to the water, but now everything has changed, because now you realize why you are uncomfortable, and it makes your life miserable.  It is that moment of realization that will eventually grow to consume your entire life until all you can think about is getting out of the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent question. I'm sure experiences vary but this is mine. To me, the occurrence of dysphoria and intense depression highlighted to me that something was wrong. My time in the military became incredibly hard. I actually had difficulty identifying as a woman and denied it for many years. But I did &quot;feel&quot; wrong and I had incredibly intrusive and distressing thoughts that didn't necessarily correlate to physical desire. I would have preferred to be a man, socially, in fact I had an extremely good life as a man, but I felt absolutely awful, a feeling that simply got worse and worse over time until I was driven suicidal. After plenty of therapy, it was determined that I had GID and everything started to make sense to me, even though it took many months of denial to accept.</p>
<p>After starting HRT (hormone replacement therapy), I rather quickly went from feeling suicidal to incredibly happy and content for the first time ever. At that point in time I had absolutely no desire to change physically, but through acceptance I realised that living as a woman was most right for me, as much as I didn't want it. I never wanted to be transgender, I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. But it simply is part of who I am and I've accepted that now. It has been 2 years since the start of transition and I live happier than I've ever been. I still have very typically &quot;male&quot; hobbies if that even is a thing, I still wear tomboyish clothes, but I just feel excellent and &quot;right&quot;. It's a really hard and conceptual thing to explain to people but to me it's purely a hormonal issue, a mismatch of hormones with my brain.</p>
<p>Side note: Don't worry about causing offense. There are a lot of overly sensitive trans people about, especially online. The vast majority of trans individuals are actually pretty normal. Allowing free discussion around the subject is really important! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really appreciate you taking the time to answer this question as candidly as you did.  I have often asked the same question as OP and never received what I felt was a legitimate answer.  It has always appeared to me that justifying/encouraging the desire/need to change one's appearance to solve an internal conflict is, effectively, kowtowing to what is an obvious mental illness.  I have wondered why such an illness would simply not be treated as other similar illnesses would be.</p>
<p>Millions of American suffer daily with mental illness and we treat that illness with a variety of different therapies, medicines, etc.  without encouraging its propagation.  We legitimize the person and their need without legitimizing and furthering the illness.  I've felt, in regards to this particular disorder, that it deserves better treatment to help someone accept who they are biologically, rather than acquiescing to their mental perception.  Your answer helped explain that.</p>
<p>You gave a clear, supportive answer that helped me to better understand the situation and has given me a deeper appreciation of this issue.  Thank you.  It is refreshing to see someone go out of their way to broaden the minds of others on such a sensitive topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what's hard to understand is that when it comes to mental illness, we treat mental illness with what reliable research and science has been shown to increase the well-being of that person regardless of ideology. So in that sense, Gender Identity Disorder is treated just like other mental illness-it is treated with what has been shown with rigorous years of research to increase the well-being of those who experience it. In this specific case that means years and years of therapy and then moving on to the specific hormone therapies and sexual re-assignment surgery if they so choose, so that they may live as who they want to be. </p>
<p>Further, I have to point out that unlike other disorders of delusion, GID is restricted to one's gender identity. There aren't other symptoms of delusion in addition to this. So it's not like we're telling a schizophrenic person to validate all their hallucinations and watching their lives completely turn to chaos. We're just saying to someone who identifies as a woman that they can live as a woman. Further I think it's important to point out that homosexuality used to be considered a mental illness that many people used to use the exact same rhetoric that you're using right now, &quot;why would we let them live as they want to be? why aren't we trying to just change them so that they can be &quot;normal&quot; like the rest of us?&quot; and I think most people nowadays would agree that that narrative was very wrong and misguided and homosexuality is not a mental illness. I hope we can think of people who are trans the same way in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes--very much yes to your second point. I think it's important to recognize the strong social stigma behind the idea of &quot;mental <em>illness</em>&quot; when discussing the place of GID and homosexuality within the realm of scientific study. While GID and homosexuality (and, if you think about it, many disorders listed within the DSM either presently or historically) are really markers of difference in neurological operation and experience, we tend to knowingly and unknowingly both apply a negative social understanding to these physical/emotional/mental distinctions. They are regarded as abnormal, therefore as an &quot;illness.&quot; It is my hope that the more we aim to research and understand these differences, the less they will be unnecessarily stigmatized. When we think about &quot;treatment,&quot; especially in the case of identity &quot;disorders,&quot; we should not leap to the facile conclusion that a person will be &quot;made well&quot; by attempting to &quot;normalize&quot; them.</p>
<p>I apologize for my flagrant abuse of quotation marks, but I am using them here in order to point out how socially tinted all this language really is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I explained being trans to the girl I nanny a year or two ago. </p>
<p>Recently we were having a conversation and I mentioned that trans people are often discriminated against in society. She was genuinely shocked.</p>
<p>It apparently had never occurred to her that there was any reason to stigmatize trans people. And when she found out that some people did, she dismissed them as &quot;weird.&quot;</p>
<p>She's 11. I'm also convinced she's going to grow up to be president but that's neither here nor there. In any case, conversations with kids make me feel really hopeful about our future. I just wanted to share.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree with that part. But what's interesting and strange to me that a lot of trans people (at least those from Tumblr crowd) seem to not think of themselves as just somebody with GID - they seem to mold their whole identity into it. It's like they're identifying with having an identity disorder, rather than just trying to overcome it, or overcoming it and trying to forget it. For example, the whole &quot;transexual&quot; definition - if you want to be a woman instead of a man, why not just call yourself a woman? (if you've already undergone the surgery). Why identify specifically as transwoman?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many countries other forms of psychiatric treatment have been tried to repair transgender people to the gender they were assigned at birth. Much like the programs to cure people of homosexuality, every form of therapy created, failed. Decades and decades of research have shown that it is not possible to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; a transgender person.</p>
<p>Plenty of people suggest psychological therapy, but when it comes down to what that therapy would entail, their suddenly silent. What exactly do you think a psychologist and a trans person should talk about that would fix the trans person's gender dysphoria? Doctors and psychologists tried dozens of different methodologies and all they managed to accomplish was killing people. Gender dysphoria can and does kill the people afflicted by it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, hormone replacement therapy and/or surgery DO help trans people. In fact, the success rate is astronomical. It is almost insane how big of a difference a chance in hormone balance or a &quot;cosmetic&quot; surgery can make to a trans person's quality of life. </p>
<p>I went from struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for many many years, to finally understanding what it feels like to have a normal state of mental health. All I needed was testosterone and a double mastectomy. I can guarantee you that without access to physical transition care, I would not be alive today.</p>
<p>Physical transition is the &quot;cure&quot; of choice because it works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also I would like to clarify that this was definitely NOT a loaded question. I genuinely wanted an honest answer. I am looking at this from a non transgender viewpoint and genuinely wanted to be educated by people who actually know. Thank you again for such an enlightening answer :)</p></div>		</li>
