			<div class="markdown"><p>Because cooked bones splinter easily. Raw bones are very flexible, while cooked bones are porous and might make sharp splinters which might damage the cat. The cat will gladly eat cooked bones, but I once saw on tv a cat that had a infected jaw because the cat ate bones and got a splinter right into the back of it's neck and the jaw had become all rotten. Lucky cat because it's internals was fine. Usually they puncture something inside. Often everything is fine, but I would not take the chance.</p>
<p>Raw bones on the other hand do not make sharp splinters. Break raw chicken bone and then break cooked chicken bone and you will see why one is dangerous and the other is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please don't give ANY domestic animal bones. Even raw ones can splinter. Or cause impactation. Or pancreatitis. Or chip a tooth that can become infected or accessed. We have bred our cats and dogs to rely on the food we designed for them. I have seen a animal choke to death on a bone, and I have seen terribly invasive exploratory surgeries to retrieve bone splinters from the stomach or colon. Buy them supplemental treats, a higher quality kibble, but please DO NOT feed your pets bones. Cooked or raw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive heard this many times on Reddit. Im originally from a rural area, weve had a bunch of cats and dogs in my family. Everyone there gives cats and dogs bones and ive never heard of it being a problem. Never heard anyone say &quot;dont feed them bones&quot;. Even from my aunt who was dog lady that owned tons of dogs. Im starting to think this problem might be from cats and dogs that didnt grow up eating bones so never learned how to properly eat them and are suddenly given a bone and fuck up some how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, not sure. We have always given our dogs bones (albiet not chicken bones), mostly larger bones. Never had a problem. If we include my last 3 living generations that is almost 200 years of combined subjective observation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rural pets are badass dude. My cat used to catch live mice to give to her kittens as hunting training. She also survived 2 poisonings. The thought of raw bones killing that creature is laughable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Way too many &quot;purebreed&quot; pets would not survive without human intervention because looks where chosen over health etc.  </p></div>		</li>
