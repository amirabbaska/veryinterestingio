			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an icecream maker (it auto stirs and all that magic).  Just throwing yogurt into it doesn't make it into good frozen yogurt.  I'm guessing that normal yogurts have poor a ratio of milk fats to water content (even greek yogurt), because even with stabilizers, it freezes into a solid brick.</p>
<p>You are correct that you can make your own froyo, but it won't be good if you make and freeze normal yogurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need ice and salt with a home ice cream maker. The ice and salt are to make a brine that keeps the ice cream cold while you manually stir. Home ice cream makers have a double walled mixing bowl with coolant inside of it, that you freeze before making ice cream.</p></div>		</li>
