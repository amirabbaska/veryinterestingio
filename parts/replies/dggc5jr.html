			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my grandpas fought in WW2 (I wrote about him here some time ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My grandpa was the only son to a family with 8 daughters. Being from an old farmers family he voted FDP (whatever is was called then, liberals) for as long as possible, as the NSDAP made it harder for them to find and pay farm workers.
Had he died our name would have been gone. Drafted in '42, barely 18, rushed training as a grenadier, send to Russian front, injured near Kiev, send home, send to France shortly after Normandie landing, injured again, send home and to the Homefront after that.
Surrendered to the Canadian forces, spent 2 years as French prisoner for war. Kept in contact with the place he was send (a farm) for decades.
Never talked much about his time in the war, until he wrote it down around 7 years ago. He passed away in 2013.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not fight for glory, he fought because it was expected, <em>a good man goes to war</em>. Those were the times. He didn't even really fight for his country or culture, that man bellowing speeches from the podium wasn't even speaking the same language (my grandpa grew up in East Frisia, where you spoke Low German)</p>
<p>He never talked about his time in the war, not to his kids, not to us grandkids. And we knew that it was wrong to ask. This was pretty much how it was all over the country.</p>
<p>In the first two decades, the 50s and 60s, people tried to forget, to push the memories away, the whole culture, you can still see it in the architecture, buildings from the 60s tried to get as far away as possible to what was &quot;german style&quot; before. Many old (medieval) city centres, even tho not succumbed to allied bombings, were replaced with new futuristic buildings, pushing away the old times. It was only during the late 60s-70s that the young generation started really asking questions, and started the whole process of reconciling and understanding the not so distant past.</p>
<p>It took my granddad until the late 90s to come to terms with his involvement.</p>
<p>edit: this sure got more upvotes than expected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Germans had a rather intense military tradition until the end of WW2, largely thanks to the Prussian military legacy that was adopted as a sort of national identity following unification. It was considered very prestigious and honorable to be a soldier, far more so than even the jingoistic idiocy we're steeped in today. Reading the lengths that guys like Rommel went to in order to achieve military honors and be recognized for their skill and bravery (and especially to win the coveted <em>Pour le Mérite</em>) is crazy to 21st century sensibilities, but in those days it was the epitome of manhood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that you say he kept in touch with the farm where he worked. My Gran's family owned a farm in England where German and Italian POWS worked, and her mum, (my great-grandmother,) used to keep in touch with some of the German POWS after they went home. She believed in looking after them as well as she could; she argued that they were all some mothers son and they were only doing their duty like our sons were. The POWs in turn would warn my great grandmother of who the real Nazis were and who to avoid. </p>
<p>Both my Great grandmother and my Gran hated the Americans for how they behaved in England during the war, (as did my Granddad who fought in many famous battles in the war,) but they defended the non-Nazi POWs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been said before, but the first country the Nazis invaded was their own. Many people, maybe most, objected to some part of the Nazi regime as the war approached, but those who did so vocally were at best pushed aside and at worst, literally murdered. </p>
<p>Add to that, Germans were proud of their country and eager to take back what had been taken from them in the aftermath of WW1 (personally I subscribe to the theory that the treaty of Versailles largely caused WW2 because it was ridiculously harsh on Germany). </p>
<p>Plus, eventually, a draft was a draft, and many men were put in the position of being either soldiers or criminals. </p>
<p>So how did they think they'd be remembered? I don't know. Probably they were​ just doing the best they could for their families and themselves in rough circumstances, without much thought to spare for legacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested about the treaty of Versailles, Keynes wrote a book about it called The Economic Consequences of Peace.
Keynes was an advisor in the British delegation that negotiate the Treaty and he left before the ratification because he didn't agree with it. </p>
<p>It is a quite well written book (surprisingly), he just explains how the negotiations went and why Germany would never be able to pay and what it would lead to another war. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's largely a myth. The Treaty of Versailles didn't go far enough, as evidenced by the fact another World War started.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can say the same sort of wishy-washy thing about any political group. Some people objected to some parts. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Every single part of the treaty was broken before WW2 occurred. The thing that caused Germany to <strong>seek</strong> a war was wounded pride, because they lost.</p>
<p>You could have had a period of massive economic investment and support for Germany post WW1, and people <em>still</em> would have supported nationalistic expansionism. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>many men were put in the position of being either soldiers or criminals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So were the Italians. See how the end of their war was, compared to Germany's.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably they were​ just doing the best they could for their families and themselves in rough circumstances, without much thought to spare for legacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Or</em>, we can look at their diaries they wrote home, about how they were pretty stoked about how many villages they were purging during Barbarossa. </p>
<p>Of course there were people who didn't want to fight, who objected. But this was not the culture of the Wehrmacht or Germany. It was not the dominant narrative in people's lives. The level of &quot;collaboration&quot; with the regime was enormous. People didn't pretend not to notice the death camps because they didn't want to be sent there, but because they trusted the Fuhrer about <em>those</em> people. </p>
<p>This isn't to demonise Germans as an ethnic group. It could have happened to the UK had we lost WW1. We just can't start to argue that it was a few bad apples at the top that kept everyone afraid to do the right thing. </p>
<p>Don't buy the Clean Wehrmacht myth. The Volk were proud of their country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the average soldier fought for honor or for their country. My grandpa was a German soldier in WW2 and he was just so grateful to survive somehow. He was still a teenager when he had to go to the eastern front. He wanted to be remembered as a writer and reminded people how horrific wars are.</p>
<p>I wish we would stop fighting and hating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats pretty much it.  We have a sort of remembrance/memorial day here, but its a day of reflection and solemness, and honors the victims - ALL victims, ALL who suffered.   A great deal of respect in my town is paid to the Jewish cemetery, for example.  If there is say, an allied cemetery, a lot of people will go there and pay homage to the allies that stopped the war.  As for the German soldiers themselves, there is a statue in my town that lists the townspeople who were lost.  Its pretty modest and very respectful.  No one would ever don a German soldiers uniform, although some of the older soldiers might have items of pride from their military days BEFORE Hitler.   </p>
<p>We still have some old soldiers left in our town.  Most of them fought at Stalingrad and lost all their friends.  They will sing an old song and mourn their lost buddies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Top two comments explain it quite well. I'd like to add that it's not 'natural' that soldiers are celebrated like heroes as much as in the US; I believe it is something that's also enforced by politicians so as to make the public support the idea of war. And well, most Americans think war is something honorable so they 'naturally' honor their soldiers whereas Germans learned a few more lessons about what it means when you go out and slaughter people. Plus it's not always evident who is the aggressor and who defends their country; or one country not always 'only' defends itself. Think for example of the Vietnam war, where the US (and France before that) were definitely rather the aggressors than defenders. Or so many other colonial wars for that matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is I think the way the US treats solders now is directly related to the Vietnam vets and Vietnam war coverage in general.  The vets were hated, spit on, denied services from veteran organizations , and left to die in the streets.  Some wore the uniform because it's all they had, which made things worse for them.  After that there was an effort to make sure that didn't happen again.  The problem is media over corrected.  Also there's plenty of people that felt like the media's role is what caused the US to &quot;lose&quot; Vietnam.  So then you have the people applying that pressure.  Can't have the public turn and decide we need out or we might &quot;lose&quot; again.  Also add in the fact that the US is a volunteer army now, unlike with the Vietnam war. If the public lost interest and it wasn't respected you wouldn't get more meat for the meat grinder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Vietnamese government did 10x the harm to its people than the US ever did.  So it kind of depends on how you defend aggressor, like is an aggressor a nation who responds to the threat of a brutal dictatorial regime, or is the regime?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so I'm clear: there are veterans in your town who were with the 6th Army at Stalingrad, got captured with 91,000 of their comrades, made the walk to Moscow and then Siberia, and are some of the 5,000 that actually managed to RETURN TO GERMANY?! And are still with us today?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two cents I would like to add to the explanation why Germans do not honour their soldiers of WWII much:</p>
<p>1) The later in the war you look the fewer of the soldiers were volunteers, fit for the job or enthusiastic for the war. Consequently the portrait of soldiers being sent to death against their will became more and more true.
As a prime example of this take the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkssturm" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkssturm</a></p>
<p>2) boils down to the part: &quot;without thinking about the ones who did heinous things.&quot;
Essentially you cannot do this. Especially caused by the tendency of the returning soldiers not to talk about their experience of the war you basically don't even know whether the exact people you want to honour died honourably, &quot;only&quot; killed a few civilians for food or hunted down hundreds of jews or something.
And to be honest: If the person you would want to honour is your father or grandfather, maybe you do not want to ask either.</p></div>		</li>
