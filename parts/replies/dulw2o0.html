<p>I don't know about other species, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, your dog doesn’t understand rhythm. Pretty much all our understanding of music is unique to the human psyche. That’s not to say animals can’t enjoy sounds, and that more vocal animals (birds, monkeys, dolphins) haven’t responded to adjusted pitch music in studies.</p>
<p>But it does mean that you dog gets a completely different experience out of music you listen to.</p>
<p>It doesn’t ‘fit’ the sounds together in its mind. It doesn’t inherently time the music, or understand the beat behind it.</p>
<p>To the dog it probably sounds like loud nonsense.</p>
<p>It just likes you, and you are doig something, so of course it will be curious and playful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my dog doesn't react at all when I play most instruments or music through a speaker, but when I play the harmonica in a staccato, slow style he sings along. He matches pitch and everything. Thoughts? Does he think I'm howling and is joining in in the &quot;pack&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be related to how we store music and sound and play them back. With digital music we will purposefully cut out noise outside of human hearing range in order to decrease file sizes, why store sounds you can't hear? Which is probably fairly obvious to a dog. Even analog equipment that has a broader pickup range recording in some kind of non-compressed format might suffer since we specifically focus our microphone design, amplifier design, and speaker design to be most optimal for human-range sound. So compared to a real instrument, a speaker may sound flat and fake to a dog, and they would likely be use to that flat noise being garbled human nonsense they are use to ignoring. Where as a real instrument may even have extra sounds and depth they can hear that we can't, same with our voices.</p></div>		</li>
