			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep penguins aren't monogomous for life like most people think. They frequently will stay with the same partner season after season but sometimes they will change, have side partners etc... </p>
<p>This nat geo video kind of shows a female changing partners. Warning it has quite a bit of blood.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I watched the video.</p>
<p>At first?  &quot;Ha, how cute how they fight.&quot;  Then the minor cuts, &quot;Wow they overhyped the blood.&quot;  Finally get to the end.... &quot;okay I was so wrong, wow.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
