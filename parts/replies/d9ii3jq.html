			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that Bohmian mechanics requires a preferred spacetime foliation to be made consistent with relativity.  Do you have a sense of what the &quot;deeper&quot; theory behind relativity would look like to make a preferred foliation tenable and, if not, doesn't this challenge make Bohmian mechanics a less credible contender than other realist interpretations of QM (Many worlds, GRW collapse, time symmetric) which can be relativistic without a preferred foliation?</p>
<p>Does Bohmian mechanics make a prediction for the precise spatial extension of particles or is it sufficient to treat them as point particles?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What if it only predicts 90% of all statistical predictions, but doesn't match up with some of them? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's generally a problematic question in physics (and I suppose science in general) how much you should be allowed to extrapolate based on the theories you have to describe what you <em>can</em> observe.  At one extreme you can say theories are <em>only</em> tools to make predictions of observations and nothing else. While it's a view that's popular to express and lets you get back to work quickly it leads to some uncomfortable absurdities. I can observe the CMB and I have a theory, the big bang theory, that makes consistent predictions with those observations (and many others). But in that view I'm not really allowed to extrapolate back in time and say the theory describes something that actually happened in the past. It's a theory that allows me to make predictions of observations and that's it. If you take the view into everyday life you run into some very serious absurdities and end up with something akin to epistemological solipsism. A lot of people would step back from that and agree we can extrapolate our theories to some extend beyond what we can directly observe. Not all, though. I've certainly.met phycisists who'll double down and insist that's just something we'll have to accept.</p>
<p>The problem with QM is that we have different underlying theories that make the same predictions, but have widely different extrapolations. It would be like having a theory that explains the universe as we see it today, but it predicts a completely different past than the big bang theory. Would you think it doesn't matter which is correct? Again, some people would say it doesn't matter, some would say it's a meaningless question and some people would argue about them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's ever a meaningless question. That's kind of epistemologically defeatist. I sense that it's like this: the universe's mechanics operate on functions that are unknown to us. We only see the output. We create models of understanding that try to best describe these functions, evaluated based on their predictive capability. If there are two &quot;competing&quot; models that seem to both explain reality accurately then they are either actually the same model or we lack the information that would allow us to determine which is more correct. I don't believe its possible that two theories could perfectly account for the future and have drastically different explanations for the past. </p>
<p>Try to write two functions that return identical Y values after a certain X value, but not before. Possible if you accept values within a range, which is where we are right now, but that has less value.</p>
<p>Obviously we're at a time where we lack the technology to observe QM closely enough to scrutinise pilot wave theory vs  Copenhagen but really don't think that it's worthless to continue to make extrapolations. How else will we narrow that range? What else would motivate us?</p>
<p>I think you can only do that by extrapolating beyond what you can observe, because the scope of what you &quot;can&quot; observe grows through the scientific process. You discover capability to observe by making those assumptions and trying to find ways to (in)validate them. I think science would be a lot less effective if you decoupled hypotheses from experimentation. That's my feeling, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I disagree with your analysis, but y=abs(x) vs y=x are two functions that give equal y values from a certain point and not before that. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Just a technicality, but if two models really do produce exactly the same results, I'm not sure that I'd call them the same model. A better term might be &quot;dual&quot; models. In the case of mathematical duals, each may be more useful than the other in specific circumstances. They may both be faithfully modelling the same thing but I wouldn't call them the same model. Once we've determined that they model the same thing, then we can stop arguing about which model is correct and just argue about their utility.</p></div>		</li>
