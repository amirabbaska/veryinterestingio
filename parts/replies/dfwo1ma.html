			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is if you stay in Canada where do you move? Especially depending on your field your options are basically limited to the GTA. Don't speak French? Well Quebec is ruled out. Not to mention the job prospects in Montreal are not very impressive. If you don't work in hydro, aerospace or make cheese you're kind of fucked. The video game industry is being propped up there by government subsidies however working in video games isn't exactly gonna rolllll in the money. I have heard just absolutely awful things about the job market out west in Vancouver. If you go mid-west to Alberta/Saskatchewan you're now faced with a collapsing oil industry as everything grinds to a halt due to the low price of oil. Where people used to brag about making double the national minimum wage working at a tim hortons now there are no jobs. Basically every other process is just dim. Manitoba is a mess and has been basically since they hung Louis Riel. The maritimes haven't been the same since the coal industry collapsed and now their fisheries are being hit too. </p>
<p>The Canadian market is propped up by oil, natural resources, and inflated housing. We've knocked oil out of the equation with fracking and overproduction, if it doesn't bounce back soon I'm not very positive on the future of the Canadian economy. But global warming is doing wonders for our north though! So bring on those carbon emmisions imo. Let's turn Toronto into a tropical paradise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like the real answer to your question is simple: <strong>Debt</strong>. </p>
<p>This is also happening where I live. Housing prices are rising rapidly but average salaries aren't really keeping up. </p>
<p>Sure, you might make $75k/year and live in a $600k house. The ~$2300 mortgage payment would be about 1/3 of your income. And somehow <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/08/04/housing-30-percent-rule/" target="_blank">society has convinced people that it's normal to spend 30% of your income on housing</a>. So you'll be spending about $30,000/year for your house until you pay off the mortgage in, what, 20-30 years? </p>
<p>To me the real question is: Why do we, as a democratic capitalistic society that &quot;votes with their wallets&quot;, let it get this bad? It's crazy how expensive it is to just <em>live</em>. </p>
<p>And there are also some good points in this thread about averages and statistics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1/3 of 75k is 25k/year.  And actually, 1/3 of your gross is not a bad ratio for overall living expenses.  It's when you're getting into the 40%+ range that things are becoming unsustainable.  Now, if you're referring to Canada, the taxes and write-offs could be different. What I said is referring to the US.</p>
<p>That said, you're correct that debt is fueling this run up (just like it did last time).  </p>

<p>People think homes are about value.  A huge chunk of home prices simply comes down to access to debt.  Unsurprisingly, the world didn't learn this painful lesson last time around.  It basically comes down to this:</p>
<p><strong>If you approve the average person for a loan they cannot afford they will take the loan</strong>.</p>
<p>This is so simple the mind repels, and yet most believe they're immune to it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, some Canadian towns Toronto? Vancouver? are trying to work on problem. Solutions arent going to come quickly but a start is a start. They have started penalizing non resident owners for holding onto properties that sit vacant. Seems as if they are trying to deal with speculators which are prime drivers of these hyper prices.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly, most people probably support things like deductible mortgage interest, which only serves to make housing more expensive.</p>
<p>Hopefully interest rates will continue to rise to a more realistic level so the &quot;cost&quot; of money can bring housing prices more in line with reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Renting isn't necessarily that bad.  You don't need to worry about maintenance, freedom to move around for work/if you don't like your neighbours, and if you're financially responsible, investing your money can yield pretty decent returns since you won't have a downpayment that eats up your principal.</p>
<p>There's pros and cons to everything :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My var mortgage is 2.2%, I will happily borrow $infinity if they would let me (and dump it into a bank stock yielding 4-5%).  You realize the downpayment doesn't dissapear right?  My 'returns' on my downpayment have been double digits every single year (in terms of equity gain). Renting in such low interest enviroments doesn't make sense to me, what am I missing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except you're burning your money, not earning equity on it. $1 of rent gives you no asset. $1 of mortgage gives you part of an asset. If you're dropping $24k on rent per year, you're out close to $100k. You didn't invest it at 5%. You don't get anything for that money but time and space in the past.</p>
<p>And rent prices are climbing.</p>
<p>And the market is still going up which means the value of each dollar you save/invest decreases in terms of purchasing power.</p>
<p>If the market is going up 35%/yr, you'll have to be investing in selling drugs to get that kind of return.</p>
<p>Even if it drops off to 0% for the next 5 years, you'll just have broken even if you found an investment that gave you 7% back each year (not accounting for compounding, but you get the point).</p></div>		</li>

I live about an hour north (straight up the 404). And the the prices there have skyrocketed.
When I bought 6 years ago, 1850 sq ft house, just under 300k. Same houses (similar upgrades) now going for 880ish
You can get a maybe 1000sq ft for around 500k here... but further south towards Toronto? Yeah, even there, the STARTING is 800+k</p></div>		</li>
