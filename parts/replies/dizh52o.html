			<div class="markdown"><p>The classical definition of liberal maps liberty to policy; avoiding government restrictions of anything, whether individual liberties or economic regulations. </p>
<p>Conservative is more of a relative term. It is only the opposite of liberal in the American, open to change, use of the word. Otherwise, it's meaning is going depend on what policies are being conserved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want specific ways in which this word changes, it was probably the uneducated taking 'liberal' to mean 'liberal application of government regulation,' while in Europe in maintains a connection to 'liberty', as in 'liberty from unnecessary regulation.'</p>
<p>I have to admit I'm not 100% sure what you're seeking here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thin it was less a case of &quot;liberal application of government regulation&quot; and more that the party that tends to favor government regulation of businesses is the same one that is more socially liberal, in terms of things like abortion, same sex marriage etc.</p></div>		</li>
