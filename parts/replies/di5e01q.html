While Hearst did influence Anslinger, no company was more panicked than DuPont, who realized that hemp could quickly and cheaply fill in for many of the products they produced synthetically.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how hemp is legal in the US, but god forbid we <em>produce</em> an insanely versatile plant fiber, great source of protein, and a complete amino acid profile. (as well as about 100 more uses).</p>
<p>I'm not saying it's a miracle drug; although CBD oil is pretty-fucking-useful as a non-toxic, non-psychoactive, anti-inflammatory drug. However it's just so versatile and cheap. Henry Ford made plastic x10 stronger than steel many decades ago... I'm too lazy to google it though lol</p>
<p>Better to just pay absurd prices to Canada and import it.... wut?</p></div>		</li>
