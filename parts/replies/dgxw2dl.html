They'll come back alive when they warm up and you have a little airplane flying around your yard powered by flies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They might be different flies. If you put any fly in the fridge, it will move slower than before. A lot of the reactions in living organisms work slower the colder it gets. (Food spoils slower in the fridge, wow.) By putting a cold blooded animal in the fridge, it will generally move slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I catch a fly with my tongue I eat it right away, I mostly prey on small rodents though. I like my food fresh, I only use the fridge for drinks and sometimes diary based snacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also tend to slow down as they age. Life expectancy is max about 30 days for your average housefly. If they're near the end of their life they're more sluggish (just like humans).</p></div>		</li>
