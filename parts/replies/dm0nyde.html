<p>Apparently we've also found places in the bones where the feathers would have come out in some dinosaurs (as well as found that tail with feathers/fur on it), and up until very recently we just imagined them as giant lizards.  A while back I even read an article claiming dinosaurs would have been much smaller than we had thought them to be after we <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090621195620.htm" target="_blank">re-did the weight equation for them</a>.  I think a lot of this is guesswork, isn't it?</p>
<p>And as I understand it Pompeii was unique in the exact way you've described.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nitpick here, but feathers never emerged from bones. Feathers emerge from follicles in the skin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are rare, surely. But we do have some finds of some dinosaurs with some of this level of preservation.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>As they were excavating the city in the 1860s, they started finding hollow pockets filled with bone fragments. The dude in charge of the excavation quickly realized what they were and ordered the workers to fill them with plaster when they found them. I wouldn't call that a hunch. </p>
