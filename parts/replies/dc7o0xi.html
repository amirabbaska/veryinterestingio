The difference is that most people don't rely on the detail-oriented parts of their taste as much, at least not consciously, so you notice your eyes first.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that when you're tired it's easier for someone to wok up next to you or behind you and you to not want a second helping? Or that you don't really taste what is being fed to you?</p>
<p>In a kitchen environment, the first way I notice that I'm getting tired and it's time to call it a day is that I can't discern details as easily.</p>
<p>It's all about input, sensory stress, and what you are focused on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know if we're talking sleep deprivation and extreme levels of exhaustion, you start having auditory hallucinations way before visual ones - so I wouldn't be surprised if your hearing actually went first, and it people just don't notice because they normally don't pay as much attention to it.</p>
<p>Of course, it may also just be strain on a particular set of neurons that causes fatigue. It might be that whatever thing you're paying attention to more is the thing to go.</p></div>		</li>
