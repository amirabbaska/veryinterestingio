			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily danger. Seeing a butt is unusual. Your son probably noticed that people act like he shouldn't see butts or show his butt. People act like something bad would happen, and yet nothing bad is happening. In this case a social rule is violated and those usually carry consequences. There's no threat of physical harm. Had your son grew up where seeing butts is common, he probably wouldn't care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmmm. I am weirdly concerned about my parenting choices. In the future, should I show him more butts or fewer? :D</p>
<p>I kid, I kid...butt seriously, he'll laugh uncontrollably at the mention of a butt. Today, the wind was blowing and some cloth was billowing out on the two sides where it's not tacked down, and he thought the wind-butt was the greatest thing ever. I wish I could be six years old again. In his defense, it totally looked like a butt.</p></div>		</li>
