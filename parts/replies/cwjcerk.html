			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess this is where the confusion comes from. The idea is to prevent the other food, close to the hot food that you put in the fridge, from heating up. However, it's not very useful to let bacteria grow in one pot of food to prevent a little heating in another pot of food.</p>
<p>My solution so far has been to let the food cool for a few minutes (get it from say boiling hot to lukewarm), and then put it in the fridge. In the past, I have also put a pan of hot food in a bath of cold water (of course while preventing the water to flow into the meal) to cool it down faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had say one big pot of soup, wouldn't it be better to split it into smaller containers before refrigerating? I always heard since it will cool from the outside in, a large amount will leave the inside within the danger zone longer, while splitting it allows it to cool faster and more evenly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I cook foods with less bacteria than other foods, but I've never had problems with leaving something to cool on the counter for a few hours. I understand that the chances of infection become remote if it's, say, a heavily boiled pot of soup (aka nearly sterilized), but I don't feel like I take too many special precautions with my leftovers and I have no issues. (Admittedly, I cook very few dairy products, and really no partially cooked meat.)</p>
<p>I don't think people should take zero precautions, but I think a lot of foods are rather more robust than some people worry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is how it's done. also, always put warm food into a closed container so the steam won't condense on the cold items in the fridge and ice up the back wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTOH, evaporative cooling is significant and covering a hot item will extend the time it takes to cool.  One should allow items to cool to 60C/140F(hot holding temperature) before placing in refrigeration.  Below this point the released vapour shouldn't be enough to cause issues so long as the cooling item is stored in immediate proximity to sensitive items.  </p>
<p>If the item is hot enough/large enough for condensation to be an issue, it's large/hot enough to need to be cooled uncovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With things like a big pot of soup the best practice for restaurants and the like is to portion it off into smaller containers, as the center of a large pot of say, chilli, can still be warm after a day and a half of sitting in the fridge! Smaller portions means greater surface area and faster cooling, therefore safer food!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most places I've worked tend towards the icebath/wand technique rather than using an excessive amount of storage containers.  Even a 20+ litre pot of chili can be cooled effectively with an ice bath/wand and some stirring.  </p></div>		</li>
