<p>Do you have scientific studies/proof backing that statement? As far as I understand the primary source of endotoxins a human would encounter are from the bacteria within their own body, and that even a ridiculously spoiled meat (that is fully and properly cooked) would have no effect on a healthy human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would depend on the poison. Distillation would prove troublesome for example if the poison forms an azeotrope (a 'boiling mixture') with water, meaning the water and poison would evaporate and condense together. Now I don't know of any specific poisons that do that, but I would certainly investigate it further before risking it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great information in this thread. I did a bit of research into this a while back - specifically about how altitude while hiking influences the boiling guidance, so my focus is on common stuff you find in water while out in the wilderness. (You'll see my seemingly arbitrary use of 14,000 feet below. Mt. Whitney, the highest peak in the lower 48, is 14,505'.)</p>
<p>tl;dr: Boiling your water for any duration gets rid of lots of nastiness that you'll commonly encounter while hiking.</p>
<p>The CDC suggests that:
&quot;Common intestinal pathogens are readily inactivated by heat. Microorganisms are killed in a shorter time at higher temperatures, whereas temperatures as low as 140°F (60°C) are effective with a longer contact time. Pasteurization uses this principle to kill foodborne enteric pathogens and spoilage-causing organisms at temperatures between 140°F (60°C) and 158°F (70°C), well below the boiling point of water (212°F [100°C]).</p>
<p>Although boiling is not necessary to kill common intestinal pathogens, it is the only easily recognizable end point that does not require a thermometer. All organisms except bacterial spores, which are rarely waterborne enteric pathogens, are killed in seconds at boiling temperature. In addition, the time required to heat the water from 60°C to boiling works toward heat disinfection. Although any water that is brought to a boil should be adequately disinfected, to allow for a margin of safety, boil for 1 minute. Although the boiling point decreases with altitude, at common terrestrial travel elevations it is still above temperatures required to inactivate enteric pathogens. To conserve fuel, the same results can be obtained by bringing water to a boil and then turning off the stove but keeping the container covered for several minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>(See <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/the-pre-travel-consultation/water-disinfection-for-travelers" target="_blank">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/the-pre-travel-consultation/water-disinfection-for-travelers</a>)</p>
<p>The Wilderness Medical Society Practice Guidelines for Wilderness Emergency Care states: &quot;As in pasteurization, temperatures above 160°F (70°C) kill all enteric pathogens within thirty minutes, and 185°F (85°C) is effective within a few minutes. Thus, disinfection occurs during the time required to heat water from 140°F (60°C) to boiling temperature, so any water brought to a boil, even at high altitudes, is safe.&quot;</p>
<p>It's interesting, then, that the CDC recommends one minute at sea level and three minutes at elevation in their general guideline, which seems to contradict both their own guidance about 'common terrestrial travel elevations' and the Wilderness Medical Society. Which is correct?</p>
<p>Of the water-borne bacteria, viruses, and protozoa listed by the World Health Organization, only Hepatitis A and Poliovirus 1 survive instantaneous temperatures greater than 80°C for more than 1 second. The highlight of the word instantaneous is deliberate. The inactivation is a function of both temperature and time, as suggested by the Wilderness Medical Society. To reach a boil, time has been spent at each previous temperature. At 70°C for example, Giardia is inactivated at the rate of 99% for every 600 seconds. According to the EPA, water is considered potable with a 3-log (99.9%) removal of Giardia lamblia and 4-log (99.99%) removal/inactivation of other viruses. At an instantaneous temperature of 80°C, Giardia is inactivated to a safe level in 60 seconds and is instantly inactivated at 87.7°C (see Kerasote, Ted:  Great Outdoors; Drops to Drink.  Audubon, July 1986).</p>
<p>Let's looks specifically at those viruses which are the most heat resistant.</p>
<p>Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A can be encountered in water that is contaminated by human waste, so it is possible to encounter this in wilderness situations.</p>
<p>Bidawid et al (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10772219" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10772219</a>) found the following for the heat inactivation of Hepatitis A:
Hepatitis A 5-log reduction (99.999% reduction)
85°C in less than 30 seconds
80°C in less than or equal to 41 seconds
75°C results in a 1-log reduction for each 10.2 seconds
Note that temperature exposure is instantaneous. That is, the samples were immersed directly into a water bath at the stated temperature. The higher temperature does not, therefore, take into account any time of exposure at any lower temperatures. Note also, that Bidawid's study focused on Hepatitis A in dairy products and concluded that fat content affects the survivability of the Hepatitis A virus.</p>
<p>Parry and Mortimer (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6094725" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6094725</a>) found the following for the heat inactivation of Hepatitis A:
Hepatitis A 5-log reduction (99.999% reduction)
85°C virtually instantaneous
80°C in 5 seconds
75°C in 30 seconds</p>
<p>In either case, based on Bidawid or Parry and Mortimer, achieving a boil at any elevation up to 14,000' eliminates the risk of Hepatitis A.</p>
<p>Poliovirus 1
Poliovirus 1 is also possible in water contaminated by human waste.</p>
<p>Strazynski et al (see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160501007085" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160501007085</a>) found the following for the heat inactivation of Poliovirus 1:</p>
<p>Heating at 72°C for 30 seconds was a reliable method of inactivating polioviruses present in water, milk, and yoghurt reliably. Also, heating at 55 °C for 30 min resulted in complete inactivation of polioviruses, regardless of the suspending medium.</p>
<p>Similar to the Hepatitis A virus, achieving a boil at an elevation up to 14,000' eliminates the risk of Poliovirus 1.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking this to add onto a common food preparation misconception.</p>
<p>You'll see that the recommended <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html" target="_blank">safe internal cooking temperature for chicken is 165° F</a> (~73° C). And in a sense that is right, if you cook chicken to 165° F, you'll kill pretty much all of the bad stuff... along with any decent texture and flavour.</p>
<p>But in reality, it is a function of temperature <strong>and</strong> <em>time</em>. If you heat chicken to 165° F, the harmful bacteria are killed nearly <strong>instantly</strong>. So if you hit that temp at all, you're OK. But what you can <em>also</em> do, is <strong>heat the chicken to 160° F for about 15s</strong> to achieve the same effect, or 155° F for 45 seconds, or 150° F for 3 minutes, etc etc.</p>
<p>So when you're cooking, take the chicken off the heat source at about 150° F <strong>and let it rest for 3 minutes</strong>, wrapped tightly in aluminum foil if possible. After resting, test the temperature again.</p>
<p>If it is still at 150° F, the chicken is safe to eat, since it has been at 150° F for three minutes. However, in all likelihood, the temperature has probably risen, because meat often keeps cooking for a while after you take it out of the oven.</p>
<p>This is all basically just to say - safe temperatures are a recommendation that is supposed to be easy to follow. The FDA isn't trying to make your meals <em>taste</em> good.</p></div>		</li>
