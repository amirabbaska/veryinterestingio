<p>You'll never get that much energy, either. In this example you can approach the surface temperature of the sun, but not exceed it. Otherwise the sky would need to be <em>brighter</em> than the surface of the sun, and in reality it's only <em>as bright as</em> the surface of the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the sky only gets as much flux as allowed by inverse square law and it undergoes scattering in all directions. But what if we placed a lens that was larger than the radius of the sun itself? It would collect not only the Ray's from the surface to us but also Ray's that never would have reached earth at all. This would certainly be able to heat up the earth at the expense of the surrounding &quot;space&quot; </p></div>		</li>
