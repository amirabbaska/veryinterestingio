			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to slightly nitpick, vapor isn't &quot;compressed into a liquid&quot; in a vapor compression system, it's compressed and then <em>cooled</em> to become liquid or two-phase. So on that point OP is actually closer to correct. Don't get me wrong this is an excellent post, just clearing up some language. </p>
<p>The compression process actually brings it further away in terms of enthalpy from the saturation point, but with a higher saturation temperature that comes with higher pressure, it's easier to cause it to condense. </p>
<p>Similarly, during expansion it may partially flash to vapor but generally it's expanded <em>and then</em> absorbs more heat, evaporating. </p></div>		</li>

The craziest part is the cost of he-3, nowadays the gas costs more than the cryostat.</p></div>		</li>

Unfortunately that link is a little short on detail, but at one point all the airport scanners homeland security was deploying were filled with He-3. Hopefully that will end soon. </p></div>		</li>
