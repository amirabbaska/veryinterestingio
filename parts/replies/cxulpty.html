			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the source! I skimmed the article, but I couldn't find anything that said the windshield comprised 60% of the structural strength of the roof...  I did see some talk about the windshield pillars, but maybe I just missed it.  Mind pointing me towards the data?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure no prob.  I linked up one of the things I read just now, and boy oh boy, did I read a lot.</p>
<p>Google this:  NHTSA safety car windshield</p>
<p>There is a crapton of info.  NHTSA is the gov safety thingy for cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, I get this, but say it takes 100 lbs of force to break a plate. Will 100 1lb ball bearings individually accomplish the task?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot depends on the material, but I'm going to say no in general.  It's important to point out if the max load is 100 lbs, that would be equivalent to carefully setting a 100 lbs ball bearing on the plate.  1 lbs @ 100 cycles would be the equivalent to carefully setting 1 lbs ball 100 times on the plate.  This is called a cyclical failure, which does happen in materials, just not linearly.  So if something falls at 100 lbs at 1 cycle it may do 99 lbs at 10 cycles and 90 lbs at 10,000 cycles.  Eventually you will hit a load where even at infinite cycles there would be no failure.  Most materials could handle a 1% load an intimate amount of times without failure.</p></div>		</li>
