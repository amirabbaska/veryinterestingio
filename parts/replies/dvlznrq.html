			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a genetic component. Some people are naturally immune to some diseases. </p>
<p>For Example:
My mom and I are both immune to small pox and this makes getting vaccinated against smallpox an issue. The small pox vaccine is a localized infection in the arm (cowpox, I believe) and we donâ€™t get the symptoms of that. It usually means receiving multiple vaccinations to verify that they did it correctly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you didn't gain that immunity from exposure to small pox. The original question is about people who have gained immunity from exposure to a disease.</p>
<p>There are plenty of cases where a trait is passed on and spread because it grants immunity to a disease, and that trait isn't always totally beneficial, but it's better than dying from the disease it protects from. For example, sickle cell anaemia protects from malaria, but causes its own set of issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the population level, The increase in frequency of genetically immune individuals is functionally similar to an individual gaining immunity via exposure. </p>
<p>The population level immunity is what would be passed onto their children. </p></div>		</li>
