<p>In theory, US states and Canadian provinces are more independent than UK countries</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Canada is more like the UK and less like the US.  The actual distinction is the source of power.</p>
<p>In the US, the state is the basic unit of government.  The state then agrees to give certian powers to the counties and municapalaties.  States, through their ratifaction of the constuition, also agree to give certian powers to the federal government.</p>
<p>So in the US you hear the term &quot;states rights&quot; or &quot;it's a state issue&quot;.  This is a short hand way of saying that whatever particular issue being discussed is not one that the states have explicitly handed over to the federal level and therefore the choice deflects to the states.</p>
<p>Wheres in Canada it's the exact opposite.  All power sits at the federal level, and the federal government explicitly grants provinces certain rights and responsibilities. So the &quot;default&quot; choice for any new law or power is the federal level, wheres in the US it's the states who are the default choice and the federal government needs to make an argument as to why the constitution grants them the ability to do X.</p>
<p>Canadian Healthcare is a good example.  The federal government collects the taxes and sets the minimum standards.  That money is then distributed to the provinces and the provinces are tasked with administrating the program and/or adding their own extra money to it. So the federal government passed a law insisting that alkl provinces set up a health care administration system that MUST comply with certian basic rules. This was accepted.</p>
<p>In the US, some states could have argued that the federal government has no right to make states do this thing because there's nothing in the constitution saying so.  The federal government would have had to make an argument as to why this was allowed and the courts would decide.  This is basically what happened during the medicaid expansion of Obamacare, and even now there are some states who have not expanded medicaid. </p>
<p>So in the US the federal government can ask states to do a thing, and it can make an argument in court that it has the right to make them, but the feds might lose.  In Canada the federal government can just make provinces do a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should (or at least is interesting to) also be noted that this interaction between the states and federal government in the US is built into the system as one of the checks against an ambitious central government.  (You obviously already know this, but it might be interesting for other readers). The founding fathers, coming from a period where an absent king was passing proclamations with no recourse from those affected in the colonies, checks and balances were a major factor in their &quot;more perfect union&quot;.  One can also see this in the three coequal branches of government (legislative, judicial, and executive), and even things like the second amendment (depending on who you ask for an interpretation... but that's a whole other hot conversation).  </p>
<p>One of the more interesting things, I think, in a country whose law-of-the-land is so focused on checks and balances, is that there are no articles for secession, should a state decide the Federal government no longer represents their interests well or has completely overstepped its bounds. The civil war was fallout from that omission, intentional though it no doubt was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some states posses articles of secession, the state I live in, New Hampshire, for example has them in our states constitution. If the states legislature votes to a 2/3rds majority, then we leave the union. I believe Texas, another state with a strong state legislature also has them in their constitution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are incorrect about Canada's distribution of power between the federal and provincial governments.</p>
<p>The Constitution sets out which areas are within the power of the federal government, and which areas are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.</p>
<p>The federal government cannot force a province to do something that is within the province's exclusive jurisdiction. </p>
<p>This is found in ss. 91, 92 and 93 of the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember there's a lot of grey area too though. Such as with the pipeline expansion fiasco we're having between BC and Alberta right now. Does BC have the right to decide how the resources are teansported through the province, how much and whether to allow it at all? Yes. However, it's also a matter of national interest, which means the federal government gets to trump BC's provincial powers. Can BC fight the feds through the courts? Of course, which is what they're doing. However, they are losing due to the federal goverment having every right to supercede BC's provincial powers (as an Albertan, thank god). All I'm driving at is that it is very situationally dependent and ultimately the federal government gets a <em>lot</em> of say in what happens at the end of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know very little about the Constitution of Canada...  But I think the difference /u/Miliean is pointing out is the 10th Amendment of the US Constitution which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which essentially says, anything not explicitly granted as a power or explicitly is granted as a power to the individual States, and the Federal Government can't just claim the right to exercise new powers,  as they belong to the States.  This seems to take it a bit further than not allowing the federal government to supercede provincial laws within their jurisdiction, giving jurisdiction to the States over anything not given to the federal government.</p>
<p>This is complicated by the &quot;Commerce Clause&quot; which can and has been interpreted to give the Federal Government the right to regulate anything having to do with commerce between the states, since just about anything can fall in this category it can give a lot of power to the federal government.  This is something that changes with the way the Supreme Court interprets it.  We are currently in a period where the application of the clause is more limited than it was in the past, but some will argue that it still encroaches on the 10th Amendment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it was however technically a confederation that bore resemblance to the North German confederation and the European Union but in a more centralized form, so you could still say they were technically different countries. However, this did not last for long as we introduced the constitution, therefore there was insufficient time to really craft distinct American nations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Articles of Confederation (first governing document post-Revolutionary War) essentially rendered each state its own nation only to work together on certain areas (commerce, for example) - somewhat similar to what the EU was modeled after in a way. The adoption of the Constitution brought in the concept of federalism where powers were designated for the states and minimal powers for a central governing body. </p>
<p>The term &quot;state&quot; is not really a coincidence, America was designed to be a united confederation of states (individual governing bodies) under one flag. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The articles of confederation did make states more independent but it was introduced for such a short time that a separate American culture for each state could not develop. Also the EU is more a supranational organization that is more complex and de centralized than a confederation. For example I believe in a confederation you need a certain degree of unity in foreign policy. The EU does not have the same cohesion. Its actors have a much higher divergence in policy. The EU is almost like a bloc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though, it's worth remembering that the dissolution of the northern irish government was literally because they were having a civil war. And the current situation is because the Executive has essentially dissolved itself.</p>
<p>Where it gets really funky of course is that after the Cash for Ash scandal, when disgraced DUP first minister Arlene Foster refused to resign, Sinn Fein were able to collapse the government to remove her. Meanwhile, after the last UK general election the DUP ended up being the powerbrokers that kept Theresa May as PM, giving Foster- who can't run her own country- massive influence nationally, and more direct influence over Scotland and Wales than their MPs. Democracy is weird sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
