<p>Field populations have to be 'weaned' onto this system to become lab colonies, initially they will only arm feed. Mosquitoes in the wild require host cues to take a blood meal, little is known about these other than carbon dioxide, heat and a volatile called octan-3-ol are attractants</p>

<p>Do you have a review on that? It sounds super interesting!</p></div>		</li>

<p>During feeding I'll also exhale into the cage, fun to watch them all fly from the sides of the cage and land right on the casing. </p>
<p>Also I published an EM image of a friggin condom, haha!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, based on the &quot; different combinations (of volatiles) on the skin&quot; making a person &quot;more or less likely to be bitten&quot;, is there truth to my grandma's assertion that eating large amounts of onions and garlic repels mosquitos?

			<div class="markdown"><p>The University of Georgia has the only black fly colony in the world. According to papers published in 1999 by the managers of the lab and another by a researcher (Alder I think) in 2002, the hardest part of keeping the lab colony going was having the flies mate in tubes instead of swarms like they do in the wild. The original colony that gave UGA the material started with 340 something females (in 1981), and using genetic testing in the 2002 paper, the authors think only 2% (8 females) of the flies successfully mated for the first ~25 generations (IIRC) where it bumped up to a higher amount. Now, most all of the flies will mate in the tubes. So they &quot;learn&quot; through a high selection pressure. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean there are people who volunteer their arms for mosquitos to feed on?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People have a very complex array of volatile chemicals on the skin, and different combinations of these make people more or less likely to be bitten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming there are volunteers, are they known to be prone to being bitten?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, people voluntarily feed. After you've fed around 400-600 females, your sensitivity to the bites dramatically decreases. (some people can go the opposite way and become hyper sensitive, so you have to be careful). Very few people in my department can arm feed due to this, I myself can't, however my boss does. To get maximal biting, the mosquitoes are starved for at least a morning (sugar water removed), in this way, the mosquitoes are more likely to bite. I would think some people would get better results than others but due to the small number of people who do this, it's hard to say. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does the sensitivity decreasing have permanent effects?</p>
<p>Honestly I'd allow myself to get bit a few hundred times in a controlled environment to have a lifetime of immunity from bite itchiness. </p>
<p>I'm always the go-to for mosquitos in the wild, even in groups of 40+ I'm usually the only one to walk away with bites. It's ridiculous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also use animals, our lab used rats that other labs were done with (rats/mice that were going to be put down anyways). We would anesthetize them first, and then put them in the mosquito cages. After the mosquitoes were done, the rats would get put down as scheduled anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a mosquito lab in the early 2000's and we used a water pump, heater, and rubber tubing to circulate warm water. A metal jar lid was glued to a portion of the tubing and a thin layer of paraffin wax was stretched across it as a membrane which held the horse blood for the females to feed on. Dry ice provided the CO2 and a nasty mix of old Limburger cheese and water provided the odor. It wasn't the most technical nor very efficient, but it worked well. These were anopheles malaria mosquitoes and they fed enough to lay plenty of eggs. It's nice to see they have dedicated machines for this now as ours took a lot of work.</p></div>		</li>
