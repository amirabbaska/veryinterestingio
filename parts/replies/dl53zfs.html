			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks very much for explaining it to me! I guess I just thought, given what the planet has been through since the beginning of time, it was a little more hardy than that, even with all the crap we're doing. </p>
<p>I never understood even how the human body can be so fragile that a couple degrees of difference in temperature in either direction could cause major problems. But I know every cloud has a silver lining and climate change could wreck one thing and make another thing flourish. We won't know until it happens. I know plant life has already begun to evolve to absorb more carbon, so would that mean that vegetation may flourish, which would result in more plants, which would result in those plants &quot;eating&quot; more of that pesky carbon? I realize it wouldn't be enough to deal with those billions upon billions of tons of carbon we make, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt (but then those same plants that are hungry for excess carbon might even die out if there was less carbon).</p>
<p>And I did wonder what to do with all that carbon. I know we make a lot of things out of it, but I don't think we'd need 36 billion tons. What would be considered a &quot;safe&quot; amount of carbon to have in the atmosphere anyway? I know we need some, but when does it go from enough to too much? Could carbon filtration systems on a larger scale be powered by solar power or wind power, which would be cleaner than our usual power sources? Or would this require more power than we could ever hope to harness, clean or not?</p>
<p>Sorry for asking so many questions. Science interests me - I'm just bad at it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So here's the thing about that, and this is something that gets lost often in the current discourse about climate change.</p>
<p>Whatever we're trying to do to prevent the course of climate change we're currently on, we're doing it to save <em>ourselves</em>, not Earth. The planet is going to be fine if the global temperature rises 2-degrees Celsius. Humanity will not be. You're probably right, too, in your assumption that some species could flourish with a warmer planet. Hell, dinosaurs lived on a planet that was hotter than ours currently is. What we're concerned about is the fact that humans will not be able to flourish on a warmer planet, and in fact it's going to make life more difficult for some and impossible for others, depending on where you live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Basically any kind of &quot;end of the world&quot; scenario you come across that doesn't end with the planet LITERALLY blowing up somehow?  It's all about screwing things up for US.  None of them mean anything whatsoever to the planet itself.</p>
<p>The planet itself is much like the universe at large - it couldn't care less about us if it tried.  Even if we went full nuclear apocalypse and wiped ourselves out completely, to the planet it's the equivalent of a slight tingle for a fraction of a second.  It's a big old ball of rock, it's spent Billions of years getting along fine without us, and it'll spend Billions more doing it after we're gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people don't understand the finer details of the implications of climate change. We're not all going to die of heat stroke. But the changing weather patterns, hotter summers can greatly affect agriculture. I think the common person really does not have a great enough appreciation for our dependence on agriculture. We just go into the grocery store, grab our food, but think very little about what made that happen. And it doesn't end at lost crops and higher food prices. Economies aren't closed systems, they're all interconnected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the dinosaurs survived on a climate that <em>slowly</em> got warmer over millions of years of very gradually warming. We've increased the global temperature by that same amount in <strong>200 years</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that more plants will grow, and eventually the carbon will be taken out of the air again.  There is evidence that this has happened in the past (the existence coal and oil reserves for instance).  But this process operates on geological timescales, like, tens of millions of years.  It definitely won't happen in a few decades.  And that's the crux of the carbon problem, humans are going and unlocking carbon that'll take the earth 30 million years to reclaim.  There is literally no chance of the earth's geological cycles responding quickly enough for us to avoid, say, sea levels rising and some densely inhabited places turning to desert.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't <em>bad</em> from the earth's point of view.  It keeps on doing its thing.  And some areas win.  Greenland's going to be a lot more temperate and livable in 50 years at the rate things are going (some of its coastal communities may suffer though).  </p>
<p>Have you seen <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/" target="_blank">this xkcd</a>?  It might answer some of your questions.</p>
<p>Regarding your power question, I don't have a good answer.  But remember that plants are basically solar power plants that remove carbon dioxide from air and turn it into biomass.  So when you talk about global scale carbon filtration from the atmosphere, that's the scale of energy usage you're talking about - the amount of energy used by every single plant on plant on planet earth.  Sure if we designed a system that didn't need to reproduce or grow roots or produce fruit or fight off pests or something, we could probably make it a lot more efficient.  Let's say we could design it 100 times more efficiently than plants.  Do you think we could reasonably harness 1% of the solar power consumed by all plants on earth?  Seems dubious to me. </p>
<p>EDIT: I realize my physics reasoning in the last paragraph is kind of screwy, but hopefully you get the thrust of my point?

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what you've already said for the carbon filtration systems people keep talking about as a potential solution. The goal would be to build a system that can simulate the process of plants converting CO2 over hundreds of thousands of years, if not millions, in a time frame of a few decades at a reasonable price. It's an astronomical engineering and economics problem that literally gets worse the more time is spent working on it. Some say we've crossed the point of no return but the biggest issue is the uncertainty behind what happens next</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants and animals, including some of the ones we like to have around or eat, are already facing climate change related issues. For example, climate change is threatening maple syrup as the southern areas where the trees used to flourish are starting to become inhospitible to that species. Yes, something else will come along to fill in that gap, but it may not be something useful or desirable to humans. </p>
<p>Another thing is that many storm systems get larger/worse and/or more frequent the more energy they have. We can already chart the increase in tropical storms, etc. </p>
<p>There have been mass extinction events before, the worst left something like 5% of the species. Could humanity survive something like that? Maybe, but we would almost certainly lose at least one thing we depend on today, and a large % of human population wouldn't make it either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give an explanation of how change a few degrees will mess up the globe, when you go far north or far south, there's a certain line onwards where the temperature is always below freezing year round, here there is a massive buildup of ice, because it snows there, but it never melts. Let's say you increase the global temperature by 1 degree Celsius, you've now shifted that line a hundred kilometers south at the south pop and vice versa(its not actually 100km but its not a small distance) this means all the ice that has been building up for millions of years just melts and goes into the ocean, and this is like a serious amount of ice, I'm talking several kilometers deep kinda ice. And that really messes up the system. </p></div>		</li>
