<p>Thankfully, it wasn't the main point of coverage, however, because that would have likely gotten people killed.  The storm was still a major threat due to storm surge and rain.  Imagine how many more people would have stayed behind in flood zones because they thought a category 1 storm would be relatively safe?</p>
<p>This &quot;the media lies&quot; or &quot;the media ignores things&quot; narrative is getting fucking old.  If you watch CNN and Fox News you get exactly what you signed up for, to be poorly informed by a 24/7 news outlet that values profit over informing their viewers.  Pick up a newspaper every once in a while, or seek out any legitimate web-source of information.  Almost all major news sources do their job extremely well.  Blaming them for the money-grubbing actions of a couple shitty outlets is both dangerous and, frankly, stupid.</p></div>		</li>
