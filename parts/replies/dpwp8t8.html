			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see how that would be important for one person traveling somewhere with a different language or accent. But I'd be interested to know how just two people with different accents change their speech when talking with each other? Like, do both people on average change towards a common similar accent that's halfway between the two? Or do some dialects &quot;pull&quot; the average more than others? I wonder if people have a <a href="http://definitionmining.com/index.php/2017/11/15/consciousness/" target="_blank">conscious</a> prediction of how they want the conversion to be based on the members of the group? Or if it's something that happens without realizing it?</p>
<p>I'd guess that since there's a question about it, that people recognize it happening and it's not unconscious, even if it might not be intentional? If that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
