			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to follow up with a question. You're allowed to ban a customer for any reason but not race or religion. But then couldn't you roughly get around the last part by re-framing it politically? Like instead of banning a race, ban anyone who supports a civil rights movement; or instead of banning homosexuals, ban anyone who supports the LGBT movement, or something of that sort. How does the distinction get drawn?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going off your example of banning homosexuals. There are plenty of hetrosexuals who support the LGBT movement. If you don't ban them too, then your ban isn't REALLY banning supporters. That is where you get in trouble. If you ban some of the supporters, and not others... then you are really just banning the homosexuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that it MAY be illegal for Twitter to do what it is doing.</p>
<p>Twitter is based in San Francisco, and in California, political affiliation IS a protected class.</p>
<p>If Twitter is exhibiting a pattern of discrimination against people based on their politics, it is probably breaking California law.</p>
<p>So you can say &quot;I'm only kicking people out when they do something offensive&quot;, but if every person you kick of for &quot;doing something offensive&quot; is black, you have committed a crime.</p></div>		</li>
