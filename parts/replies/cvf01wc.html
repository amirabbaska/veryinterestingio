			<p>I wonder this about a lot of careers. Like &quot;what does blah blah job involve on a day to day basis?&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>This is sort of why they'd be meteorologists. Someone is forecasting the weather. Sometimes, they're just reading the stuff national/regional offices come up with and that's why they're wrong so much. But some networks bother keeping a proper forecasting team on staff to try to make better predictions for a specific locality.</p>		</li>

			<p>Our meteorologists prepare all their own reports. In fact, they don't actually read off the prompter. The copy we have in the prompter is there for closed captioning purposes and is just general weather info (we get a fine if there is no CC). They mostly just make up their patter off the top of their heads and sprinkle in weather reports through the segment. </p>		</li>
