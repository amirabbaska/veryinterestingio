			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of why they'd be meteorologists. Someone is forecasting the weather. Sometimes, they're just reading the stuff national/regional offices come up with and that's why they're wrong so much. But some networks bother keeping a proper forecasting team on staff to try to make better predictions for a specific locality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that in the UK, the weatherman you see live on BBC News 24 will probably go on to record an extended forecast that will be available on the website, then will record a forecast for radio, regional radio and shipping, and probably appear on a couple of regional TV broadcasts.</p>
<p>Then back to the office to prepare the next day half's forecast (as in, the next morning/afternoon/evening) and script up the teleprompters for the next series of recordings (which they'll half use more as reminders of what's on then next slide rather than word for word readings).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and as someone else here said, chances are they work for the MetOffice rather than the BBC.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now you will quite possibly get MetService from New Zealand doing your weather for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if they are actually a meteorologist, they can prepare the reports that they then read. No need for someone to write and a separate person to read if you have one person capable of doing both.</p></div>		</li>
