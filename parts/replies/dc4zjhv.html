			<div class="markdown"><p>It's supposed to be a statewide message that alerts everyone that a kid has been abducted and may be hurt or killed by their abductor. That's why it interrupts everything and is broadcasted everywhere, it's a time sensitive alert to help save the kid before they get killed.</p>
<p>In reality amber alerts are rarely used when there's a risk of injury or death and are commonly used when parents take their own children.</p>
<p>So it was good idea 20 years ago, now it's just a boy who cried wolf warning that most people ignore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually get at least one a month. They aren't that rare, especially in large cities. Usually noncustodial parents taking kids but there's been several that he really tragic outcomes in the last few years </p>
<p>Edit: I literally just got the second one since New Years. Two boys abducted, fleeing in a equinox. </p></div>		</li>
