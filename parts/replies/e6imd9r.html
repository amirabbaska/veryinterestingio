			<div class="markdown"><p>But what About the bigger nociceptive nerves, that are used for the flexor reflexes, by your explanation those nerves would still be active and  able to send sharp lokalised Pain??

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of the dose/response curve, nerve transmission is interrupted largely in sequence of fibre diameter, smallest to largest.  As noted above, other less significant factors are in play, such as sodium channel activity, as this is the drug target.</p>
<p>In terms of nociception, you're correct in that the A Delta fibres are generally larger (~1- 6 microns, myelinated) than c fibres (~1.2 microns, unmyelinated).</p>
<p>Given that LA clinically annuls sharp pain, it therefore seems that with a therapeutic dose of say, lidocaine/lignocaine (max 3mg/kg without adrenaline, 7mg/kg with) we're sufficiently along the dose/response curve to additionally block the larger sets of fibres.  Given that movement is preserved this is evidently not sufficient to block the even larger alpha motor neurons.</p>
<p>Concentration at the sodium channel is, however, related to the immediate LA concentration, and thus  proximity of the injection site/needle tip.  With regional blocks the same drug is placed immediately next to the nerves, typically under ultrasound guidance, rather than generally infiltrated around the nociceptor endings.  In such cases the closer proximity and consequent higher concentration, typically block all transmission, even up to alpha motor neurons, thus clinically precluding movement.  This can occur even with a much lower dose.</p>
<p>Other factors are in play, however:  When I do a subarachnoid block ( e.g. for a caesarian section), pain is blocked (smaller fibres), autonomics too (b preganglionic, c postganglionic) and movement is blocked (the largest alpha fibres), however fine touch sensation may be partially intact, despite being transmitted on beta fibres, which are smaller than the alpha motor fibres.  This I can only rationalise as being due to the anatomy of the spinal cord and distribution of LA in the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid/sub arachnoid space.  Away from the cord, Peripheral nerves are much smaller, so this is less of an issue, but may become clinically relevant in a suboptimal block.</p>
<p>TLDR: more drug, closer to target = greater concentration and thus greater effect.  Anatomy can limit proximity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation, i have just been through the introduction to neuro-physiology,  but anasthetics is in Another semester, but never the Less, still Very interesting too me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, if you're up for it, could you find my comment and give an explanation to hazardous on the anaesthesiology side of things? I'm a cognitive scientist, so I can only talk about the nervous system, but I'd also love to learn. I loved reading your comments here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi erucia, sorry I had a quick look and I'm not sure: What's the question with which you'd like some help?  Are you referring to the hazards associated with local, regional, or with general anaesthesia?  Or is there a alternative specific aspect you'd like covered?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Sorry, thanks for looking. The comment was:</p>
<p>&quot;I dont feel anything in areas where i have local anesthesia, no pressure at all, and my proprioception gets messed up and my mind image of  myself just has a giant hole in the face&quot;</p>
<p>I gave a very generic neuroscience-y answer, but I don't know the anaesthesiology end of it very well. </p></div>		</li>
