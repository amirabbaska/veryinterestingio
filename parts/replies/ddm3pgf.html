			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm... Consider this. A C minor chord contains 3 intervals: a minor 3rd (C-Eb), a major 3rd(Eb-G), and a perfect 5th(C-G). And a C major chord contains these 3: a major 3rd(C-E), a minor 3rd (E-G), and a perfect 5th(C-G). Same amount of the same types of intervals. </p>
<p>So it seems to me that by definition, major and minor keys have the same amount of dissonance through the relative major/minor relationship, i.e. C minor has the same notes and intervals as Eb major. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Major - 4:5:6
Minor - 10:12:15</p>
<p>Same intervals, different order, different amount of dissonance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great link! This is exactly what I was getting at. Triads work because of their overlapping harmonics, which makes them consonant.</p>
<p>When the harmonics do not quite overlap, they sound more dissonant.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that we associate consonance with &quot;happy&quot; and dissonance with &quot;sad&quot; could be socially conditioned, but being pleased with matching and displeased with not matching just seems to me like the expected reaction to such stimuli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I do agree with you, I think the argument needs to be related to the tonic of the scale, or more so the root of the chord. In a C major chord, there is a major third relationship to the tonic, and a perfect 5th relationship also to the tonic. Both very strong, non dissonant relationships to the note which grounds/defines the chord. The minor 3rd between E and G is there, and is more dissonant than a major 3rd would be (from the E, i mean. I know if we had two major 3rds itd be an augmented 5th which is a no.)</p>
<p>Whereas, in the minor case, you have a perfect 5th again, but a minor relationship to the root of the chord. The strong major 3rd is related to the mediant, and hence doesn't give necessarily as much to the overall emotion of the chord as it does when its related to the root. </p>
<p>That's how it seems to me, anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to me. Everything in music theory is relative to key. I still think how we perceive a tonic or 'root note' may differ from culture to culture but essentially dissonance is dissonance and our ears/brains react to it in a certain way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe think of it in terms of a guitarist playing power chords. Take the thirds out of the equation. Do A and E from C Major have tendencies to lead in different directions when they become flattened in C minor? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By that logic, a major chord should sound &quot;sadder&quot; than a pure octave or perfect fifths or fourths. But that's not the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I see what you mean there. Assigning happiness to more harmony and sadness to less harmony is where it becomes subjective.</p>
<p>Your brain can easily detect the presence or absence of harmony in mixed sounds, but how you react to that could be socially conditioned and have different effects within different cultural contexts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Major keys contain natural physical harmonies with little dissonance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true in Just Intonation, with beatless perfect fifths</p>
<p>It's less true in Even Temperment, where the major third and fifth are slightly out of tune</p></div>		</li>
