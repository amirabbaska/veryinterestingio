			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not false nerve signals, they are very real, but the explanation is longer and it will require you to pay attention during my lecture next year.   </p>
<p>First, peripheral afferent (sensory) nerves have cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia (adjacent to spinal cord) and have long axons that extend to the periphery to its pseudodendrite, and in the other direction past the cell body into the spinal cord. The nerve axons have categorically different axon diameters, which are called, from small to large, C fibers, A-delta fibers, A-beta fibers, and A-alpha fibers. Whatever happened to the B fibers, you might ask? That's another, longer, story.   </p>
<p>Pressure blocks conduction in nerve fibers, but it acts selectively. The large fibers stop conducting first, and then the small fibers stop conducting. The large fibers carry signals about touch and proprioception, while the small fibers carry signals about pain.  So, when you have a pressure point on a nerve, you have a block that is selective, at some point, for touch and proprioception, while pain and temperature conduct reasonably normally.  </p>
<p>Now, we get to the spinal cord. In the cord, the touch fibers synapse on interneurons which are inhibitory and use the neurotransmitter classes of enkephalin and endorphins (endogeneous opiates). These fibers, in turn, inhibit nociceptive (pain) fibers. In a normal, non-noxious touch, the touch fibers turn off the pain fibers. Only when the nociceptive fibers carry a signal that is strong enough can you sense pain.    </p>
<p>Hey you med student in the back row - listen up. You are definitely going to see a patient at some point with persistent paresethesias - and if you don't listen right now you are going to make the wrong diagnosis and do something stupid like prescribe antidepressants.  Turn off your fantasy football league and listen up!  </p>
<p>OK, so now we understand that<br />
1) Pressure can block only large fibers which carry touch<br />
2) Touch fibers suppress pain signals  </p>
<p>The tingling feeling is the low levels of activity in nociceptive afferents that is now not blocked by the stronger touch signals. It is called paresthesia. You can map out the skin region associated with the paresthesia and get a good idea for the location of the pressure block. The most effective treatment is a mechanical relief on the pressure point, which sometimes has to be surgical. There are whole syndromes associated with these pressure points (Guyon's canal, the carpal tunnel, the 'funny bone', sciatica etc). Find the skin region with the paresthesia, and trace it to a pressure point. There is a good chance that mechanical relief at the pressure point will restore normal sensation. Not all paresthesias are caused by pressure blocks, but it is always a stronger contender for the diagnosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beautiful explanation.</p>
<p>I had a paresthesia on my outer thigh. The affected region was suspiciously definite. I could draw the outline with a ballpoint pen. I looked it up in an atlas and figured out it was my belt pressing against the place where my lateral femoral cutaneous nerve came out of my pelvis. So I loosened my belt. That was the first time science told me how to dress.</p></div>		</li>
