			<div class="markdown"><p>I know on ELI5 everyone gets super exited when somebody makes a very easily relatable analogy, but just because an analogy is simple doesn't make it particularly good (not necessarily this one is bad, just saying in general there is other criteria to consider...). I do feel like this explanation kind misses the fundamental idea that calculus is concerned with continuous change (or at least, it is buried too deep inside the analogy), and would lead someone to a superficial undersranding that calculus is more concerned with the geometry of what functions look when graphed, rather than whatever those functions actually may be saying. </p>
<p>Just felt the need to add some constructive criticism among a sea of praise. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this explanation is very good at addressing this particular part of the question. I don't think children intuit rates of change (I have tried to explain them to my ten year old to blank looks), but most kids that play with lego figure out that using large pieces results in crappy curves. The smaller the pieces they use, the more their lego can approximate a smooth curve. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a math teacher explain it to me in 5 minutes during lunch time in 9th grade some 40 years ago.</p>
<p>— What is calculus?<br />
— Well… Okay, you know what’s a line with the equation y=mx+b?<br />
— Yes.<br />
— Okay. Well, okay, when you integrate a function (draws some arbitrary line on a sheet of paper with an X-Y axis), you calculate the area below it.<br />
— That’s it?<br />
— And when you differentiate it (draws a tangent one some point on the line), you calculate the slope at a given point.
— Oh.
— You can also, for a given equation, like y=mx+b, have the formula that gives you the integral. For y=mx+b, it would be ƒ(y)=mx2/2+bx. You just find the formula in a table of integrals (pulls out such a book and opens it at the proper page).</p>
<p>There. Total time elapsed, 5 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one issue is you completely ignore like half of calculus. It misses intigrals completely an doesn't really go over a real example like going from speed yo dS to dS/T or back up. Yeah sure it's covering &quot;converge to reality&quot; which is a big step 1 but it doesn't take the second or third step so the examination just kinda ends. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Calculus breaks things down into those tiny strips to accurately measure curvey things. It works for straight things too, but kinda overkill.</p>

<p>Once during my AP calc class, one of the other students used integration to do the equivalent of 5 * 12 = 60 (integrate y = 5 from x = 0 to x = 12)... and we were like, well yeah I uh guess that works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a class in high school where you were presented with a problem and got to freely solve it however you wanted.  It was supposed to encourage problem solving and application of what you've learned in other classes.</p>
<p>One particular simple problem was to find the area of a triangle made by folding a sheet of paper a certain way (something like this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oCezMjz.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/oCezMjz.png</a>).  Being bored (and in calc at the time), I converted the paper into a graph and the folds into line functions and made it into two integrals and solved them to find the area of the triangle.</p>
<p>Was overkill, but got a funny reaction from the teacher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shows they didn't have a true understanding of the material, and could only solve a problem using cookbook style steps. </p>
<p>The equation y = 5 is a horizontal line. Integrate from zero to twelve under that line is asking for the area of a five by twelve rectangle. Someone who understands calculus recognizes that, whereas someone who doesn't understand, but can do the steps ofcalculus wastes their time coming up with the otherwise easy answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue the opposite, someone with a deep understanding of that problem would see &quot;rectangle&quot; and do a little multiplication, you only wind up doing integration if you're blindly following a series of steps and not really thinking about what's going on.</p></div>		</li>
