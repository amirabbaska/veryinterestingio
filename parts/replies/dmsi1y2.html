			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhh, it is a really common issue in Japan, so I'm not sure what to look for in terms of a study. Like asking for a reference on horses being bigger than dogs.</p>
<p>Here's a survey on it:

<p>Here's a clip about it:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Victor Mair (linguist specializing in Sinitic languages) calls it &quot;character amnesia&quot;, as the phenomenon is quite common in the Sinosphere. I did a quick search through Google Scholar for the term and turned up nothing. </p>
<p>I don't know what the academic equivalent of this would be for Japanese, but there is a Chinese expression that seems to describe it. 提笔忘字 means to forget the character even as you're trying to write it. I tried looking through GS for that and turned up a few academic citations, but the focus is educational and prescriptive (how do we reduce the phenomenon) rather than experimental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that nowadays Japanese phone and PC keyboard interfaces will automatically interpret kanji based on the phonetics that are entered. However, I think it is absolutely not true that this is causing a significant decline in the Japanese youth's ability to write kanji. </p>
<p>Japanese students still have requirements to learn kanji in their language classes, which involves lots of writing repetition, and tests involve writing kanji by hand. Students who may be affected by the digital kanji interpretation, will suffer in their grades, and given how much of Japanese society is based on academic performance (the college you get into matters even more than in America), there is plenty of incentive for students to learn how to write kanji properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally speaking, I work in Japan these days. And a lot of my co-workers (and even my Japanese teacher) tell me that they struggle with remembering kanji when writing these days. So even if kids are learning in school (and here I agree, since outside of school, how much would they have been writing anyway), they might well start forgetting a few years after graduating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To throw more anecdote on the fire, most American millennials learned how to write in cursive (at least in my area) and most people don't know how to write anything but their signature now. So just because a writing system is leaned in school doesn't mean it's retained for even 10-20 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about Chinese using the &quot;cangjie&quot; input method? It breaks down each Chinese character in a systematic way which to some extent resembles writing by hand as one has to remember how the character is written to type it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh, I mentioned cangjie in another place. I'm sure frequent users of that system are not as impacted in their handwriting. It isn't super common though (at least as far as my chinese friends go).</p></div>		</li>
