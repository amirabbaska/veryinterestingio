<p>Jupiter and the sun actually orbit a center of gravity outside the sun, so I was wondering if that had an effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the Jupiter-Sun center of mass is located just outside the Sun is actually <em>inversely</em> correlated with the amount of influence that Jupiter exerts on the Sun.</p>
<p>If you were to move Jupiter to just half its current distance from the Sun, the center of mass would move well inside the Sun...but the tidal force exerted by Jupiter on the Sun would be 8x stronger.</p></div>		</li>
