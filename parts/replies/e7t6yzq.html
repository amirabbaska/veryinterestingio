			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight nitpick that modern fluid couplings also use the return direction to help drive the vehicle too. Propellor blades pushing one way on the send, then reversed propellor blades pushing the same direction on the return. So it looks more like if a desk fan’s blades flipped halfway through. The outer edge of the blades would be blowing air, but the inner part would be sucking air in. This helps encourage that corkscrew fluid motion the video mentions.</p>
<p>Many modern fluid couplings will also have methods to “lock” once they’re up to speed, so you aren’t losing any power to the movement of the fluid - The pump blade will just be directly moving the drive blade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen a few videos of this type posted on reddit. </p>
<p>Are these the videos that the army would show soldiers to train them to be something like a mechanic back in the day? </p>
<p>Because they’re incredibly helpful and usually pretty easy to follow. Is there a database where I can find a ton of them and just watch them for fun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but modern automatics have a lock inside the coupling that eliminates part of that inefficiency while driving at higher speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but more modern fluid couplings have more efficient designs. Rather than a corkscrew motion, they’re designed to give the whole thing more of a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/1vt6hfGwloctW/giphy.gif" target="_blank">convection current</a> movement. The idea being that power gets transmitted on both the fluid getting sent <em>and</em> on the return.</p>
<p>They’re also designed to lock once they’re up to speed, so they’re only really using the fluid on acceleration and when the gears shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During a launch event it’s actually a little bit of an advantage… Look up torque multiplication. </p>
<p>But you are right, it is less efficient at cruising speed. But as another poster mentioned, a clutch locks the fluid coupling so there’s no speed difference between the input and the output.</p></div>		</li>
