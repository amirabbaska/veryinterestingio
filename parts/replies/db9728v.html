			<div class="markdown"><p>I can represent pi exactly by writing &quot;the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter&quot;, it's less useful in terms of calculating but more useful when trying to prove something about the number. I could also say pi=2*arcsin(1), that is exact as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A History of Pi is a great book. Very fun and easy to read while it teaches the beginnings of mathematics. Theres always historical context given that makes you see theres a very real, practical application for something as &quot;abstract&quot; as pi. </p></div>		</li>
