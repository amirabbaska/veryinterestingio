<p>In case anyone questions me, gonna be honest, I use an iso salt mix for cleaning my bong and I'd rather use 100% iso than the 70% I have access too, works faster and with less effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be pretty much instantaneous.</p>
<p>The trick here is to saturate the water layer, so as long as the salt you add is still dissolving just keep adding more (and make sure to keep stirring or shaking the container). Any extra salt you add will just lay on the bottom of the container and then you can pour off the top layer of near 100% isopropanol. Pour it slowly and just leave the last bit so you don't pour over water by accident.</p>
<p>And of course remember that the more water you take out the faster it will evaporate so it becomes increasingly important to store it in a closed container. And remember to keep it away from heat and wash your hands after using it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, don't use it in an unventilated room and keep it out of your eyes.</p></div>		</li>
