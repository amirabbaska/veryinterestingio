			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS. Also when people shout play me this song! You can't stop everything and just play it, songs have Beats Per Minute so you want to generally wait for a song you have to match that, then you can fade into it or whatever.</p>
<p>Like many professions...your DJ already did his work, he is basically there to crowd control. Make sure the crowd likes his mix, then to adjust it as time goes on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  In order to not sound like a jerk, what I tell someone when they make a request at a bar or club is if I have the song, I will try to &quot;work it into the mix&quot;.  That way they understand that there's a process to what the DJ is doing, and whether or not you preface the request with &quot;it's my friend's birthday&quot;... it's not a birthday party.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a DJ, you're dead on. It's always someone's birthday. Then their friend wants to say something about it on the mic. Never allow anyone who's not the promoter to use the mic. You'll have a line of people looking to lay down some rhymes, even if you're playing stuff that's not the least bit MC friendly. </p></div>		</li>
