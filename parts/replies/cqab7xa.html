			<p>I agree 100%; I just hope we don't ever lose the mentality to experiment for ourselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>It will be a good idea to put the ice blocks in ziplock bags first... Although this will somewhat confound the result, nobody likes wet blanket at the end of the day.<br><br>Also, ice in blanket might melt first due to heat transfer from the blanket itself in this case. For this experiment to work, the ice &quot;cube&quot; might need to be big enough to make that factor negligible.</p>		</li>

			<p>Don't forget to repeat the experiment ay least 3 times to confirm your results. <br><br>This is the best excuse I've ever heard for drinking 6 beers and eating 6 icecreams in one sitting. </p>		</li>
