			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it can!  Your blood has to be a certain pH (in a range around 7.4), too, much more importantly than your stomach. H2CO3 helps maintain that (it’s a good buffer), but you have systems that recognizes too much acidity in the blood, mostly in the lungs and the kidneys- the lungs react by trying to expel more CO2, basically, and the kidneys by filtering out the H2CO3. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why we're alive, if your pH goes up, your body detect it and tries to get it down, if your blood pressure gets too elevated, your body will try to make you piss more in order to evacuate the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This all assumes everything is working correctly. Some people (like myself) have GERD (acid reflux), where the spincter above the stomach should close when we're not eating but doesn't. That can allow stomach acid to creep up into the esophagus which is painful and not good.</p>
<p>Antacids will help treat that symptom, though not the root cause, by neutralizing stomach acid.</p></div>		</li>
