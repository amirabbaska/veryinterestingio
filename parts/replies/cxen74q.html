			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally yes, but Camilla is a divisive figure since some blame her affair with Charles as contributing to Dianas death. </p>
<p>Prior to Charles and Camillas wedding there was controversy and speculation about the Queen Consort title, as a result the palace announced she would be styled Princess Consort instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a stretch. People may feel their affair led to Charles' and Diana's divorce, but I don't think anyone (sane) holds them responsible for her death. I guess if they were still together, then she wouldn't have been in Paris, but you know, shit happens. Camilla actually carries herself pretty well, I'd say her 'approval rating' has gone up considerably.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hope that's not gonna happen. The whole country is making fun of him &quot;waiting for his mother to die&quot;, Camilla is disliked and William is beloved by basically the whole country, along with Kate and the little'uns. Charles has basically outlived his usefulness, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Charles and Camilla were married in a register office at the Windsor Guildhall on April 9, 2005, but it's far from clear that that marriage was lawful. Civil marriages were introduced in England by the Marriage Act of 1836 but in section 45 it says that the Act &quot;shall not extend to the marriage of any of the Royal Family&quot;. This was a factor in Princess Margaret's decision not to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend in 1955. Because Townsend was divorced, a church wedding was out of the question and a civil ceremony was their only option. The view of the then Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, was that Parliament would only regard such a marriage as lawful if the Princess renounced her right of succession.</p>

<p>Edit: This is also the reason than Queen Liz's Uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII_abdication_crisis" target="_blank">abdicated</a> in favour of his brother (her father), he wanted to marry a divorced American lady called Wallis Simpson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a first marriage of a hitherto childless monarch or heir-apparent there is a potential difficulty with them acquiring step-children who would be older than any blood-children yet to be born, because those step-children would secure a position of dominance and disproportionate influence - putting the blood-line in jeopardy. Also, the divorcee's ex-partner may still hold strong influence, creating a conflict of interests there too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was created so that the King could annul his marriage and remarry. Semantics, but Henry the VIII never divorced anyone. He deliberately widowed himself a few times by executing his wives, though. That's okay, you know, because they were treasonous whoors.</p></div>		</li>
