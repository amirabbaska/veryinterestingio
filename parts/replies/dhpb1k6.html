			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly . Most people view these items as if they were made with today's context. Most of the world back then was illiterate and no books to read either. If the king left a gap for religion to make a rule they did.  Cultural trappings and social engineering.</p>
<p>I view all religious text through the lens of the pork/Jewish rules.  Why pork ? Because it's basically the only food source animal that can kill you if cooked improperly. Fear of Gods wrath is easier to keep people safe and in control. Every religion has something banned / controlled that can be traced back to some king or priest that just wanted their way ... so do I still get Prima Noctum ? </p></div>		</li>
