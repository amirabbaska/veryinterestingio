			<div class="markdown"><p>levo-methamphetamine is used as a cough suppressant, dextro-methamphetamine is the one that provides the stimulant effects in both street meth and prescription use.  While there are some recipes of cooking meth on the street that make a racemic mixture of dextro- and levo- methamphetamine, its most commonly made to be pure dextro.</p>
<p>Fun fact, in Breaking Bad they commonly use a process that requires methylamine, which wouldn't be specific to the dextro- enantiomer and thus less desirable than the more common pseudoephedrine process.  This fact is briefly called out in one scene when Walter is trying to prove his necessity, rhetorically asks the question &quot;if my recipe isn't stereospecific then why is the product enantimoerically pure&quot;.  The show never actually gives an answer.</p>
<p>Anyway, levo-methamphetamine would just dilute it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want be clear about what you’re saying. Methlamine is not specific to dextro and would lead to mixes of levo and dextro, but Walter specifically calls out that his process is stereospecific which I’m assuming uses only the dextro and discards the levo, leading to a product which is enantimoerically pure, which I am again assuming means it contains only the desired dextro?</p>
<p>In other words they address that methlamine would be a poor choice for a precursor but Walter is skilled enough to work around that anyway? Man there must have been some chemistry buffs with hard-ons after that scene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Organic chemist here! Methylamine is not really the part that matters, it is the reducing agent that is used. I believe he uses aluminium and sodium hydroxide and maybe a noble metal catalyst? There are methods to do this stereospecifically that use this procedures on ton scale. </p>
<p>Also, he could crystallise the material with a chiral auxiliary to induce crystallisation of just a single enantiomer. Plenty of methods. </p>
<p>This is all open material and can be found online without too much effort, I'm not spilling unknown secrets to general public. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention intake method is usually different.</p>
<p>Medical/theraputic uses are most often taken orally, which have a lower bioavailability (remember, lower bioavailability means it is less efficient at being absorbed) than more recreational ways of intake, such as insufflation, <del>combustion</del> vaporization, and intravenous (intravenous being the highest).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to remember is that a lot of the side-effects associated with Meth (&quot;Meth mouth&quot;, etc.) aren't caused by the drug itself, but by the lifestyle of being high all the time and not taking care of yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure release of the medication vs. recreational use is very different too.</p>
<p>I'm not sure <em>exactly</em> how the instant release compares to street use, but long release is even less like street use. </p>
<p>Most people that have issues tend to take a whole lot at once, long release medication prevents you from doing just that. It regulates the amount in your system as to just a small x amount per hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Standard prescriptions of Desoxyn are 5 mg. Not sure how high it can go. I’d wager 15-20mg max since Adderall is rarely prescribed over 60mgs. That’s usually the cap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, it refers to the minimum amount of something that gives you the maximum amount of benefit. So in the case of Meth/Adderall the maximum therapeutic doze is 60 mg / 24 hours. If your taking more than that you will damage your body more than you are benefiting from the medicine. In this case the benefit would be to curve the symptoms of ADD and the damages of prolonged Meth abuse are well documented. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heroin, meth, cocaine, and virtually every other drug have all been, and are still being, used as medications.  It's why most of them exist (as refined/processed drugs) in the first place.</p>
<p>Heroin was originally an accident in an attempt to make codeine by Bayer. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wright's invention did not lead to any further developments, and diamorphine became popular only after it was independently re-synthesized 23 years later by another chemist, Felix Hoffmann.[67] Hoffmann, working at Bayer pharmaceutical company in Elberfeld, Germany, was instructed by his supervisor Heinrich Dreser to acetylate morphine with the objective of producing codeine, a constituent of the opium poppy, pharmacologically similar to morphine but less potent and less addictive. Instead, the experiment produced an acetylated form of morphine one and a half to two times more potent than morphine itself. The head of Bayer's research department reputedly coined the drug's new name, &quot;heroin,&quot; based on the German heroisch, which means &quot;heroic, strong&quot; (from the ancient Greek word &quot;heros, ήρως&quot;). Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but their scientists discovered ways to make it, and Bayer led commercialization of heroin.[68]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amphetamines (and a brand name of meth called Pervitin) were used by the Nazis as stimulants/perfomance enhancers, but fell out of favor due to the side effects.</p>
<p>Basically, most drugs are either naturally occurring, or were made in a lab by drug companies.</p>
