<ul>
<li>The product were packaged at different plants that use separate sleeve suppliers.</li>
<li>The sleeve design/material was changed between the introduction of the first product and the second. The cost of retrofitting the packaging machines of the first production line to use the second sleeves was not worth the gains.</li>
<li>The ham&amp;cheese sleeve is more expensive, and was only deemed necessary for that product, while they felt they could get away with a cheaper one for pizza.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am willing to believe the different factory explanation. It would make sense that the sleeves are machine specific, and machines cannot be updated to use the different sleeves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone verify? That wouldn't make sense, because the pizza sleeve is obviously inferior as it only breaks down once while you eat it, instead of getting really short as you finish the burning hot pocket.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I buy offbrand Hot Pockets so I'm not of much more help. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in packaging design on crisping sleeves like these. What would happen is that for every product line they would have a design for boxes and sleeves. If whatever layout for the sleeve worked and the thickness of the paper was ok and met the price point they wanted, they would go with that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm based on my own experience that the cooking sleeves were originally just a tube, then they became the ones that you could fold in on the bottom to make a little holder with the single removable perforated bit.</p>
<p>I haven't seen the multi-stage one you're describing, but I also can't remember the last time I ate a hot pocket.  It seems like a logical progression, though.</p></div>		</li>
