			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of overabundant fluids, I have a math question: assuming you could burn semen and extract its potential energy as efficiently as gasoline, how many ejaculations would I need to drive my Toyota Corolla 100 miles?  </p>
<p>Edit: the authorities have informed me I cannot obtain fuel from the local high school.  I retract my question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calories in liquid food are measured by baking (dehydrating) and then burning the resulting powder.  Find an accurate Caloric content for your baby batter.  Gasoline has 31000 Calories per gallon, you probably need three gallons of that to do 100 miles.  So, find what volume of spunk contains 93000 Calories and divide that by the volume of your typical ejaculation. </p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/nutritional-value-serving-semen" target="_blank">According to this rigorous Colombia University study</a> there are 5-7 calories per ejaculation. </p>
<p>93,000 calories / 5 calories / ejaculation = 18,600 ejaculation sessions for 100 miles.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, if you spanked it every day you would need 51 years to get enough. 17 years if you went 3 times a day, but probably closer to 20 years due to losses in volume from the 2nd and 3rd daily low-five.</p>
<p>Another fun fact: the average man produces about a teaspoon of baby gravy per session. The amount required to go 100 miles is about 97 litres, or just under 2 beer kegs.</p>
<p>Also: To get the same amount of energy from gasoline, you would need 8x the volume in pole milk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For this to be reliable, you'd need to rig up a collection system to your ass, and somehow pressurize your farts into a container for storage, and then rig that up to your car when you want to drive.  This is why liquids are better fuel sources than gas, higher energy density and easier to contain, transport, and transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have nothing better to do with my life at this moment so I did a quick GIS for calories of semen per teaspoon(7) and teaspoons per gallon (768).  Using the 93000 calories from baldjugglingogre's post...</p>
<p>5376 cal/gal</p>
<p>93000 calories / 5376 cal/gal = 17.3 gallons.</p>
<p>768 teaspoons/gal * 17.3 gal  = 13,286.4 teaspoons</p>
<p>So assuming each ejaculation is 1 teaspoon... there you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's a question of energy economics. In short, it takes LESS energy to pump, refine, move and eventually sell a gallon of gas to the end customer than a gallon of gas will put out. That's why hydrogen will <em>never</em> be a viable solution to get away from fossil fuels. It's not a fuel, because procuring and using it is a net energy <em>loss</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you not read what I posted, or did you just latch onto the word &quot;economics&quot; and assume I was talking about money? </p>
<p>A fuel is a ready reserve or <em>supply</em> of energy. The amount of energy it takes to produce hydrogen completely overwhelms the amount of energy that we can harvest from it. In other words, hydrogen is <em>not a fuel</em>. Where you get your seed energy from is irrelevant. Using nuclear to produce hydrogen still requires using more energy than you will get out of the hydrogen. Hydrogen &quot;fuel&quot; takes more than it gives, unlike fossil fuel. It's a prime example of what it means when we say something is not sustainable. </p></div>		</li>
