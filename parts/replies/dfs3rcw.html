			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who do not know what CFC and HCFCs are, they are normally used as refrigetants, Chlorofluorocarbon and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Production of reactive refrigerants such as R12 and R22 is set to end fairly soon, and has decreased every year due to EPA regulation. What is still used is HFCs like R134a (no Cl) and we have stricter limits on what you can release to the atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many local governments have placed restrictions on the type of people who can recycle the systems that contain these chemicals. This has greatly reduced the number of air conditioners being stolen which greatly reduces the amount of chemicals being released by criminals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only stolen, just scrapping in general. A little a/c has a fair bit of precious metals in it, if a scrapper sees 10-30$ sitting there they aren't going to pass it up because of the environment, someone else is just going to <em>pop</em> it anyway.   </p>
<p>Shamefully I've done it myself in the past, even with some old r-12 systems, and there were multiple a/c units a day being scrapped. I hope my city cracked down on it since I've been there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under the Montreal Protocol, the manufacturing of R12 was banned in developed countries in 2005, and in the developing world in 2010. The phaseout of R-22 is ongoing. The EU has completely banned it, and the USA is in the process of phasing it out. At this time, in the USA, it can only be used to service existing equipment that depends on it. Furthermore, it will soon only be possible to use recycled R-22.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And why CFC/HCFCs are so bad for the ozone is because the reaction they have with O3 (ozone) is non-deletive for the damaging part of the CFC, it can continue to cause O3 damage on and on and on without being used up.</p>
<p>Basically the CCl^2 Fl^2 is broken up by UV radiation to become  C Cl F^2  + Cl radical.</p>
<p>The Cl radical then bonds with O^3 to create ClO + 2O^2.  The ClO then bonds with more O^3 to make Cl + 2O^2.  This leaves the Cl to then repeat the process as a catalyst, until it finally bonds with something other than O^3 and becomes stable.</p>
<p>So one single CFC molecule can just stay in the Ozone layer and destroy ozone for years and years and years as free radical Cl.  This is why its so so dangerous on a mass produced level.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>R717 (ammonia [nh3]) is one of oldest and one the the most environmentally friendly refrigerants. It dose have its have its hazards being toxic and flammable under the right conditions. But if released in to the atmosphere it will start to break down into its base elements nitrogen and hydrogen relatively quick.</p>
<p>Nothing realy to do with the question. I just prefer R717 to any holocarbon refrigerant for 3 reasons</p>
<ol>
<li>Its environmentally friendly compared to CFCs and HCFCs</li>
<li>It has the most refrigeration factor per pound then any other refrigerants.</li>
<li>You can smell it when it leaks which makes it easier to find. Others such as R22 can displace all the oxygen in a confined space and you can walk right into a death trap with out ever knowing (unless carrying a gas sensor).</li>

<p>Except if you work on large industrial plants a refrigerant leak of ammonia is immediately dangerous and you cant just &quot;smell&quot; it. Suspected leaks must be found whilst wearing full breathing apparatus. Also mixture with oil or water can increase toxicity and flammability. Oil in refrigerant is common in all refrigerantion systems used in commercial applications.</p></div>		</li>
