<p>At large scales it doesn't matter where the mass is, it can be smeared across the &quot;surface&quot; of the event horizon, or it can be a &quot;singularity&quot;.  The mass is still there.</p>

<p>I'm not sure, these are only theorized currently, but the effect would still exist just at a much smaller scale.</p></div>		</li>
