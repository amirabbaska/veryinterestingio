			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello fellow satellite coug, I'm a grad student from WSU-TC I was an intern for the hydrology group at PNNL for a year, the best thing you can do is networking. I don't know what program you're in, but sit down and talk to your professors, talk about what you want to do and they might be able to point you in the right direction. There's also the career fair we do every year.</p></div>		</li>
