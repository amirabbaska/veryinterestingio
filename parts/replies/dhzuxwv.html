<p>They only like their cheeseburgers plain with no toppings, like they did when they were a kid. They get the same meals at the same restaurants. Their home cooked meals have to be exactly the same everytime or they are 'gross'. </p>
<p>I've always been amazed by this. I mean, how do you know what your favorite food is unless you've tried them all? But your logic here suggesting that their experience is so limited that they don't realize there are other great things out there, or that their tastes may have changed since they were a kid, so they only eat the foods they ate as a kid.. well that rings true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently figured out that if I'm here for another 40 years, I'll only have time to listen to another 3,000 albums. Not that many really. So I now try and listen only to albums I haven't heard. Same goes for the movies I watch and books I read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be sobering when you calculate the amount of theoretical leisure hours you have as an adult, versus a child or a retiree.</p>
<p>8800 hours a year sounds huge, but chop it down with duties and &quot;must do to live&quot; activities (sleep alone knocks out a third for &quot;normal&quot; people) and the resulting number looks pitiful.</p></div>		</li>
