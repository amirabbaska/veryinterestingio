			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for sharing the second video. The first one was so sad. I'd like to have heard more about what she did in recovery in the second video, versus just everything's great. Recovery is really hard work and she has a lot to celebrate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i mean aside from sudden death due to running out of heartbeats or breaths, the other damage is cumulative.   So just like smoking three cigarettes probably won't cause cancer, huffing a few times probably won't cause you to need adult diapers in your thirties.</p>
<p>That said, it's a really bad idea to start because it's always easier to do something you've done before,  and because it fucks up your mind, one of the first things you lose is your ability to tell that you're losing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That last paragraph!!! So necessary to remember for any kind of drug. Moderate use of almost anything is fine but it is a slippery slope... It's easy to make excuses for yourself when you don't realize the impacts of what you're doing until it's too late </p></div>		</li>
