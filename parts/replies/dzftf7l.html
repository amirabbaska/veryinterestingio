<p>That relative position changes depending on whether the planet was moving towards us or away as we orbit more quickly and &quot;pass&quot; its position in the sky.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, it was quite accurate for having no real accurate instruments for time or to make precise measurement of the exact location of the moon in its orbit. </p>
<p>Being within 30% is extremely impressive for their limited technology. </p></div>		</li>
