			<div class="markdown"><p>A little less often than most.  I buy 5.11 Tactical pants which hold up very well in physical activity, so I get a good 3 years out of a pair of pants.  After that, they all develop a small hole in the crotch just left of the seam.</p>
<p>I buy 6 new pairs at a time, and make sure to always have 6-12 pairs with no hole for wearing to work.  Then I'll keep the holes pairs in stock for use when working the yard/hiking/etc.  </p>
<p>I won't throw away until a pair gives up and completely blows out the crotch on me, which takes quite a while.  This I own a lot of pants.</p></div>		</li>
