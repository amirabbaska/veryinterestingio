			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if flies use their forelimbs for anything else? Do they even manipulate food with them?</p>
<p>I would guess from observation that they use to them to walk and for cleaning. Maybe also to grab on during mating.</p>
<p>One thing about most insects is very, very little ability to do something they are not programmed to do. I was struck by the tarantula hawk's behavior -- it drags a paralyzed spider by one of its legs to the hole it will stick it in; if that leg is removed, the wasp will not use a different leg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insects are the closest biological thing we have to computers, they just follow their basic programming. Reminds me of a gif I saw a while ago of <a href="http://m.imgur.com/FmLJZz6?r" target="_blank">a bug rolling a piece of trash around with its legs on its back</a>. It thinks it’s walking because its feet are touching something. I’m not a programmer but that just seems like a simple if() statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However: Bees, ants and wasps, perhaps not coincidentally related, do seem to be able to learn. The bee thing is quite striking, a new task where they either pull a string to get a reward or put an object in a receptacle to do so and not only can they learn but bees watching other bees seem to learn by observation. I think that this is a big surprise given brain size (and bees don't have brains like vertebrates do) but also not totally surprising and in fact maybe 100 years ago some scientists believed insects and animals in general were able to learn/reason perhaps some of it being over optimistic views.</p>
<p>The bee thing makes me more optimistic myself about some anecdotal evidence of tarantula intelligence, owners of pets reporting that tarantula unscrewed jars and even sorted sand by color (!) but not sure if this has been documented. However, I saw what sure looked like a tarantula opening the top of its enclosure by shoving on the opposite side to create an opening -- very amazing.</p>
<p>Tarantula live decades and this at least gives value to having the ability to learn from experience whereas very short-lived animals need to &quot;know&quot; everything instinctively.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's fascinating.  Which leg is it?  And will it not even use the opposing leg?</p></div>		</li>
