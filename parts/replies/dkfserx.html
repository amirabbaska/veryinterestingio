			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you can find enough info in the Wikipedia, it really is interesting, I had to study bamboo for a project I did last year, very cool. It is not the same for all species but when you see a bamboo forest all the plants are genetically the same, in fact they are all connected by the roots. When they flower they flower all at the same time, in some cases even if they are in different continents as the previous commenter said. The reason is not completely known, there are different hypothesis. After they flower the plants die and new bamboo grows from the seeds. Period between flowering varies among species and, although rare, it con go up to ~100 years. Sorry for not providing sources but Im writing from my phone, also I'm am engineer, not a biologists, so probably not 100% accurate. Bamboo is really cool and has a lot of potential in architecture, great mechanical properties.</p></div>		</li>
