			<div class="markdown"><p>Back sometime around 6th grade, when I learned about the area of a parallelogram is that of base x height, and not base x length, I fought to grasp the idea visually, for I would visualize a parallelogram's sides merely straightening out into a rectangle. Then, for some reason I decided to slice it into pieces and shove them over, similar to how what you have demonstrated with the Cavalieri's principle and suddenly it clicked. Thanks to your comment, after 20+ years have I come to find out the name of this technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're so welcome! Honestly, I thought people would dismiss my answer outright since I didn't <em>really</em> explain anything and just linked to Wikipedia. However, that article explained he question better than I could have. My geometry is quite rusty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading one of the criticisms of cavalierris principle was since there was an infinite number of horrizontal lines, then you could also have an infinite number of vertical lines that matched the diagonal, but if you do this then his principal doesn't hold up. (Calculus solves this issue of lines not having 'Width' by using very narrow rectangles. )</p>
<p>However I'm not able to find a diagram that illustrates the flaw the flaw very well. Do you happen to know what it's called or how to draw it. I'm a bit rusty but found it intriguing </p></div>		</li>
