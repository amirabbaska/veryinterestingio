<p>The whole idea of &quot;the self&quot; as a singular, finite and bounded entity is flat-out wrong.</p>

<p>Well hold on a minute here... </p>
<p>There is no naturalistic boundary between what I normally conceptualize as 'me' and what I conceptualize as 'others'-- I am a collection of atoms working together as a system, there are more interactions within this system than there are between this system and things outside of this system, however this is a difference of degrees, rather than absolutes. Such a conceptualization indeed warrants a fuzzy boundary of self. </p>
<p>However my perspective is discrete and bounded. I am aware of my subjective perspective, you are aware of your subjective perspective, and we are not mutually aware of each others' subjective experiences, despite there being interactions between us. The same applies to any two people. We may share information about the world, but the subjective perspectives we each possess are singular, individualized, and discrete (Unless you're a philosophical zombie, in which case you have none), rather than gradient. If my subjective experience was wholly derivative of interactions in the above sense, I would not have a bounded subjectivity-- my sense of subjectivity would be isomorphic with the interactions which comprise it, and it would be gradient. </p>
<p>I hear that when one is on psychedelics, while one does indeed experience ego death and loss of an individual sense of self, one does not share subjective experiences with others and ones perspective too stays discrete and singular. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your thoughts, I think we are almost on the same level, except I definitely do believe that our subjective experience is gradient. As a matter of fact, stating that subjective experience is NON-gradient is akin to the hard problem. Our subjective experience is the result of the underlying biopsychological processes that work together to create a coherent experience.</p>
<p>It is perfectly logical from an evolutionary perspective that the more coherent this experience is, the higher the chance of our survival. This is why we have a model of our self at the base of this subjective experience. This, model can, however, be altered in various ways. When we grow up and age, it changes. When we use certain drugs, it changes temporarily. </p>
<p>What I'm getting at here, is that the sense of self, of you being 'you' is subjective and subject to change. This sense of self can even vanish under the influence of substances like dissociatives or psychedelics. It is possible to lose your sense of self, while still being conscious- which is, of course a gradient phenomenon as well: you can have slight ego-dimming to full-blown ego death. When you are in the latter state: you still perceive, but it is no longer tied to your construed persona, there is just an 'it'  observing that is no longer a 'you'. Without a sense of self, everything feels objective, instead of subjective. There is no longer a 'you' separate from the external world, the boundaries between the external and internal have blurred to an extent that the duality is no longer there: everything is one, everything is interconnected. </p>
<p>Subjective experience is, in any case, not bounded, but fuzzy as well. I agree, however, that it is bounded from person to person. There is no way someone's subjective experience  can transfer to someone else  through some cosmic connection, that is never what I meant. </p>
<p>I can elaborate more but I'm afraid it would get too philosophical for an ELI5.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, however the individual perspective is not. Not the quality of the experience, the fact of the experience. </p>

<p>Sure, I agree with what you're saying, except that this isn't what I mean by subjective experience. I'm not talking about the quality of the experience, or the details of the experience, I'm talking about the fact of the experience. It does not, at any point, become shared with another person (another 'point' of perspective) nor does another person's subjective experience become yours. It is still your individual perspective, despite you not having a coherently meaningful sense of self during an ego death experience (at least that's what they say). In this sense it is absolutely non-gradient. </p>

<p>This is the cool thing about it right? If it's bounded from person to person, we still have duality. Since, again, there is no naturalistic absolute objective physical barrier between people, only differences of degrees of interactions, yet if there are two people, there are two subjective perspectives, two points, two completely independent facts of subjectivity. </p>
<p>I agree with what you're saying about evolution, and I view that as classifiable as one of the 'easier' problems, which have in common the specifics of the subjective experience, but not it's fact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin is just a specific arrangement of carbon and other atoms. When you get into how you actually define the boundary, it ends up being really hard to define. </p>
<p>There's a great math documentary called &quot;How Long Is A Piece of String&quot; that while not directly related, shows how hard it is to define boundaries. They really are essentially psychological. </p>

<p>Could you clarify what you mean with that? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok let's reverse the situation: given that your body is just a collection of molecules in an even larger collection of molecules (the universe), what ground is there to create a distinction between these two? The fact that you're contained in skin? </p>
<p>Any answer that you give to this question is inherently based on bringing to life some concept like 'skin', which does not hold any real truth value. It is just a model we use, an imperfect representation of reality. The reality being, that everything is just a bunch of molecules interconnected. </p>
<p>When looking at the universe like this there is no 'you' vs. An external world. Everything is interconnected molecules. The concept of 'you' is just a super intricate biopsychological model. Psychedelics deconstruct this model, resulting in epiphanies like 'everything is intrrconnected' or 'I am one with the universe'. While there is arguably a lot of truth to it, it is at the same time quite meaningless.  </p></div>		</li>
