			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly believe that life begins at conception. Because if that I'm against deriving stem cells from babies that were killed. We did donate cord blood and whatever else they wanted to take when our kids were born. Stem cells do represent a way forward scientifically, but profiting from abortion really rubs me the wrong way.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the sticky part of the issue is not when &quot;life&quot; begins, because simply being alive isn't an issue in lots of other situations. We don't care that much (as a society) that cows are alive. Or insects. Or bacteria.  We don't even care if something is alive and has human DNA (tumors, warts, moles, etc. fit those criteria).</p>
<p>I think the relevant distinction is that something has a consciousness. Babies clearly do. Zygotes clearly don't. But where do you draw the line? That's a question that is very hard to answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you considered that the &quot;excess&quot; (unused) fertilized embryos are otherwise going to be killed anyway?</p>
<p>I never could understand how some people are so concerned about the use of the excess fertilized embryos for stem cells (to save lives potentially) but are completely unconcerned that if the embryos aren't being used for stem cells then they are simply destroyed. Why no big protest? Why no movement to adopt the embryos (voluntarily implant them in volunteer women's' uteri)? Seems strange to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are groups of Christians that are strongly opposed to IVF in general, not just for research but for procreation.</p>
<p>There's two main reasons behind this that I'm aware of.  The first is about when life begins and what it means to kill.  Some people feel that life is sacred and special and is a sort of divine spark.  That you kind of get assigned a soul at the moment that a sperm and egg get together, and if you do anything to that, you are killing and that's wrong.  In IVF the selection process means that some embryos are going to be started but discarded, and that alone is enough to make people morally against it.</p>
<p>The second is the argument on natural law.  Essentially that life is a special thing that God gets to create when people have sex, and the reason we have sex is so that God can work to create new life.  Anything that interferes with God from creating new life during that act, such as a condom or hormonal controls, is bad.  Similarly, anything that tries to create life without the sex part of it is also bad.  If you are infertile, too bad, that's God's decision to not create children, and it's contrary to God's will to try in any way other than more sex.   Similarly, abortion is the same thing, God has the ability to create a pregnancy during sex, and in the same way has the ability to not do so.  For people who think this way, a pregnancy is God's will, and it doesn't matter if that pregnancy was accidental, through rape or incest, threatening the mother's life, or unsupportable, if God didn't want it to happen, he wouldn't have made her pregnant.  They believe the life starts when God decides for it to do so, and to kill that life is to go contrary to God's will.  If the mother might die, they feel this is an acceptable risk because that was God's decision and not man's. This is the basis behind the attitude that can be confusing to some people when they see people who are opposed to abortion but are also opposed to birth control. </p>
<p>Between those two points there's strong opposition to ES cell research for mostly metaphysical reasons.  Moral arguments that don't rely on a specific definition of life, humanity, divine will, or a divine soul are pretty few and far between. </p>
<p>You'll get arguments about &quot;playing God&quot;.  There's also a fear that studying and modifying how humans grow will lead to some kind of eugenics program, but I think the larger concern is generally religious in nature, or at least philisophical. </p></div>		</li>
