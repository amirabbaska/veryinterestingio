			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good explanations there.</p>
<p>There is just one part I think is misleading a bit, which is regarding the Global Financial Crisis you spoke of: While I understand how you reached to that statement, there is obviously a lot more to it, and China actually has very little to do with it, mainly because it was American banks lending out money to people thinking it was a good idea to invest into real estate without actually knowing their worth. People don't want to mention this because it would mean the crisis was caused by unethical business practices, but what's more is the people's greed and mindset of basically trying to one-up another. It was caused by nobody else but by people not knowing what they were doing and borrowed money like crazy that they couldn't pay back. With that being said, while China played a role in the buildup, it really isn't their fault in the slightest, and the way you put it kind of makes it seem it is, not sure if that was your intention. Now, I am sure China could have done something to not make it so bad, but I don't think it's their responsibility as they aren't babysitters telling you what you should and shouldn't do with your money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I also thought the China part was a pretty steep angle. There's plenty of blame to go around, but I think only the US banks had the knowledge, power, and sensitivity to the consequences to have not acted the way they did. China lacked the sensitivity, home-owners lacked the knowledge and power, and investors like pension funds were lied to so they certainly lacked the knowledge as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most microeconomics textbooks are 2 chapters explaining how great markets are, followed by 28 chapters discussing when and why they fail to produce an efficient outcome and governments MIGHT do better to intervene.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish this were true, but my micro-econ text devoted the last 28 chapters to exclusively explaining why government interventions create &quot;market distortions&quot; that oppress firms in the market. We even had two out-of-class online excercises that involved acting as simulated firms against other students to compete based entirely off our costs. Every student would (somehow) make a profit during the unregulated portion of each excercise, then they'd experience a &quot;price ceiling/floor&quot; effect imposed by the Government which would price-out a bunch of students who would then rage in the chat.</p>
<p>It was such bullshit. Everytime I see someone say something like &quot;China devalues its currency&quot; or &quot;it's just supply and demand&quot; or &quot;we need to just cut the budget to pay off the massive debt&quot; I assume they had a similar text book. Actually I remember there was no real treatment given to <em>any</em> other form of market management, pros or cons, but I remember a side panel graph with basically three lines describing a simple interaction of supply/demand, a one sentence explanation, and then the phrase &quot;this is why communism doesn't work&quot;. Which was a suspiciously succinct summation of the largest political and economic upheaval of the 20th century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow.  That explains a lot.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just supply and demand&quot; seems to be a phrase people like to use when they have no idea what they're talking about.  You hear it applied to markets that are clearly completely rigged all the time.  Case in point: it's something estate agents seem to say a lot.</p>
<p>Both micro courses I did talked a lot about monopsony, monopoly, oligopoly, natural monopolies etc.  Then there was also asymmetric information, the theory of second best, product differentiation etc.  By the end of the second one, I realised that anything worth any money from oil to diamonds is a racket, and uncompetitive practices are rife in most high-paying industries.  Even the Economist highlights the likelihood that the banking sector makes most of its profits rent-seeking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Similar experience with my Business Law textbook in college lo these 30 years ago. (What, really? Gah.) Actual question from one of my tests, which I remember because it pissed me off SO MUCH: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which is the best form of government [or possibly government regulation]:
A) Communism
B) Socialism
C) Capitalism
D) Laissez faire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may have the question slightly off, but I remember sitting there raging for several minutes before marking the &quot;correct&quot; answer (which was C, of course). The implicit value judgments and complete lack of nuance lead me to utterly discount that entire class for the rest of the semester. I suspect many of my fellow middle-aged citizens received a similar economic education.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once traders see this is going to happen, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, until the central bank abandons the fixed exchange rate regime or at least adjusts it downward.  This happened to the UK in 1992 (Black Wednesday).  It happened to Argentina in 2002.  It's happened to Mexico (who peg to the US dollar) multiple times in the last few decades and many other countries besides.  It's what the markets tried (and as yet have failed) to do to Greece.</p>

<p>Great explanation. How did China manage to not follow down the same path?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another helpful sentence I missed off would have been:</p>
<p>This hasn't been a problem for China until quite recently as all the pressure on their currency has almost always been upward, so they've only been using the infinitely-available tool of money printing to control it.  It's only recently that the currency has started to become seen as over-valued, so they've had to start selling foreign currency reserves to counter the downward pressure on the yuan.</p></div>		</li>
