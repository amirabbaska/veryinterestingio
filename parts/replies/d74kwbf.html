			<div class="markdown"><p>I gotcha covered.</p>
<p>Short version: The atmostphere above us pushes down on us due to gravity holding the air to earth.  </p>
<p>If the top of the tank were open, it would work exactly like you think, spilling out through those holes.  However, if the top of the tank is sealed, air can push down on the top of the water through those holes, but not on the water in the top of the tank.  </p>
<p>So long as the downward pressure of the water in the tank and above those holes is less than the pressure of the air pushing down on the top of the water in those holes, the weight of the air above it holds back the water.</p>
<p>Any better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the top of the tank needs to be sealed for this to work, then how did they fill it up? </p>
<p>If they filled up the water from the top, there would be no vacuum and the tank would spill from the openings, but if they sealed the top, vacuumed it and filled it up from the bottom, wouldn't the force of the water make the water spill through the openings? </p>
<p>Would the only solution be to tape down the openings, fill it up, then remove the tape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it is: if you have a U-shaped straw with some water in it, and suck on the one end, the water will shift to the side you're sucking on, making a sort of J-shape. Your sucking is the vacuum and the other side has the atmosphere 'pushing' the water towards the vacuum side.</p>
<p>Edit, furthermore, you can cut the side of the straw where the water has resided from (thus making the U-shaped straw actually J-shaped), and there you have a similar scenario with the fishtank. If you stop sucking the water will spill out (trying to go back to the U-shape) </p>
<p><em>I could be mistaken but this is how I understand it</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It didn't make sense to me until he mentioned the tank is sealed.</p>
<p>In an open tank, water would pour out that opening and the volume of water exiting the tank would be replaced by air flowing in through the top. Here, any water volume that would otherwise flow up over the lip of the plastic won't be replaced by air and would have to create a suction force on the rest of the sealed tank, which isn't going to happen.</p>
<p>If you were to smash the lip off the side of the tank, water would not pour out in a steady full stream like it would on an open tank with the same hole, but splash messily while air bubbles enter the tank through the same hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my pleasure, though I'm only acting as a translator of sorts; I wouldn't have thought of it off the top of my head, just by looking at the picture - at least not without more time and thought.  I'm merely familiar enough with the physics that I got it thanks to /u/TheScotchEngineer's explanation.</p>
<p>There's no shame in not catching on right off the bat, explanation or no; the world doesn't always work in ways that are intuitive, and the details of many things are hard to follow if you aren't familiar with what leads up to that point.  Always be willing to question and to learn, for there is always more to know; to be too ashamed about not knowing to ask just keeps us from knowing.</p>
<p>The idiot is someone who cannot or will not learn; to admit that you don't understand and to be led to understanding proves that you are not among their number. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats the thing though. A 5 year old doesn't have to make sense of it because they changed the rules a while ago stating that the explanation just needs to be in laymans, easy-to-understand terms, not something a literal 5 year old could understand.</p>
<p>I don't personally like it, because you can see that the explanations tend to be complex sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if I take a sealed bottle of water and make a hole in the bottom, water will pour out even though the top is sealed- how is that different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, if the hole is small enough and the bottle is rigid, the water will not spill. The issue comes with larger holes.<br />
The reason is, air can get in from the hole in the bottle, since the surface of the water at the hole is not horizontal.<br />
In the picture, you can see these &quot;cups&quot; extending out from the tank. The surface of the water filling these cups is flat, and seals the hole. No air can get in, the vacuum is maintained, and no water spills out.<br />
With your hole, the water surface is not flat. Thus, there is a difference of pressure between the water at the top of the hole and the bottom, which means water will flow out from the bottom of the hole and air flows in from the top, breaking the vacuum.<br />
If the hole is small enough, the pressure difference is tiny, and the surface tension of the water keeps the water from spilling.<br />
There are two more considerations: why does the bottle have to be rigid, and what happens if the hole is perfectly at the bottom? I will address these a following comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) What happens if the bottle is not rigid?<br />
What I really mean here is the volume of the bottle or the water does not change. If it does, when there is more volume in the bottle or less of water, air flows in; when there is less bottle volume or more water, water flows out. This kinda ruins things :P if the bottle oscillates, then eventually all the water will flow out.</p>
<p>2) What if the hole is perfectly flat at the bottom?<br />
Here, we have an unstable system. What this means is, if the surface of the water was disturbed slightly, the whole thing would collapse. Suppose the surface at one point in the hole moved down slightly. This part would experience more pressure from the water above than the other parts of the hole. Water would then continue to flow downwards from this point, dropping the surface lower, while air would flow up into the other parts of the hole, ruining the balance and emptying your bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I got a rigid straw that had a right angle turn (picture a an Allen key that's hollow through the middle) and stuck that into the bottle, the water wouldn't spill out as long as the top was parallel with the ground? Assuming I could stick it into the bottle without breaking a vacuum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a different scenario, as the system extends past the bottle opening to the air underneath. </p>
<p>Since the air underneath is less dense than the water above it, it will displace the water. The rate of water pouring out is now governed by the air flow inwards, and isn't a hydrostatics problem. </p>
<p>In the tank example, the air is completely on top of the water surface, and the air will always be on top due to density difference. To demonstrate the difference, it would be like having the top-sealed tank full of air up to the opening in a swimming pool. The air again would flow out until the water completely fills up to the opening level. We can see clearly it's a different scenario. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you make a small hole then the water will remain in the bottle!</p>
<p>You can simulate this with a straw: fill a straw with water, place your thumb over the top, and you can carry the straw around full of water even though the bottom is open.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen a party trick where a hole is punched in the bottom of a beer can, but the beer does not shoot out until the can is also opened at the top.</p>
<p>The water only comes out the bottom of the bottle if the hole is big enough so that air can go in at the same time as water is coming out.  (Shaking the bottle may help the airflow to get started).</p></div>		</li>
