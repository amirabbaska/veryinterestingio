			<div class="markdown"><p>Because military has its own laws. </p>
<p>They have to have a separate system, as many laws we have in day to day life simply wouldn't work in a military environment. </p>
<p>You can't just leave when you feel like it in the military. If the were to happen, we don't know how many soldiers we'd still have if a war were declared. They could all quit. </p>
<p>But it wouldn't be right or legal to make normal people unable to quit their job. </p>
<p>Assault, murder, gbh..... Those are all illegal.
Those are also normal everyday things for infantry. </p>
<p>It's just not feasible to have one system with two hugely different sets of laws. Different lawyers, judges, standards. Nothing is the same.</p></div>		</li>
