			<div class="markdown"><p>With water, yes, but as air temperatures, they’re remarkably not deadly at all! 90° is a pretty typical sauna temperature in Scandinavia (and some people go well over 100°). The reason that’s not deadly is essentially the same as the answer to OP’s question: air is pretty insulating, while water is very conducting, so 90° in dry air may only be giving you as much heat flux as 45° water would, say.</p></div>		</li>
