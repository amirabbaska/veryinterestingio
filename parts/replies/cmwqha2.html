<p>But then (and please forgive the extremely ignorant question) why doesn't it feel hot when I shine a flashlight at my face? </p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks, I've gotten plenty of half explanations now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is simply because of power. A good old fashioned flashlight with a tungsten bulb will probably emit 90% infra red and 10% visible, but there will only be 20 watts in total. A bonfire on the other hand will be emitting around 5,000 to 50,000 watts or more, mostly in the infra red spectrum.</p>
<p>Stand next to a 1000 watt light bulb, you will feel the heat.</p>
<p>EDIT: Reading some of the replies below, there is one example everybody can relate to. If you set up a 1000 watt green laser beam (that would be a powerful cutting laser) it can be entirely visible light on one wavelength, but it will heat up and vaporise a piece of steel some distance away. But to confuse things, a lot of cutting lasers use infra red light simply because it is more efficient to produce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But aren't you still just feeling the heat from IR given off by the bulb, not the visible light? I sounds /u/henrebotha was thinking that by /u/chrisbaird's description, /uchrisbaird is saying that you feel the heat from the visible light given off by the bonfire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't feel the radiation itself, you feel the heating up of your skin. Your skin heats up when it absorbs light of any wavelength: visible, infrared, X-Ray... It's a lot better at absorbing some of these wavelengths than others, but for the sake of the argument let's ignore all that and just compare the two energy sources you have.</p>
<p>Matter above absolute zero temperature emits light at all sorts of wavelengths. The spectrum of an optimal emitter is called the black-body spectrum, and is described by the temperature alone. There's a nice picture of some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_body.svg" target="_blank">black body spectra at various temperatures</a> on wikipedia showing how much various temperatures emit at which wavelengths. On the whole, the hotter something is, the shorter the wavelengths at which it emits. The temperature of the surface of the sun is about 5000-6000 째C, which is very hot and produces a relatively narrow spectrum of light. Since that's our dominant source of light, human eyesight has evolved to make use of it -- making that region of the spectrum the &quot;visible&quot; spectrum. </p>
<p>So 5000째C is roughly the temperature we want something to have if we want it to emit light that we can see by. That's how (and why) the tungsten filament in the light-bulb of your torch works: a current flows through it and heats it to very high temperatures -- although probably not quite all the way to 5000째C, which is why the light might look a little yellower. (aside: the filament is in a vacuum or oxygen-free gas to prevent it from burning up). </p>
<p>Your fire, on the other hand, is burning at around 1000째C, much colder than your tungsten filament. That's why it has a reddish glow rather than a white one. The lower temperature results in a lower, broader spectrum with a peak that's shifted a lot further towards longer wavelength, and the part that does tail into the visible light is mostly red. The peak, and in fact the vast majority of the emitted light, is well into the infra-red and invisible. </p>
<p>So why does the colder fire feel hotter than the white light from a hotter tungsten filament? Because a tungsten filament is tiny, and the fire is big. How many tungsten filaments could you fit into the fire? There is a huge amount of light coming from the fire, since there is such a large area emitting the light. However, you can't see the light, because most of the energy is outside of the visible. Comparatively, because the tungsten filament is so small, there's a tiny amount of light coming out of it, but you can see nearly all of it because that's how we engineered it.</p>
<p>However, because your skin can absorb both visible and infrared light, and because you can feel the resulting warmth, you can get an idea of how much brighter the fire is... even if you can't see that brightness very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, get a mag light, point it at your skin from a couple inches away and it will be warm. The reason you don't normally notice the heat is because most flashlights are much less powerful so the effect is much less noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! Follow up question, if it's not too complicated to answer: Similar to what henrebotha asked, how come visible light doesn't heat me up while infrared wavelengths do? Do other wavelengths warm humans similarly to infrared, or is that a property unique to that range of the spectrum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does heat you up. You've just never been exposed to sufficiently bright visible light, that's all. Try putting your hand in front of the IMAX projector lens while a bright test image is being projected. You'll feel the heat allright, and that light only visible - the infrared is completely suppressed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visible light at the same power level would heat you up more or less the same.  (There would be differences if your clothing reflected more/less of IR compared to visible)</p>
<p>You just rarely see light that bright.  Even very efficient LEDs are only putting out about half the input power as visible light.  A campfire radiates tens of thousands of watts in IR-- you'd need a light outputting tens of thousands of watts of visible light.  Mind-bogglingly bright.  We can't see IR, so we don't have a good intuitive grasp of how &quot;bright&quot; a campfire is in that frequency range.</p>
<p>To get that much visible light out of an old-school incandescent light bulb, you'd be looking at a bulb with a rating approaching a million watts.  The problem with that, of course, is that most of those millions of watts would radiate in the IR.  But if you carefully set up an experiment with that bulb placed behind layers of IR-blocking glass, you'd find that you got plenty warm from purely visible light.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how you used heat correctly as a verb! So, I'll give you a decent answer before I head to bed. Different wavelengths interact with atoms and/or molecules in different ways. First, different atoms and/or molecules will emit, reflect, absorb, and transmit different wavelengths in different proportions under different conditions... in large part because of my second point. Anyway, absorption at a higher rate than emission is the critical thing for heating to occur. Reflection and transmission mean nothing. Second, different wavelengths interact with the electrons in atoms and/or electrons forming molecular bonds differently and depend on the various ways in which they can move. Microwaves for example reflect well off of metal and transmit well through most non-metal. Your microwave oven heats things by spinning whole water molecules more than anything else. As another example, infrared is absorbed well by vibrating bonds of particular size. Really high energy stuff like x-rays tends to interact with deeper electrons... I think I'll stop there because it is late and I can tell I am going to start getting into all the conditions that have to be just right for things like absorption and emission to occur. Good night! Let me know if that helps. If not, are you ready for a discussion of quantum mechanics? Have you heard of stuff like quantized angular momentum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually very applicable to firefighting. One of the goals of fire suppression is of course to protect exposures (prevent the fire from spreading to other structures). </p>
<p>It used to be common practice to setup what's known as a &quot;water curtain,&quot; which is basically what it sounds like: a sheet of water that you'd spray in between the burning structure and its neighbor, for example. The idea was that it would prevent the transfer of heat by convection.</p>
<p>Once it was understood that the majority of heat transferred to exposures is through radiation rather than convection, tactics shifted, and now (in most places) the standard practice is to apply water directly to exposures, which keeps them cool even with large amounts of heat being transferred by radiation.</p></div>		</li>
