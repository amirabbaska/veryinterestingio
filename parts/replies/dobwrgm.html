			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the most reasonable interpretation of &quot;optimal&quot; in this context is the angle that helps you win the competition.</p>
<p>Oxen Pulls are not races. Maximizing acceleration isn't really important. The goal is to be able to move the heaviest possible weight a very short distance. Basically just breaking the static coefficient of friction.</p>
<p>You basically want the angle to be as high as possible. But you are limited by the fact that oxen pull from their front shoulders and the sled has to be a foot or so behind them so they can walk. So getting anything much higher than 30-45 degrees would require you to build some kind of tower contraption or something that would presumably be unsafe/against the rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>F=ma... to maximize acceleration you need to maximize the utilization of the force available. If you want to pull the largest object possible and don't care about the acceleration... then use the same equation to find the optimal angle. Get a value for force that your oxen is able to exert and solve a simple free body diagram using the angle you solved for previously. </p>
<p>That will give you the largest load you oxen could barely move.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think in terms of this contest that is incorrect.  The way an ox pulling competition works is the ox has to pull a sled a distance of 6 feet.  They keep adding weight to the sled until the ox can't pull it anymore.  Whichever ox can pull the most weight the full 6 ft is the winner.</p>
<p>The way to interpret this question then is what rope angle would maximize the amount of weight an ox can pull?</p>
<p>Acceleration is the wrong way to look at this because acceleration includes a time factor.  Time is irrelevant to answer this question.  We just need to figure out what optimizes the forces to move the weight forward.</p>
<p>In your argument you say for low friction it would be better to have the rope nearly horizontal.  This is incorrect.  Because of the nature of this contest in this situation they would simply add more and more weight to the sled until the force of friction was back up to a level where the ox could not move it.  If the ox can support the weight it would be beneficial to have the rope angled more.  This would transfer weight to the ox, which would reduce the friction force from the sled and allow the ox to pull it forward.  However you would have to consider how much weight the ox is actually capable of supporting, which we don't know.</p>
<p>I don't think this is a question we can answer entirely with the information given.  We would need the dimensions of the sled and its center of mass.  We would need the coefficient of friction between the sled and ground.  We would also have to consider the geometry of the ox and biomechanical factors which are unknown.</p>
<p>A simple answer is you want to transfer as much weight to the ox as it is capable of supporting, while still providing maximal forward force.  You also don't want to provide so much upward force that the sled lifts up.  For example if we determine the ox can support 400 pounds with little effect on its pulling capabilities then we would want to angle the rope so that 400 pounds of sled weight is transferred to the ox.  This will reduce the force of friction and allow the ox to pull more weight forward.  What angle will transfer 400 pounds to the ox?  We don't know, it would depend on the geometry and weight distribution of the sled, and the coefficient of friction between the sled and the ground.</p>
<p>Edit:  I have spent some more time thinking about this and I think it's actually pretty simple.  There are a few factors we need to consider and we can make an equation to solve.</p>
<p>W1 is the weight the Ox can support.  This would have to be determined through testing, load the ox with weight until it can't comfortably support anymore.</p>
<p>W2 is the weight of the sled</p>
<p>μ is the coefficient of static friction</p>
<p>θ is the rope angle</p>
<p>F is the maximum pulling force of the ox</p>
<p>I also have to make an assumption, namely that the bottom of the sled is flat and uniform in shape and the center of mass is in the center of the sled.</p>
<p>So with those variables we can solve for the optimum rope angle.  Optimum rope angle will occur when maximum pulling force F occurs at maximum ox loading W1.</p>
<p>We can make two equations:  F = μ(W2-W1)  and  tan θ = (W1/F)</p>
<p>Substitute and solve for θ  ---&gt; θ = tan^-1 [W1/(μ(W2-W1))]</p>
<p>This equation will tell you what the rope angle is for the maximum load the ox can pull, which is the purpose of the contest.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that's how an ox race works, then, yes, the question is a bit different. The problem I solved assumed the mass was fixed. So... under the standard ideal assumptions, a given force magnitude <em>F</em> can pull a load of only so much mass. The solvability condition for this problem is</p>
<p><code>[; F \geq \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}\cdot mg ;]</code></p>
<p>Suppose the maximum possible applied force is *F*<em><em>max</em></em>. Then if the mass of the load is large enough, the above inequality will be violated, and thus there will be <em>no</em> angle at which the load would actually accelerate. So that maximum load mass is</p>
<p><code>[; m_{\textrm{max}} = \frac{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}{\mu}\cdot\frac{F_{\textrm{max}}}{g} ;]</code></p>
<p>If the mass load is less than m<em><em>max</em></em> then the load can accelerate given the force F<em><em>max</em></em>. The mass load is just barely under m<em><em>max</em></em>, then the load can just barely accelerate given the force F<em><em>max</em></em>, and this will necessarily occur at the angle θ<em><em>optimal</em></em> = tan^(-1)(μ). If the mass is equal to m<em><em>max</em></em> or greater, then the load simply does not accelerate, no matter what the angle is.</p>
<p>So there is, in principle, a maximum load mass, and if you're concerned about whether oxen are then able to pull that maximum load for the entire 6 feet, then you have to consider other biology and physics beyond the scope of my top-level response.</p></div>		</li>
