<p>Normal bacterial growth happens more when you do eat, not when you don't eat.  Most of your cavities are caused from the first 30 minutes after you eat.  The more frequently you eat carbohydrates, the more fermentation occurs on your teeth, the more cavities you'll have.</p>
<p>Not eating for a day may cause ketosis (it depends on how used to it you are), but it may take up to 3 days.  You breathe out acetone when you're in ketosis.  Some thinks it smells bad, others think it's sweet, others think it's not a big deal.  I don't really notice it when I fast for multiple days without food.</p>
<p>Sleeping and waking up with bad breath has more to do with a bacterial overgrowth of Streptococcus Mutans, combined with probably sleeping with your mouth open causing it to dry out and/or dehydration.  They're the bacteria that more contribute to cavities and they really like carbohydrates and specifically sucrose.  Interestingly, while sucrose is nearly chemically identical to fructose+glucose, sucrose is far more cariogenic (it's good at causing cavities) than fructose and glucose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have 6 autoimmune diseases, including 2 gut issues.  Fasting helps to calm down my gut.  A normal fast is 2-3 days without food, but my longest is 6 without food.  I just don't see the point in eating if I'm in pain and can't absorb it anyways.  I've gone 8+ months with gut issues that cause me to drop 20+ pounds.  A 2-3 day fast can calm things down enough for me to then be able to regain the weight. </p>
<p>I didn't used to fast.  Given my health issues (I was 5'10&quot; and 115 pounds at age 29), I had to do something.  I completely cut out refined carbs and started eating a whole foods diet.  For me that meant eating a lot more fat and a lot less carbs.  In doing so, I inadvertently cut bread, which was the reason I was so skinny.  I started gaining weight and started burning fat better (partially because I was eating more fat).  </p>
<p>Doing the whole foods thing takes more time, so I started eating bigger dinners and skipping breakfast.  Lunch slowly got pushed back from noon to say 2 pm and sometimes 3 pm.  At some point, I just skipped lunch, went home early, had a snack and started cooking.  Then I stopped snacking.  I just fell into it.</p>
<p>Refined carbs and specifically sugar actively make you hungry.  Coffee actually suppresses hunger.</p></div>		</li>
