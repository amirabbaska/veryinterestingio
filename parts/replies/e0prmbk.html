			<div class="markdown"><p>Another one: Is it possible? </p>
<p>I mean, Si does need four eletrons, but i heard its molecules are not as stable, or Si is heavier than C, so it s not as versatile as C.</p>
<p>Can someone explain, please? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon based life has been put forward as a possible alternate biochemistry because its similar to carbon. Both make four valence bonds allowing them to form more complex structure. However, carbon has a few things going for it…it is more abundant, the bonds are more stable and its smaller so its easier for living organisms to work with it. One of the interesting alternate chemistries that I think is fun to contemplate is not alternate carbon-based life but types of life that might not be water-based. Something that you might find on Titan in the methane or ethane lakes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>About methane opposed to water-based, how would the polarity (apolarity) of the molecule interfere with the biochemistry of the organism?</p></div>		</li>

<p>it is more abundant</p>

<p>Couldn't that just be in the places we've observed?  Couldn't there be a part of the universe that's Si rich and C rare?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, it’s possible, but you’re not far off. Bonds to silicon have lower bond energies and are generally considered weaker both in terms of homolytic cleavage as well as being more prone to things like nucleophilic attack. Silicon is also bigger (or what is known as “softer”) than Carbon is, and thus generally binds more poorly to other “hard” atoms like oxygen and nitrogen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably possible, but carbon is far more likely. As you said, silicon compounds are less stable and versatile, and carbon is plentiful throughout the universe anyway. And amino acids like the ones that make up our proteins have been found in space and in meteorites, which makes it fairly likely that life on other planets will be amino-acid based (and therefore carbon based) as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon based is far, FAR likelier. I'm not going to say other biochemistries are impossible, but carbon bonds are much more stable and versatile. The only other element that could POSSIBLY even work is silicon, and complex silicon compounds are far less stable and likely to occur naturally.</p>
<p>Carbon is plentiful throughout the universe. In fact, alien biochemistry may be far more similar to ours than some think; many of the amino acids that make up life have been found in space and in meteorites.</p></div>		</li>
