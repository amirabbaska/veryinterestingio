			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be said though, that since most spiders will tend to be preying on insects their venoms are often specific to insects and at most will only cause discomfort to large vertebrates. The toxins in many spider's venom are incredibly effective against invertebrates, however, and will cause paralysis or death in a very short time frame. </p>
<p>In Australia there is only two <del>species</del> types of spider that have been known to have toxin that is capable of killing humans. That is the redback and the funnel-webs (Atracinae subfamily). </p>
<p>Source, I'm a biologist in progress and Australian. </p>
<p>Edit: [Here is an excellent article on venoms that many should find interesting.] (<a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-ento-120811-153650" target="_blank">http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-ento-120811-153650</a>)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, found a funnel in my mailbox when I was still in school. Leaving home one morning I seen something sticking out of the mailbox, it was it's legs. Got the mortein and sprayed the fucker.  He crawled out and started to lift it's fangs so I stomped on it to show I'm the boss and not him.</p></div>		</li>
