			<div class="markdown"><p>Your second point is by far the most important. I got into RC planes as a kid, but didn't get very far since even the RTF models were well outside of my budget. The planes I could afford had a learning curve to fly and were expensive to repair when you  inevitably broke a component.  Now, there are high level easy to fly multi rotor platforms that are much more durable that are affordable under my childhood budget. </p>
<p>It's all about the money. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The newest generation of &quot;consumer drones&quot; are not even marketed towards RC hobbyists.  They are marketed towards &quot;photo-dads&quot; and adventure seekers.  They are no longer hobby RC toys, they are flying photography platforms and the people &quot;flying&quot; them have little to no respect for the RC hobby or regulations.  </p></div>		</li>

Traditionally, the RC enthusiasts have been more or less responsible, so the government has been okay with leaving them relatively unregulated, that's not the case anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's what I worry - idiots already fly them into TFRs over sporting events and into airport airspace. And the worst part is, people don't think its a big deal because they don't understand the dangers of why they're prohibited from entering said airspace</p></div>		</li>

<p>Woah, stop right there.  Before I continue let me point out I am a drone hobbyist and enjoy my Phantom3.</p>
<p>Courts have ruled you have no expectation of privacy in public.  That how ever is very different than someone sitting outside your property line with a telephoto lens watching you undress in your bedroom.  That is one scenario where you would have an expectation of privacy.</p>
<p>Does flying my drone with a camera over a public park violate anyones privacy?  No.  Especially considering there are no telephoto lenses on my rig.  If I was flying it 10 feet up and blantantly following someone around, well I could see how they would find that annoying to say the least. </p>
<p>Edit: Follow up does this &quot;american&quot; misguided sense of privacy mean I should be able to wiretap your phone or read your emails or open your snail mail?  I'm not the government so by your logic that's perfectly ok.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This really depends on specific local laws. An artist in NYC did an exhibition of telephoto shots he took looking into people's apartments. It was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/for-arts-sake-photoing-neighbors-with-zoom-lens-not-a-privacy-invasion/" target="_blank">ruled legal</a> by an appellate court.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An artist who hid in his apartment's shadows and deployed a telephoto lens to photograph his neighbors through their glass-walled apartment is not liable for invading their privacy, a New York state appellate court has ruled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/05/business/media-talk-california-law-will-allow-celebrities-to-sue-paparazzi.html" target="_blank">California has explicitly</a> written laws on the subject of paparazzi using telephoto lenses to 'tresspass'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The law will allow photographers to be found liable for invasion of privacy if it is proved that they trespassed or used telephoto lenses to capture images of people engaging in personal or familial activity, and provides for hefty damage awards against both photographers and their organizations. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: If I'm laying on the beach in my swim suit, and suddenly notice a drone that is hovering around and getting close up-leg camera footage of sunbathing (swim suit covered) lady-crotches (certainly any person who crawled that close to stare at my swim suit covered lady regions would get shoved away), is that harassment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like that would be similar to trying to take voyaristic upskirt shots of girls walking down the street.  I believe the technical legal term is &quot;pervy&quot;.</p>
<p>One of my friends was flying his drone around a park and there was a public pool near by.   He got accosted by a mother claiming he was clearly just trying to take creep shots of her kids.  I'm not sure that's really drone related, more an aspect of any single male adult alone around a park with kids is considered a pedo by the court of mommy opinions.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>5 years ago the best to learn how to fly RC was to find an instructor and have them slowly and methodically teach you how to control the aircraft because they were relatively expensive and if you crashed you had weeks of work to re-build them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an avid RC airplane/helicopter pilot myself, your info is way out of date. For the last 10 years the best way to start a newbie has been an RC simulator on their PC (e.g. RealFlight). Once they've got a couple dozen hours and a few hundred crashes under their belt and can reliably control the plane in the sim, you start them on trainer foamies like the Super Cub. I've seen some pretty bad crashes repaired within 30 minutes using fast setting foam compatible glue and tape.</p>
<p>You don't have to learn to fly using a buddy box, flying with a string tied to a wing, spinning in circles while controlling a balsa wood framed plane covered with monokote anymore.</p>
<p>Also, you forgot:</p>
<p>3) 2.4 GHz radios. You don't have to make sure nobody is transmitting on your frequency anymore. Your day isn't ruined when it turns out 3 other people are also using channel 27 and only one of you can be in the air at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I would say your half right.  I was one of the first 6 or 7 employees to work at the company Quadrocopter.  They were basically the first company to start selling multirotors on any kind real scale in the US.  I have been involved in the multirotor industry from day 1 basically.<br />
You are right about learning on a sim.  We would start people out in the sim.  Have em crash on there a million times or so, and then invite them to the office to train.  We hooked them up to the buddy box, and did several days of ground school, and flight school.  When all is said and done, some of our RTF units with camera gear included can cost over 50k.  Because of this every tip, pointer, and form of practice made a huge difference in their ability to fly.  Once the smaller copter came along like the blade mqx (Palm sized multirotors), we involved this in our training also. The problem with the sim, is that it's a great to to understand the basics of stick movements, but it just doesn't teach you the true feel of the multirotor, or how not to panic if you lose orientation, or how much faster it comes down when you throttle back with 5 pounds of camera gear.
Then DJI came along and made something that any idiot can buy and do dumb shit with.<br />
Drones, or multirotors, or whatever you want to call them aren't the problem.  It's stupid people.  I saw some amazing things done with multirotors during my time at Quadrocopter.  There are possible applications in many different fields that can and are extremely beneficial in saving companies time, money, and even not having to put an employee in harms way.
There are now millions of these things out in public hands, and 99% of the people using them are responsible people, doing creative things.  Don't let a very small number of fuckheads ruin your viewpoint on something that really can be a great thing.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not disagreeing with you.  Sim time is a lot like instructor time but not as good. Anyway maybe I should have said 10 years ago.   </p>
<p>But even the difference between 5 years ago and now is huge.  Between S.A.F.E and W.I.S.E and multicopters  you don't even need sim time anymore.  these planes can take off, land by themselves and save themselves from crashes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, the things the sims don't do so well with is: wind (maybe the newer versions of RealFlight have it right, but my latest version still doesn't model natural wind very well); imperfect flight characteristics (the models are usually &quot;ideal&quot;; they don't require trim adjustment, and don't have quirks due to slight weight imbalances or surfaces that are slightly out of calibration - I'm looking at you, Typhoon3D, with your elevator that is a good 10 degrees off alignment with the wings); courtesy (or how to stay out of someone else's airspace so you don't bring both aircraft down); responding to fires (or the reason why I prefer electric); and how to deal with the adrenaline and recover control authority when you're pretty sure that you're about to do over $100 in damage to your plane that you are out flying for the first time.</p>
<p>Some of those an instructor can help you with, some of those you just have to figure it out yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still amazing to me that I have one radio bound to 2 planes and 2 helicopters, each with their own control trim/quirks/channel mixes programmed in and it's always just there. I don't have to install an elevon mixer on my v-tail planes anymore, it's built into the controllers firmware; if I decide to fly plane #2 (which has channel mixing for elevens setup) but leave the radio on plane #1's settings, plane #2 will not respond until I set the radio to the correct setting.</p></div>		</li>
