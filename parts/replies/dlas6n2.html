			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of American tribes actually were aware of other tribes, but there's a tendency to think of them all as one big country, rather than think of them as separate countries with their own cultures as in Europe and Asia (or Africa, though lots of people make similar mistakes there too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever hear of aztalon? Its twenty minutes from my city in wisconsin... Its a major settlement of the mississippian empire which stretched from Mexico to Canada all along the mississippi river. Aztalon has an earthen pyramid and another under its lake. There was a massive temple complex and bustling city here 900 AD that traded up and down what are now three distinct countries.   </p>
<p>The apache of the desert come from british columbia which is why they speak a northern language.  Travel was WAY more common than many whites assume,  natives developed an international sign language specifically because of VERY long distance trading and travel being quite common. Natives most certainly had awareness of one another, their mythos and creation stories acknowledge other tribes and ancient places they came from.  They have myths going back to the paleolithic times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pyramids aren't really high tech, you just need vast manpower to stack rocks all day.  The Aztecs were warmongers and had no shortage of slaves to do the rock stackin'.</p>
<p>The plains Indians did construct some fairly elaborate earth and wood structures at times, but those have not survived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like &quot;advanced&quot; comes with more permanent settlements. There were a few Native Americans that  did have permanent settlement but most were nomadic.
