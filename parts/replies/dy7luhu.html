			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Wood fire won't do it. Hydrogen, acetylene, a welding arc or burning metal(like magnesium or thermite) should do the trick. Any object that is hot enough. It'll have to be waaay past white hot though. Like 3000-4000 degrees celsius hot. And for reference, at 1500 degrees objects start getting too bright to look at comfortably.</p></div>		</li>
