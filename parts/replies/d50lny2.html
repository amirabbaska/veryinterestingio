			<div class="markdown"><p>You're very much correct, but I doubt the average person is going to come across an acid with a high enough molarity that it has a negative pH. And people in school often learn that it's a 1-14 scale or something similar, so I was just keeping it simple. But yeah, it can be negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because as a log scale a ratio of more than 10\^7:1 is beyond the sensitivity of the equipment. ph 0 might as well be pH -infinity or no detectable pOH ions present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that pH of 7 is neutral at 25C.  For reference, neutral pH is 6.1 at 100C.  If the pH is seven when water starts to boil, you don't have pure water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, pH actually stands for &quot;power of hydrogen&quot; and the scale is the inverse power of 10 that will give you the molar it's of H+ ions</p></div>		</li>
