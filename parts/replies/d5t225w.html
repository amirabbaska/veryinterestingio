			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that methane <em>might</em> have contributed to warming during the Paleocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum and subsequent 'hyperthermal' events during the early Eocene. An interesting model can be found in <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n11/full/ngeo1266.html" target="_blank">Lunt et al. 2011</a>, although the question is still very much an open debate. The PETM did cause extinctions though, especially in deep sea benthic organisms such as foraminifera.</p>
<p>(for more info on the PETM and hyperthermals, see <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-earth-040610-133431" target="_blank">McInerney &amp; Wing 2011</a> for an overview)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Problem will be when people need to do the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real concern with climate change, in terms of society, is with how it interacts with our infrastructure. The American West has been prodigiously productive in terms of food growth, but in the near future won't be because of droughts and permanent loss of groundwater storage (subsidence). That farming industry will have to move elsewhere, at a tremendous economic cost. Areas that were dependent on rainfall to support its population may not get the amount they need anymore, causing shifts in population. Other areas may receive rainfall amounts that overwhelm their storm-water systems (See Hurricane Sandy), resulting in devastating flooding and economic damage.</p>
<p>In short; we've built massive amounts of infrastructure takes one thing for granted; the climate that it was built in will continue without much variation. Climate change has the potential to throw that completely out of whack, to such an extent that it could do horrendous damage the global economy for decades, if not centuries.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean, animals and plants <em>extend</em> towards the higher latitudes now that they are habitable.  I don't remember any warming event ever making the equatorial regions less inhabitable.  Global warming (absent some other catastrophic event) has always increased biodiversity and habitat range.</p></div>		</li>
