<p>Personally, I feel that if an area is deemed abandoned and there are homes or buildings that could be restored, the government should step in and assist. In some places, they do this, if the district is desireable. It could be a great opportunity for low-income affordable housing to help in areas that have a housing crisis. &quot;Companies&quot; like Habitat for Humanity could work on these projects and provide more community assistance to those in need. An old motel could be turned into single bedroom apartments for those in times of need (victims of domestic violence, or even student housing).</p>

<p>This is where a land bank could come in handy as well. People don't want to invest in just one house in a single neighborhood, but if a government or quasi government agency can facilitate the aggregation of a larger area it may make it more worth it for a developer, as you'll add a bunch of quality all at once. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I just find it really interested and retained a little information. Personally, I'm all for it and I think it would be GREAT if we could start renewing older buildings, but there are a lot of cons. Only thing I would recommend googling some stuff using key terms like historic, restoration, refurbishing and that stuff (any of the key terms myself or other commenters have brought up). </p>
<p>Though, I do remember a post back when the Olympic Games were going on, talking about how the Olympic facilities get abandoned after the games end. I know the '88 Winter games held in Calgary had a lot of establishments that didn't go to waste - The training facilities were all kept alive and maintained, and &quot;Olympic Village&quot; was turned into residential housing. Most cities/countries that have hosted did not do that and let their Olympic facilities fall into a state of disrepair.</p></div>		</li>
