			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this was a very good answer. The person I know who was just in Jamaica noted that nobody really did anything, nobody got anywhere on time, nobody felt the need to go to school or get to work, nobody did much but smoke and have sex. Again, not to be offensive or racist, just observations that my friend made while helping out in a very rural, very poor area.</p></div>		</li>
