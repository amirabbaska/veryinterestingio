<p>You know if you put this into a government tax, took 6% of a person's salary to pay for it, you would have a system that is affordable to all and you know when you get cancer your only option won't be to die so you don't bankrupt your family.</p>
<p>I saw people on another thread talking about the &quot;Don't buy an iPhone&quot; scandal saying they pay over a thousand bucks a month on health insurance. I don't pay anywhere near that in contributions to the government. </p>
<p>If I complimented my own health insurance and went with private insurance it would only cost me like Â£70 a month. (Had it as a perk in a previous job).</p>
<p>I would love to live in America but your labour laws &amp; health system scares the living shit out of me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What blows my mind is that people trip balls over a 5-6% increase in tax, but that would be offset by the money saved by not paying premiums, deductibles, HSA contributions, and out of pocket expenses. </p>
<p>5% of my wife and I's annual income is ~$7500. We pay $6300/yr for insurance premiums alone. My wife has a medication she has to take that costs us another $1500 a year, and would be $1000 a month without insurance. </p>
<p>I am begging for my taxes to be raised. I would bring home more money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick here is, employer contributions to your health insurance premium are likely not included in your math.  This country went off the rails when it decided that &quot;insurance&quot; was something to use to make pricing disappear.</p>
<p>No other product in this country is sold this way.</p>
<p>Once you had most of the population in the system, who is there to really price check the healthcare industry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a sizable population of people who will NEVER be persuaded or convinced to &quot;share their money.&quot;  These people don't want to pay for your medical insurance, your doctor bills, or your treatment of any kind.  The &quot;too bad so sad&quot; attitude just kind of stops the buck right there.</p>
<p>And it's not just Conservatives.  It's people, it's individuals who take pride in personal responsibility over helping your fellow man.  Left or Right, Progressive or Conservative, people are selfish.  A nation-wide publicly funded healthcare system simply won't succeed in a &quot;me-first&quot; culture.  You can try and try, but you won't convince someone to pay for someone else's bills if given the choice not to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People here still hate taxes and &quot;government handouts&quot; despite our health care system and social services, it's not a utopia cut off from America's bullshit. Prescriptions aren't covered, neither is dental or vision.</p>
<p>Also it can take several years to get in. Immigrating to Canada and obtaining citizenship is actually quite difficult.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then he pushed through a bill that further entrenched the useless insurance companies into the healthcare system by requiring people to get insurance or they get fined. Obamacare isn't about reducing costs as much as it is about reducing the number of people that aren't covered by insurance, assuming that being covered by insurance = affordable healthcare.</p>
<p>Another reason US healthcare is so expensive is because we put an emphasis on treatment instead of prevention. We would rather let a person get sick and then spend a ton of money treating the disease than prevent the disease from happening in the first place. Another thing that the PPACA did was raise insurance premiums, so now many people are choosing to forgo insurance that covers preventative care in favor of cheaper plans that only cover million-dollar medical disasters.</p>
<p>But, yes, health insurance isn't like car or house insurance anymore. They're a middleman that you pay protection money to so you don't get screwed over by hospitals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do people keep repeating this myth that Obama ever pushed for single payer? </p>
<p>Single payer was never <em>ever</em> on the table. The Democrats lead the negotiations with &quot;we know you'll never actually work with us, so here's everything you've suggested for the last 25 years,&quot; and Republicans said &quot;not good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>This sickening rewriting of history, pretending that the Dems worked their hearts out to give us everything and just fell 1 vote shy of worthwhile reform, is exactly the type of shit that reminds progressives that the neolibs and their apologists truly haven't learned anything from the biggest political romping in close to a centrury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a single payer system would remove tons of paperwork and administrative overhead costs. Another big (IIRC about 15%) place to reduce the costs we are paying. </p>
<p>I mean that right there is roughly 20% savings assuming it wouldn't completely remove all of the admin costs, and then there would be even more cost savings by added bargaining power the monopsony would create. I wouldn't be surprised if a single payer system ends up cutting healthcare costs almost in half. </p>
<p>But capitalism...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That problem would still exist without insurance. When one company makes a vital medicine (in this case EpiPens) they can dictate the price. Middlemen make it worse, but the absence of competition is the root problem and that is enabled  by the corruption within the FDA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to also consider the health care providers charging whatever they see fit because they know what they can get out of the insurance companies. Unless the insurance companies are actually price checking and comparing, causing the providers to compete, the providers will continue to exploit the flawed system and the insurance companies will continue to pass the expenses onto the consumer by raising premiums across the board. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most doctors love Medicare because the prices are fair, easy to collect, and include a reasonable profit margin (read 'income') for the doctor.</p>
<p>Most doctors only accept Medicaid when they are first starting up their practices because the reimbursement rates are set at the cost of providing the service plus 17% to cover overhead.  This means that the average doctor makes NO MONEY on Medicaid patients.  The only way to make money treating Medicaid patients is by cutting overhead by reducing the quality of the service (i.e. understaff) or by increasing the patient throughput (patients per hour).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why Obamacare didn't work. The idea was &quot;universal healthcare,&quot; but the implementation was &quot;everyone gets health insurance.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> for the record I am in no way blaming Obama himself for this. The government is big and has a lot of inertia. It takes a lot of effort to make even incremental progress, and I applaud him for what he got done. When I say &quot;didn't work&quot; I'm referring to negative consequences such as higher premiums which are the reason public perception of the program is so divisive today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We need to give the consumer more negotiating power with our dollar and choices. Not being able to source the best health plan, no matter it's geographical origin would help a lot. Same with buying drugs despite their origin. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-12-12/1-in-4-americans-have-pre-existing-conditions-that-could-hinder-coverage-if-obamacare-repealed" target="_blank">it is estimated that somewhere around 50 million people have pre-existing conditions which would have made it difficult for them to find private insurance if the government didn't mandate it</a>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the point though. Getting everyone on normalizes the risk and decreases the cost to the average person as well as the fallback cost on the government theoretically. The Republican alternative is a continual coverage policy, which means insurance companies can charge you increased premiums for a year if you ever let your coverage lapse. Also btw, a lot of those 20m people were covered by the Medicaid expansion, which there are no plans to get rid of right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair the fee / tax / whatever for not getting health insurance is significantly less than paying a monthly premium for a year. I think it was ~$650, in comparison my premium  even (as a young, healthy, non-smoker, no pre-existing conditions) is $180/month. So I could have easily opted out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who's always had to buy private health insurance these were a godsend. Basically before the ACA there was no way for me to have a pregnancy covered by any type of health insurance since my husband and I are both contract employees. </p></div>		</li>
