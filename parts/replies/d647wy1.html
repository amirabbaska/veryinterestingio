			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is a bit ambiguous (but entirely appropriate given the ELI5 context). To clarify, it is indeed &quot;concentrated sound waves hitting you all at once&quot;, but the object does not have to be emitting sound (like the roar of a jet engine) in order to produce a sonic boom. An object travelling faster than the local speed of sound, even if it is otherwise silent, will still generate a sonic boom because it is compressing the air in its direction of travel to the extent that it generates a shock wave that will be heard as a sonic boom. For example, there is a marked difference in the sound levels of subsonic and supersonic bullets, though the bullets do not emit any &quot;sound&quot; themselves.</p>
<p>No qualms with pontoumporcento, just trying to clarify.</p></div>		</li>
