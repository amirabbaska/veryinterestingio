			<div class="markdown"><p>Poster above is half right. <a href="http://aworldofbiology.weebly.com/uploads/3/2/1/4/32143827/1469476551.png" target="_blank">Most insects</a> do <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/media_colorbox/3288/media_original/en" target="_blank">have muscle fibers in their legs.</a></p>
<p>Most spiders do use hydrolics for extendending their legs but use muscles to retract them. Interstingly, they therefore have more strenght to grab on to preys!</p>
