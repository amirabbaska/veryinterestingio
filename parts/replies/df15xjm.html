			<div class="markdown"><p>I paid off my sleep debt within 3 years after putting 5 alarms every single night of high school in one hour intervals. No symptoms until I heard deep earth rattling before a tremor and it half woke me up as my mind focused on this... rapidly accelerating clinging. And then the tremor hit and I realized I was in sleep paralysis and panicked so bad... from that night on it started. I was diagnosed with narcolepsy based on my unnatural sleepiness, a latency test that said I would go into REM within 10 minutes, hypopompic and hypnopompic hallucinations on a regular basis, a merging of dreams and hallucinations with real memories (conversations, texts, chores that never happened, but they were dreamt as happening) and lost time. No cataplexy. Sleep paralysis on regular too. I could sleep 15 hrs in a day easily if I could.</p>
<p>My last yr of Hs and first 2 yrs of college feel like a weird intermittant mushroom trip or something. My hallucinations ranged from rotating glowing white helixes over my bed, hearing other people in the house talking about food they just purchased (but didnt in RL) to umbrellas open and set beside me so I would feel the air hit my face from another direction than it was actually set by my fan... I could write a book of all the weird shit I hallucinated and half dreamt. </p>
<p>But 3 years after and suddenly it stopped. Like a switch. I still hallucinate more often if I nap or go back to sleep in the morning if I fully wake up. I now sleep 8 hours. Maybe 9 or 10 if I can get away with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studies have shown that the circadian rhythm is closer to 25 hours! Studies also show that tribesmen from around the globe sleep very differently than most. They have 2 sleeps per day (as you correctly stated, at night), and often in the middle of the of those 2, they have a small meal.</p>
<p>The whole 8 hours per day thing is pretty much a fallacy, especially when considering that teenagers require significantly more, or that complete sleep cycles are roughly 90 minutes, so 7.5 or 9 hours would be better if going by what is &quot;recommended&quot;</p>
<p>Also, sleep debt CAN repair the damage, however it simply takes longer than a single sleep. A sleep debt of 2-3 hours can be resolved in a few days, however a proper jetlag for example, of 9+ hours can take up to 4 weeks to normalise hormones and rhythm.</p>
<p>Side note: The main hormone responsible for your sleep is melatonin. It is suppressed when light hits the eye and builds once it gets dark. As you get older, production is affected in general, and you make less, which is why many old people take naps constantly, they simply can't stay asleep for long periods, yet need the same amount of sleep as a young adult. Children require more sleep than adults.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The supposed benefits of biphasic/polyphasic sleep is in the realm of pop science not real science, and it totally ignores culture and work. Just because some people do it does not make it healthy. Some researchers suggest that modern conveniences like electricity are bringing people back into its natural monophasic sleep state because we are less influenced by environmental cues that historically disrupt sleep, like fluctuations in daylight hours as you move away from the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or you can be like me and have delayed sleep phase disorder.
I am not very ill, depressed, or working late nights. It is just that my circadian rhythm isn't dependent on sunlight. My circadian rhythm generally wont let me sleep till about 4am and wants to sleep till about 12 or 1 in the afternoon. It is mostly regular at those times, although I do have rare occasional non-circadian days, which result in me being awake for more than 24 hours because I just don't get tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit I think I might have this. Everything you mentioned describes me to a T and this has been going on my whole life. Melatonin etc hasn't helped in the past and I pretty much gave up on it. I sleep through class a lot because when I try to stick to a normal schedule, I'm exhausted ALL THE TIME. I also lie in bed for hours on end most nights I try to go to bed early. How can I go about finding out if this is the same issue? I've been to doctors but was never successful in any sort of diagnosis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very difficult to diagnose. For 15 years I was incorrectly diagnosed with ADD (come to find out that is very common). You will wan't to get a sleep study done. And you should keep a sleep journal. What time you went to bed, what time you actually fell asleep, how well did you sleep, what time did you wake up, that kind of thing. </p>
<p>Edit: I found out because of a post like this on reddit and got a sleep study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost exactly the same here. Sleep feels more natural at 3-5am. No matter what, my body is ready to sleep at 7-9am. I usually prefer to awake at 12-2pm and anything before is absolute brutal--even if I went to bed at 12am--I'll feel incredibly tired and will want to take a long nap soon after.</p>
<p>It's been this way since late middle school.</p></div>		</li>
