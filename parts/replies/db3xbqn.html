			<div class="markdown"><p>And this works effectively because number of listeners is just a number they use to measure marketing effectiveness which means the higher the effectiveness the more they can charge for commercials.</p>
<p>Therefore using gimmicks as the other guy said to raise numbers is just an example of how marketing can be used to have an impact on the listener base:  a true measure of marketing value.</p>
<p>Interesting how it all works together like that.</p></div>		</li>
