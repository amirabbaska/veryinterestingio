			<div class="markdown"><p>that would vary hugely, depending on the charge of the strike, the salinity and temperature of the water, how fat you are (more volume in your body means the same charge per cubic meter imparts more energy on you)...</p>
<p>I would strongly advise against being within visual range of the strike point of lightning in water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, I'm overanxious anyway so when there's a thunder storm I usually stay inside if I can. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Because cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Skin effect does limit the depth of penetration, but even if it's a wide curve, it will still be a cubic curve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even then, I expect you'd get something more complex than a simple 1/r^3 in that case.  At that point you have a real PDE to solve.</p></div>		</li>
