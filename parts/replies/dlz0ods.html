			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there's a big case in the web world just the other day where a Florida judge ruled that Winn Dixie food stores' website is not ADA compliant in a way that services blind people with the same customer experience as a seeing person.</p>
<p>A website.  Servicing blind people.  With visual content.</p>
<p>Apparently it doesn't matter that the defendant is a serial litigator who sues pretty much everyone over ADA &quot;violations.&quot; and while the ADA legalese <em>does</em> have provisions about websites, there are <strong>no actual guidelines for what a website has to do to be ADA compliant</strong>.  The 11th circuit judges couldn't even agree what would actually need to be done by the company for them to <em>be</em> compliant in that regard, and an expert witness claimed that he could &quot;make their site compliant for a mere <strong>$37,000</strong>&quot;.  Not to mention that it's all based around third-party screen reader apps not being able to parse the site to do text-to-speech, so at what point does it become the app creator just not doing a better job of parsing modern web designs?</p>
<p>The whole thing is sue-happy bullshit, but now that there's established case law supporting it literally every business in the US with a website can potentially be sued for ADA violations for not somehow magically meeting guidelines that don't exist.  There's already an ambulance chaser firm pushing similar cases against McDonalds, Grubhub, and another big company I can't remember, but this could go all the way down to people being able to sue a mom and pop shop with a website if they don't spend big bucks to make sure their website can meet these nebulous guidelines.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind the ADA was made law like... 17 years ago?  And this is the first successful lawsuit against a website for not being &quot;blind friendly&quot; enough?  (plenty of ambulance chaser settlement cases though).</p>
<p>So yeah, big business court cases like this are total BS more often than not.  Just because someone sued and won over some crazy labeling thing doesn't mean baby powder actually causes cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm absolutely aware that they use the internet.  But the precedent set by this case is quite literally that every business-oriented website <em>must</em> accommodate blind people or they can be sued under the ADA, but there's no definition of <em>how</em> they must accommodate.  That's a <em>huge</em> difference from needing to make ADA accommodations for a physical office space.</p>
<p>This precedent means that even if you're a one-man startup selling custom jewellery through your website, if it's not designed <em>explicitly</em> so blind people can easily and readily navigate your site, any random blind person can sue you for violating their rights under the ADA and win.  You could just google up every little shop in America with a poor web presence and start firing off lawsuits.  If a third party screen reader that has nothing at all to do with your site, your business, or your design can't read your website, it's now <em>your</em> legal responsibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, in a civil trial the plaintiffs only need a simple majority of jurors to win. So it could have been a 7-5 vote, which is a much lower standard than in criminal trials.  </p>
<p>Edit: I was mistaken. In California the plaintiffs need 9 out of 12 jurors to win their case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true in federal court, which is where a lot of these high profile civil cases are tried. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(b) provides that &quot;the verdict must be unanimous&quot; unless the parties agree otherwise.</p>
<p>You may be thinking of the lessened burden of persuasion in civil cases, which is a preponderance of the evidence. This is often characterized as &quot;more likely than not&quot; or &quot;a feather on the scales in one direction.&quot; This is contrasted with the burden of persuasion in criminal cases, which is constitutionally required to be beyond a reasonable doubt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to state civil courts, but you are definitely correct regarding Federal courts. This case was in Los Angeles Superior Court, however, so the point stands. (My experience is that plaintiff's counsels fight <em>hard</em> to keep these cases at the state level for this reason.)  </p>
<p>Your point about the burden of persuasion is well-taken, and another reason that civil rulings should be taken with a grain of salt. They definitely do not constitute scientific causation.</p></div>		</li>
