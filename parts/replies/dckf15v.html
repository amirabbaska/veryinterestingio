			<div class="markdown"><p>Color blind people can still see the intensity of all colors; they just see two or more primary colors as the same color. In this case, for example someone with red/green color blindness would be able to see the image perfectly fine, he/she just wouldn't be able to tell if he looked at a red or green NVG image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cone-response.svg" target="_blank">Here's a graph of the wavelength sensitivity of the three different types of cone cells in our eyes, overlapped with the wavelength sensitivity of rod cells</a></p>
<p>Two of the types of cone cells and the rod cells all have high sensitivity to light with wavelength in the green part of the spectrum. Rod cells do not resolve color, but they still have wavelength-based sensitivity.</p>
<p>This means that the least amount of energy can be used for the greatest ability to resolve images if those images focus on green light.</p></div>		</li>
