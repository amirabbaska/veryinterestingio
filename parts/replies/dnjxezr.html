			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk, personally I hate killing anything. I’ve killed spiders but I always feel terrible after. What’s worse is realizing that your killing off only the stupid spiders that don’t stay hidden, which in return strengthens their gene pool. The future looks bleak now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid I had nasty big spiders in my room, and became frightened (slightly arachnophobic).<br />
As an adult male, it felt ridiculous to be afraid of spiders, so I began using time studying the least threatening species I could find. (Pholcus Phalangioides)<br />
I still do not like letting the adults walk on me, but the spiderlings are now cute!</p></div>		</li>
