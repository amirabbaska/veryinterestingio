			<div class="markdown"><p>Linear A is one of the more famous.   There was another system we called Linear B, and for a long time people believed that Linear A was just an older form of Linear B, with the language of Linear A being to Linear B what Old English is to Modern English, so deciphering Linear B would allow them to also crack Linear A.</p>
<p>When Linear B was finally deciphered, researchers then knew what sound each symbol stood for.  but when they tried to apply those sounds to Linear A inscriptions, it produced gibberish.  So that suggests Linear A and Linear B were two languages which had similar character sets but used each symbol for completely different sounds.  So Linear A is still undeciphered!</p></div>		</li>
