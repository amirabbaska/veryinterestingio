			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad I was able to help. It can still help to eat because most food contains water. However if you care about calorie intake I recommend water. Also water in the morning can help prevent the bad habit of always eating when you feel hungry which can lead to eating when bored or binging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs a however statement. By no means should you substitute breakfast with a healthy breakfast. Once you are on the right track with your diet and not stuffing yourself with sugar in the end or middle of the night, it is crucial to consume a good breakfast to make a starting point of your day. From there it is managing your meals accordingly with time and exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During a full night of sleep I lose nearly a pound of (water) weight. I keep a liter of water next to the bed and try to drink it all when I wake up. Then I wait a bit before eating. It does the trick!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's definitely hunger for me, it does it after large high protein meals-- my stomach is rumbling like a mother fucker and I can feel the nausea of not having eaten coming on.</p>
<p>I almost never eat breakfast unless I do this to myself accidentally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it is still dehydration. I won't say you don't know what hunger feels like, but dehydration and hunger can feel near identical a lot of the time. Next time you feel like that I would suggest trying water and waiting a bit. I won't say don't eat, that's up to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My body is irritatingly sensitive and needs a continual intake of water to stay hydrated, so I know dehydration symptoms and they're nothing like my hunger symptoms (again--for my body). Dehydration for me is panging headaches and craving sweets. Hunger is nausea in more and more severe building waves, dizziness (if it goes too long), and sluggishness, characterized by me feeling like I'm floating and the world is weird. Also, a lot of anger snapping (I almost never get angry unless my blood sugar drops and I'm hungry).</p>
<p>Keto helps a lot of these so I mostly stay low carb (don't have to worry about eating a meal three times a day then), but it also stifles your first hunger pangs that remind you to eat, so I end up getting some of the worst symptoms if I don't pay attention and force myself to intake at least 900 calories or so a day (I don't move much so that sounds low but it's not when I'm losing weight).</p>
<p>I know what hunger feels like. I don't know what starvation feels like, but I don't purport to know that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly you do get &quot;hunger pangs&quot; when you're thirsty. This comes with the asterisk of depending on how recently you've eaten and how much. But in the morning, hunger pangs are most likely a result of stomach stretch receptors, not an actual physiological need to eat. This means putting anything in your stomach can help. They showed this with balloons in the stomachs of animals in the 50s.</p></div>		</li>
