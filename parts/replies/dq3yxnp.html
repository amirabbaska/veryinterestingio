<p>you don't need to know how a car engine and the other parts work to become a good driver.</p>
<p>but it helps, makes some things easier.</p>
<p>and I find it very rewarding when I have the feeling I really understand something I do a lot/for a living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the best way to envision it.  Quality programming algorithms depend upon mathematical reasoning.  The more forms of math you've been exposed to, the easier it becomes to apply in code. </p>
<p>Inherently, not all math you learn in an advanced degree is directly used, but many concepts and their application will be used.  The more the programmer can detect these patterns of operation that have been solved, the easier the programs will be to write.</p></div>		</li>
