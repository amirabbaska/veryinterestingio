			<div class="markdown"><p>In a totally blind person, no.  The photoreceptor cells need to be alive and the optical nerve connected, and totally blind people are missing at least 1 of those.</p>
<p>If both are working (in any form) then you'd be partially sighted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you'd be blind with a detached retina as well or any one of the diseases that turns a part of the opaque. Since the radiation doesn't care whether setting is visible light opaque, that would still be able to cause the flashes.</p>
<p>But you are right the brain and connection to the eye has to be working.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If not.. how could we know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on why they're blind. If it's due to optic nerve damage, then no. But if it's due to lens damage then yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those linked experiments are very interesting to me. I've been looking for something like this, but haven't stumbled upon those yet. I came to the same conclusion (direct activation of retinal photoreceptors) by thinking about the phenomenon, but wasn't really sure until now.</p>
<p>I came to think about it because several of my patients so far reported seeing white or blue flashes or dots or streaks when we shot their heads with 6 MV photons, as in radiation therapy for gliomas or brain metastases.</p>
<p>It happens relatively rarely, I would estimate in the few percent range, but that's plausible because we usually spare / shield the eyes as good as possible. Could also be because I don't really ask my patients for these sensations, but sometimes the more curious ones do ask me.</p>
<p>Theoretically could be Cherenkov radiation in those cases, a max photon energy of 6 MV generates secondary electrons with an energy spectrum of around 500 keV to 5 MeV <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228655951_A_comparative_Monte_Carlo_study_on_6MV_photon_beam_characteristics_of_Varian_21EX_and_Elekta_SL-25_linacs" target="_blank">source, figure 7</a>. Electrons would have to move at a minimum speed of 230,000,000 m/s, which is an energy of about 286 keV, to be able to produce Cherenkov radiation in water / the vitreous body... but the linked experiments make it more plausible to be direct neuron / photoreceptor activation.</p></div>		</li>
