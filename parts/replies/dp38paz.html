<p>Great example would be fruit. A number of studies have shown that eating whole fruit versus fruit juice will promote a greater feeling of satiety. But once you get into specific fruits and fruit juice... how satiated you feel depends on the osmolality of the juice, chemicals in the fruit and juice (such as how they interact with insulin) as well as fiber, water, and protein. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So the fitness gurus have it pretty much spot-on when they say broccoli, brown rice, and baked chicken (with water only).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every person is different, and as a result some &quot;diets&quot; work better for them than others. I've tried a variety of lifestyle changes. Went &quot;balanced&quot;, wen't &quot;higher protein&quot;, &quot;paleo&quot;, and now I'm doing Keto. Keto by far has worked the best for me. I no longer crave crappy high-carb foods, eating healthier, the diet self-regulates your eating, and the weight has melted off me. </p>
<p>That being said, for some people Keto doesn't work, and their body can't handle it. You have to experiment and see what works for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keto is awesome. It's the only diet I can stick to long term because of the delicious food you're able to eat while also staying lean/losing fat. I can pair keto with intermittent fasting on a 20:4 hour split no problem. I rarely have that hunger feeling, I never feel bloated or get heartburn, I don't worry about food since I eat twice a day, plus I get to save money on food. What's not to love?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to achieve the results you want is to simply not buy things you want to cut out of your diet.</p>
<p>I look in my fridge it's fruit, eggs, a whole chicken and wraps to make egg wraps with in the morning and 4 bottles of sugar free diluted tropical squash.</p>
<p>The worst thing I can snack on is an apple or an orange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally you drink a healthy amount of water but also eat foods which contain high natural water content too - boiled potatoes are much higher on the satiety index than crisps/chips for example and part of that is that its calorie density is lower.  </p>
<p>Water itself tends to be more satiating when it's an inherent part of the foods you consume.  Nutrient dense, low calorie soup is a good example of a high water content, filling food but it's almost an exception because most liquid meals are less satiating than their solid counterparts.  In general the sweet spot tends to include solid foods you can chew with high protein, low energy density and high volume.</p></div>		</li>
