<p>A bigger question posited by non-neoclassical economists is whether or not the very definition of money, in a fractional reserve debt issuance based context, falls into the category of &quot;continuation non-viable&quot; (and, in point of fact, most evidence points to the reality that all fractional reserved debt issuance &quot;money&quot; eventually fails, although the failure is usually attributed to political reasons rather than some fundamental flaw with the idea of money as defined in that context).</p>

<p>If it's relevant to you : Currency and money are not the same, and they can only issue fractional reserve debt based currency, not money, but I imagine you already know this. There's really good goldbug video by Mike Malony called &quot;Hidden Secrets of Money : Money vs Currency&quot; and it really put a few pieces of the picture together that I was missing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one thing to understand about pyramid schemes is the above explanation is the theoretical paradigm.  in real life very few people who are solicited directly by the top guy which is the master company actually gets anyone below them to get in.  it's very unlikely that anyone that is savvy enough to build a stream below them is going to sign on to be below someone else in the same relationship.  </p></div>		</li>
