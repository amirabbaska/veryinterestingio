<p>As for why light has a speed at all and why the speed is what it is and not any other number or infinite, we don't know.</p>

<p>Light travels at the speed limit of causality because it's the speed limit of causality (assuming it's in a vacuum).</p>
<p>Why that speed limit is there we do not know, but your answer is fundamentally misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Causality is a concept. It doesn't have a speed limit. Causality is defined by a light cone, which itself is defined by c. You can't say &quot;the speed of light is the speed of causality because the speed of causality is the speed of light&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The (speed) of (light) is different to c, the (speed of light). They are two entirely different concepts. c is a constant, the speed of light is some value between 0 and c depending on the properties of the medium it is in and gravity.</p></div>		</li>
