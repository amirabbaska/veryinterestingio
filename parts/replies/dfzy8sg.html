			<div class="markdown"><p>Americans, Russians, Sryians, everyone with an airforce trains on how to rapidly repair damaged runways. Putting a single hole in it would only render is inoperable for however long it takes the engineers to get there to patch it.  During the Falkland War the British spent a awful lot of resources to launch one of the longest bombing raid of all time against the airport at Port Stanley, and engineers had it repaired to the point that C-130s were using it less than 18hours later.</p>
<p>There are purpose built munitions meant to permanently knock out runways, but those were not employed because that was not the intent of the strike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume it depends on the aircraft? What kind of take off space you need? A friend of mines dad growing up was a hobby pilot, he graded what seemed to be a decent runway on his land. Granted it was for a Cessna and a older Seneca, but if you get desperate enough I suppose you could try to build one for a modern aircraft? Except it would be hard to hide. </p></div>		</li>
