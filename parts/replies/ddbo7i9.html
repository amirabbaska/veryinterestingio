			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I feel like these rules being expensive for banks is really just due to lack of competition leading to inefficiency on the banks part. Some of these regulations on derivatives should be a no-brainer for the banks, yet they have trouble implementing and abiding by them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a reasonable argument. Until the last 40 or so years, banking was well divided amongst numerous institutions, but now through M&amp;A there are only a handful of megabanks extant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many of these derivatives had complicated names and lengthy legal contracts, but on the surface they were just banks gambling with your money, e.g. if the price of this commodity I don't own goes down to this value, you give me this much money, but if it goes up to this value, I owe you money.</p>

<p>I think teaching financial literacy to our kids will do more to help the situation then adding regulations. If you can't see the usefulness of derivatives and can't understand concepts like hedging, no amount of regulation will make you feel safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banks play an absolutely critical role in the economy through investment. I didn't write this to harp on banks, and even OTC and swaps markets play a role in making markets work efficiently. That said, there is some role of the government in ensuring that the average person isn't too exposed to risk without knowing it. The extent of that role is always the question. I'm not actually against the Trump administration's removal of some of these regulations, and I'm very glad interest rates are being bumped up, since interest rates are how companies price risk.</p></div>		</li>
