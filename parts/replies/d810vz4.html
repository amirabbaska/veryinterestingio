			<div class="markdown"><p>Genders are ways to classify nouns. They don't have to be based on real-world categories. Indo-European languages like to classify things into Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter or some combination thereof, but you could also do it the Cree/Ojibwe/Seneca/Oneida way of classifying things into animate and inanimate, or something totally different and arbitrary. </p>
<p>Fula has 24 genders, and most of them are totally arbitrary. A handful have patterns, though: there is one gender that contains mostly long, skinny things, one gender that is mostly liquids, one that is mostly round things, one that is mostly non-count nouns. </p>
<p>One gender has only one word in it, &quot;calf&quot;. This leads to the odd effect that the word &quot;calf&quot; is almost never actually spoken,  since, if the verb is inflected for the &quot;-kol&quot; gender, the subject can't be anything other than nal-ol, &quot;calf&quot;. </p>
<p>Another gender has only four words in it, &quot;cow&quot; &quot;fire&quot; &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;hunger&quot;, and similarly, these words are rarely spoken, especially &quot;cow&quot; because the gender inflection on the verb tells you all you need to know. </p>
<p>I did a semester-long project on this language in my undergrad typology course, it's really interesting, and tragically underdocumented. I pulled all my information from four books, because there only exist four books on it, and one of them is written in a language I only barely speak, &quot;Die Sprache der Ful&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: someone will inevitably come in and say &quot;Anarion, those are noun classes not genders&quot;. This is a distinction without a difference. The systems work in basically the same way, it's just that when a language has a lot of types,  people are uncomfortable calling them &quot;genders&quot; so they made up a new word. </p>
<p>edit: clarification on arbitrariness of Fula genders</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd call that nomenclature a misnomer, to be honest. Grammatical gender and sex have, generally speaking, little in common and the subdivision into m/f/n sometimes gives people the wrong idea. Not that you said anything wrong, just my thoughts on the topic. </p>

<p>What are the other books? Grammatical gender is probably my favourite topic in linguistics (been writing papers on it since I first encountered it in uni). My pet theory is that gender and quantification are coupled and Fula seems to back that up with at least some of its categories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Gender&quot; in languages is not tied to anything outside of the language. While I'm not saying it applies in your case, I have seen many people used to European languages thinking in terms of &quot;Masculine&quot; or &quot;Feminine&quot; as it applies to human society. This is not the case.</p>
<p>Gender is simply a noun case. A group or categorization of nouns that share the same form. It can be related to the structure of the word (ie. nouns ending in -e are Gender 1, and nouns ending in anything else are Gender 2), or it can relate to the semantic meaning of the noun (Animate objects are Gender 1, Inanimate Objects Gender 2; Round objects Gender 1, Square Objects Gender 2, everything else Gender 3), or it can be completely and utterly arbitrary or in place for historical reasons.</p>
<p>The language he mentions has cases like &quot;Singular Person&quot;, &quot;Plural Person&quot;, &quot;Singular small object&quot;, &quot;Liquids&quot;, and a whole bunch that Wikipedia classes only as &quot;Various&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but that's not where my problem is. I don't care if all languages are equally effective or not. It is not <em>self-evident</em> that effectiveness and complexity are the same thing. So unless someone can articulate how they are the same thing, and therefore show that there is no such thing as variable complexity (because there's no variable effectiveness), then OP's question hasn't been answered <em>at all.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems really counterintuitive.  </p>
<p>As a programmer, I can picture a bunch of different programming languages all with varying complexity.  Even though they are all turing complete, that doesn't mean that their language / grammar complexity is the same.   </p>
<p>It seems like if I were designing a natural language I could make it as complex as I wanted.  I could design all sorts of intricate grammar rules for one-off situations, where it would instead be possible to have a simpler general rule.  </p>
<p>When you say this, is it simply quibbling about the definition of &quot;complexity&quot; for natural languages?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turns out, that's not the case. There have been experiments done in this regard. There are certain features that appear in every human language, and while you can design a language without it, it is literally impossible for a human to learn it. For example, every language has a designated order for modifiers in DPs. In English it's</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those three blind mice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Akan and Konkomba</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mice blind three those</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other languages (Japanese and French, I think?) you will find</p>
<blockquote>
<p>those blind mice three</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you will never, ever find</p>
<blockquote>
<p>blind those three mice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 24 possible word orders here, and 10 of them are never seen in natural languages. If you invent a language that has one of the 10 unseen orders, you can't teach it to people, they simply won't learn it. If they think they've got it and then you test them, they will almost always unconsciously fall back to one of the 14 attested orders (even if it's not the one their native language uses).  The basic format of language is built into our brains, there is a hard cap on &quot;complexity&quot;. </p>
<p>Edit: replaced errant Japanese order with an actual language that has that order. Thanks, /u/invaderkrag </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thats both wrong and misleading. Many programming languages have a context free syntax, but many have slightly context sensitive syntax (for example Python). And I believe some have (by mistake) turned out to be even more complex. But that is only about the syntax. It doesn't say anything about how powerful the language is. In fact nearly all programming languages are Turing complete, which is equivalent to a Chomsky type-0 language. </p></div>		</li>

あの三匹の盲目のねずみ or
