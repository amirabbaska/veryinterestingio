			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct! Back in the Ice Age, much of the environment was ubiquitous -- sprawling grasslands interspersed with mixed conifers and other vegetation. Back then, the dominant herbivorous mammals were the mammoths, mastodons, horses and camels. </p>
<p>However, as the climate began to warm, more and more niche environments were able to arise. Suddenly there were many different habitats based on precipitation and elevation and plants began to adapt and become specialized to these differing environments. Many of the plants evolved unappetizing chemical compositions that made them either unattractive or entirely indigestible to animals with one stomach (such as the horse, camel and extinct pachyderms).</p>
<p>While the one-stomach herbivores were essentially starved out of the environment, animals with multiple stomachs, such as goats, cows and especially deer were able to digest the new vegetation and began to take advantage of the shifting climate. Some historians believe that it was this shift in climate and vegetation types that led to the extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse and camel in North America (as opposed to the <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/11/1112_overkill_2.html" target="_blank">Over-kill hypothesis</a> in which incoming humans wiped them out). </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the climate shift killed those creatures, then Europe and Asia were lucky. The big animals such as the horse were quite important to the development of societies there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans would have just trained and bred a different available species for work, though maybe some things wouldn't be possible with cows (don't know how the whole four stomach thing works with smaller amounts of high quality food so they don't have to spend all day eating, which is an important feature when you want the animal for work).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it'd be a mix of both.  Their numbers were growing low, then humans helped them along to extinction.</p>
<p>Then again, how local would those animals populations have been?  Native Americans were numerous, but North America is quite large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is far before what you consider &quot;native americans&quot; were here.  </p>
<p>It was Clovis, the greatest killers of animals ever.  If the climate wiped out these animals it just brought about their fate sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I buy this.  For starters, Klatsoot is talking about a time <em>long</em> predating the current ice age and the extinction of megafauna...the Eocene and Oligocene.  Furthermore, he's saying essentially the opposite of what you are claiming, namely that perissodactyls do better in warm, lush, low-grassland environments (like the current world), while artiodactyls do better in arid grasslands (like the past ice age).  And this makes sense based on what we see in the real world.  If perissodactyls and elephants had really been starved out when the world transitioned to a warmer, wetter climate, we'd expect to see them hanging on in current areas more similar to the past ice age world....but this is the opposite of what we see. Remaining elephants survive in wet tropical forests, as do tapirs (perissodactyls).  Horses and some camelids do occupy some cold, dry niches, but rhinos survive in warm and in some cases wet regions.  In fact I think you have it backwards, as pressure was more likely placed  on populations during the glacial periods, not the interglacials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there were megafaunal extinctions all throughout the Americas, right down into tropical regions that didn't see a whole lot of climatic change at the end of the ice age.  And the most recent glacial cycle in North America isn't really all that different from the several preceding glacial cycles.  Any solely climactic explanation for why so many megafauna died out has to address why they managed to survive previous  similar cycles.</p>
<p>At any rate, we <em>know</em> horses aren't excluded from North America due to foliage quality, at least in the modern era,  because feral herds establish themselves quite well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This kinda sorta explains why you can kill a horse very easily by feeding it the wrong thing. They are maladapted to things that ruminants would be okay with. </p></div>		</li>
