			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but I think the idea behind the question is if the actual measured eclipse compared to the estimated version might help narrow in on the answer...like if diameter X predicted that City Y would be total vs non-total, it it turned out to be total, they could maybe adjust their diameter assumption.</p></div>		</li>
