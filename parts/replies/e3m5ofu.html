			<div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I'm wrong. I read in The Missing Microbes, (I think) that kids born vaginally (as opposed to c-section) pick up lactobacillus from the vaginal canal on their way out and that this is what helps give them better digestion of milk etc. Not saying that this means cunnilingus would have the same effect, but it confused me about the strains being different in healthy women.</p>
<p>I think it also mentioned that even without it, kids born via c-section catch up to kids born vaginally by the first 18 months.</p>
<p>So maybe it's not lactobacillus? Now I don't know.  I'm rambling and tired. But still interested....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent book.  It seems that c-section babies who receive an oral vaginal swab (Dr. wipes a cloth on the mother then puts the cloth in the baby's mouth) from the mothers can get at least some of the health benefits that they miss out on.</p>
<p>There was also some discussion on this (pro-biotic and germ transfer) being the reason that babies are born facing the mother's anus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s an episode on Radiolab called Guts that was pretty interesting - but one of the stories on there a scientist samples his feces daily for some set amount of time to see if the effects of probiotics are lasting and I believe he found them to be transient (effects lasting like a day). Haven’t listened to it in awhile though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. The stomach microbiome, once established is finely balanced, and not easily perturbed. Part of the reason engineered probiotics are a subject of interest is that they are transient. The idea being you introduce a bacterial species that overproduces a specific compound you wish to express, the compound is made, and the bacteria is carried away, so the dosage is not sustained. I wrote a grant proposal on this exact idea a few years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The medical literature have mixed reviews on this.  In general unless you're treating something like diarrhea associated from taking antibiotics, probiotics are probably unnecessary and might be harmful.  Some people suffering from IBS benefit from probiotics but again it is a condition being treated.  Healthy and well?  Probiotics are probably unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that in general foods that are not only fermented but still retain living colonies (rather than dead ones - like from heated and cooked sauerkraut which kills all the probiotics) can contribute to digestive health.  I don’t know if commercially available yogurt retains living colonies or if they’re pasteurized to become sterile. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on freshness, and quality. Most good name brand yogurts advertise live, and active cultures, and can be used to make more yogurt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the yogurt label they all* (many brands that I have read) say they contain live cultures.  &quot;Activa&quot; just advertises it as something unique - though I believe they have a special particular strain of lactobacillus.</p></div>		</li>
