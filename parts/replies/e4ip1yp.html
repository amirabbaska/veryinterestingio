			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be one point.</p>
<p>There are enough counterexamples of non-fire oxidation and things like catalytic oxidation that indicate fire is at least a macro scale event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fule/air composition and other factors. for example the quenching distance will be 0 if spontaneous combustion is possible in the mixture at that temperature. (a new ignition point can form after or even in the gap)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably also related to the ambient temperature. I have heard of early antarctic explorations that couldn't start fires because to much heat energy was lost to heat the fuel (wood) to the requisite temperature for combustion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered you, but I will too. The queening distance depends on the composition - the amount of fuel, oxygen, and nitrogen, and the type of fuel. It also depends on the temperature and pressure of the mixture.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jeffy_Weffy" target="_blank">Jeffy_Weffy</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. Also, a flame needs fuel and oxidizer. A liquid fuel injector doesn't have any oxidizer, and the fuel reservoir is at very high pressure so that oxidizer cannot enter.</p></div>		</li>
