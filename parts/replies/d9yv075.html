			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Yeah except ethanol is such a staple reagentand large-scale molecular sieves are still a rarity. Using a destillation column, another staple reagent and a literal metric ton of energy is the cruder, more managable way.</del></p>
<p>I get it. Molecular sieves as the state of technology have reached industrial scale plants. I stand corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the way we did it my lab during undergrad. Sieves are basically like super duper dried out little sponges (in layman's terms). You keep them heated for a ridiculously long time in order to make sure there's no water in them.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that for experiments that rely on high purity of ethanol, you pretty much have to use sieves unless you have a brand new bottle. You can't just reuse bottle that was at one point 100% ethanol because it will form the azeotrope from the water in the air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, that's incorrect.</p>
<p>The azeotrope is a point you can't distill past, because the vapor pressure of each component is the same at a given set of conditions (That's another way of saying they have the same boiling point).</p>
<p>What really happens is that water from the atmosphere will dissolve into your ethanol and lower the purity. The azeotrope has nothing to do with that. Once you're on the right hand side of the azeotrope, you should be able to distill the remaining water out. It might help if you looked at this graph of an azeotrope:</p>

<p>An azeotrope is a point you can't cross using only distillation of a 2 component mixture. As many people have pointed out, you can use a different separation method (molecular sieve) to cross the boundary.</p>
<p>Note: Methanol will do the same thing if you leave it open to the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to throw calcium in the ethanol and add till it stops fizzing. At that point calcium can still slowly react with ethanol but it forms ethoxide which reacts with water to ethanol and hydroxide.</p>
<p>Then you just distill off what you need.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, though whether that would mean increasing or lowering pressure depends on ethanol's and water's respective constants in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_equation" target="_blank">Antoine equation</a>. And in either case, you would end up in a diminishing returns situation as you tried to get closer and closer to 100% purity.</p></div>		</li>
