			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting part of Japanese infrastructure strategy -- their bridges and tunnels are often built on loans rather than through taxes. This means that crazy projects can commence without too much legislative and budget approval, but it also means that the tolls are often extravagant to cover the costs. </p>
<p>Japanese people consider this fair -- those who use it pay -- but more often or not too few people use them for their loans to be sustainable, let alone paid back. </p>
<p>I've been to the base of the Honshu end of the bridge before, and it's a truly colossal sight. There's also an observation deck tucked into the bridge's trusses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better than my town. The proposed building a toll bridge across the river. One of their associate's companies would build and maintain and profit from it. The current bridge that they recently built would still be free to use. In order to encourage the use of the toll bridge, the city council suggested adding a bunch of stop signs and other hindrances on the other side of the free bridge so people wouldn't want to drive across it. I did my best to vote this city council out, but I am only one man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how the tollways were first presented (at least in Illinois, though they are interstates so, idk if it went beyond here) and were promised to become freeways after they were paid for. Obviously, that last part never happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, people dont really use the bridge to commute to work or anything like that. Rent in that area of Japan is low so you just live and work on the same side and use the bridge just for day trips or travel purposes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary on the Golden Gate Bridge and it was all about the coefficient of expansion. The bridge structures were pre drilled in another state with the intention of putting the last bolt in place on a certain day with the most predictable weather temp of the year. On that day, the temp was right on and the bolt went right in. That had to be orgasmic to the engineer that slide-ruled that show.</p></div>		</li>

The bridge OP mentions has the longest center span in the world, but it's not the longest overall.</p></div>		</li>
