			<div class="markdown"><p>A common trait among people considered &quot;intelligent&quot; is that they usually think quicker than those who don't have that &quot;intelligent&quot; quality tagged on them by others.</p>
<p>In this context, the quicker thinking lets them evaluate something and realize, for example, &quot;if I yell at this person, it's not going to help.&quot;  Or &quot;getting upset is going to generate a lot of messy stuff that won't be beneficial to the goals involved.&quot;  And so on.</p>
<p>It's the speed with which they can clamp down on reactions that applies to this question, and gives some such folks the quality others view as &quot;less emotional.&quot;  They're usually very emotional, but are also very good at not letting it take over.</p>
<p>A person who can't react (mentally) as fast can let slip strong emotions, sometimes before they realize they didn't want to get that angry or happy or excited or upset or whatever.  A lot of folks will then say or think &quot;oh, sorry, I didn't mean that.&quot;  They did; they just didn't mean to <em>show</em> it.  And now they're reacting to having allowed that emotion to come out before they processed it and decided, before the yelling or scowl or whatever, they would have preferred to not have that visible emotional reaction.</p>
<p>Someone who thinks quicker is able to catch those reactions before they manifest, and hold them more internally.  But those emotions are still present.  Just not as visibly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just don't buy that. You can be highly intelligent in many ways but have poor impulse control. This explanation is lacking for that reason. I prefer the idea that there are different types of intelligence. You can be an emotional wreck, know what you are doing or how you are reacting is is irrational, but do it anyways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where did I use absolute terminology?</p>
<p>Further, I am in agreement there are different types of intelligence.  For example, when most people label someone else &quot;intelligent&quot;, what they usually mean is &quot;that person knows a lot of stuff.&quot;  Which actually has nothing to do with their mental abilities except for storage and recollection of data.</p>
<p>Some people might have a very poor memory, but think incredibly quickly.  Others might be bad at both recollection and speed, but have astounding creativity and ability to think at problems from unique angles that tend to work out successfully.  There are people who are amazing once they can put hands onto an issue or problem, but be completely unable to work it out analytically beforehand; and those who are the exact opposite.</p>
<p>And so on; including those who would usually start getting to where labels like &quot;super genius&quot; are being hung on them by others, who can do all of those things (and more besides) very, very well.</p>
<p>Intelligence is ultimately undefinable in a singular concrete manner, IMO.  The lay definition most people use, again, basically defaults to &quot;wow, that person knows a lot of stuff.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, conscientiousness which is more or less impulse control has no correlation with intelligence, the thread is repeating a popular misconception that Intelligent people have better impulse control, when that does not appear to be the case according to research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person diagnosed with Schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, You're entirely correct. Not impulsively acting on emotion is very different thant truly being devoid of, or not processing, emotions.</p>
<p>It makes maintaining social relationships very difficult and a huge drain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a disorder but I feel your frustration. I consider myself to be relatively intelligent compared to the average person and I have always been a person who thinks more logically about problems and situations rather than taking an emotional approach. My dad is a business man and always taught me that emotional decisions are generally not good decisions. I definitely have an engineer/accountants brain. This tends to irritate others, especially women who don't like when I reduce a situation to numbers which makes me seem cold and detached or not spontaneous. The reality is I can be a very emotional and adventurous person, I just keep those emotions in check so that I don't make poor life decisions and for the most part this has served me well. </p>
<p>I agree with the first post in that this is the perception because successful and intelligent people are just more self aware and in control of their emotional impulses. Vice versa this is what I feel is a big down fall in many people who aren't successful. I've witnessed it with my own friends. These are people who spend money on dumb things, get involved with bad people, have poor time management and habits, etc. they make decisions based on what will feel good but not necessarily what is right. To me it's like an addict who is always looking for that next hit of dopamine despite what impact it has on their life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;especially women&quot;, you mean &quot;especially my romantic partners or people I would like to be my romantic partners&quot;, then those people just aren't right from you. My thinking is exactly the same - I learned Economics when I was young and took Homo Economicus to heart - but my wife appreciates that quality rather than disliking it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really disappoints me to see this post with as many upvotes as it has. </p>
<p>Impulse control , emotional regulation, and intelligence are three different things, each governed by different portions of the brain. It is analytically possible to have high intelligence, poor impulse control, and poor emotional regulation. It is possible to have high and low capacities in any combination of those three. </p>
<p>A person with high intelligence, poor impulse control, and poor emotional regulation would score well on IQ tests. But the  damage to or inchoate formation of the emotional regulation portions of his brain causes him to experience unusually high stress. Because of the damage to or inchoate formation of the impulse control portions of his brain, he might drink or use drugs to cope with that stress, despite his high IQ. </p>
<p>A person with average intelligence, high impulse control, and poor emotional regulation might experience stress, anger, and shame as acutely as the first guy. But he's just smart enough to realize many uninformed people regard those who show emotions as stupid or weak. So he bottles up his feelings of stress, anger, and shame until he can't stand it anymore. Every few months he throws a self-destructive screaming temper tantrum, despite his normally subdued demeanor. </p>
<p>Any number of other combinations are possible, each with different social adjustment and personality outcomes. But advancing stereotypes like &quot;people who express their emotions must be stupid&quot; isn't just unhealthy. It's also uninformed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is not about an intrinsic quality of intelligence but rather the <em>perception</em> of intelligence in others.</p>
<p>The people we <em>perceive</em> as intelligent are those with extensive learning or certain types of practiced skills.  Poor impulse control interferes with acquiring these traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brothers were intelligent robots and have had terrible mental health problems. So have I but ive managed them better on my own than they have. I'd hate to think what I'd be like if I put myself under all the pressure and stress they put themselves through. I think I'm intelligent in gauging what works for me and what doesn't in life. They dont feel alive unless everyone's being impressed by what they do. I on the other hand don't mind being average if it means being sane.</p></div>		</li>
