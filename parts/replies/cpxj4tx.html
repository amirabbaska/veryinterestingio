<p>A broader multiverse theory states that the fundamental constants of Physics or even the basis of mathematics that we observe are just one point in a larger spectrum.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, although modern multiverse theory grew out of mathematics, the idea of countless worlds or countless repetitions goes back to the ancient mystics and is an important part of Hinduism for example.  This may have influenced mathematicians as well.</p></div>		</li>
