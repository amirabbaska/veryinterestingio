<p>The Southpark episode &quot;Ginger Kids&quot; is the origin for the &quot;no soul&quot; joke. Red-headed people have been given a pretty bad rap for quite a few centuries now, though. During the medieval ages, red hair was associated with moral degeneration, beastly sexual desire, and birth from unclean sex. They were the object of witch hunts, believed to have the mark of the devil, etc, etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>2005 E. Cartman, &quot;Thank you, Ms. Garrison. My speech is entitled 'Ginger Kids'. Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles. We've all seen them. On the playground, at the store, walking on the streets. They creep us out, and make us sick to our stomachs. I'm talking, of course, about Ginger kids.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
