			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, again, many assumptions, but new skin can't really go through a big, thick, dried-out scab.  Wounds heal in from the edges, so the better you can keep the wound edges touching and unobstructed the better you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wounds dont always heal from the edges. </p>
<p>I have a wound that is healing from the bottom up. </p>
<p>But it is a massive hole more than a wound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it better to pick the scab off as it starts forming? And according to other comments, it's even better to just glue it? </p>
<p>This is sort of TMI and embarrassing but I have SH scars that are huge and noticeable and now I'm wondering had I used glue if I would have saved myself some embarrassment in the future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on how bad the cut is. </p>
<p>If it's minor, just leave it alone. </p>
<p>If it's bleeding pretty bad you can elevate and apply manual pressure to stop the bleeding </p>
<p>If it's life threatening use whatever you can (clothes, towel, etc) as a make shift bandage, elevate and apply pressure and call 911 </p>
<p>In the field washing the wound is the least of your concern because if it's hospital worthy they'll clean it there and likely give you prophylactic antibiotics anyways. And if it's not bad enough to need stitches/hospital treatment you can clean and bandage later when you have the supplies available. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, if you can't wash it properly early on, try to keep an eye on it so, if it does get infected, you can get it taken care of well before it becomes dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Choose a better place to get cut, I guess?  :)</p>
<p>If you're not going to bleed to death, the next thing you need to worry about is preventing infection.  The next thing is the quickness of healing and the cosmetic outcome.</p>
<p>Pressure on the would with something clean until bleeding stops, then wash/dress as soon as you can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Duck tape is a decent alternative if you've got it, not sterile, but it applies pressure and keeps the cut closed, if you can put some cloth in there to absorb blood that would likely help too</p></div>		</li>
