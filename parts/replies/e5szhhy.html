			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is mind-blowing that humans can do that. I started playing guitar a few years ago, and for like the first 6 months I was awful and I thought I would never been very good at it. Now about 3 years later, I can play pretty damn well without even really thinking too much about it (provided I’m not learning something new). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I think learning an instrument is sooo important to children, besides all the benefits to mental stimulation, it teaches delayed gratification. “Hey this is new, you will be terrible and you will have to be terrible every day for a while before you’ll  get good at it”. Sports can teach this too but sports are almost too much like play. But learning that everything you try the first time you will be terrible until you keep at it is powerful. It gives one the understanding they can learn anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like muscle memory is much more applicable to physical movements like bike riding/instruments etc. when it comes to information, most of the time I can’t just read and remember. I have to write most stuff down if I want to memorize it. Often times when I write notes in a class, i end up not even needing them because writing  drills it into my brain, unless it’s math. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s pretty amazing. I can still perfectly play songs on the piano I learnt as a kid but have not actually seen the sheet music for in over 20 years. Ask me to write you down the notes from memory and I would really struggle, but sit me at the piano and let me play and the brain remembers.</p></div>		</li>
