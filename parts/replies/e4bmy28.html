<p>Keep this in mind. I'm so grateful that I knew this when my husband died. I kept talking to him in his last moments, and even after his pulse and breathing stopped. Hopefully the last things he heard were how much we loved him, and how happy he made us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad was dying of AIDS and me, a sixteen year old kid then, happened to have the sense to tell him, despite his own struggles, I was proud of the way he had raised me and loved him, deeply. </p>
<p>He hadn’t talked since he arrived five days before from the hospital for hospice. Had not eaten, could barely drink anything. Rarely blinked, never moved his head, just stared out the window.</p>
<p>I was not ready for the flood of tears that came from his eyes at that moment, when I told him those things.</p>
<p>He died the next day. I found out I was the last of his kids to say their goodbyes and nearly missed that chance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I did this. Reading all of these posts, especially this comment, just makes me feel so stupid, shitty, and empty.</p>
<p>I was 17. My dad broke his leg and ended up in the hospital. He had to have surgery on his broken leg to be able to walk again.  During surgery he had a massive heart attack, and was unconscious for a day or two before he woke up. He was hooked up to a breathing tube and just so many machines. But I kept thinking he was going to be okay - just being foolishly optimistic I guess. I didn't think he could die - he was my dad.</p>
<p>Then he had another heart attack, and coded. They performed CPR on him and brought him back to life. He clung on. They told us the only option at this point was for him to have surgery to put in a machine to help his heart pump blood for him, since his heart was so weak. After surgery we would talk about a heart transplant. I remember that afternoon so vividly. The translator was there and my dad could only blink, still with the breathing tube in his mouth. He had a piece of paper in front of him and he started scribbling something short - doing the same thing multiple times. Then we understood he was trying sign his name to agree to the surgery.</p>
<p>He had the surgery. I remember one of the the surgeons giving us a small smile as they wheeled his bed past us and back to his room. He was concious again two days after the surgery and in hindsight he looked exhausted. They decided to take his breathing tube out for the first time in about 12 days. I was there with him in the room that morning. Just me. He was trying with enormous effort to say 1, 2, 3, 4. I thought he was trying to count. So I counted with him. He shook his head slightly, then stopped trying to count. I didn't say anything to him. I just stood there watching over him. I didn't say anything. </p>
<p>That was the last time I saw him alive. He had another heart attack later that night and passed. I only realized earlier this year (10 years later) that he probably wasn't trying to count numbers. He probably wanted to know what day it was.</p>
<p>I only wish I was able to tell him how much I loved him and appreciated him. I never said it - we just never said that stuff in my family. Instead I just stood there silently and watched him lying there, thinking he was going to be OK. I just never got the seriousness of the situation even though I was 17 - and I really beat myself up over that now.</p>
<p>EDIT:
Thank you all for your kind words. I never speak aloud about my dad or share this part of my life since it's still pretty hard for me, even though it's been about 10.5 years now. I was very close with my dad. I just saw this comment and it made me cry since I remembered I didn't say a word to my dad while he was laying there. While I have a lot of good memories of my dad to think about, I always end up connecting it back to his death and how he must've felt so lonely and scared when he died in the middle of the night surrounded by doctors instead of his family. Your comments, esp the ones telling me he knew I loved him, are comforting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what I tell myself every day when I think about how my mom died. </p>
<p>She was only 60, long explanation of what happened to her, but in the end she was in a coma. </p>
<p>About a week before she died, she opened her eyes for the first time in over a month and (sort of) responded when I spoke. I say that because she had been looking at the ceiling and never looked at the nurses or anything. But when I got there, I talked and she looked at me. </p>
<p>I was so hopeful. But in the back of my mind I knew it most likely meant she was gonna go. </p>
<p>I talked to her. Told her I’d be fine (I was 34 at the time) and to go be happy (she was pretty religious and although I am not, I knew it would comfort her). </p>
<p>I keep hoping that she heard me telling her how much I loved her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely believe this.  My dad had ALS and was in hospice care for his last six months.  His doctor called me late one night and said, &quot;I think you need to be here.&quot;</p>
<p>He was asleep when I arrived (11PM), but woke up when I held his hand.  Couldn't talk at all.  Breathing super shallow with O2 dropping.  I sat and held his hand and talked to him.  I thanked him for the life he gave me.  I talked about the things we did together when I was a child.  His eyes tracked me and he couldn't say anything, but I was certain he was hearing it.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, and a short while later was in Cheyne–Stokes breathing and getting cyanotic.  I held his hand and said, &quot;goodbye, dad.  I love you.&quot;  A lot of people don't get to say goodbye.  In that respect, I feel lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad called me hours before his cancer finally won. He was upbeat, telling me that I needed to check the pool pump, asking to talk to his dog, and telling me he loved me. The whole day he had spent with family talking, causing a ruckus. He kept nagging everyone for a mango and a beer. Then a few hours later. Poof. He aspirated in his sleep, heart attack, his body just gave up. He got his damn mango in the end though, last meal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think when that happens, it's because the body has accepted its fate, and stopped fighting. And since your body is no longer fighting, you suddenly have a huge burst of energy that you didn't before, so you can spend your final moments able to enjoy what little time that you have left. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% accurate. </p>
<p>My father passed Feb 27th of this year at 90 years old. I watched every detail of his passing and stayed with him right to the end. </p>
<p>I knew it was minutes from the end when his lips turned blue and he yelled with his last breaths to &quot;slow down&quot; ( im assuming the room was spinning ) he also mentioned there was another man in the room ( I was alone with him. ) I let him grip my hands and spoke to him that he did everything a father could and to rest. </p>
<p>( I'm 29 btw... I was always there for him when health started declining ) </p>
<p>Didnt mean to rant. This post hit home for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lost my grandmother last August to ovarian cancer. She was basically my mother. I helped care for her till the end. I left the day before she died to go to work. A job I hated and quit right after she died. I'll never forgive myself for leaving. </p>
<p>She was a fiercely independent, lively, and pragmatic woman. She was the life of everything and didn't buy into superstitious shit. The hospice nurse said that sometimes people see dead loved ones before they pass. </p>
<p>She never told us if she did but she was always looking off into the corner like she was watching something leading up to her death. She would have never told us anything anyway. I think her mom came back to tell her to pass on. I miss her so much. I like to think that if I ever die in a similar situation she'll come back for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother had her adult children around her hospital bed as she was nearing death. For some reason, they all had left the room at one point, which was really unusual, and that's when she passed. The nurse said &quot;Sometimes they wait until they are alone to let go because they don't want you to bear that burden of watching their last breath.&quot; It was very kind of her to say, and it helped my mom and aunts and uncles feel--not good, but less bad that none of them was there for her last moment.</p></div>		</li>
