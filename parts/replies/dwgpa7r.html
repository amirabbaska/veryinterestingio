			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything far enough away to be redshifted, at present, to the point of being dimmed out of naked-eye view, is VERY dim and far away to begin with.  </p>
<p>These lights so far away are not discernable as individual stars, they are galaxies.</p>
<p>The &quot;dimmer switch&quot; that would stop turning-down the lights would stop, and the light will go full-blast ... At a rate of the speed of light FROM where the light source is.  The light already on its way (from millions of LYs away) is already &quot;red&quot; and humans will be probably gone by tue time a naked-human-eye effect could be seen.</p>
