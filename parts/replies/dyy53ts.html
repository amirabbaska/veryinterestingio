			<div class="markdown"><p>the sensation of itching is  a complicated thing that is not entirely understood. For instance, there are nerves that are known to detect both pain and itch, but there is also evidence in mouse models that there are different nerves that only detect itch.</p>
<p>the itch sensation is also processed and acted on differently than pain is. you scratch a bug bite or poison oak, but recoil from fire.</p>
<p>so the short answer is maybe, or more accurately, sort of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body doesn’t need excess tissue to be removed for healing (unless you’re talking about debridement, but it doesn’t sound like that). Often scar tissue and other replacements are stronger by certain metrics (/less elastic and functional by others). Think of callouses or tanning after repeated damage. Beyond that, your skin should still shed appropriately without addition scratching</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to research done in 2013 not really.  There are specific nerves for itching, but they do fall into the same class of nerves that feel pain.</p>
<p>There's a decent <a href="http://science.time.com/2013/05/23/solved-the-mystery-of-the-maddening-itch/" target="_blank"><em>Time Magazine</em> article</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6135/968/tab-figures-data" target="_blank">the <em>Science</em> research paper as well</a>.</p>
<p>From the <em>Time</em> article:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The classical view,” says Hoon, “was that a single class of nerve cells detected both itch and pain.” According to this theory, the type and intensity of the stimulus told the cells which sensory message to send up to the brain. The nervous system would then respond accordingly.</p>
<p>At one level, the theory is correct: pain and itch, as well as heat, are all transmitted by a class of nerve cells known as TRPV1-expressing neurons. When scientists use genetic engineering to create mice that don’t have these cells, the animals don’t feel any of those three sensations.</p>
<p>But over the past five or 10 years, says Hoon, research in his own group, and also what he calls “some beautiful work by others,” has shown that at a deeper level, the one-neuron-fits-all hypothesis is wrong. Evolution has evidently provided us with a subset of TRPV1-expressing cells, and it’s the ones in that specialized group that do the actual work of making us itch.</p>
<p>What makes these cells special, say Hoon and his co-author, Santosh Mishra, is that they, unlike their pain-sensing cousins, produce Nppb. When the skin is stimulated by a feather or a mosquito bite or a chicken-pox lesion or a drop of urushiol (the itch-inducing oil in poison ivy), a signal zips up to the other end the nerve cell where it triggers the release of Nppb molecules. The molecules leap across a gap, or synapse, to an adjacent nerve cell that carries the signal up the spinal cord toward the brain. All nerve signals travel this way, and all require neurotransmitting chemicals to vault the synaptic gap. But itching needs the particular assistance of Nppb to do that job.</p>
