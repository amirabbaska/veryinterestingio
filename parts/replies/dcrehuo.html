			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be a clue in relation to the geological record of oxygen abundance in the atmosphere. Arthropods evolved and were the top fauna in Cambrian to Silurian periods, when oxygen abundances were low. It wasn't until plants spread to the land in Silurian and Devonian time that oxygen abundances became more like they are today and in fact during the Carboniferous that were almost double today's levels, when insect sizes were huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, insects directly take in air from spiracles to tracheal tubes to supply oxygen directly to organs. Most insects do <strong>not</strong> use blood for respiration, except for some chironomid larvae or bloodworms (which have red color due to hemoglobin).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/21em8b/would_humans_be_able_to_survive_in_the/cgcbppv/" target="_blank">used to think</a> the same thing, until /u/StringOfLights <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/21em8b/would_humans_be_able_to_survive_in_the/cgciv67/" target="_blank">set me straight</a> two years ago by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not true. There is no pattern of increasing body size in insects alongside rising oxygen levels through geologic time. The giant insects we think of actually show up when atmospheric oxygen levels are highest and survive even as oxygen levels drop. So oxygen really doesn't explain their size.</p>

<p>In the same comment chain he had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/21em8b/would_humans_be_able_to_survive_in_the/cgcjmqp/" target="_blank">another insightful post</a> with more information. Check both of them out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. I don't doubt your evidence here.</p>
<p>I just remember seeing a study done where they increased oxygen in the environment in a controlled study and got bigger insects as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda off subject here, but how big were some of the insects?  I've seen drawings of dragonfly's that looked to be about a foot long but that's about it and I don't know how accurate that is.  Also is the Carboniferous period where we get most of our coal deposits from  Since there was lots of flora?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meganeura  (very similar to dragonflies) had &gt;2-foot wingspans. And there were huge millipedes, over 7 feet long.</p>
<p>There was lots of flora in the Carboniferous, but the main reason we get so much coal from it is that newly evolved compounds like lignin made it very hard for microorganisms to break down some of the plant matter. So more than normal was left to accumulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No we only have coal, for example, because fungi hadn't evolved yet during that period.  There would still be coal and oil deposits, but maybe less and significantly smaller deposits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are impressions of quite large dragonflies from the Pensylvanian in North America, U.S. The wingspan is about three feet. There is a spider as big as a man's head as well, and a milieped-like creature two meters in length. This latter left track ways as well as fossils of the critter itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I also believe hemoglobin has greater/wider affinity for competitive inhibitors, ie. other ligands that can bind instead of oxygen. Sometimes that's desirable</p>

<p>When might that be desirable? Just in certain medical situations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fetal blood might be an example. Human fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult versions plus the mother uses a small molecule to make her own hemoglobin more likely to release oxygen. Without it, the child would not be able to &quot;steal&quot; enough O2 from mommy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know why we don't keep the fetal form into adulthood? It seems like it would be overall more beneficial.</p>
<p>This is fascinating, btw. My kid's about to turn one, and I had no idea her hemoglobin was different from ours so recently.</p></div>		</li>
