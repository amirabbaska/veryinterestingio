			<div class="markdown"><p>The short length of the growing season and hard frosts out of season. In the time I takes to form new leaves, the growing season is almost already over, and late frosts could entirely kill of new leaf growth for an entire season.</p>
<p>Also because of the slow growth rate and frequent glaciation extreme latitudes tend to have poorer soils.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule though. Birches and larches are both deciduos trees that thrive in taiga environs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the rainfall patterns. There are many places with moderately cold winters that are conifer dominated because of a pronounced summer dry season. Most of the Pacific Coast of North America is dominated by conifers or mixed forests, there are very few ecosystems that are exclusively broadleaf in this area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna guess that the further north you are the less fertile the soil is.  It's only in fertile but dry areas that Deciduous trees thrive.  Otherwise evergreen (not just conifers) trees change the nitrogen levels of the soil to suit themselves instead of the Deciduous trees (which want more nitrogen).</p></div>		</li>
