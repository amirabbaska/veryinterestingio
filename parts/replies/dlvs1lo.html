			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's different for every person. Drugs can have a big effect. Plus, certain substances like DMT or LSD can have a huge impact on the consciousness resulting in an extremely different perception of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is there a way to make this the &quot;standard&quot; way a person experiences their life? It seems as though this would be pursued extremely passionately if it were a skill or talent acquired through practice. </p>
<p>Would also be the equivalent of switching from standard to hi-def, wouldn't it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Research has shown (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18408715" target="_blank">Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain</a>, <em>Soon et al</em> 2008 ) that decision outcomes are encoded into the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex of the brain before it enters the awareness of the subject ( up to ten seconds, according to the abstract ) which would indicate awareness and decision making on the subconscious level, meaning we're processing information <em>very</em> quickly on that level, but are unaware of it consciously, and <em>in my opinion</em>, (using a computer analogy) these operations are encoded &quot;close to metal&quot; and would be at the limit of neural transmission speed.</p>
<p>Arstila (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384265/" target="_blank">Time Slows Down during Accidents</a> <em>Arstila</em>, 2012)  argues that the flood of epinephrine during fight or flight causes changes in how we perceive time by altering the relationship between internal and external time - This, <em>in my opinion</em>, dovetails nicely into the research that has shown improved detail in memory due to norepinephrine release (<a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-6606-3-15" target="_blank"> Emotional enhancement of memory: how norepinephrine enables synaptic plasticity</a> <em>Tully, et al,</em> 2010 )</p>
<p><em>In my opinion,</em> this points to human perception being finer than we normally make use of, and is dampened through habituation between birth and young adulthood, and we only see the limits our perception when in situations that are &quot;fight or flight&quot; and cause a release of norepinephrine in the brain, which combined with changes in perception allow us to react in a way that might save our lives. </p>
<p>But by constantly flooding the brain with norepinephrine you would eventually overstress the body - a similar condition is Pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheochromocytoma#Signs_and_symptoms" target="_blank">here is a list of symptoms</a> and at best it would extremely unpleasant, and it would likely shorten your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, taking control of attention can have a smaller version of this effect. </p>
<p>However, in the trauma example, a person's adrenaline is pumping, and I don't know if it would be possible or healthy to replicate the trauma state without actual panic. </p></div>		</li>
