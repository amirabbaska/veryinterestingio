			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best of the top answers so far (account manager here).  Couple key points missed, though that may be down to a difference between American and Canadian lending practices:</p>
<p>1) Debt to Income Ratio (Total Debt Servicing Ratio up here in Canada): in addition to everything reporting on your bureau, you have to include your anticipated property costs.  That'd be strata/maintenance fees if you're in an apartment/townhouse complex, a monthly average of the annual property tax, and utilities like electricity and gas.  Especially in strata buildings, this is usually the second-biggest monthly obligation after the mortgage itself, and sometimes it's even larger depending on the size of the mortgage.</p>
<p>2) Appraisal: the amount loaned will be a percentage of the appraised value of the property, and never 100% -- hence the term 'down payment' you keep hearing.  I have no idea what's typical in the US, but up here 5% is the common minimum without some down payment helper program (ugh), and 20% is the preferred minimum because it doesn't require any extra insurance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>2) Yep, 5% is minimum for conventional mortgages. FHA is 3.5% down. VA and USDA loans can do 100% financing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CMHC has TDSR maximums dependent on beacon scores -- currently 42% for &lt;680 and 44% for 680+.  For conventional mortgages though, the TDSR max can vary from institution to institution.  For example, mine has set a hard cap at 44% for mortgage lending, but it's a soft cap for unsecured lending depending on the business case (beacon, income, net worth, total connection etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and it's beacon-dependent -- &lt;680 score it's 35%GDS/42%TDS, 680+ it's 39%/44%.  Kind of interesting though, CMHC still says on their website that it <em>should</em> be 32%/40%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, you don't happen to know why banks look at gross income instead of net income, do you? It's the same with apartments and it was the same when I had a car loan. I always thought net income would be a more reliable means of determining what someone could afford?</p>
<p>By these measures and from other calculators I've seen online, using gross income, my wife and I could afford a house upto the 200k dollar range, but I feel like that would be a strain if we only considered our net income. That never made sense to me, I would think banks are less prone to distribute risky loans. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: well damn, thank you reddit, got my answer and then some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to nitpick a bit... creditors aren't telling you what you can &quot;afford&quot; to borrow, they are telling you how much they would risk lending to you and at what interest rate. </p>
<p>In many cases, borrowers may want to consider borrowing significantly less than the &quot;maximum&quot; amount approved by their lender. So yes, if they are telling you they will lend 200k, and you think it would be a strain on your income, it very well could be. A general rule of thumb is that your mortgage payment should not take up more than 25-30% of your gross income, your mileage may vary.  Banks may offer loans reflect a significantly higher ratio of 40-45% or even more. There are plenty of people that shoot for the maximum, thinking it is a &quot;good debt&quot;, only to discover they are &quot;house poor&quot;, which basically means they are broke trying to pay for a mortgage they can't afford. There are also other unanticipated costs of home ownership that people don't factor in, which can raise the actual cost of home ownership much higher than just the cost of a mortgage. Your sewer has problems? That will be 4 thousand please. Your roof needs replacement 5 years later? That will be 15 thousand please. I could go on, but I'm sure you get the picture. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;house poor&quot; I've never heard that term before, but i like it.  Is there such thing as &quot;rent poor&quot;?  Where I live it's cheaper to have a mortgage than it is to rent.  Here I'm renting an apartment for $1100/month, but my friends are buying townhomes with a lot more square footage and their mortgage is $950/month including pmi and insurance. Most months I feel like I'm barely getting by, but the idea of putting my money into the equity of a house is more tempting than renting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it too comes down to how important your house is to your life. I work from home and don't go out much so I was happy to put more of my income toward my house since it's where I spend the bulk of my time. </p>
<p>On the other hands my friends who like to go out multiple times a week often keep their housing payments as low as possible since they want to have the funds to do that. </p>
<p>So long as you pay your bills and plan for the future, there really isn't a right or wrong way to do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mortgage underwriter here. Gross amount is used to level the playing field nationwide so things like different tax rates, paycheck withdrawals to insurance/401k/tax free daycare funds/ etc are not variables to consider for each borrower.....it basically is much easier to figure pretax pay than take home pay and compare it from borrower to borrower.</p>
<p>Think of it like this - if you were to ask someone how much they make, you would expect them to say $18/hr, not $11.763 per hour after taxes and deductions </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you on IBR? If so the latest Fannie Mae regulations require monthly student loans to be calculated as 1% (or possibly 2) of your total loan amount if your loan repayment plan will not fully amortize the amount due in the loan period. If you plan on doing IBR and loan forgiveness after 10 or 25 years your student loans won't fully amortize. Further, if your loan is not Fannie Mae conforming most banks won't lend to you (since they usually just sell the loan to Fannie Mae and can no longer do so). So for many people on IBR this puts their DTI way too high to qualify. I got rejected from several large banks due to this. My monthly student loan payments were less than $500 and I had a DTI of like 20%. With the 1% calculation my DTI was almost 100%. </p>
<p>I ended up going with a credit union as their rules are often more relaxed. Also credit unions will sometimes just take on the loans themselves and not sell it to Fannie/Freddie (therefore not needing to be confirming). I would recommend becoming a member of a local credit union if you are in this situation as they may likely be willing to make a loan work with a member. </p>
<p>I would also not trust the major banks to be completely forthright with all this information. One major bank fucked me by initially approving me for the loan and then backing out a week before closing due to the student loan calculations. Do your own research and don't blindly trust the bank's loan officer.</p>
<p>Edit: Full disclosure, I don't have a banking or finance background and didn't know how any of this worked last year. This is just stuff I learned and thought I'd pass on from my personal experience dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Based on comments below, it looks like Fannie Mae is changing the guidelines to so it is your actual loan payments. I would still recommend a good credit union. They were much easier to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know I almost had a heart attack when I got my mortgage application back a couple months ago with a nearly 50% DTI even though it was really only 20%--and even less if you consider that my grad school sends me a check for the student loan payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fannie Mae info you reference is no longer accurate. As of 4/25/17, they will now use the payment on the credit report (even if IBR) as long as the loan is in repayment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No IBR as I &quot;make too much&quot; (but live in a high cost city and have a large amt of student loan debt, thankfully less now than a few years ago). Don't plan on doing loan forgiveness as that's just a waste of money to wait 10-25 yrs with the rate of interest I have. My loan repayment amount was $1400/Mon but I've paid off a lot so it's now down to about $900/month. </p>
<p>Not Fannie Mae either - some private and mostly federal (and those were given over to Sallie Mae, or Navient as the like to call themselves now), plan on using something like SoFi once grad school finishes up this year. I'm a member of three credit unions but haven't found them to be much better in the student loan arena - one sold mine off to a shitty company.  </p></div>		</li>
