			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're going to be pedantic about it, right-to-work laws don't just affect how dues are deducted from pay or not; they also prohibit union-security agreements, which make union dues collectible in the first place even from non-members.  In states that allow union-security agreements, while there may be no &quot;closed shop&quot;, if you are compelled to pay the union anyway, then there is little practical difference from being in a closed shop to begin with.</p>
<p>&quot;What about Right to Work states?</p>
<p>27 states have banned union-security agreements by passing so-called &quot;right to work&quot; laws. In these states, it is up to each employee at a workplace to decide whether or not to join the union and pay dues, even though all workers are protected by the collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the union. &quot;</p>

<p>You might then ask what a union-security agreement is.</p>
<p>&quot;A union security agreement is a contractual agreement, usually part of a union collective bargaining agreement, in which an employer and a trade or labor union agree on the extent to which the union may compel employees to join the union, and/or whether the employer will collect dues, fees, and assessments on behalf of the union.[1]&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems to me this would resolve the issue. Don't pay, don't play.</p>
<p>Also, this would make possible having multiple unions at any given place. Free market's all about that competition, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies would pay the rats the rate and use them as sabateurs against the morale of unionized. But if we're going that far, it has to go whole hog. No weekend,  work day is sun up to sun rise, no shift differential, etc. Unions didn't just get us better money they got us better working and living conditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. But this is ELI5, yes? </p>
<p>Federal law is clear that employers are completely prohibited from agreeing to hire only union members (i.e., create a &quot;closed shop&quot;), but can agree to require new hires to either join the union <em>or pay agency fees without joining</em> (i.e., create a &quot;union shop&quot;). That choice can't be taken away from them. Employees don't have to join unions if they don't want to. They can only be forced to pay &quot;agency fees,&quot; and only if state law permits it.</p>
<p>Right-to-work laws don't permit it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.  This is ELI5.  Your quibble about the specific difference in exactly what happens in states with and without union-security agreements is indeed accurate, but then largely irrelevant to the question on the table, since the practical impact is almost identical.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I could double upvote this, then I would.  All of the other responses posted right now are wrong.  &quot;Right to work&quot; laws are not about forced union membership or at will employment.</p>
<p>To reiterate: they only prevent unions from collecting service fees from non-union employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the union.  The non-union employees get the representation service provided by the union for free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To ELI5 this, you must first realize that Republicans have always been anti-union.  Whether unions are wrong or not is beyond the scope of the ELI5.  What is certain, however, is that if the Republicans pass right to work in the states and eventually at the federal level, they will not stop there.  More anti union laws will be passed until eventually unions have no power.  To pretend right to work is designed to help employees who just don't like (read: understand) unions is disingenuous.  They are designed to help business owners/shareholders.  (I just got super dejavu writing this.)</p></div>		</li>
