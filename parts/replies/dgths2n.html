			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I know why she's doing it. Without going into detail, she had a lot of shit hit the fan within the space of a few months about a year ago (abusive relationship, death of a couple of very close people, health scare, a bunch of crap) and turned to food for comfort. She's gained a lot of weight in the last year because of it and just can't seem to stop herself. </p>
<p>I don't know how to help her. This is her own battle and all I can do is be there when she asks. I just don't want her putting herself through a fresh hell to escape another. I can't force her to go see a therapist or stop the pills. I'm hoping some of these responses help her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She's not going to get the body she wants even if she does lose fat. Losing weight this way leads to the skinnyfat look where she'll have stick legs and arms but a rotund belly from undernourishment, like the way starving kids in third world countries look. If she won't listen to health concerns, maybe she'll listen to vanity concerns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might work. She used to be in very good shape. Not just slim, but athletic. The last year has just been very hard on her. She's not dealing with things well. I'm just trying to stop her from making it worse. Vanity might work. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're a good friend. Just as long as she knows you're there for her, you're doing what you can. Sometimes just knowing someone cares helps a lot </p></div>		</li>
