			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting history about Okinawa: from 1945 to 1971, it was officially classified an &quot;Occupied Territory&quot; and was directly administered by the US military.</p>
<p>It was 'returned' to Japan, but I used quotes because a lot of Okinawa natives didn't see themselves as Japanese and had their own issues with what they deemed a Japanese occupation of the Ryukuyan lands.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of the animosity about the bases there is as much the US presence as it is resentment towards what they see as heavy handed policies cast by Tokyo with little input from the natives</p></div>		</li>
