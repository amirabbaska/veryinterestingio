			<div class="markdown"><p>Widely, I agree with you, though I wanna somewhat separate the notion of mirror neurons from &quot;Theory of Mind.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mirror neurons are, I believe, more closely related to &quot;Simulation Theory&quot; than to &quot;Theory of Mind&quot; Theory (aka, &quot;Theory Theory&quot;). On this account: through mirror neurons, we enact the same mental states the characters supposedly undergo, and so we relate to them, have shared affect, etc.  </p>
<p>Theory theory, on the other hand, would more so involve interpretation of linguistic information in a kind of theoretical way that does not entail sharing the same mental state attributed to the characters. It entails a kind of semantic or theoretical representation of the character, rather than an affective one: it involves understanding what the character is going through according to our understanding of how minds work generally, and so in that respect is &quot;cognitive&quot; (not to say explicit or available to reflection, though).   </p>
<p>There are also &quot;direct perception&quot; accounts of empathy that could be applied here, but I'm not particularly familiar with such accounts so don't want to misrepresent them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. The reader is, obviously, always a separate entity engaged in, at best, passive reception--dramatic surrogacy only takes one so far. We experience, in a limited way, what we imagine the characters affect to be; of course, direct, and therefore identical, affect is impossible. There always remains the subjective judgement and separation of the reader.</p>
<p>How is this relevant? Empathy, in the immediate experiential sense, of feeling it depends on a person ability to &quot;read&quot; another in context of the situation. That said, a person, like a reader brings with them their judgements, history, etc.  The only difference being one of intention and interpretation. A reader intends to engage and, due to the nature of fiction, often is willing to suspend certain judgements.</p>
<p>This has gotten messy with theory though at this point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Makes sense. I read Heart of Darkness not too long ago and there little in it that was relatable to my life experiences yet I felt like I was there in the jungle and trying to understand the motivations of the characters.</p>
<p>Or am I way off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I think that's pretty much right. Theory Theory does not always have to be explicit - we have all sorts of implicit theories all the time, about just about everything. But, it can be explicit. What is important is that your understanding of someone else is determined through some sort of process of reasoning (perhaps subconscious) based on a kind of theoretical understanding of how the mind works. So, for example, if you were trying to understand these character's motivations in terms of what you believe typically motivates people - or even certain types of people, or specific actions - that would be a theory theory of mind. If, on the other hand, you tried to understand these characters by stepping into their shoes - by trying to feel what they felt, or even by subconsciously feeling what they felt (a kind of sympathy) - then this would be a &quot;simulation&quot; (the idea being that you simulate their mental state within your own mind). </p></div>		</li>
