			<div class="markdown"><p>They're actually not terribly complicated: the tricky part is that your garage will have too much air for the electrons to get very far. The cheap way around that problem is to enclose the electron gun in something airtight and use a pump to suck the air out. The expensive way is to send your electron gun to outer space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue on this train of thought, if you don't have a neutralizer in the exhaust flow of an ion engine, you will eventually get those ions attracting back to the spacecraft (at least in a closed system) due to that build-up of charge, which will start to cancel the thrust as they pull on the spacecraft. Those ions will also start to cause damage to the thrusters and the spacecraft as they hit things like the solar panels or the sensitive instruments, in general its just not a great time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a heads up for people who might be looking for more info in the literature. We usually don't call that an electron gun but rather a cathode. The most used technology is the hollow cathode. They can get you very high currents (100A) in a very compact package and with a very small energy cost.</p></div>		</li>
