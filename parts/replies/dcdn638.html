			<div class="markdown"><p>Bohr's model was actually designed to answer the problem you just mentioned. When scientists (Planck) realized that atoms only emitted specific quantities of radiating energy after being energized, Bohr changed Rutherford's model to show why that might be. That's where we got the idea that an electron can be at, say, N1 and N2, but not N1.01, N1.02, etc. Bohr's model wasn't perfect, but it did present a solution to the stability issue that was found in Rutherford's model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not really. bohr introduced a quantisation condition int p dq = nÄ§  so you get discrete orbits but the model still assumed the particle is on a circular trajectory. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Stable states will normally not have probability current.</p></div>		</li>
