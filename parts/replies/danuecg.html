<p>The current is still passing through your body to ground so it is not acting as a shield like a faraday cage.</p>
<p>Plus when you start going to high voltages that are capable of ionizing it's path, weird things can happen.  For instance, your skin is acting as a resistor to keep the current low, but the high voltages could ionize the air around the path enough to find a cut or abrasion that offers very low resistance to another fork of energy and now the current is suddenly magnitudes higher.  If you watch super high speed footage of lightning you can see it is branching and looking for the lowest resistance path to ground and when it finally connects is when you get the large flash and boom.</p>
<p>In this case your demonstrator had current limiters installed that keep things very low so as not to worry.  But that's usually why the answer is what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, you have what is known as the &quot;skin effect&quot; when dealing with high-voltage, high-frequency energy such as produced by a Tesla coil. This is the tendency of the current to flow over a conductor rather than through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the skin is more resistive, maybe it's spreading the voltage applied across the body, akin to making you a huge conductor as opposed to the vast majority of current passing through a narrower path in the body.</p></div>		</li>
