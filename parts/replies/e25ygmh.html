			<div class="markdown"><p>Its no longer a hypothesis. The last article that i can find stating that it is a hypothesis is from 2010. In some of Dr. Hallowell's research (Considered the #1 leading doctor on ADHD) it was confirmed. Trying to find it right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a part of it, and IIRC the specific part of the brain that's impacted is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex" target="_blank">Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a>. </p>
<p>Its functioning at a diminished capacity and Stimulants well... stimulate that part of the brain to work a little harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes and no. ADHD affects alot of the brain from develop in the womb to fully grown adult brain. As much as 80% of the brain is different from a neurotypical person. There are quite a few videos and papers i have read about it. I can share them in the morning after im on a computer.</p>
<p>Edit: just looked at the wiki page. It affects a majority if not a supermajority of the prefrontal cortex too. But yes ADHD severaly affects this area.</p>
<p>Edit2: <a href="https://adhd-institute.com/burden-of-adhd/aetiology/neurobiology/" target="_blank">here is a pretty great sourse</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the stimulants provide the dopamine to the brain so the brain can quit focusing on finding stimuli wouldnâ€™t opiates/opioids have a similar effect? </p>
<p>Reason I ask is because I (38m w/adhd) ever took opiates, where other people would pass out or get numb and relax, I felt like a machine, I was able to focus and work way more efficiently. </p>
<p>I suspect this is why so many people with adhd that goes untreated end up abusing drugs, essentially self medicating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stims dont provide the dopamine. They just &quot;encourage&quot; more to be made than &quot;normal&quot; which would then depending on dosing and tolerance try to be around a neurotypical person would be. Ill find my sourses for this in the morning. My currently in bed bored and probably going to moblie reddit for another few hours, and i dont want to wake my wife. (Personal opinion here: having a wife is almost as effective as a motivator and a stimulate as meds, just in different ways, for me that is)</p>
<p>Also for the focusing part, does it feel like you have a bunch of tv's on all at the same time (10+)? Then someone turns all but 2 or 3 off and you can think, listen, speak normally without tripping over yourself, focus on 1 task but not hyper focus and forget everything else? If it s like that, i would suggest you talk with a doc about vyvanse if your looking for something that is quite modern and effective. And also that is your brain doing what i like to call &quot;syncing up&quot;. There is a fancy term and medical explanation for what happens. But for my story of ehat hapoens is that its you have 3-5 parts of your brain working at different speeds. And the meds speed up the parts that arent going as fast as some of the others, because they just are not being stimulated enough naturally. Like driving a V8 car but only engaging 1-2 pistions in the engine. The meds engage the rest of the mind that is below where it needs to be and then your firing on all cylinders so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the same effect with opiates. It's kinda like taking a stimulant in reverse, so I'd feel super mellow and focused instead of alert and focused. More like the few and far between times I could get into a flow state without medication. </p>
<p>Opiates only ever slowed me down like others if I combined them with alcohol, barbiturates, or benzos, or if I took waaay too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>have you tried kratom for working?  those greens are dope for super intense brain work, and dont keep you up all night like an adderal. although getting the dose right is tricky, and taking too much fcking <em>sucks</em></p>
<p>note: it can be habit forming for some, so as with anything DYOR </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically you want to be at a certain level of dopamine for stuff like working memory to function correctly. Adderall increases your dopamine level. If it was too low to begin with, as in ADHD, this will take you to the level of normal functioning. If it was correct to begin with, adderall would pt you outside the optimal levels of dopamine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been telling people this like it's the gospel -- have I just been spreading potential bullshit?</p>
