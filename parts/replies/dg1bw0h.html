<blockquote>
<p>Courses numbered 0000 through 0999: Non-credit courses and courses that are offered to non-matriculated students (such as CIEP). </p>
<p>Courses numbered 1000 through 1999: Introductory, elementary, and general education courses that are appropriate for first year students and others with no special background. A course in this series will have few if any prerequisites. </p>
<p>Courses numbered 2000 through 2999: Lower level undergraduate courses; those that ideally are taken by second and perhaps third year students. These courses might build on materials and knowledge from the 1000 series courses and may have prerequisites. </p>
<p>Courses numbered 3000 through 3999: Upper level undergraduate courses, courses for majors, courses which require significant prerequisites. </p>
<p>Courses numbered 4000 through 4999: Advanced upper level undergraduate courses including seminars, advanced independent study courses, honors thesis work, etc. </p>
<p>Courses numbered 5000 through 5999: Introductory graduate or first year graduate courses.</p>
<p>Courses numbered 6000 through 6999: Upper level graduate courses. </p>
<p>Courses numbered 7000 through 7999: Doctoral courses. </p>
