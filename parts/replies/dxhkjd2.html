			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really creating a true vacuum, but rather reducing the volume of the gas. When the can is hot, the gas expands. But when the can cools down, the gas volume decreases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't exactly create a vacuum, but the temperature drop causes the pressure the gas is exerting to decrease substantially. The resultant drop in pressure, means the atmospheric pressure outside the can is  much greater than inside the can, and so there is a lot of force pushing on, and trying to crush the can from the outside, and not so much force pushing back from inside to prevent crushing the can. </p></div>		</li>
