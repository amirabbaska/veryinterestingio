<p>And cats like it.  A lot of treats and toys have catnip in them without the ability to purchase the toy/treat without it, so it's just kinda part of their normal toy.  The catnip wears off over time from what I can tell though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all cats like it. My cats get very angry and fight with each other really badly if we give it to them so we don't. Normally they are very happy cats that are very friendly with people and each other but catnip brings violence. It's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>here are a couple of reasons</p>
<ol>
<li>there no evidence showing any extreme negative effects</li>
<li>most people give there cat dried catnip so they don't know this but if many cat's prefer to eat the catnip plant which actually helps relax them, I do this with my old cat who has arthritis.</li>
<li>catnip is a natural replant to insects having them rub against it or eat it is good for them which might explain an evolutionary component to why cat's like it.</li>
