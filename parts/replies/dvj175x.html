<p>(shrinking back to non-pregnant size)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those curious, a non-pregnant sized uterus is about the size of a chicken drumstick. A pregnant-sized uterus (immediately after the baby is removed in a c-section) is about the size of a grapefruit.</p>
<p>Fallopian tubes are about the width of a pencil / two inches or so long; and ovaries are about the size of a pecan.</p>
<p>*all of the above can vary per individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Source: I'm a surgical tech -- c-sections and the removal of the above organs are all pretty routine here. Handling those organs while they're still on the sterile field is one of my responsibilities.</p>
<p>The actual sizes of all of them was a bit of a mind-blow the first times I saw them. Those diagrams you had to color in anatomy class are a lie (portraying everything as ridiculously huge and improportionat to each other).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I’m an ER doc and didn’t realize that ovaries are the size of a pecan. I’m sure that’s part of the reason they’re best evaluates with a trans vag ultrasound instead of CT scan. Not to mention US let’s you see blood flow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? It's amazing how quickly it shrinks considering it was so huge for so long.  I never would have guessed that the Fallopian tubes are as thick as a pencil, I would have thought for sure they are about as thick as the taped end of a shoelace.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found this photo of a uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and cervix! CN for gore: <a href="http://gynogab.blogspot.com/2012/04/uterine-surgery-pictures.html?m=1" target="_blank">http://gynogab.blogspot.com/2012/04/uterine-surgery-pictures.html?m=1</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure if this size is accurate for most people, since most pics of removed uteri were enlarged or had other problems, but it seemed the most accurate of the photos I found. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do searches for the surgical cases that involve the anatomy in question, you'll find some pics and footage of the real thing.</p>
<p>Hysterectomy for uterus; oophorectomy for ovaries; salpingectomy for the tubes. Though, usually the tubes and ovaries come out in the same case, which is a salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>
<p>Another fun tidbit: the ovaries don't just hang out at the ends of the tubes as shown in most of those diagrams - they are their own distinct structure. The tubes do interact with them, but not 100% of the time. </p></div>		</li>
