			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a couple of different reasons for this. Physical symptoms are extremely common in depression, but they are always secondary to the emotional symptoms. Since this is ELI5, let’s just say that, if you ignore your body’s needs long enough, it will start making new (psychosomatic) symptoms to get your attention. You’ll literally start to feel it affecting your body, even if you don’t have any previous medical conditions. Also, depression biologically alters the brain to interpret pain differently.</p>
<p>Depression is highly stigmatized and many many people choose to ignore or minimize depressive symptoms. Mild depression should be treated as a cold. You get a cold, ideally you should change your eating and sleeping habits until you’re feeling well again. If you ignore a cold-symptoms, they could turn into something much worse. People who are depressed are typically eating comfort food and rarely getting any exercise and face time with others. Physically, your body will eventually “cry for help” simply due to lack of essential nutrients and activity. Loneliness and feelings of hopelessness will also hasten the process.</p>
<p>On a purely biological level, let’s simply consider the neurotransmitters involved in depression (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine). These neurotransmitters literally regulate our mood and control how we respond to pain, so low levels of these in depressed individuals are likely to cause a pain response that is maybe out-of-proportion to reality, and not due to any medical condition. More importantly, the severity of physical pain is usually correlated with the severity of emotional symptoms, so someone who is acutely suicidal may experience pain differently than someone who is simply “down in the dumps.”</p>
<p>The physical pain that accompanies depression is both habitual and biological. Reported symptoms of depression are also different across cultures (and between children and adults), which has led to some grave misdiagnoses. It is extremely common for depression to be described as physical pain, rather than emotional dysfunction (more often in collectivistic cultures). It is important for mental health professionals to know the difference when making a diagnosis and treatment plan for someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So.... I have ADHD and anxiety. I take meds for both. This might be a dumb question, but if anxiety and ADHD limit the same neurotransmitters, why don’t I just take 1 antidepressant instead of 1 ADHD and 1 anxiety? And how can someone have ADHD and anxiety but not depression if the chemical imbalance is the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll give this a shot...with some reluctance. When I think ADHD, I think of (1) inattention and (2) hyperactivity/impulsivity. There are different stimulant meds for ADHD, but they may target different neurotransmitters (dopamine and norepinephrine). A norepinephrine imbalance is responsible for attention deficits, while a dopamine imbalance causes the impulsivity/hyperactivity. Unless the ADHD is severe, people usually present as predominantly one over the other. In fact, most people can “grow out” of the hyperactivity by learning and practicing social skills, and have only inattention problems...but I digress.</p>
<p>Although anxiety partly involves a norepinephrine imbalance, it is also heavily linked with a serotonin imbalance (serotonin is important for regulating mood). So while stimulants can help even out norepinephrine and dopamine levels, they don’t necessarily do the same for serotonin. OCD is a good example of a disorder that involves a lot of anxiety that is treated well with an SSRI antidepressant.</p>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressants are sometimes used as a secondary intervention for ADHD, but there’s still a lot that’s unclear. Tricyclics also come with a lot of side effects (especially compared to stimulants). My guess is that your ADHD and anxiety are treated separately with different meds because that is the safest/most comfortable regimen for you (side effects are different for everyone).</p>
<p>To address your last question, I think the difference between having anxiety and depression simply comes down to what combination of serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine. You’re right in noticing that these disorders operate with the same neurotransmitters, and both anxiety and depression can be treated with antidepressants. In your case, it sounds like you may experience anxiety from a serotonin imbalance and ADHD from a norepinephrine imbalance, and that’s why you have to take the two separate meds instead of the one. Definitely not a dumb question...hope I was helpful.</p></div>		</li>
