			<div class="markdown"><p>Congress is really good at fishing. The house investigated Clinton on the whole sex thing, but that wasn't even illegal. Because of what he said during the investigation, they got him for lying to congress. The senate acquitted him, but the point remains. With a scandal and enough political will, they can absolutely come up with something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Impeachment is whatever Congress wants it to mean. The power for he House to bring a charge and the power for the Seante to convict is absolute and unreviewable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it can.  The opposites of those two words are &quot;narrow&quot; and &quot;nonspecific&quot;.  A broad, yet specific example is &quot;water&quot;--it covers rain, lakes, oceans, ice, tap water, and much else, but there is no question about whether or not something is water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: In the Philippines, during the Marcos reign, a huge protest was made to get him out of office and it worked. </p>
<p>Would that work in the U.S. if people band together like that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically Congress has the only authority to remove the president from office, but if the protests were large enough (and involved enough voters from rural districts as well as urban), they would probably do it to appease their voters.  I'm sure that there would be a lot of discussions and horse trading behind closed doors beforehand, and they would wait until the most politically advantageous time.</p></div>		</li>
