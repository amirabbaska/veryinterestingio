The first can be done if the molecule is similar to other toxic compounds or is highly reactive. But you can't look at a molecule and know that it's safe, because there are so many receptors within the body that have not been characterized. Until tests are done with cell culture or living organisms (and even after that, sometimes), you can't know if there is a safe dosage. We just don't know enough about all the proteins in the human body yet.</p>
<p>If the software you're using had never seen a toxin like amatoxin, which is produced by death cap mushrooms, would it be able to predict that it is dangerous? Amatoxins are just a sequence of amino acids, like every other protein in the body. However, they are a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II and cause liver failure at 0.1mg/kg.</p></div>		</li>
