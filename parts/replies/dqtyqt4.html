			<div class="markdown"><p>The Los Angeles basin in particular is a deep bowl that's been opening up and filling up with sediment from the nearby mountains for millions of years.  <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/fs086-02/images/log.jpg" target="_blank">This site</a> includes a shallow drill core made near Long Beach: under the sand, it's all compressed and solidified shoreline sediments (old remnants of beach, river, tidal flats, etc) for at least a quarter mile down, probably much farther.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost always the types of stone you find above shore are what's in the water, just so happens that the water has eroded them into something else or deposited something else on top of them, which may or may not be different than the wind did above the water line. You'd probably find exactly the same type of terrain and stone you find in the mountainous area ~40 miles south east of that if you dug down in both spots.</p>
<p>You have to remember the ground wasn't always in that configuration, it moved to that position and elevation over time, and other than erosion there's not many mechanisms to change the rocks at the top of the crust of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to ask &quot;how far out into the ocean&quot;. There are many archipelagos we could be talking about or actual continents. There is no one &quot;beach&quot; scenario considering that there are millions of miles of beaches all around the globe with many different bases.</p>
<p>I mean, when you get down to it, it's plant life, ocean life, volcanic rock at hugely different degrees with hugely different ways of forming. </p>
<p>It's all just basically the same things with different levels of age or pressure depending on where you are in relation to fault lines and underwater volcanos and where the ocean used to be before the ocean levels became higher. </p>
<p>Here's the map of Florida before the end of the last ice age. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/e3/e9/f9e3e9b70e9c2930ef87413a9713f313.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/e3/e9/f9e3e9b70e9c2930ef87413a9713f313.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its certainly possible at 3-30 meters to find a layer of sandstone or more likely, fragments.  But as noted earlier, there are a wealth of factors, like deposition rates/sources, geolocical processes like vulcanism, earthquakes, subduction, marine transgressions and regressions, orogenic cycles, etc.</p>
<p>You've seen fine, sandy beaches and certainly  craggy, solid-rock covered beaches as well.  Over a period of geologic time, sand and limestone may be deposited on top of the rock, via sea level changes, erosion, or other processes.  Conditions like wind, current, deposition rates and time all factor into the depth of the sand.  </p>
<p>A geologist would be better suited to ballpark a question like this if he or she had information on the location of the beach.  Otherwise, there are too many variables. </p></div>		</li>
