			<div class="markdown"><p>It would offer advantages, perhaps in cases where the patients vascular system had problems maintaining pressure.  Has all the problems facing larger artificial hearts with an additional restrictions placed on packaging.</p>
<p>You wouldn't actually need a pump or a turbine.  A simple one-way flow valve could assist a leg vein in pumping depleted blood uphill from a leg for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah.  A turbine heart already wouldn't have separate systolic/diastolic pressures, but a whole system of them would allow for the operating pressure to be even lower, since it doesn't have to go all the way through the body and back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The veins in your legs already have valves! If they are failing, you have varicose veins. Also, the skeletal muscles in your legs help push blood upward, which is why people who stand very still for a long time (cashiers, bridesmaids, etc) can be prone to fainting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably exactly what the first hearts were.  Just enough to get circulatory fluid moving in a vaguely consistent direction.</p>
<p>That works for a single channel with slow-moving contents.  Our circulatory system is massive and fractal.  I think you'd have to &quot;muscle up&quot; a huge chunk of it to provide enough pressure to get fluid to every last nook and cranny in a timely fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is the inevitable solution to shear in the artificial units. A single pump has to push too fast and swirls the blood too much, but if you could get multiple pumps, say one to the head, one for the organs, one to each extremity, then they could move blood pretty slow and still suffice. That's basically what the heart does but it regulates by varying vessel size and stuff instead. They can all share a master exchange for oxygen and have some sort of failover where they can take over some work for each other in event of failure.</p></div>		</li>
