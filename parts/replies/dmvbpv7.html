			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived the first 32 years of my life in the UK before moving to Canada. I must agree I prefer the UK plugs not only because of the safer earth connection but they also seem more robust. The 'prongs' don't bend if the cable is yanked while it's in the outlet and also they seem to fit nicer in the outlet in terms of sturdyness. Plugs in Canada seem to easily fall out when a small bit of force is put on the wire. Also more or less every outlet in the UK had its own on off switch unlike Canada where it's a constant live socket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was part of the design considerations and directly leads to the Plug of Doom^tm found on floors at 00:30 with the lights out.</p>
<p>They're designed with the pins coming out at 90 degrees to the cable so that if the cable gets caught in something the plug will <em>stay</em> in the socket - the force will be a shear force on the plug pins, which are quite hefty compared to other plugs, so it'll bind in the socket. Might not be terribly healthy for whatever's on the other end of the cable but that is not the plug designer's job.</p>
<p>Reading up on the design decisions is actually quite interesting; there's very little in the UK socket that's there by happenstance or accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Schuko has all the safety in a smaller, less clumsy and ugly package. You can also plug it in upside down and you don't have to have the cord leave the plug on the side. And a small one exists, too! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does schuko have a fuse, and if so how does it know which wire is the live so it can interrupt it?</p>
<p>Having a plug with a known location for the live wire is useful in designing safer appliances. </p>
<p>Also, wires leaving the socket and traveling directly down the wall is useful to avoid trip hazards and accidental pull outs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a few months in Sweden using the EU style and I seem to have had many more experiences of plugs not fitting sockets due to damage/bent pins. Might have just been bad luck though.</p>
<p>I'd have to call you out on the 'ugly package' though. I think the UK style is way nicer. Simple, chunky, classic.</p></div>		</li>
