			<div class="markdown"><p>I consult for our local gas and electric utility.  Every cable we put in below a body of water is in conduit these days thanks to the ease of horizontal direction drilling.  We even do it for just about any cable under roadway now too so the cable can be replaced without digging up the road.  And almost all the new streetlight cable is in conduit since it tends to get struck more and fault more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I work for a local electric utility company. Everything we put in now is in conduit as well, even though it derates the cable. However, if a cable is failing, it's likely older cable, and 20 years ago the conduit wasn't as common. You often never know what you'll find. :)</p></div>		</li>
