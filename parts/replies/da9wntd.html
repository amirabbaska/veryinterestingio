			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid growing up there was a popular TV show featuring a kid with Down's Syndrome, Corky, on Life Goes On. He appeared to breath from his mouth. Just how he delivered his lines, he sounded out of breath while breathing from his mouth and talking. At least in my experience &quot;a retarded mouth breather&quot; was a common insult. God jr high kids are fucked up.</p>

<p>No one breathes through both nostrils at once anyways. Our brain switches between them. Breathing through one nostril is literally the most amount of nostrils you can even breathe through</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's not true. Your two nasal cavities have differential rates of air travel to avoid damaging either or due to dehydration. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The nasal cycle is an additional feature of normal nasal physiology. This cycle causes turbinate hypertrophy to periodically alternate between the 2 sides of the nose, causing periodic unilateral obstruction approximately every 3 hours. A computational nasal air-conditioning model developed by White et al indicated that during the nasal cycle, the airway that conducts most of the airflow, and with it, most of the transfer of heat and water mass, undergoes some airway surface liquid dehydration, while the other airway maintains enough hydration to allow continuous mucociliary clearance.</p>
