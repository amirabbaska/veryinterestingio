			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like IPv4, MD5, or DES. They were designed at a time where certain needs made them ideal and there weren't many problems. As time goes on, they start to be less effective as we have more computers and faster processors, but you can't just stop using them, they need to slowly be phased out. IPv4 is a great example because it creates many problems for the internet, and it slowly gets phased out as we start using more IPv6 enabled devices.</p></div>		</li>

Your brain will always prefer to use sugar as a fuel source. It's just we have an abundance of food now, so overconsumption is too easy.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“Bacteria within the gut are manipulative,” said Carlo Maley, PhD, director of the UCSF Center for Evolution and Cancer and corresponding author on the paper. “There is a diversity of interests represented in the microbiome, some aligned with our own dietary goals, and others not.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s a two-way street. We can influence the compatibility of these microscopic, single-celled houseguests by deliberating altering what we ingest, Maley said, with measurable changes in the microbiome within 24 hours of diet change.</p>
<p>“Our diets have a huge impact on microbial populations in the gut,” Maley said. “It’s a whole ecosystem, and it’s evolving on the time scale of minutes.”</p>
<p>There are even specialized bacteria that digest seaweed, found in humans in Japan, where seaweed is popular in the diet</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also why the concept of dessert is important. A scoop of ice cream can be very satisfying if eaten after a meal. It's not satisfying when eaten as a meal. But these days it's pretty common for people to essentially do just that. Whether it's ice cream or food whose nutritional profile might as well be. </p></div>		</li>
