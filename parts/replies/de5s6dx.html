			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I like human hugs and all, but when my dog sits on my lap and puts her head on my shoulder like she's hugging me I feel like I can never be sad again.</p>
<p>She's a good girl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxytocin is a bonding hormone/brain development stimulation, among other things. It is released when your mother holds you to breast feed, and for her as well, that you would bond with your child/parents. I feel like this is why we have it, and it's the same trigger skin to skin contact with people.</p>
<p>I researched it when they were inducing my first born child's birth. You get an IV of oxytocin, apparently that promotes labor. Also, it is suggested that oxytocin is responsible for ethnocentrism, which still makes sense. We get all this oxytocin to bond with our mother and father who look like us, so we've bonded with our own kind, black folks are different and I never had a black woman breast feed me. Obviously it can be overcome, since it doesn't only hairball in infancy. It seems logical from a survival pov as well, it increases or chance of survival to be weary of people who look substantially different, since they aren't part of our tribe. They are likely enemies. I mean in a historical context, at this point we are global and the tribal thing is pretty much extinct</p></div>		</li>
