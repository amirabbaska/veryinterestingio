<p>If you could instantly turn all of the mass to energy, and somehow keep it all together in the same space the object occupied, this energy would have the same gravitational attraction as the object it came from.
Both mass and energy contribute to the gravitational attraction of an object.
Realistically, the gravity field of your object would disperse in a roughly spherical pattern as all of that energy expanding at high velocity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that most of the mass of ordinary matter comes from the binding energy of the nucleons, so it is already the case that the gravity we feel mostly comes from energy, not rest mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has it not been proven yet that all mass is just binding energy?  At the very least I feel like I read a hypothesis that there is no massive particle that is fundamental.  That if it is massive then it must be made of smaller mass-less particles and that its mass must come from the binding energy of those particles.  Maybe that was just from some unsubstantiated string theory article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it more accurate to say that the rest mass comes mostly from the binding energy of nucleons, as opposed to the sum of the masses of the individual electrons, protons, and neutrons?</p>
<p>Just goes to show. There's no point in making a distinction except to make things easier to talk about. Mass is energy is mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think so, yes. I really hadn't considered distinguishing between &quot;rest mass&quot; and &quot;sum of masses of constituent particles&quot; before thia post, but they seem to be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of electrons, protons and neutrons itself, most of the mass is due to the binding energy of the gluons (subatomic particles).</p>
<p>In that way mass really equals energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Yes<br />
Long answer: Hotter objects have higher pressure, all else being equal. This in turn increases pressure or strain and thus gravity.</p>
