It when into his jaw bone and the bacteria was starting to travel up to his brain. People don’t understand how important it is to take care of your teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Head and Neck surgeon here. This! I can not stress this enough. Keep your teeth clean and get cavities dealt with. If these infections get bad they can and will kill you. They can lead to severe deformity due to the surgical interventions needed to keep you from dying, or you might end up with a tracheostomy (hole in your throat to breath through. </p>
<p>The worst case, who survived, I've dealt with recently required my team to remove all of the tissue from this person's jaw bone and out. (picture two face from the new batman but much worse) They miraculously recovered which was really amazing. However, now they can't open their mouth more than a centimeter or eat anything more than smoothie consistency.</p>
<p>TLDR: bad teeth = bad time

If things are going wrong better to deal with it earlier rather than later, a competent medical professional should be able to tell you where things are heading without sensationalism or profit seeking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have an impacted wisdom tooth that tastes like infection. Gum disease surrounding my jaw. Having it removed thursday because I was told oral infections cannot heal themselves and if the gum disease is left untreated it can eat my jaw bone and the infection can spread to any part of my face and brain. Probably a huge long shot. But most medical disasters are one in a million type odds. The difference is, if it were my jaw causing the infection, medical would have it covered 100%. Because its my tooth, i pay 50% out of pocket because dental only covers half of this procedure. Either way, left untreated, this long shot could eventually cause my death. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK medical cover is free as paid in taxation. But dental and optical ARE separate from general medical care. In the case of your wisdom extraction this would cost equiv of $100 as you have to contribute to dental. But full medical care for say cancer is $0</p></div>		</li>

My mom drives down there and pays 1/10 of what she would have to pay in the States. But if you don't speak the language it's a challenge to find the proper dentist for your need</p></div>		</li>
