			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty good explanation.  We WANT to have some taboo words -- every culture wants to have some kind of strong language available -- so we (figuratively) chose these.  It's tied to those three areas that make us nervous (which are widespread but not universal) and also tied to certain sounds that register for us phonetically, and have a little &quot;kick&quot; to them.  </p>
<p>But something to consider: much of language and culture got partially frozen in time as we developed printing, television, etc. -- we have solid reliable records of what people said decades ago.  So our language hasn't changed as fast as our culture has, and often people get offended by -- and deliberately offend others with -- a different set of words than the ones still filed under &quot;swear words&quot;.  (Which word in the post above do you think somebody will get upset about?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Language changes a LOT faster now than it used to, with mass communication.</p>
<p>But some words are so entrenched they are hard to displace.</p>
<p>&quot;Jerk&quot; used to be a bad word, it means &quot;jerkoff&quot; or masturbator.  But now anyone can say it.  It's not a bad word any more.  It took time but it happened.</p>
<p>But the F word is NOT going to go that route, not within the next 50 years, because it had reached such a high level of offensiveness and for so long that there is a large portion of the population (in the US) that will NEVER be able to see it as &quot;just a word.&quot;</p>
<p>(Even the vast majority of people who CLAIM it is &quot;just a word&quot; still nevertheless use it as a swear word.  They don't <em>really</em> think it is no different from the word &quot;banana,&quot; they just want to be free to say it without criticism...)</p>
<p>Similarly, even after you get the majority to agree gender-neutral pronouns would be awfully nice, the fact is that getting them to take traction, even in a highly-evolving language like English, is HARD.</p>
<p>Swear words are bad because we collectively (but not universally) agree they are bad.  The origin doesn't really matter so much, the shared agreement is what keeps it alive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose the internet has led to fast changes in language, although many are used in specific sub-demographics.  But it seems to me that quite a lot of those fast changes disappear quickly as well (consider all the examples of dated slang) and things regress a bit to the mean (or rather, the established).  I was thinking of how radio/television set some things &quot;in stone&quot;, which settled many things and slowed down change.</p>
<p>(On a different note, technological development leads to a lot of new vocabulary but not as much fundamental change).</p></div>		</li>
