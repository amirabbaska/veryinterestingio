<p>Tickets for Concorde was expensive as hell and the seats are seriously cramped.</p>
<p>People with the money to buy a ticket were more willing to pay less for a really comfy 1st class seat in a regular airplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the people flying concord didn't even know what they paid to fly. Concord even raised prices to test this theory and didn't see a significant drop in ticket purchases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.</p>
<p>If you had enough money to afford a ticket then you also had enough money to either pay first class for a more-comfy seat or just hire your own plane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concorde was a huge cash cow for BA. The cost of R&amp;D had been written off, so all BA had tor pay for was fuel and maintenance.</p>
<p>Even if your claim that it cost as much to operate as a 747 is true, the cost of a ticket on it was many times more than the equivalent tickets on a 747. Concorde had a single class.</p>
<p>In 2000 tickets cost approximately $6000 one-way, and with 128 seats that is $768,000 in fares for a single flight. Even with discounting each flight generated a lot of money. And I recall a news story about how Concorde was full or nearly full on most flights.</p>
<p>What killed Concorde was 9/11. After 9/11 most of the frequent flyers that used it disappeared for a long time.</p></div>		</li>
