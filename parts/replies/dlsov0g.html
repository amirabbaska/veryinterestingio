<p>If you mature with dignity then you have a good chance of keeping the childish tendencies that you cherish most, while still becoming a responsible adult. If you fight it then you'll struggle and in that struggle you'll lose the parts of yourself that love anyways.</p></div>		</li>

I remember when I was 3 I was too embarrassed to go on Santa's lap and tell him I wanted a Power Rangers Megazord because I felt like it was too specific of an item and I'd get a weird reaction. I specifically remember thinking that.</p>
<p>By the way it was <a href="http://hottopic.scene7.com/is/image/HotTopic/10941030_hi?$pdp_hero_standard$" target="_blank">this one</a>, I did end up getting it, and it was fucking awesome.</p></div>		</li>
