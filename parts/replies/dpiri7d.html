			<div class="markdown"><p>Another book of his, “an anthropologist on mars” describes a man who was blind from birth until adulthood and then received his sight (cataracts removed, I think). He could “see” but could not learn to recognize anything, i.e., had a lot of difficulty mapping concepts onto visual cues. Super fascinating, everyone should read Oliver Sacks!</p></div>		</li>
