			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been lazy and installed a few pull string lights in my house.  It's pure laziness.  You run a single 14g romex to the spot you want light and... that's it.  No other wires, electrical boxes or god forbid, fishing wires behind drywall.  I can understand the appeal if you're getting a contractor to do it.  Way cheaper.  </p>
<p>Pro-tip:  Swap the bulb for newer motion sensing bulbs in these sockets.  It's sooooo nice not having to fumble around in the dark for a stupid string.  Walk in to get your laundry and the light comes on.  Walk away with your arms full of laundry and the light goes out on its own.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pets are not a problem. the sensors only respond to movement in that particular room and they automatically switch off after a short delay when living things leave the room. pir sensors respond to body heat given off by animals and humans. they have a range of 2-13 meters depending on ambient temps (lower temp = higher sensitivity). they aren't able to sense through walls. they use about a fraction of a watt power. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume those Google home/Amazon smart bulbs would work. Use an app to turn them on/off either through the app for the brand of bulb you got or do it by voice command with Google assistant. You don't need to be in the room so can turn it on before picking up your crap and turn it off when you put your stuff down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Chicago in an old typical Chicago apartment building. My bedroom and hallway and pantry and closet lights were all pull string when I moved in. Since I have been here, I was able to get the landlord to change out the bedroom light to a switch (wiring done via tubing across ceiling and down wall rather than inside wall).  My living room overhead light is also with the wiring in tubing to the light switch. My guess is in the 1920s when the building was built, the lights were all pull string? </p>
<p>I am also lacking in outlets in my rooms and several of the outlets are with wiring through tubes rather than threaded through the walls themselves.</p></div>		</li>
