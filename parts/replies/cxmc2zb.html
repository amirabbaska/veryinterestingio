			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct but the presence of vorticity depends on the temperature difference and the Reynolds number.  In all cases, the smoke can't rise as a broad front because something cool has to go down to replace it and a large circulating pattern breaks down as minor nonuniformities are forced to grow to create adjacent upward and downward flows.  See &quot;plug flow.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
