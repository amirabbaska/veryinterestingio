			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, obviously, but the terms <em>special</em> and <em>general</em> historically came about for different reasons. It's not as simple as &quot;SR is a special case of GR&quot;.</p>
<p>If a physical theory is invariant under a group of isometries, we say the theory exhibits <em>special covariance</em>. Note that even pre-relativistic physics exhibits special covariance. In that theory, space is the manifold <strong>R</strong>^(3) imbued with a flat Riemannian metric. The physical laws are invariant under the group of isometries of E^(3). SR and GR also exhibit special covariance, albeit with respect to a different group of isometries.</p>
<p>However, GR also exhibits a more general symmetry called <em>general covariance</em>. The physical laws are invariant not only under the <em>special</em> group of isometries but also under the more general group of diffeomorphisms (i.e., general coordinate transformations).</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, I feel like I should emphasize this point very clearly. <strong>SR is perfectly capable of describing accelerated frames of references The difference between SR and GR is not &quot;SR can only handle inertial frames and you need GR for acceleration&quot;. That is an extremely common misconception.</strong> At the most pragmatic level, the difference between the two theories is the presence of non-zero curvature in GR.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Also, pedantic correction: but &quot;static and globally flat&quot; is redundant. A globally flat metric <em>is</em> static. (The converse is not true obviously.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm? A special case of something is a <em>more restrictive</em> case of that something. A property that holds in general may not be true for the <em>special</em> case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not seeing a problem. Only a subset of transformations under which GR is invariant apply to SR; that's why it's special. </p>
<p>It's a special case of the general thing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just how I like my whiskey. Anyway, I have a question about what it's like to be a GR physicist vs a SR Physacist. One of my college professors (thermo stats or something similar) he made a joke about how GR's and SR's didn't talk to each other because they didn't speak the same language. Specifically, he said &quot;they don't use the same math&quot;. Specifically it seemed like the GR's had such special methods, that none of the other sciences would be able to recognize them. Probably just the proff ranting, but does that sound like a myth with some roots in reality? Does GR's really alone on a mountain with their obscure mathematical methods? Heard anything like that before? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any branch of physics or applied math has its own methods, some of which may be esoteric, some of which may be quite common. At some point almost every physicist is solving equations, and so almost every physicist is going need to know something about numerical methods or partial differential equations.</p>
<p>It's not very common for people working in entirely different fields to be able to understand much of anything the other is doing or saying. In fact, it's very rare. Not only is there a lot of jargon, but it's also just the nature of expertise. No one reasonably thinks this is a bad thing or a joke. I work in computational plasma physics and it's rare that I even understand about half of the talks at the annual DPP conference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't really people who you'd call &quot;an SR physicist&quot; at this point. There are plenty of physicists who work with SR and not with GR. But that's in the context of studying something else where SR is relevant but GR is not. (Like, for example, most particle physics.) SR is &quot;done&quot; in the sense that new research on just it specifically doesn't really happen anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does one represent expanding spacetime? I am familiar with some of the metrics used in the theory but have never considered this. Would you have finite but increasing parameters for your space coordinates or do different metrics arise when you consider an expanding universe?</p></div>		</li>
