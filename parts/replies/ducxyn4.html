			<div class="markdown"><p>How does anyone keep all those multiples of 10 straight?! It's so much easier when every unit conversion has it's own unique formula. All you have to do is look it up in a series of conversion tables or just google every calculation you make; no need to memorize!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, right? How stupid is it that 1 cm^3 has a mass of 1g, and that a liter is 1 dm^3, therefore having a mass of 1kg?</p>
<p>I'll take my 128g of water with a mass of 8.345404 pounds any day.<br />
....we are talking about US gallons, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hated metric as a kid in the US. Once I became a science major in college, i knew i could never turn back. Metric is far superior and easier to understand/keep track of. However, once you learn imperial as a child, it's harder to switch over without sometimes combining the two. It's got a nostalgic feel to it that makes you want to believe metric is inferior</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imperial systems is easier to use in day to day life though. Roughly speaking:</p>
<p>one foot = distance from wrist to elbow</p>
<p>half foot = distance from wrist to end of middle finger</p>
<p>one yard = length of one stride</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know the imperial version of the calorie is no more logical than this right? The BTU is the amount of energy required to raise one pound of water by one degree Farenheit (or Rankine)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah but but one ml = 1cm3 = 1g, a kilogram is one liter of water, 0-100 degrees celsius are the fusion and boiling point of water.</p>
<p>Now, 32f to 212f
A pound is 16 ounces
A pound of water is 15,34 fl oz
And so on
There is no logic to the imperial system, its just arbitrary. Theres a reason why scientists use the metric system.</p></div>		</li>
