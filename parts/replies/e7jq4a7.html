			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be better to say that our heat sensing nerves actually sense the transfer of heat instead of the current heat. Like putting your hand in a 400 degree oven versus touching the hot stove. The air will feel warm and hot because it can only transfer heat slowly, but the stove will burn your hand because it transfers it faster.</p></div>		</li>
