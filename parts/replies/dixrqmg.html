<p>Another oddity of the UK is that it is not required to have identification. A person can, and many do, in fact, live their lives without ever holding a passport of a driving license and have no way to identify themselves.</p>

<p>Even 'identifying yourself' is a bit of an odd concept in the context of the UK. You can change your name simply by using a new one, its not so much that there is a defined identity for a person, but rather that they are the same person who did something else (whether that's the same person who has x bank account, or the same person who was convicted of x crime..) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I seriously love that part of our laws. You don't even have to tell the government that you're changing your name, you just start using a different one. Of course the only trouble is changing the name on any ID you have but that really doesn't cost as much as I thought it would. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't even have to do that. It can be helpful, but you can just change it on renewal..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is and it isn't, it's just a different approach, but it means you end up starting from first principles at times, say changing bank.. And you still have things like credit reports, address history, electoral rolls and stuff that tie things together, just not on a single primary key, but rather a selection of them. Now that can be good, but it can also be a pain if, for example, you live somewhere that is new and not in peoples address databases, or you have the same name as someone else who lives at the same address, or you move out quite young etc..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty limited life though - lots of people hold licences because they need to be able to drive, and some who don't drive but have a provisional licence just to use as ID.</p>
<p>You can certainly live without them, but you probably won't. Unless you look older than 18, don't need to drive, and don't want to leave the country.</p>
<p>That said, the laws aren't so strict in the UK as they might be in the US. For example you don't need to have your driving licence on you while driving - if the police don't trust what you're saying they can issue a &quot;producer&quot; to get you to show it at a police station within x days. Many older people still have &quot;paper&quot; licences that don't have photos or any other modern ID card features. My dad's paper licence is in a filing cabinet at his office, for example.</p></div>		</li>
