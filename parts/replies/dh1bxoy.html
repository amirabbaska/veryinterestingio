			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravity is spread as evenly as the mass of the object creating it.  Earth's shape is roughly a sphere but specifically an &quot;oblate spheroid,&quot; or a flattened sphere.  The gravity field would probably look something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is the Earth not a perfect sphere, it also isn't of consistent density. In particular, oceanic crust is denser than continental crust. So you would have a stronger gravity field over the denser parts. </p></div>		</li>
