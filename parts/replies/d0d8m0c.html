			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you run it long enough to boil the water I can imagine that the water vapor will make everything soggy! When you just warm bread you are not aiming for the boiling point as you probably are with a pizza since you want to melt the cheese.</p>
<p>Haven't even tried if it actually works with bread though, see no reason when I can just toast it... I'm just speculating!</p>
<p><strong>What I have tried is to run the microwave with a cup of water before cleaning it (~5min), the hot water vapor dissolves all kinds of disgusting residues.. super easy to wipe clean afterwards, no rubbing!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better than that, lay a wet towel on the bottom of the microwave, then turn it on high for about minute. Give it a couple seconds for the towel to cool  (so you don't burn yourself) and then use it to wipe out all the crud inside. It was the standard way we'd clean out our microwaves when I was a line cook, it works wonders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I have my mythbusters info right, you have to be pretty careful putting a cup of any liquid in the microwave for a long period of time. It's rare, but they can sit there and superheat instead of properly boiling, and instant boil (see: explode hot water everywhere) once disturbed.</p>
<p>There are roughly 400 faster, safer ways to clean a microwave of disgusting residues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it regarding reheating leftover rice. (like a mexican dish). From my own experience it's better to just spray some water on the rice before it goes in the microwave. Prevents it from getting hard and dry. Just run your hand under water before and 'flick' it a few times over the rice.</p></div>		</li>
