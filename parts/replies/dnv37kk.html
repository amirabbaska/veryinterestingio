			<div class="markdown"><p>It was not brute force. In this instance bruteforcing would have been isolating all the different symbols, assigning letters to them in progressive order and trying to find an assignment which resulted in valid words.</p>
<p>Their approach involved a whole fucking lot more research work than that. Brute force is a misnomer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helped that the language was an ancient form of Greek. We still haven't deciphered Linear A because it is hard, if not impossible if it is in a language that we don't have any record of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to do if you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingual_inscription" target="_blank">bilingual texts</a> like the Rosetta Stone - that is to say, the same message written in multiple writing systems, where you know at least one of the writing systems already.</p>
<p>There are no known bilingual texts with Linear A and a known language, like Linear B.</p>
<p>Another problem is that if you try and say things in Linear B using the same phonetic values as Linear A, the resultant &quot;language&quot; resembles no known language. If it resembled some known language group's phonetic values, we could potentially piece together the meaning from those languages - like how if you know French, you can decipher texts in Spanish, albeit with considerable effort. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case with Linear A, indicating that either it encodes a language with no known relatives, or Linear B encodes phonetic values completely differently from Linear A.</p></div>		</li>
