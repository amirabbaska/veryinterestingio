			<div class="markdown"><p>“Master” is for unmarried males younger than the age of majority. If you've ever seen <em>A Christmas Story</em>, the decoder pin Ralphie receives in the mail is addressed to “Master Ralph Parker,” and he says as much in the scene. That movie is set in the 1940s, and it's just how people talked in Indiana back then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When she got married people called her &quot;Frau Doktor Husbandsfamilybame&quot; because of German nonsense</p>
<p>That was so funny</p></div>		</li>
