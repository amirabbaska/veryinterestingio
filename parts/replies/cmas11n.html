			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that this only leads to special relativity. General relativity is a consequence of both special relativity and the equivalence principle, which says that an object's gravitational mass and inertial mass are equal.</p>
<p>Inertial mass is the mass appearing in the equation that the sum of forces ΣF working on an object is equal to its inertial mass m_i times the resultant acceleration a (ΣF = m_i * a).  </p>
<p>Gravitational mass is to gravity what electric charge is to electromagnetism: an object's electric charge q times the electric field strength E is equal to the electric force working on it (F_e = q <em> E), and an object's gravitational mass m_g times the gravitational field strength g is equal to the gravitational force working on it (F_g = m_g </em> g). </p>
<p>Because this mass is equal to the object's inertial mass, a vertically falling object's acceleration in a vacuum is independent of its mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The equivalence principle was introduced by Einstein in 1907, two years after he had proposed special relativity. Those two ideas led to general relativity, but are not equal to it. IIRC he had a hard time learning the mathematical framework required for GR, differential geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to a documentary I recently watched about him, he wrote down the equations for general relativity well before he 'figured out' general relativity. He re-discovered them many years later when he came across a similar pattern and thought he might have already analyzed that case. He went back to his notes and they contained the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to say that he based his equations off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation" target="_blank">Lorentz Transformations</a>. I'm definitely no expert here, but it is to my understanding that relativity was derived from this mathematicians work. Looking at the link provided I found this, &quot;The Lorentz transformation is in accordance with special relativity, but was derived before special relativity.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that he didn't start with the equivalence principle for GR. He started by trying to generalize special relativity to non-inertial reference frames (i.e., accelerating or rotating references frames), and he came up with the equivalence principle on the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember in my first physics class, when my professor told us that no scientific law says that inertial mass and rest (gravitational) mass have to be the same. They've always just been measured to be the same. Blew my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe he was also looking to explain the mystery of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" target="_blank">Michaelson-Morley Experiment</a>.</p>
<p>That attempted to measure how fast we were moving through space by measuring light projected against our direction of travel vs with our direction of travel.  The result was the speed of light did not change at all with system's velocity as long as the receiver and transmitter were fixed relative to one another.  Nor is there any deflection &quot;downstream&quot; if the transmitter-receiver path is 90 deg from direction of motion.</p>
<p>This was not merely baffling, it created unanswerable questions.  The idea that light traveled through the medium of space &quot;aether&quot; was totally busted, that was certain, but no one had a comprehensive explanation of what it was doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right and it's an important point: light speed was experimentally shown to be constant and independent of the state of motion of the source and receiver before Einstein introduced special relativity. </p>
<p>He didn't tell us that light speed was constant. He told us what that meant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a great point about the scientific process- Michaelson-Morley Experiment basically created a mystery about the nature of the universe and existence that went unanswered for 20 years.  Not that &quot;maybe it works this way, or that way, we just don't have confirmation which one.&quot;  No.  ALL attempts to explain how this works could readily be disproven with other known observed phenomena.   </p>
<p>General Relativity, of which E=MC^2 is key, finally explained this with a comprehensive theory that agreed with all observations.  Weird though it was, it fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was also a pupil of Minkowski who would talk about time dilation and the paradox it creates. Minkowski inspired a lot of Einstein's theory of relativity. </p>
<p>Einstein was always more a physicist/philosopher than a mathematician. He believed (and later regretted) that a physicist only needed elementary mathematics. Minkowski would call him a 'lazy dog' for not attending his math classes while at university. But they always had the utmost respect for each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which was also a reason that Einstein needed 10 years (or whatever it actually was) to figure out general relativitiy. Much of the time was spent learning the math.</p>
<p>Oh, and a good indicator that Einstein hadn't been into math that much in the beginning is the fact that all mathematical constructs of special relativity bear other peoples' names (Lorentz transformation, Minkowski space), whereas general relativity has, sure enough, Einstein tensors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is not clear that Einstein was directly influenced by the Michelson-Morley experiment itself, but he specifically refers to &quot;the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relative to the 'light medium' &quot; in his 1905 papper</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The MME was not the only experiment to demonstrate the problem, I'm sure it was reproduced by others in the 20 intervening years.  Regardless, it's the signature experiment for the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I don't think this was worth pointing out, but it's a tiny nitpick. The MM experiment was merely the latest and most precise in a fairly long string of attempts to measure differences in the speed of light. Whether or not he was specifically aware of this one experiment at the time that he did his work or not doesn't really change his motivations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was basically a reference to said experiment. Even if he only knew about derivative works, this by definition makes theories based on them derivative of MME.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that an enormous amount of the work was already done for Einstein. Lorentz and Poincaré basically already had all the pieces, but they failed to put them all together. The Lorentz transformations that today form the backbone of special relativity were actually invented by Lorentz and another physicist more than a decade before Einstein's seminal paper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't Einstein derive the Lorentz equations entirely on his own, though?</p>
<p>If I recall from my university physics classes, it's not that he used Lorentz's equations, but rather, that he derived them independently, and it just so happened that Lorentz had done so first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define, &quot;entirely on his own.&quot; While his derivation was different (based on slightly different assumptions), it is extremely unlikely that he wasn't aware of them beforehand. They (and many of their implications) were already well-known, and given his interest in the field, he almost definitely was aware of the major developments.</p>
<p>Einstein's major contribution was by connecting all the pieces. Poincaré suggested that maybe the speed of light is constant in moving references frames, Lorentz and another guy whose name I always forget previously derived the transformations, and based on them also suggested the idea of length contraction. Larmor realized that the transformations also implied time dilation.</p>
<p>The difference is most of them were still hung up on the idea of the ether, and were interpreting the equations in those terms or in special cases. Einstein was the first person to come along and throw away all the old baggage and just start from the three most basic principles that he could.</p>
<p>And I don't intend at all to belittle his work, on relativity or any other field. It's just that so many people are under the impression that Einstein was working in isolation and came up with it all on his own, when most of the math and most of the concepts involved were already considered; just not in quite the right framework or all at once. It still took a stroke of creative genius to put it all together like that, and his other work on Brownian motion, GR, the photoelectric effect and other miscellaneous contributions to quantum mechanics proved without a doubt that it wasn't just a bit of luck. The man was a creative genius.</p></div>		</li>
