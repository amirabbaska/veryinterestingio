			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest part is how unlikely recalled memories are to be accurate. </p>
<p>Sometimes you have a vivid memory of something that's just blatantly <em>incorrect</em>. </p>
<p>Yet eye witness testimony holds so much weight in our legal system when it's flawed both by our imperfect biology, and human's tendency to lie</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source on that?<br />
I understood that each recall re-constructed the memory so the more recalls the less differences in between. That's why we remember our phone numbers but not our debit card numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than this. Every time you recall a memory, you take the only copy out of long-term storage. If you are remembering something and receive brain trauma, that memory can be entirely and totally lost forever. </p>
<p>A memory can be taken out of long term storage, altered, and replaced. And the original is gone. All that remains is the latest altered copy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im just a random guy on the internet, but it seems likely that we dont have super accurate memory because historically we've never needed accurate memory for survival.</p>
<p>We just had to remember that tigers will eat us and not to rub poison ivy on your dick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that the point which Blasey Ford brought up during hear hearing about how trauma causes certain memories to be encoded with greater detail and clarity is also scientifically accurate. Ancillary memories are more likely to be confused over time, while the central event remains the same. If we assume that the perpetrator and the act are core events that are encoded and that time, place, clothing, other events of the evening are ancillary events, this should help explain the nature of most sexual assault allegations and why there may be inconsistencies about details when recalled years after the fact, even though the victim is convinced that the key parts of their allegations are true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa! You seem really pumped about memory and how it works (slash doesn't work). Can you recommend any good books on the subject? I'm sure i can find the wiki on my own,  but books always feel like they have a direction. Whenever you wake up,  or whatever (its like 11pm here)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not off the top of my head. Memory is pretty broad, and so gets put into other chapters in text books. </p>
<p>The principles of neuroscience by Kendall (and others) is the go to book if you want to learn neuroscience, memory is in there, but not as its own chapter - its spread out across the book. The index provides a good guide to its locations though. </p>
<p>edit: Just checked the book, there is a chapter on learning and memory at the back, around pages 1450 onwards... My bad. It been a while since I have used that book haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't eaten an apple in a long time, yet reading your comment I pictured it as vividly as possible, the feel of crunching into it, the sweet juice released as you bite, the sound of the fruit breaking apart, the temperature of the skin being a bit cold, the waxy feel of the skin, the bitterness of seeds when you accidentally get them, on and on....all of these sensations manifested by just a few characters typed out and read on a phone screen, nearly as real as if I had eaten a real apple just now.</p>
<p>That is truly remarkable, and really makes me feel like our brains are superbly malleable, like...the difference between &quot;reality&quot;, or real sensations, and imagined sensations, is very small! And then considering imagined sensations or events that have never happened at all...it's just incredible how our minds can generate all of this information on the fly, even while processing information that is being input as I sit here.</p>
<p>The brain just seems so much more fluid and dynamic than a computer. Which is typical of biological things I think. Everything serves more than one purpose, systems are adaptable and flexible ...</p>
<p>The world is an amazing place!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But here's the fun teaser about that.  When you picture yourself eating an apple, were you recalling eating a specific apple you had eaten in the past, or was this a new, generic apple that you mentally constructed as a pattern from many apples you had eaten in the past?  How many apples went into that apple you &quot;ate&quot; right there?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This thought was what I was thinking. The description of what I was visualizing. I don't eat apples.... It would have been years at this point. So I was imagining an apple gettinging eaten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a massive part of art and recreating things that you see around you. In college I learned how important reference is because of how often we fall into the habit of recalling details from memory, rather than looking at what is right in front of you. I have recently grown to appreciate this more doing acrylic pet portraits. It is very important to me that I make it look like &quot;your&quot; dog, and not just &quot;a&quot; dog. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun one... I primarily drive in North America (so steering wheel on the left and driving on the right side of the road). However I've done quite a bit of driving in Ireland and the UK, so RHD. If I just casually recall memories of this trips, my brain has filed then around to be&quot;correct&quot; aka LHD, until I really think about it and it switches back to RHD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because your “reality” is your brain making a solid representation of the world around you from the limited sensual input it gets. “Representation” being the key word - your memory is so close to your “reality” because your brain made both for you, we all live in virtual realities we make entirely inside our brains. Bats use echolocation to “see” their world. The returning sonics lets them accurately make a representation of the location and shape of objects around them. Their brains use this information to construct what they “see” as the  world around them, but it’s objective reality as far as they’re concerned. The combining of all sensory input (there are more than 20 senses, not just the traditional 5) is then processed into a whole coherent perception by another sense called proprioception and presented to you as objective reality in real time but with a slight delay to allow for all the processing involved. The visual cortex takes the longest as it’s the biggest and most complicated sensory area of the brain, and the other senses are delayed or buffered by the appropriate amount before being added to to it, so everything syncs up.</p></div>		</li>
