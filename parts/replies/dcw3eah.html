<p>A &quot;good&quot; tax is avoidable by those that don't use the service and is unavoidable by those that do use the service. A gas tax is a &quot;good&quot; tax at the pump because it targets exactly who is using the roads.</p>

<p>I'm not sure we should be talking about 'good' taxes here.</p>
<p>We can talk about who they impact and so forth, but no more than that. We should leave the politics out of this.</p>
<p>For instance, we can say the gas tax is what we call a regressive tax, and explain that it impacts people regardless of income and instead in terms of how much they drive, and impacts corporations the same, but we shouldn't call it 'good'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you understand what makes it good then you realize that both the rich man and poor woman that drive pay in a rough proportion to how much wear and tear they put on the roads. That is what makes it good.</p>
<p>All this talk about regressive and progressive Mises the point in this scenario. I understand you may have been taught about progressive and regressive taxes and a new way of evaluating the busyness of tax might undernime your sense of justice.  But think about it, doesn't it seem on it's its face that the more you use a public good the more you should pay for it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, the terms 'regressive tax' and 'progressive tax' are not political terms, they are economic and mathematical. </p>
<p>A regressive tax is so called because the effective tax rate increases the less you earn, and thus it forms a regression curve. A progressive tax is the opposite.</p>
<p>Second, if you must get onto the politics, then here I have three further points.</p>
<p>One, if you look start looking at these costs in terms of tax rate, then you find yourself having to justify a position that states that someone who earns less should support the government with a higher proportion of their income. I cannot find a way to justify this.</p>
<p>Second, measuring the use of a public utility by those who use it rarely produces a true picture of what is going on. For instance, parents of children aged between five and eighteen are the only taxpayers who make use of schools. However, schools benefit all of society by educating future citizens and workers. The same is the case with infrastructure, though slightly less intuitive; strong infrastructure encourages increased commerce and movement, thus boosting the economy and benefiting everyone, regardless of how much they use the infrastructure. </p>
<p>Third, is simply a moral argument against deriving a flat tax solution to answer my first point. I believe that the more money someone has the larger percentage of it they can afford to put towards the government and the effective operation of society; while a single mother working a minimum wage job will be hard hit by paying even a 10% tax rate the CEO pulling in $10,000,000 per year can easily afford a rate of sixty percent or more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The argument is we benefit by taxing all the other stuff that comes along with the oil industry. All the work clothes, all the account services, all these industries pay their income taxes, their sales taxes, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't this a similar argument behind the Laffer Curve?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar yes, but not precisely.  The debate of where best to tax goes a way back.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiocracy" target="_blank">The Physiocrats</a> in the latter half of the 1700s thought that you could most efficiently the coutnry by taxing agricultural products and everything would kind of cascade through the system.</p>
<p>The Laffer Curve assumes there is an optimal or best tax rate to maximize government revenue.</p>
<p>What I wrote about above concerns combining the two.  Picking the proper industries and taxing them at an optimal rate.  This is very ideological complex and politically complex idea but it is in the background of these decisions.</p>
<p>Take building a new pipeline.  If you tax at too high a rate the oil coming out of the ground the pipeline is a non-starter.  Land does not get leased, steal does not get made, nothing is transported onto site.  Tools are not crafted, work clothing is not sold, etc.</p>
<p>All of those things bring in tax revenue (sales, income, etc) if you don't &quot;overtax&quot; with an oil production tax or an oil profit tax.</p>
<p>So, by lowering the tax in one area we can see an increase in tax revenue in other areas.  If the tax in that first area is to high then all the other tax revenue will not go up and we do see less revenue than we would have.</p>
<p>Kinda a Laffer Curve+</p></div>		</li>
