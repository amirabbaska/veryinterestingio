			<div class="markdown"><p>To go into more detail, it's actually two wavelengths of light, and relies on the fact that your blood changes color when it's oxygenated. Basically you shine two different colors of light into your skin, and both are reflected, and both are absorbed roughly equal and proportional to skin/flesh thickness/color, however one color is also reflected proportional to the total amount of oxygenated blood, and the other color is reflected proportional to blood that is not oxygenated. Thus the ratio of the two brightnesses is reflective of the percent of oxygenated blood, and it allows it to correct for things like skin color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little bit more to the conversation, this technique is also being used to image brain activity and breast tissue, among other things. Overall, the field is known as Near-Infrared Spectroscopy or Imaging (NIRS/NIRI). This light can pass through about 3-4 cm of the skull (so we can only see the very surface of the brain in general) and about 8 cm of breast tissue (so you can get cross sections of a breast or image the whole thing).</p>
<p>You can use several different wavelengths at once to get more accurate values of oxygenation or concentrations of other things like water and lipids as different wavelengths are absorbed in different proportions by these fluids/materials. </p>
<p>NIRS is actually a pretty exciting and relatively new method of medical imaging. It's not being actively used in medicine right now as far as I know, except for the pulse oximetry, but I don't think that really falls into this field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your reply. This is all really intresting! What is the purpose of imaging the brain etc? To look for tumors or braindamage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with brain tumors, so I'm not sure if NIRS can get deep enough into the brain to find any. But the technology is definitely being used to hopefully identify traumatic brain injury, like concussions. You can also use functional NIRS (fNIRS) during psychological experiments to identify what parts of the brain you use during different activities. </p></div>		</li>
