<p>It was seen as very masculine and powerful up until that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC correctly they are an imitation of Persian cavalrymen's fashion. A small heel locks into stirrips more effectively and helps you keep control on a horse. And actually, looking at the picture of King Louis, those heels aren't actually that high.</p>
<p>America actually has a fashion that follows this pattern: cowboy boots, which have about 1-2 inches of heel. Of course, lots of women in Austin wear them.</p></div>		</li>
