			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are saying is true, but all the examples you mentioned where π is used can be explained by a circle cropping up somewhere.</p>
<p>In Coulomb's law it's because a sphere's surface area is given by 4πr^2.</p>
<p>In pendulum dynamics, the position of the pendulum as time goes on is cyclical. The motion is modeled by trigonometric functions, which are similarly cyclical. The values of trig functions are related to angles and those are essentially parts of a circle's circumference.</p>
<p>In complex analysis it's because complex numbers can be thought of as magnitude and angle, which loops back to the trigonometric functions argument. There is always a circle involved with π.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trigonometric functions were <em>designed</em> to model the coordinates of a circle in a plane. It is certainly possible to define them without a mention of pi (say, using Taylor series), but all of those methods will have a reference to pi and circles necessarily baked into them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think it is the conversion factor between dimensions, a line being a 1 dimensional object and a circle being the simplest 2 dimensional object, rotate by pi again and you have a 3 dimensional sphere. I imagine 'rotating' that sphere by pi gives you the simplest 4 dimensional 'object' and so on..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see it similarly, but slightly differently. Point A is zero dimensions. Connect that Point A to another point a fixed distance away, Point B, and you are in 1-dimensional space. Log all the points on a plane the same fixed distance between Point A and Point B and you have a circle in 2-dimensional space. Log all the points in space the same fixed distance between Point A and Point B and you have a sphere in 3-dimensional space. Etc. The idea I end up with is that the radius, that distance between Point A and Point B, is the fundamental unit. And ratios involving the radius are far more fundamental than the diameter or other measurements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a bit confused by what you mean by </p>
<blockquote>
<p>same fixed distance between Point A and Point B</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean you get a circle if you look at moving a fixed distance from <strong>one</strong> point in 2 dimensions and a sphere if you do it in 3 dimensions. Where does pi fit into this visualisation ?</p></div>		</li>
