			<div class="markdown"><p>My ID says I live 30+ miles away in another city. I tried showing them the rent receipts, but bureaucracy is what it is, and there's nothing the distributors can do if they are told to only distribute water to certain zip codes. </p>
<p>I'm used to that sort of shit by now, just bitter about the walk and pissed that people abused the water at the bus depot so much the stopped offering it. If you were getting water they were giving free rides, so people were carrying water on for the ride and leaving them on the buses and all over town. It's annoying to have to walk that far, but it wasn't fair to keep making the drivers carry all the water back off the bus, either. It just sucks, is all.</p></div>		</li>
