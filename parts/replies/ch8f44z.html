			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/d0US12a.jpg" target="_blank">Here's the actual path taken by Voyager 1 &amp; 2.</a> You'll notice each of the giant planets were in an arrangement such that the spacecraft could slingshot from one to the next, spiraling outwards as it went, Voyager 2 in particular.</p>
<p>I can't seem to find a good reference for this at the moment, but I've worked extensively with some of the original Voyager scientists and the figure they always quote is that such an alignment won't happen again for another 200 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The synodic period between Jupiter and Saturnus is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+1+%2F+x+%3D+1+%2F+11.8618+-+1+%2F+29.4571+for+x" target="_blank">~19.86 years</a> and the synodic period between Earth and Jupiter is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+1+%2F+x+%3D+1+%2F+1+-+1+%2F+11.8618+for+x" target="_blank">~1.09 years</a>. Edit: Synodic period is the time it takes for two orbiting bodies to reach the same alignment.</p>
<p>Based on this if we allow a 15 day tolerance (considering the Voyagers were launched roughly that much apart and both reached Jupiter) to have similar similar conditions the next launch window is 2196-02-05, which has conditions similar to within 8 days of 1977-09-05.</p>
<p>If the tolerance is increased, there's a launch window on 2077-01-21 that has error of 32 days. Whether fuel consumption outweighs the benefits of gravity assist is beyond my knowledge. <a href="http://pastebin.com/iyRcFTNP" target="_blank">Source code</a> for the code that calculated this for anyone interested.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thank you stranger for the gold. And thanks to everyone else too, this got way more attention than I expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wanted to go to all 4 outer planets, like Voyager 2, the limiting factor is the synodic period between Uranus and Neptune, which is 171 years.  So you could go to all 4 planets roughly every 171 years (plus or minus ~20 years since Jupiter and Saturn would also have to be aligned).</p>
<p>If you only wanted to go to Jupiter and Saturn, like Voyager 1, you only need the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn, which is about 20 years.  So there would be launch windows from Earth to Jupiter to Saturn for 2-3 years every 20 years (the Cassini spacecraft took advantage of this in 1997).</p>
<p>If you wanted some other trajectories: Jupiter-Uranus and Jupiter-Neptune launch windows are every 13-14 years, Jupiter-Saturn-Neptune or Saturn-Neptune launch windows are every 35 years, Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus or Saturn-Uranus launch windows are every 44 years.</p>
<p>In general, all these launch windows last for 2 or 3 years, since the arrangement of the outer planets doesn't change too much during that time.  When launching from Earth, the launch windows last about a month every year, since Earth also has to be in the right place in its orbit.  So for example, the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which was launched in August 1977, could have also been launched in August 1976 or August 1978 on a slightly different trajectory but still passing by all the 4 outer planets.</p>
<p>Since all the large outer planets can bend a spacecraft's trajectory significantly, there are also a lot of other launch windows if you're willing to wait a while between successive flybys.  For example, in 2077 you could launch a spacecraft to Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune if you're willing to wait ~50 years between the Uranus flyby and the Neptune flyby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My job is to calibrate instrumentation. I deal with very high end sensors and equipment, even sensors from nasa(nasa has the oldest shit I have ever calibrated in my life, I have gotten accelerometers that are so old from them that they almost broke Endevco's record for oldest working accelerometer). Most of the analog instrumentation and equipment isn't much better than the very high end stuff they had in the 60s and 70s, just smaller, auto ranging, self stabilizing etc. Some of it is even less accurate due to expanded frequency ranges or substituting digital circuits for analog.</p>
<p>What has gotten better is our ability to automate processes, record information, logic circuits, digital communication, lighter more stable equipment, better material science, cost effective ways of producing equipment and materials. You'd be suprised how quickly the cold war and the space programs pushed a lot of sensor technology and technology in general. </p>
<p>IMHO there's really no way to tell what they were capable of back then unless we get a engineer/physiscist who was working on the space program to come in here who has a solid understanding of where we're at today. I have a feeling that i'd be somewhat disapointed in the advancement of technology.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You are corect in your thinking from the planet's frame of reference. But you have to remember that the outer planets are also moving very fast from a solar frame of reference. So you can gain a lot of momentum if you are able to follow behind them and use their gravity to accelerate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the spacecraft uses a gravity assist to speed up it actual steals some of the planet's orbital momentum to speed itself up. Due to the mass difference between the craft and planet this is a big boost for the craft and an insignificant loss for the planet. </p></div>		</li>
