			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too. I think it's called cataplexy or something. A friend in school used to make me laugh when we were having to copy off the board so that I wouldn't be able to hold my pen well enough to write, which would make us laugh even harder.</p>
<p>-edit- if I laugh really really hard it also makes my legs get the same thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, thanks to you I now know the name of this condition.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I couldn't write using pens/pencils if I was laughing or crying. It was really annoying and I could feel that people would think I was making it up when it would happen. </p>
<p>Interestingly it eventually stopped happening, somewhere between ages 9-13. And I dont think I ever had narcolepsy (apparently the two usually go together). Will be reading more about this.</p>
<p>If anyone else had this as a kid but not anymore I'd love to hear about their experience!</p></div>		</li>
