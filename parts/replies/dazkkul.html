<p>They were called this because of the amount of italian companies financing them.</p>

<p>Not only were they funded by Italian companies (using Italian directors), they were also typically filmed in Italy, or sometimes Spain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>B) Some of the cowboys were still alive or only recently died when the genre hit its peak, adding a hint of romantic nostalgia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that this way of life was still in living memory is a big part of it I think.  I imagine it would be similar to the way we look back on the 60s, 70s, or 80s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aright, as a member of a family of cattle ranchers, I take exception to this. Cowboys still exist. Takes a lot of work to manage land and animals roaming on said range so they all thrive. It's not like you can buy a bull and a few cows in June, leave them on the hundred acres you just bought, and then sell your eighty animals to McDonald's in the spring. You won't have that many, you didn't fence the property or its ravine, etc. That's what you hire cowboys for. </p></div>		</li>
