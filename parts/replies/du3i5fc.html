			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I mean I feel it, but it's not the overwhelming, uncontrollable feeling anymore. I think it is at least partially willpower. I hate to be tickled and it dawned on me at some point that if I didn't react people would stop trying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're going off of subjective experience, it's most definitely not a willpower thing for me. It's a completely involuntary reaction. I even laugh in my sleep when I'm tickled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oooh real. honestly i don’t even feel it? if someone grabs me suddenly it sort of tickles but it’s more in general i startle very easily (it’s pretty humorous tbh) but like my feet, pits, stomach, aren’t ticklish. my friends try and it’s just the sensation of them rubbing their fingers on my body which is way weirder than tickles lmao</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the dream for me! I'm so extremely ticklish, it feels like torture. If it continues for more then 5-6 seconds I start getting a little panic attack and start kicking uncontrollably. I wish it would dissappear with the age, but it doesn't. I hate it :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always ticklish, but I told everyone I wasn't. When they challenged me on it I willpowered through. Eventually I stopped feeling the ticklishness. So i consider it a mental thing you can overcome.</p></div>		</li>
