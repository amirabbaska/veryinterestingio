			<div class="markdown"><p>My impression is that the OP is asking/imagining whether the event horizons of two nearby black holes cancel each other out because they are &quot;pulling&quot; against one another's gravity (i.e. curving space in opposite directions/ways). OP said &quot;overlapping event horizons&quot;, but that may not actually be what they meant if the event horizon of each black hole <em>shifts</em> because of the presence of the other black hole.</p>
<p>In case I'm not being clear, imagine that the black holes are of identical mass and the event horizon of each extends 1km from its center. If the centers of the two black holes were orbiting at a distance of 1.8km, there would be an &quot;overlap&quot; of the &quot;original&quot; 1km extent of each black hole's event horizon of 200m. What happens in that 200m space? Does the gravity pulling in opposite directions neutralize one another and cancel/move the event horizons? Does the gravity somehow compound/amplify instead, counterintuitively? Is it unaffected?</p>
<p>That was my impression of what OP was really asking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They do not. You are thinking of electromagnetism, which is a linear theory. This means that the electromagnetic field of a collection of charges is just the sum of the individual fields of each charges. Arrange things properly and you can cancel the electromagnetic pull of different charged particles. You can always do this.</p>
<p>Newtonian gravity, too, is linear and obeys the same principle. This leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point" target="_blank">Lagrange points</a> where the gravitational pull of different bodies cancels out.</p>
<p>General relativity, however, is non-linear. Black holes, in fact, are horridly non-linear. The spacetime warpings of two black holes is <strong>not</strong> the sum of the two individual warpings. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Put two black holes too close together and you won't get a Lagrange point that you can traverse safely without dying, you will just form the bridge /u/rantonels mentioned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about 2 super-massive black holes? Isn't it possible, if they are large enough, that their horizon's could overlap for quite a while before they converge? Also, if you could pin them down in space (with their horizon's overlapping) what would the space-time look like in that overlapped region?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be thinking of a black hole the way it's described in popular literature, gravity so strong that the escape velocity is c. </p>
<p>That description is not quite the best mental model. A better one is to consider that spacetime is warped so that all paths beyond the event horizon lead toward the singularity at the center. From the observer's point of view, no matter which way you face, you face the singularity at the center. There is no direction you could fly to get back out because turning around no longer means what you think it means. All directions lead to the singularity at the center. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty mind blowing. I can't believe things like this exist in our universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what your saying about the bridging between the 2 horizons. I'm assuming it might look like 2 merging water droplets. But I still wonder about that region in between. If the 2 black holes were pinned in place, and if they were the same size, wouldn't they cancel each other out in the bridged/overlapped region? If so, wouldn't that allow particles in that region to escape?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that as the black holes get close that &quot;balanced&quot; region becomes infinitely thin, so nothing can actually balance on it without getting ripped apart in order to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the definition of event horizon is very clever. The event horizon separates the region of spacetime where you are doomed from the outside in which you are not. Purely by definition, if you are inside the EH, you can't escape, and if you are outside, you can. If you get caught in the bridge, you won't escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. And they can't be pinned in place; but they can be orbiting each other, and they can orbit for a long time until they merge. This merger is exactly what LIGO has detected and I have read a bit about it. Of course we haven't directly observed it but my understand is that there are two distinct singularity with two distinct event horizons until the very instant the event horizons touch and then the merger is almost instantaneous. Seen in two dimensions, their gravity wells create a W shape, which almost instantly merges to a V shape; there's no canceling out any more than the earth and the moon cancel out. Gravity is just additive. It bends space time farther and farther until it breaks and you get a singularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At first it came entirely from the theory of general relativity. GR explained lots of other phenomena very well and so we believed that this is how the black holes should behave and merge. The recent gravitational wave signals LIGO measured were from merging black holes mostly (one neutron star binary too) and are entirely consistent with the framework of GR. So now we not only have some mathematical understanding but some pretty solid observations that this is what happens during the merger process. Future observations by LIGO and other gravitational wave observatories (LISA, pulsar timing arrays) can help constrain the merger process even more.</p></div>		</li>
