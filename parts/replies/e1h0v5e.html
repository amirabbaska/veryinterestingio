			<div class="markdown"><p>That trend will largely hold (with a few exceptions) within a period (the same row on the periodic table).  This is because within a period, the valence shell is the same and therefore to a first approximation the electrons in the valence shell are the same distance from the nucleus. Thus, the nucleus with more protons will pull more strongly on the electrons.</p>
<p>Within a group (vertical column), the number of protons in the nucleus increases going down the column. But so does the valence shell. So the electrons in question (in the valence shell) are farther from the nucleus. They also have as bunch of other electrons (core electrons) between them and the nucleus. These core electrons act to shield some of the charge from the nucleus, reducing the effective charge of the nucleus. So as you go down a group, a valence electron has less attraction to the nucleus and therefore there electronegativity gets lower.</p>
<p>So the element closest to the top right corner of the periodic table (closest to fluorine) will have a full octet and the element closest to the bottom left (closest to francium) will have the lone electron.</p></div>		</li>
