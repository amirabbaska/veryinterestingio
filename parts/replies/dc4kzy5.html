			<div class="markdown"><p>Take your hands and cup them, then clap. Loud right?</p>
<p>Now take one hand and make a fist. With about the same amount of strength you use to clap punch the bottom of your hand where the meat near your thumb is. It sounds a lot more dull and less loud right?</p>
<p>Now maybe the contact of the skin to skin makes some sound, but the majority of the sound you hear from a clap is coming from the expulsion of air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of it.  To make a hand-clap level clap on another part of your body, you'll note it requires considerably more force...and kinda hurts.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Causes air to move. Heat is also created although not enough to be seen by enough to be detected. Physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I thought it was an insightful question, because it seems like the kid is imagining that the sound should get trapped as the hands close, so how would it come out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Try hitting two pillows together. They are too soft to really vibrate, but they displace enough air to make a loud noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not both? The loudest clap I can produce comes from 4 fingers on my dominant hand striking the palm of my non-dominant. More surface area coming together creates a louder noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you get a sound if you hit the heels of your hands together, but it's not like a clap because there's not a lot of air being pushed out, and there's more of a thud from the vibration of your flesh and bones. If you snap, it's also a small amount of air, but the finger is moving pretty fast so the air can't move out of the way quickly enough and in the end has to move away explosively. I guess you could do that with the heels of your palms too if you brought them together fast enough, but it would hurt and maybe break something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought you had an interesting question so I experimented a bit. The snapping sound comes from your middle finger hitting the base of your thumb. Same idea air being smashed between two surfaces. You can test it by putting something to block the middle finger hitting the skin. </p>
<p>So your thumbpad doesn't have anything to do with the sound. It just is like a starting block for your middle finger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More accurately, or to elaborate (at least in my case), middle finger hitting the ring finger and base of thumb. The thumb tip provides resistance to elicit a whip effect on the middle finger, which slams down on that natural V, creating the snap.</p></div>		</li>
