<p>How loud is 100dB? Can you compare it to something please? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I googled something while we wait for the expert but according to Google, a motorcycle is roughly 100db.  Hearing loss can occur at around 90-95 db.  So pretty loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also important to note, it is a logarithmic scale, so the difference between 90 and 100 is less than the difference between 100 and 110, similar to the Richter scale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many comparison charts out there. 100 dbA would be in the range of a fully throttled lawn mower. A fighter jet would be some 120dBA. Remember: decibel is a logarithmic unit. Meaning that +10dB is double the loudness (technically). The perceived loudness is different, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3dB is a doubling of power, but 10dB maps to a perceived doubling of loudness (roughly) because hearing isn't linear either. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Each one (the size of Texas, remember) rises, disperses its light, and sinks in five minutes. That produces a Hell of a racket. There are something like 10 million of those all over the surface of the Sun at any one time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the five-minute oscillation excite higher order modes? I recall that it's some sort of coherent excitation of a bunch of harmonics, but 3 mHz is far too low for humans to hear. What would be the power density of the higher frequency modes, above 1 Hz and in the audible range? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the Sun as a whole doesn't resonate at higher frequencies than about 5 minute period (3mHz).  The chromospheric layer (just above the visible surface or photosphere) resonates at about 3 minute period (5mHz).  That doesn't mean there isn't sound at higher frequencies, just that it isn't resonant with a well-defined frequency.</p>
<p>The photosphere could in principle support audible frequency sounds, but we have no way to detect them at this time.  The layers above the photosphere can't, simply because the gas there is too tenuous.  In the low corona the collision time is about 10 seconds, so the highest frequency &quot;coronal ultrasound&quot; is 100 mHz -- just like in air the collision time is something like 10-20 microseconds, so the highest frequency ultrasound in air is something like 50-100 kHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>follow up to you, since you seem to know what's up, though I know this is probably more evolutionary biology than astrophysics.</p>
<p>If the Sun was something we could hear, would we hear it? Or would it just be one of these things that has always existed, so it is not &quot;sensed&quot; after a short time?</p>
<p>(as I write this, I wonder if nighttime, the sound would dim, and daytime the sound would grow louder? So maybe my question sucks.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would probably be the same as light.</p>
<p>Light sensors (eyes, and more primitive versions of eyes) evolved to sense a certain UV spectrum emitted by the sun because it proved to have an evolutionary advantage to the creatures that evolved those sensors.</p>
<p>The light direct from the sun wasn't terribly useful most of the time, but the reflections and re-transmissions of that light from other surfaces was.  The sun's rays hitting the body of a predator and then being re-transmitted in all directions allows prey to know about the presence of that predator and to avoid it.</p>
<p>If incoming sound from the sun was simply too noisy, it probably wouldn't be something that would be useful to evolve sensors for.  If it bounced off other things and allowed for something like echolocation, creatures that were able to sense these reflections might prosper, and a &quot;sun's noise reflection&quot; sensory organ might evolve.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it were standard sound waves and they were at 100 dB and were very noisy, it might mean that standard ears are useless because almost all sound is drowned out by the sun's relentless drone, so standard ears might never have evolved because they provided no useful evolutionary advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking this same thing. The only issue as I see it is that we would have to be &quot;louder&quot; than the base 100 dB to be heard. It takes an awful lot of energy to produce a 110 dB sound, so I'm not sure our voices would have evolved in a way capable of producing such a sound. </p></div>		</li>
