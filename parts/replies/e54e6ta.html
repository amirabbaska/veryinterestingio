			<div class="markdown"><p>And they don’t necessarily remove a tumor without doing harm to the brain. </p>
<p>A close friend found out in Feb that her 17 year old son had a brain tumor. He had surgery 3 weeks later to remove it. The surgeon said that it was a very fibrous tumor and bled a lot. He said it was difficult to see what he was doing due to the bleeding from the tumor. The boy ended up never waking up after surgery due to brain swelling and when he started having multi organ failure his mom decided to pull the plug. They tried two additional surgeries to relieve the pressure on his brain, but failed. Was devastating to say the least. The surgeon felt awful and even came to the funeral. We knew he did his best, but the outcome was still hard to deal with and so unexpected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A somewhat famous British neuro surgeon (Dr Henry Marsh) has openly spoken about this, and I think he wrote about this in his book Do No Harm. He encourages every surgeon/doctor to have a &quot;graveyard&quot; in their mind so they can freely grieve without judgment from others about the nature of the consequences of their extremely difficult job. </p>
<p>I hope that the surgeon you mentioned was able to come to terms with what happened in the end. It could really eat you up otherwise and question your skillset otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I wouldn't be mad at the surgeon... he did his best. But I would obsess over if I could find someone better. Who is the best brain surgeon?! It's great that with the internet you can find the best of everything, but applying that to this I predict I'd go crazy. I'd hunt down a list of names of the most famous brain surgeons and then not stop until I know my loved one was with the BEST. And if something went wrong all I would think about forever was what if, what if Doctor Strange, basically, had been the surgeon.</p>
<p>It's the &quot;what ifs&quot; that torture us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a slightly less deathly example, my mom had a brain tumor, but the way they had to remove it caused her to lose her ability to distinguish people talking in the background vs to her, so she hears everything at conversation level.  her ability to balance as well as she once could, is also gone slightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something similar happen visually after a traumatic brain injury.  All the peripheral stuff the brain usually ignores, mine wouldn't.  It took a year before I finally got back to as normal as I'll ever be. Oddly enough I also had balance issues.  I understand how difficult it was for your mother. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve had three brain surgeries with two different surgeons. One who I cried and hugged with when he saved my life and told me I wouldn’t be subject to my third brain surgery in 5 days. He is a genuine and pleasant person. The other who was very blunt and to the point and had little emotion. Only when he was clearing me for all activities and I asked him if I could have a beer did he show any. Loved both of them. One saved my life and one removed my brain tumor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's what you see in front of patients, and what you see away from patients. Some can have really good bedside manners, but are arrogant douchebags out of earshot, mocking amd ridiculing the patients behind their backs. And then there's how they treat other healthcare workers...</p>
<p>Obligatory - Some doctors are also as amazing as the appear to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they don’t have to be pleasant. The hospitals permit bad attitudes because “what are they going to do? Hire another incredibly talented brain surgeon?”</p>
<p>Many are awesome people, but the reality they spend very limited time in patient interfacing and most of their time with you is while you are unconscious.</p></div>		</li>
