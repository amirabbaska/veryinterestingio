			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up, the taste of something is only one component of the flavor of something. We can experience plenty of different flavors since it's the culmination of taste, texture, smell, and appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tongue map isn't real though, it was outed as a mistranslation from a German? textbook. The idea that we can only taste certain flavours on certain parts of our tongue isn't the case. You can check it by putting something sweet/sour anywhere and still note the taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We definitely CAN taste any flavor in really any part of the tongue, but there ARE parts of the tongue that are slightly better at one flavor over another, and you can also test that yourself. It is just pretty sublte and nothing like the perfectly demarcated map that people still imagine (this is the part that had been misinterpreted through an oversimplification and a mistranslation)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then wouldn't you say the &quot;five tastes&quot; theory is outdated and oversimplified, much like the five senses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the &quot;five tastes theory&quot; is really centered around the idea that there is a specific receptor for certain molecules, and when those receptors are activated the brain perceives a corresponding taste. There are <em>probably</em> more than the five receptors we've known about for a while (though it's important to note that umami wasn't even added until the mid-90's), but the science is still good regarding the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5 tastes is an over simplication. So yes. The way it works is the tongue has loads of receptor sites for an equally large amount of compounds which bind to these receptor sites. But the differences are for the most part very minute.<br />
On the other hand there are also other ways to experience food which do not fall into what would generally be considered taste (involving the tongue) and flavor (smell/retronasal olfaction). Such as pain, texture, and heat. While these seem very obvious, they are often over looked when it comes to food and how complexly they can alter the perception of food. Such as when some one says they like strawberries. Which can be fresh, frozen, flavored candy, dried, freeze dried, jellied, jam, as a hot topping, or sliced.<br />
The perception of food is a really exciting to dive into.</p></div>		</li>
