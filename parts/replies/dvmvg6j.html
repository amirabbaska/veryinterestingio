			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off this question, if dark matter has hardly interaction with baryonic matter, how can we be sure that slamming baryonic particles together will infer presence of dark matter? Maybe I'm largely misunderstanding this process, but I'm looking to get educated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't be sure. But you do it in the hope that it will. It would not be the first time that a new particle was discovered as missing energy/momentum. And if you don't see anything, you can at least set new upper limits on the strengths of possible interactions between hypothetical dark matter particles and hadronic matter, which helps constrain theories, which may eventually lead to some better ideas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think you are looking for interactions between dark matter and hadronic matter, you are looking to break down hadronic matter into it's constituent parts (quarks) with enough energy that they recombine as something else (potentially dark matter) and as you can't detect the dark matter, it will show up as missing momentum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting! What other examples are there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, you can't be sure. This is what we're testing and so far there's no evidence that we have created dark matter by colliding baryonic matter.</p>
<p>To go into this a bit further, we don't expect (from theoretical and astrophysical constraints) a lot of dark matter at colliders, but machines such as the LHC collide many protons together (more than 40 million collision per second) then we analyse these collisions, removing what we deem uninteresting for this particular search, and see if what we have left looks like we made dark matter.</p>
<p>The issue with this is there are many other things in the Standard Model of Particle Physics that can also look like dark matter in our detectors. A prime example is the Z boson decaying into two neutrinos. This looks exactly like dark matter in our detector, i.e. we have some missing momentum. So we have to make a prediction of how many collisions we expect where a Z decays into two neutrinos. We know a lot about the Z so we can make a good estimate of this and include a degree of uncertainty to our prediction. We do this to all Standard Model Physics that can look like a dark matter signal. Then we compare our estimation to the data and do a statistical analysis by asking if the data is consistent with our Standard Model prediction, or would it be more consistent with Standard Model + some dark matter events. Experimental results seems consistent with our Standard Model prediction.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the other answers, neutrinos were most famously detected as missing momentum and energy. </p>
<p>As for the interaction question, when you slam particles together extremely hard, energy of collision gets converted into matter, i.e. other particles that were not there before, particles not made of anything involved in the collision. So you get novel particles this way, including particles that are very hard to detect (neutrinos).</p>
<p>The idea is that dark matter is very weakly coupled with normal matter, but we're pouring an enormous amount of energy into it on the regular matter side of the equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's a plausible experiment to look for dark energy in a lab. It's uniform across space, so there's nothing to look for, it's what the vacuum looks like.</p>
<p>But experiments measuring the state of the universe are essentially looking into dark energy.</p></div>		</li>
