			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically it is all still &quot;you&quot; since there are smaller connections and pathways between both hemispheres. According to the current theories, memory doesn't live in one specific part of the brain so it's all technically still in there /somewhere/. If you want to know more about what each side of the brain can do independently, you can look up the WADA procedure. During this procedure they essentially anesthetize, or inhibit one hemisphere to see what the other hemisphere can accomplish independently (it lasts around 10 minutes). It has very interesting implications for language and language errors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;you&quot;. You are everything combined in your brain. If the parts split up, if they can split up, there is no part that becomes you because you are already 1000 different parts of a brain. The self is an illusion of sorts, or just the final result in a long string of calculations.</p></div>		</li>
