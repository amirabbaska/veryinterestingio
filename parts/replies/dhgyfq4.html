			<div class="markdown"><p>ayeee. just so people realize...higher government debt=higher private savings. Deficit hawks don't make much sense once you realize that debt is basically a savings account for investors.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Obviously when you take it to the extreme, a monstrous national debt would be bad, but in general it's a good thing since both the government and the public benefit from the debt. In my opinion, it's a topic that has become far too politicized simply because it's something that's very easy for politicians to talk about since everybody has experience with debt. People freak out when a politician says something like, &quot;We owe the Chinese $4 trillion in out national debt,&quot; because it sounds like the Chinese will start foreclosing the White House. But it would probably be more accurate to say: &quot;The Chinese have invested $4 trillion into our Treasury.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if credit card companies offered people unlimited money for 2% a year, you'd be dumb not to take the money if you had some self control.  You could invest it for more than that and make money off the whole thing.  The same goes with the US.  If we can take the money and create a larger economic return from building a new bridge or something, it is a win for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it's a non-issue, it's just not as bad (yet) as some would make it out to be. The US needs debt, treasuries are a cornerstone of the global economy. That said a problem arises when servicing a debt becomes too expensive, but were not at that point - or close to it really. Expanding debt coupled with sluggish growth is a bad thing in the long term. </p>
<p>Is it a pressing issue? No. But it's important to keep our eye on it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ayeee. Just so people know, higher deficits and increasing debts mean the government has more fiscal obligations, which could very well mean a need for more tax revenue if it gets too high, which ultimately means you take home even less pay!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when governments that control the currency the bond is denominated in, they can always print money to pay off the bonds in the event of financial collapse, so they are safe even then.  The only way the US would default is if our congressmen are idiotic and let it happen willingly.  However, countries like Greece don't control their currency, since they do not have the authority to print Euros at will.  Additionally, other countries also issue some bonds in USD to attract investors that are wary of currency risk, and they obviously can't print dollars to cover those bonds.  </p></div>		</li>
