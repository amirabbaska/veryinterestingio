			<div class="markdown"><p>While it can vary depending on the state you live in, State Police will work any accident on a state highway that is outside of a city.</p>
<p>For instance, Highway 223 in Anytown? Anytown PD works that. Right outside Anytown on the same highway? State Police. County will work it for state if they don’t have anyone available.</p>
<p>As far as being “in charge” goes, no agency has more law enforcement authority in their jurisdiction than the county sheriff and his deputies, even a state trooper. Having said that, if a county deputy is involved in an officer involved shooting, an investigator from the state police will handle the investigation.</p></div>		</li>
