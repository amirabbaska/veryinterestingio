			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing as how all the structural and mechanical metal in your car (frame, suspension, doors, engine block, etc...) is connected to the negative (-) terminal on your battery, and all of your electronics in the car are also attached to that same battery, well... the entire car would act as a huge antenna during an EMP event. The only practical way to protect your vehicles would be to is to park them underground and never drive them.</p>
<p>If you're just worried about not having wheels after a nuclear apocalypse, either get really good at riding a bike or learn how to hotwire old cars from the 1970's and earlier. Car manufacturers <em>really</em> ramped up putting computers into cars in the mid 80's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the Hollywood hype is exaggerated.  </p>
<p>First there are several different type of EMP.  Only one type is broadly destructive but it also requires a special type of nuclear weapon detonation and particular ICBM capabilities to place the device into the right location for it to be so broad.  Most nuclear explosions power levels decline by classical 1/r^(2) so that not far from it, the effects are negligible.</p>
<p>EMP generally will NOT affect most vehicles.  It also will NOT affect most small, battery-power electronics like cell phones.  </p>
<p><strong>The #1 at-risk technology with EMP/CME is the power grid</strong> and items connected to the grid WITHOUT hardening.  Everything else is far less at risk.  Simple military-style hardening techniques will work for most other electronics - many of which are similar to what is used in surge protectors but on steroids.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. CME is a cause of geomagnetic storm which is what is responsible for the &quot;geomagnetic induced current&quot; which is the cause of the electrical effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes in the sense both are the result of a magnetic disturbance from the sun. A solar flare is mostly energy and x-rays while a CME ejects atomic particles (protons and electrons). Both can originate from the same event but they affect earth differently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EMP is not defined by what it can affect. A pulse in the form of a magnetic field will be drastically different from an electric field.  It would be very impractical to create a faraday cage that can protect (shield, attenuate, isolate) against most forms of an EMP. </p></div>		</li>
