			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been studies done and the speed that is most widely used is the maximum speed where the vast majority feel comfortable.</p>
<p>If you increase the speed there is gonna a steep increase in people who feel uncomfortable and might lose their balance etc.</p>
<p>There is also a wide range of people using escalators, anything from small children to the elderly, it needs to be accessible for as many as possible.</p></div>		</li>
