			<div class="markdown"><p>You could look into a quick video about Kohler curves, they describe the growth rate of rain drops based on what the general chemical make up of them is (whether they're mostly potassium, nitrogen, etc.). Pretty good visual and helps understand the concept too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wasn't a very good answer.</p>
<p>You can get rain just fine without &quot;clashing air masses.&quot;  Violent supercells can form in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones when conditions are right, far away from &quot;clashing air masses.&quot;  And winds are caused by the pressure gradient force, not temperature differences.</p>
<p>The difference you're asking about is the difference between what we call &quot;stratiform&quot; and &quot;convective&quot; precipitation.  Basically, the difference is in the strength of the upward motion of the system.  Upward motion cools the air, and as the air cools, the water condenses out of it.  In stratiform precip, which comes from stratus clouds, the upward motions are very gentle.  Rain doesn't have to grow very large for its weight to be enough that the updraft can't hold it anymore.  In convective precip (cumulonimbus clouds) the updrafts are very strong, and can hold the water aloft longer.  The water has to get heavier before it can fall.  If the updraft is strong enough, the water can even freeze and have to grow to be hail to fall.</p>
<p>That's the difference in a nutshell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this even what you're asking?</p>
<p>The answer beyond this is a simple physics question: mass of the droplets. Larger and smaller droplets (barring wind resistance a little) will fall at the same speed, but due to mass, one will collide with the ground with more energy. </p>
<p>Heavier objects impart more force as they collide, though the speed is the same. </p></div>		</li>

<p>air will condense more quickly, the rain falls faster and harder,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>faster? why? and what about faster condensation makes the droplets of water 'fall harder'? Are they larger a result?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more down to the time it has to coalesce. If a strong updraft holds liquid water up longer it has more time to coalesce with other droplets. I suppose droplets would also continue to act as a nucleation site for the conversion of gas to liquid which would allow the drops to grow bigger. With the bigger mass it falls with more force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is what the  op referred to, but I have many times noticed very tiny raindrops falling quite slowly, pushed around by by eddies and behaving much more like snowflakes. This may probably be primarily due to small updrafts but perhaps also the physics of very small water droplets in the compressed gas environment of our atmosphere results in small droplets being less dense (in terms of the surface area to mass ratio) than larger ones, and therefore more subject air resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, does that imply then that a hurricane is actually a very large pocket of cooler atmosphere and this is why warm water causes it to strengthen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, from what I understand, it's the opposite (someone please correct me if I'm mistaken here):  it all starts when warm, moist air meets a mass of cooler, drier air over land.  The temperature difference generates a rain storm.  If the temperature difference is big enough, it becomes a thunderstorm.  </p>
<p>The storm them moves out over the ocean.  If it happens to cross over an area of water that is warmer than usual, the excess heat from the water ends up in the air, increasing the temperature difference.  </p>
<p>If the storm is big enough, and the warm area of ocean is large enough, the process becomes self-sustaining, and no longer needs the atmospheric temperature difference--the layer of air over the ocean becomes significantly warmer than the layers above it, and this is enough to drive the storm.</p>
<p>Warm air rises, leaving an area of lower pressure at the surface.  As the old saying goes, &quot;nature abhors a vacuum,&quot; so cooler air surrounding the low-pressure center flows in to balance it out--but this cool air picks up heat from the water, so it, too, begins to rise, which causes the low-pressure center to grow:  it both spreads out, so to speak, and its pressure gets lower, drawing in more surrounding air from a larger area.</p>
<p>If the low covers enough of the Earth's surface, the Coriolis Effect kicks in, and it begins to rotate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the air near the center of the low is warm, wet, and rising.  As it rises, it cools.  When it's temperature drops to the Dew point, the moisture it's carrying condensed--and this is where the fecal matter hits the turbine blades.  In order to condense, water vapor has to give up heat to the environment--which is the air that is carrying it.  This re-heats the air, causing it to rise even higher, which causes it to pull on the air beneath it, which strengthens the low pressure center.</p>
<p>Once the system is rotating, it will self-organize into a spiral surrounding an eye.  When the sustained winds hit 74 mph/118 kph it is classified as a hurricane.</p>
<p>Edit:  was thinking in knots, typed miles per hour. Was the wrong number either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water temp must be 26Â°c or above. A low pressure system overhead will drag in the moisture and heat from the surrounding atmosphere, as the height of the storm increases, the temperature differential will increase causing conditions to deteriorate further. Land fall will see the formation dissapate as the moisture source is extinguished </p></div>		</li>
