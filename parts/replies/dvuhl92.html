			<div class="markdown"><p>It just has to be tall. It also has to be large as there is so much to cool. The shape reduces the area (material costs) while still maintaining structural integrity, a large height and area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dosent it increase the surface area? Wouldn't that be an increase in material?</p>
<p>If I measured a cylinder that is 100 from tall, the measurement would be straight up.</p>
<p>If I then made a hyperpolic tower that is 100 feet tall and measured it straight up from the ground it would also be 100 feet tall. </p>
<p>Now if I took a tape measure and followed the curve along the tower to the top it would be more than 100 feet in length.</p>
<p>I'm just confused how that's less material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warmer air always rises when compared to surrounding air of a lower temperature. </p>
<p>Warm water enters the top of the tower and is distributed over the full inside the tower. The towers are open at the bottom. The warm water warms the air inside the tower. There’s so much air rising out of the tower that it creates a vacuum effect and sucks the outside cooler air in at the bottom openings. </p>
<p>That’s what creates the draft. </p>
<p>The water that comes in warm eventually loses temperature due to the draft. The water can approach, but can’t get lower than the outside ambient air’s wet bulb temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hyperboloid is what mathematicians call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface" target="_blank">doubly-ruled surface</a>. There are two specific directions in which a line along the surface is straight in 3-D space.</p>
<p>Informally, you could say that if you move along the right diagonal, the horizontal and vertical curvature cancel each other out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is something the shape of a hyperboloid able to be constructed with straight beams if a cylinder can’t? A hyperboloid (at least the cooling tower kind) is essentially a cylinder with a “pinched” middle. I don’t know why but <em>that</em> statement interested me.</p>
<p>Edit: NVM. I see some similar questions you answered with links. I’ll follow some of those and see what I find unless you care to answer specifically about construction. Thank you.</p>
<p>Edit 2: ...and one of your other links was THE answer I was looking for. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a cylinder, you can use straight beams in one direction: straight along the axis. Because the straight beams run in only one direction, the curved ribs have to be structural.</p>
<p>In a hyperboloid, the straight beams run along two different diagonals, giving you a stable structure without having to put any  structural loads on the curved surface.</p></div>		</li>
