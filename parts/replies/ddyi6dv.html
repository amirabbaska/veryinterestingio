			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, and I do agree with your perspective. Thank you (to everyone) who has responded to this thread and has helped to shed light on this subject. I definitely want to continue learning more about the long term effects to our ecosystem and how we can advocate for a better alternative. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to it. The reason coal was specifically chosen is due to the decline in coal over the years. For whatever reason, towns that house coal mines tend to not have much else as far as employment. They are banana republics in a sense. So when the whole mine shuts down or scales back, it hits the sorrounding town very hard. Deregulating coal in order to make it cheaper and more desirable is an attempt to put a band aid on that problem. </p>
<p>In my oppinion it misses the real issue. it's a waste and it only prolongs the inevitable at the cost of the environment and ecosystems for potentially thousands of miles. Something certainly should be done to help those whose livelyhoods are affected by a relatively sudden decline in coal, but deregulation as a bail out to a clearly dying industry is not the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally these rules or lack thereof are directly benefiting a company that has a strong political interest. Let me give you an example from North Carolina.  Duke energy has largely been allowed to dump toxic coal ash into our streams and rivers with nearly zero consequences.  We are talking about pollution that will likely persist for generations. It was massive and on purpose. Even after public outcry they will likely be allowed to raise utility rates to cover the cost of the slap-wrist fines.  The increased  utility rates won't sink following paying off fines so this will provide long term profit increases.   Most of this occurred while a former Duke energy executive was Governor of our state.  At the same time our state was trying to heavily regulate solar farms because they said they damaged the environment.  It's a wild ride in North Carolina.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not forget that the reason we have these regulations is because at some point, someone decided that it was okay to pass along diseased or rotten food, putting your health at risk, so that they could turn a profit. </p>
<p>We also have &quot;regulations&quot; that prevent my fledgling looting and pillaging business from taking off.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, what I think the parent commenter ignores is that regulations <em>do</em> cost money to comply with and that <em>does</em> impact growth and hiring. It's just that we often find that trade off worth it. </p></div>		</li>
