			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, some guy posted a weird answer below which seems really really off, but someone replied saying it wasn't totally wrong. Im kinda curious, wanna chime in? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5j99px/eli5_why_do_radio_waves_pass_through_walls_while/dbf6qd7/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5j99px/eli5_why_do_radio_waves_pass_through_walls_while/dbf6qd7/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure what they're talking about, they sound a bit confused. However what I think they're talking about is how, when a ray of light hits an atom or molecule with a vibrational or electron energy level that is raised by the same amount as the energy of that ray of light, the light can be absorbed (and then later re-emitted, generally at a lower energy). The thing they're talking about at the end sounds to me like a way of explaining ray paths through quantum theory but that's just making things unnecessarily complex and I'm not really sure they understand it properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fantastic answer, explains both why shorter wavelengths (like X-rays) can pass through a solid object, and why longer wavelengths (like sound, or radio as you say) can pass through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound waves behave fundamentally different than electromagnetic waves. Them being able to penetrate walls isn't really connected to their wavelength. Additionally Ultrasound can also have very small wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physics are different sure, but is the observation the same ?  I.e. that sound waves (wavelength about an inch up to 50 feet) are absorbed or reflected by materials that have a characteristic structure of about the same wavelength ?</p>
<p>It fits with the observation that it's much harder to sound-proof for low frequencies (wavelength on the order of metres) then it is for high frequencies.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's only true for absorption, not reflection.  A hard, smooth surface can reflect sound with a relatively long wavelength compared to the features of it's fine-grained surface.  However that's only true if the surface is supported rigidly and resists vibration in resonance with the sound.  Perhaps the complete rigid structure has to have a characteristic scale similar to the sound wavelength.</p>
<p>Edit: in other words Chlorophilia's observation is about wave behaviour.  Waves of whatever sort, including electromagnetic waves and pressure waves.</p>
<p>Another edit re ultrasound: I think the observation still fits.  The homogenous volumes of organs are relatively transparent to the ultrasound, one could say this is because they have a structure much finer than the sound wavelength.  Tissues of different density within and between organs form boundaries that reflect, absorb or refract the sound, and I suspect these boundary features must have a characteristic scale similar to the wavelength to be imaged.  Certainly the wavelength is a limiting factor, it's short by design, if it were longer the resolution of the resulting images would suffer.</p></div>		</li>
