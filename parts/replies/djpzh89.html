			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the same explanation you'd get in a high school or freshman physics class. You definitely don't need to be a graduate student to understand statics. But yeah, it's off the mark for a five year old. It's hard to do a thorough explanation while answering the question at its most simple level. I think the top comment does a fine job at explaining. I just wanted to add my 2Â¢ in case anyone wanted a slightly more advanced answer. </p></div>		</li>
