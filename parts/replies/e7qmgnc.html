<p>OP is asking about the cold shock response, which is the odd and seemingly-counterproductive reflex that causes people to inhale when their whole body is suddenly submerged in cold water. It's a common cause of drowning. </p>
<p>The mammalian dive reflex is the more-understandable opposing reflex that causes people's respiration and heart rate to slow when their face is submerged in water. It acts to prevent drowning. </p>
<p>The gasp reflex is the reflex that eventually forces people to inhale when they've been holding their breath for a long time, which is what can cause people to drown in warm water. </p></div>		</li>
