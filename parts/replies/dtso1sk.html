			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks very much for the information. I have a few questions if you have the time?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have a viral respiratory syndrome like the flu, your body mounts a widespread inflammatory response to fight it, which basically manifests as a fever. Sometimes, the rate at which your temperature rises, or even extremely high temperatures can cause mental status changes, muscle breakdown, and a disruption of normal bodily functions. But usually the fever is just a normal part of the anti-inflammatory process. For the majority of times you have the fever, its safe and normal, but it will make you feel like crap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So can anything really be done about this? Even in a hospital setting? Or is this one of those things where if the reaction just happens to be severe enough you automatically die?</p>
<p>Also, if there any way to prevent aspiration into the lungs, or is that just something that's almost always going to happen?</p>
<p>And finally, is someone with a 'better' immune system more at risk from the immune response, or is it more just sort of random?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey no prob. For the fever, i’m gonna make up a number, but i’d say &gt;95% of all fevers are okay. Really. A lot of people come in saying they have a fever, but that’s just your body doing what it needs to do. For kids, if a fever is CONSTANT for &gt;4 days we have to consider a few bad things. Also people with AIDS, people on chemotherapy, or people with immune deficiencies can have complications from just fever itself. And yes, there are things to do about it like immunoglobulin therapy, but seriously, for the average person, don’t even worry about that. </p>
<p>Aspiration into the lungs unfortunately you just gotta sit these people up, put them on a nasal cannula for oxygen, and hope they don’t aspirate. If they are very high risk for aspirating or can’t “protect their airway” as we say, then we sedate and paralyze the patient and put them on a ventilator for their own safety. But of course, in very specific situations, usually in stroke parients who can’t control how they swallow.</p>
<p>The immune system, anyone with an adequate immune system, like i said before, if you don’t have AIDS, are not on chemo, or don’t have genetic immunodeficienciesike agammaglobulinemia, then you will respond to the flu as predicted 99% of the time. </p>
<p>Here’s the real ELI5. Your body turns up the temp as a gamble. It gambles that the virus is more likely to die under the inflammatory conditions rather than your good cells. So the fever itself is just a natural process that almost always works in the end.</p>
<p>Unfortunately young babies and old people can’t regulate that inner body thermostat well and can fry too many of their own normal functioning instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I just had flu and still recovering but back then decided to let fever ride up. Highest was 38.8 degreese (celsius).
Tho I have few questions.
Alot ppl here  mention cytokine storm developing in influenza infection. So when does it occure the most? Can it occure without any flu complication like penumonia?
What is usually the deal with all young people (20s; 30s) dying from influenza, is it complication or do their bodies just shut down when encountering newer strain of flu or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mind commenting more about the mucus? I have been feeling fine but just before bed, as in as I lay down, my nose would get runny, a few blows and would be good. In the morning, I would be coughing up crap. I found if I brushed my teeth minutes before bed, I would have no mucus. But if I didn't brush, or brush an hour+ before, I would have some.</p></div>		</li>
