			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact:</p>
<p>The term &quot;factoid&quot; was coined in 1973 by American writer Norman Mailer to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true, or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print. Since its creation in 1973, the term has evolved, now often being used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be smaller facts than a bit though.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a die, or some other process which generates the numbers 1 to 6 with equal probability. Then if you communicate the fact that the die did not take the value 1 you have communicated much less information than is contained in a bit.</p>
<p>There is no quantum or minimum amount of information (unless the set of false but possible things is finite).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I were to guess, most shoe leather is of the chrome-tanned variety which is largely impermeable to water. So the material itself wouldn’t break down, and chrome-tanned leather also maintains its shape in water. Glued shoes didn’t become a thing until 1910 and took a while to become the dominant method of making shoes, so it’s safe to say that only a handful could have been glued, the rest would be of the stitched or riveted-and-stitched variety. Riveted shoes (the ones with “brass tacks” although early shoe rivets would have been iron) are made in such a way that the rivets themselves are covered by other leather that prevents the exposure of the rivets. Machine sewn shoes had been around for about 70 years and had actually taken off quite quickly, and allowed for incredibly tightly stitched leather (compared to hand stitched shoes). These nailed/tacked/riveted shoes would have held together quite well and have only minimal exposure to the rivets themselves which would delay the timeline on rusting through. So it would take a very long time for the material to become unrecognizable as as the material, and if left relatively undisturbed, would more-or-less retain its shape.</p></div>		</li>
