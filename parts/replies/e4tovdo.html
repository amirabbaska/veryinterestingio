			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  I've always put my weight on in the legs, butt, and chest area.  I'm a guy.  I'm muscular, but if I gain fat, that's where it goes.  What gives?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why is there such a difference in body type within the same gender? For instance, my mother always has very thin legs and arms but if she gains weight it almost all goes on her torso. When I gain weight, it's the opposite pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both genders have varying levels of estrogen and testosterone. You likely have higher estrogen levels than your mother. </p>
<p>As you age you may notice a shift towards storing more weight centrally as your estrogen levels wane. Just as when men age, they tend to gain more weight, and store some of it on their chests, as their testosterone wanes.</p>
<p>Central obesity is highly correlated with diabetes and heart disease, so make sure your mother is eating right and getting enough exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mom may have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome" target="_blank">metabolic syndrome</a>, which is kind of a roundabout way of saying she's diabetic. She probably has fat on her arms and legs, but her muscles are atrophied. Making it look like she has thin arms and legs. About 25% of Americans have it.</p>
<p>On the extreme end there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing%27s_syndrome" target="_blank">cushing's syndrome</a>. Which is characterized by abdominal obesity with thin arms and legs. It's kind of like advanced metabolic syndrome, but it's caused by problems with adrenal glands rather than poor diet and lifestyle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, she's overall slim and as she has another (unrelated) health condition her bloods get done relatively frequently so no diabetes. She doesn't have a large stomach, it's just that weight gain focuses on the centre of her body when she gains weight, whereas my weight gain focuses away from the torso when I gain weight. Both of us are slim, we just have a different body shape.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/oct-10-genetics-of-being-apple-shaped-or-pear-shaped" target="_blank">Just found this, which may shed some light</a>. I'm hourglass shaped (which is closer to pear-shaped in this description), my mother is apple shaped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Goddamn how I wish my lack of six-pack turned women on. I have cut and cut and cut to the point it hurts to sit down because I have zero ass, and it hurts to walk because my feet are nothing but bones and cartiledge. The fat on my stomach looks like Justin Timberlake trying to hide Janet Jacksons titty. Fuck that guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you need to build some muscle in those areas. I also need unsustainably low body fat to completely banish my gut. Having a muscular physique with a bit of stomach flab is a reasonable compromise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are at a healthy BMI and your overall fat % is low, and you still have accumulation of fat in an area, the only thing really you can do is get liposuction to get rid of it. You'd actually the ideal candidate for lipo.</p></div>		</li>
