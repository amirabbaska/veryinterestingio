			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I was studying meteorology in the early 90s, there were no web sites. Instead, national and world weather maps were faxed every 4 hours to thousands of sites around the US by the National Weather Service. Receiving sites had to have a fax machine printing operating 24/7.</p>
<p>A guy in our department had the primary job of pulling the faxes out -- 30 or 40 with each cycle -- and mounting them up on a big board in our main lobby. He even had to mount the ones received overnight, because in order to see weather trends you had to flip through the last 24 or 48 hours of maps. That's how we produced an &quot;animated&quot; weather map.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been looking at your graph for ten minutes and I still have no idea what's going on. What is the blue line? What is the red line? Where are these poles you're talking about? What portions of this graph are the temperature differences you're talking about? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way:
weather activity around the world is basically energy balancing itself out spatially; greater imbalances in energy result in more turbulent exchange of that energy as it moves around the planet, bigger storms, higher winds, and larger localized temperature swings. </p>
<p>The graph indicates average daily insolation, (energy per second per meter squared) from the sun. Greater insolation values will raise the temperature of an area faster.</p>
<p>Look only at the red line (summer solstice in the northern hemisphere). The insolation received by the equator (where latitude = 0) is around 400 w/m^2, while it's about 500 w/m^2 at the actual north pole, and 0 w/m^2 at the south pole. So, the north pole is receiving a lot of energy in the summer time, while land on the equator at that same time is receiving about 100 w/m^2 less. Compare that to the gradient in the southern hemisphere at the same time (which is the winter solstice there) and the equator receives 400 w/m^2 while  the pole receives zero. The energy imbalance is much much greater on the side of the earth experiencing winter, and so the exchange of energy is more turbulent, producing more widely varied local conditions that change more rapidly in the higher winds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blue line is the solar profile during the winter solstice and the red is the summer (defined as winter and summer in the northern hemisphere)</p>
<p>The poles are at either end, the x-axis is latitude so the left side is the South Pole and the right side is the North Pole.</p>
<p>Look at the red line (summer) for example. The point here is the right side (North Pole) is about 500 which is only slightly higher than the middle (equater) at about 400, but the left side (South Pole) is much lower at 0.</p>
<p>So in summer: (0&gt;&gt;400&gt;500) South &gt;&gt; equater &gt; North.
There is a much larger temperature difference between pole and equater in a hemisphere's winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blue line shows how much energy from the sun is received on a 1-square-meter patch (the &quot;Insolation&quot;)  at the northern hemisphere Winter Solstice, Dec 21. </p>
<p>On the far left is the -90 latitude, the Earth's south pole. During the Winter Solstice, the south pole has 24 hours of sunlight so insolation on that patch is high. </p>
<p>Move the patch north, to +90 latitude, the north pole. During the Winter Solstice, there is NO direct sunlight above about 66 deg latitude as the sun never comes above the horizon, so insolation is zero.</p>
<p>The red line is the northern hemisphere Summer Solstice, Jun 21. It's the opposite of the Winter Solstice. </p>
<p>Not pictured is the insolation across the latitudes at the equinoxes (March &amp; September), when the insolation is a symmetric curve that goes to near zero at the poles and a high value at the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem very knowledgeable about this so you'll probably have at least a basic answer for. It seems like the temperature volatility in each season is getting worse than it used to be. I feel like I'm seeing &quot;New Record High/Low Temperature&quot; almost every summer and winter. Am I imagining these changes or are they as noticeable and severe as I seem to be seeing?</p></div>		</li>
