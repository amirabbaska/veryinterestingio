			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great analogy. I have often explained it to others like waking up with a cold, wet blanket that you wear all day and look into a world of color and wonder whats wrong with them? What's wrong with me? Time doubles and triples. There seems like an endless stream of the same reoccurring days</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Time doubles and triples.&quot;  Very true.  And yet the moments of peace (if you get them) pass in a flash.</p>
<p>I also like the endless stream of the same reoccurring days.  Reminds me of the film Groundhog Day.  There was a patch in the middle when Bill Murray seemed to be sinking into a terrible depression.  Maybe that would work as an analogy for some.</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p></div>		</li>
