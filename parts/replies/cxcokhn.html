If we to extract deuterium from regular drinking water, is the remaining liquid still usable? Could we potentially run into water shortages from large scale deuterium extraction in the distant future?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deuterium is not a necessary part of drinking water. If the process contaminates the water in some other way, there might be a problem, but if it's somehow just removing deuterium, it would be fine.</p>
<p>That said, we would likely want to extract from sea water, not drinking water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, seawater is a better source of heavy water because heavy water is slightly less likely to evaporate than light water, and thus is slightly less abundant in precipitation, ie the source of fresh water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It produces wayyy more energy, the problem is not initiating the fusion reaction nor getting the fuel; its sustaining it and harvesting the energy it produces thats the problem.</p>
<p>For reference, to electrolyse 1 mole of hydrogen from water it costs about 220kJ. Since heavy water is about a hundred times rarer in production samples, 22000kJ is required to produce 1 mole of dueterium(2) Since you only need 2 atoms for the fusion reaction, this is fine. The energy produced from a D-D fusion reaction per atom is 2.26picoJoules, or 6.022e23*2.26e-12 per mole. This comes to 1.36 net terrajoules per mole of Dueterium. Most of the energy used up is to constantly superheat the fuel and contain the plasma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is of course at 100% efficiency. The real world values would be much lower but still considerably much more energy generated than needed to produce the dueterium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Tsar_Bomba" target="_blank">Tsar Bomba</a> was a great example of a man-made fusion reaction!  Unfortunately, it was a bit too violent for our tastes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. We know exactly how much energy the fusion reaction itself would produce, and it's an incredibly high amount (I don't have a figure off the top of my head). The two main concerns, however, are the energy required to contain and initiate the fusion (something made very easy with the enourmous gravitational pressures inside the Sun, but significantly harder to reach those temperatures and pressures here on Earth), and also how to harvest useful energy out of the plasma without destroying all of our machinery. Those are the issues that have made fusion &quot;20 years away&quot; for the last 50 years.</p></div>		</li>
