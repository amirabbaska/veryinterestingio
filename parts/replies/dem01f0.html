			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus rotates once every 243 earth-days.  This slow rate of rotation is  due to tidal effects, and according to <a href="https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/venus/V3.html" target="_blank">this</a> bit from NASA the slow rate of rotation may be one of the things preventing magnetic field production by the core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it also doesn't have a liquid iron core. So even if it was spinning faster, its magnetic field would be weaker. Unless that spin could created enough heat from friction to maintain a liquid core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read, Venus is expected to have a partially liquid iron core, rather like earth's in the broad sense.  Not that we'll know for sure until somebody puts seismic probes on the surface.  At any rate the planet is <em>quite</em> clearly still very hot inside, and there's evidence of major periodic volcanic activity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Venus, unlike earth, does not have a strong magnetic field or a magnosphere. Without it, large quantities of hydrogen is lost to solar wind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect reasoning. </p>
<p>It turns out that Earth loses almost the exact same amount of hydrogen as Venus does. Our magnetic field does very little to prevent hydrogen loss, and in certain cases actually hastens it (polar outflow, charge exchange, and heated ionosphere). </p>
<p>This is because hydrogen is such a light molecule that it can gain escape velocity from thermal energy alone via Jeans escape. There's no need for the extra energy from the solar wind for hydrogen escape; it can do it by itself just by virtue of being at the temperature of the upper atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
