<p>I think they account for indigestible fiber in food by subtracting it from their calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back on /u/jppianoguy 's correct response, once you leave the realm of &quot;food&quot; you don't really use the term &quot;Calorie&quot; anymore. In the realm of food, it's about how much energy your body absorbs, and not about how much energy an object has. In terms of dealing with the latter, people use &quot;Joules&quot; which is similarly a term to describe the amount of energy.</p>
<p>For instance, you can find out how many &quot;Calories&quot; are in a liter of gasoline. The energy density of gasoline is 45 megajoules/kg, which translates to about 10,922 Calories/kg, which translates to about 8,410 Calories per liter of gasoline. </p>
<p>To put this in perspective, one liter of gasoline has the same amount of energy as ~15 Big Macs. You can eat one or the other and get the same amount of &quot;energy&quot; from both <em>if</em> your body was able to perfectly absorb all of that energy. However, if you drank a liter of gasoline, you would not gain 8410 calories; you would instead die. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can figure out how much energy is released when you burn a chair, yes.</p>
<p>But this does not equal the amount of food energy a human could get from eating the chair.</p>
<p>Assuming of course you mean a wooden chair and plastic or metal.</p></div>		</li>
