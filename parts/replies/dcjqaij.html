			<div class="markdown"><p>Germans are afraid of hyperinflation for historical reasons and they have a lot of sway with the ECB and politically lower interest, inflation, is a tough sell. The ECB reacted to the financial crisis when it was too late and had to over correct with negative rates to avoid deflation. Rather than increase government spending the Germans pushed for austerity measures on themselves and other countries which slowed growth in the EU and created a double dip recession. Brexit could be justified had the British pushed for the opposite but they had similar policies. In fact, the justification for keeping the pound was the belief that Europe could not be trusted to agree on using fiscal policy to combat recessions. While the French had it right from the start.</p>
<p>The US lowered interest rates and increased government spending to bring down the rate of persistent unemployment in the aftermath of the recession. In general people in countries with stronger unions were more insulated from the impact than those in other countries without unions. The US does not have a lot of unions so business get back on hiring and increased layoffs which slowed growth despite the government getting the monetary and fiscal policy right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it was currency related.  When they all had separate currencies and a crisis like that hit, then the Greek drachma, Spanish peseta and even Italian lira would have depreciated relative to the German mark.  Instead their sovereign debt was in Euros, but local prices and wages were high relative to Germany and they had to undergo contractionary austerity to make their debt payments.  Even a 20-30% swing would have given southern European economies the breathing room to handle the crisis better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Germany's economy was far more solid and controlled in the lead up to the financial crises. Greece, for example, already had a ton of problems before the crisis hit (but was, to some extend, able to cover those up), then when the crisis hit, they were hit hard, and strategies they could've used in the past to minimise the impact were no longer available to them because they were no longer in control of their own coin / were beholden to EU policies. </p></div>		</li>
