			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, genes that code for proteins that are necessary for an organism's survival are far less likely to experience a successful mutation than a non-essential gene. </p>
<p>For instance, the series of genes coding for the small ribosomal sub-unit is less likely to experience a functional mutation than say the series of genes coding for eye colour. The reason for this is that the small ribosomal sub-unit performs a highly specific function in the body (translating RNA into proteins), and if mutated it is unlikely that it will be able to &quot;do its job&quot; properly any longer. The genes coding for eye colour don't really perform a critical function within the body, and as a result a mutation in these genes is less likely to impact the organism's ability to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If the mutated ribosomal sub-unit were not functional the embryo would be unable to grow because it can't properly produce the proteins that it needs to grow and survive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Organisms can get around this via gene duplication events. Allowing one of the copies to mutate without damaging the fitness of the organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true! I was speaking in a more generalized sense regarding functional single-copy genes, but gene duplication is a very interesting concept with a massive evolutionary significance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, you should also note that many copies of the same gene mean that one can fail/change and the others can retain function. Dogs have this &quot;slippery genome&quot; (google it) to a degree, which is why they can undergo such rapid physical changes in one generation while cats cannot, for example. </p></div>		</li>
