			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your, and everyone else's, answer! :D</p>
<p>A few follow up questions (really for anyone, but I'm highjacking the top comment) since I'm a layman in all things science... Have we been able to observe the speed of light in Interstellar space with Voyager I? Is there any change at all since our Solar System Space is more dense then Interstellar Space? Would something like Dark Matter affect the speed of light?</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who answered :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if voyager emits a signal at 1 pm voyager time and it takes 20 minutes to reach Earth, what time would it be at Earth when it reaches us? What would the effect of the signal travelling at light speed for 20 minutes be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't the clock on voyager fall behind Earth time due to the speed of the probe? I assume the solution would be to adjust for the relativistic effect on the clock, just like the GPS/Glonass systems do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all the speed of light does change depending on what medium it is traveling through. The universal constant <em>e</em> you are referring to is light's speed through a vacuum. So yes, any matter can affect the speed of light. I don't know if dark matter is observed to do so but I am guessing no since it is generally non-interactive except for its large scale gravitational effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and yes.</p>
<p>Key to understanding the speed of light light as a constant is to understand that it's the speed everything's always traveling.</p>
<p>A simplified example is to imagine a 2 dimensional graph with space and time as the axes.  Now imagine a quarter-circle from the origin point where the exes intersect connecting the two axes - that circle represents the speed of light.  Everything in the universe is traveling the speed of light, so it's somewhere on that radius, but it may be traveling more quickly across time or space.  The faster you move through space, the slower you move through time relative to everything else.  </p>
<p>If you move across space at the speed of light, then you don't move through time at all and the universe will age infinitely fast around you.  If you don't move through space at all, you travel the speed of light through time and to an outside observer YOU will age infinitely fast.</p>
<p>All of that was discounting gravity, which distorts space and time similar to a third axis, and then it starts getting really complicated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the part that I've wondered about,  I don't often hear about gravity affecting light unless it's in relation to a black hole.  Is there any measurement or successful study in this respect? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that if a particle moves at exactly the maximum c and no gravity interference, it would be undetectable as everything else would be going through time infinitely fast? Same with the perfectly still particle, impossible to ever reach it through time, so it is also undetectable?</p>
<p>On a less serious note - these two kind of particles sound very lonely and now I never want to reach the speed of light, if this is true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So you would predict that, as you look out across the universe, the spectral lines of atoms should shift by <some function>. Then you take spectroscopic measurements of distant stars and galaxies. If the spectra differ by your prediction, and can't be explained by other competing ideas, including the current models, then it supports your theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the spectra do differ.  The inflationary model was created to explain the red shift, but we can't actually measure the speed at which the Horsehead Nebula (for example) is moving away from us.  Is it possible that it's not moving away from us at all, and the red shift is because the speed of light is different in that part of the universe than this one?  Or is there some observation which eliminates that as a possibility?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, they do differ. Hence why I added &quot;can't be explained by other competing ideas.&quot; When you measure spectra of atoms moving away from you, you measure a red shift. When you measure spectra of atoms at the bottom of a tall tower, you measure a red shift. Relativity provides a precise mathematical description that matches our experiments for how much red shift you should observe both from motion and changes in &quot;the metric&quot; (how space and time change with relation to position in space and time).</p>
<p>So what your experiment would need to do is to show <em>different</em> spectral shifts than that predicted by relativity alone. </p>
<p>And note, I just used this example as one simple, but real world-ish example. A variable speed of light theory may have entirely different predictions than spectral shifting, <em>per se</em>. I don't know what those predictions are, since I only really learned what we scientifically think to be true, and not the several scientific ideas we no longer think can be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relationship between redshift and distance isn't something that physicists have simply hypothesized and said &quot;Sure, that must be true.&quot; There's a whole sequence of techniques that overlap, from parallax to the use of standard candles like Cepheid variables to redshift (nice video <a href="https://vimeo.com/41434123" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>... So while what you propose is certainly possible, you'd need a theory that predicts the exact frequency shifts observed from a change in speed of light (because red shift is more than &quot;it gets redder&quot; -- it proposes specific frequency changes for each line in a spectrum) and explains why the speed of light varies precisely as it appears to with distance (or time). It'd be a lot to explain.</p>
<p>Alternatively, redshift gives us both if we accept only that space is expanding, which isn't such a crazy idea in the context of GR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure necessarily what you're referring to. We've done some kinds of experiments like &quot;there's a burst of light. Does light of different energy arrive at different times?&quot; kind of experiments before. That would find some kinds of variations beyond our current physical models if it turned out to be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologize for not being able to provide more information, but if I recall, it was a series of tubes and mirrors that reflected light; by the time the light reached the end, a second or so had passed, and they could tell how fast it went. Or something to that affect. It was over 100 years ago I believe, very old experiment.</p></div>		</li>
