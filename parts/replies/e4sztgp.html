<p>That's a great explainer, but keep in mind that most people have no idea what a sine wave is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>2 wavy wavy things waving around zero and hitting it twice per wave at the same time is 2 phase</p>
<p>3 wavy wavy things waving around zero never hit zero at the same time, that's 3 phase</p></div>		</li>

<p>there might be some process that needs very steady power but I'd imagine they'd build their own generator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but I don't think so... At least, not in generation and transmission situations. You CAN have infinite numbers of phases, but there is little to no cost saving to more than 3 phase generation/transmission</p>
<p>Edit: should say, not that I have encountered</p></div>		</li>
