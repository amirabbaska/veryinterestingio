			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally it's not things like Uranium Veins, which are very tiny increases in density as the actual uranium isn't the majority of the components and there just isn't enough of it to make a difference. The main thing is crust thickness. The oceans have slightly lower gravity, for example, because the oceanic crust is both lower and it also doesn't go as deep.</p></div>		</li>

It's hard to accept that interpretation of oceans vs land when entire continent size areas of ocean have more gravity than entire land continents, and the lowest gravity measured includes significant land mass and vica versa.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually potentially to do with &quot;deep mantle piles&quot; of density at the core-mantle boundary which gives rise to these anomalous distributions of gravity, but what causes them is unknown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it has a lot to do with plate tectonics, crust density and even the relative thickness of the crust at that location. This <a href="http://www.sms-tsunami-warning.com/theme/tsunami/img/tectonic-plates.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> of plate boundaries shows the indian plate has a relative size and shape of the decreased gravity field in that area, so I'd probably say there's a link there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much uranium veins, but variations in the density of rocks do produce measurable changes in the gravity field that are useful for mineral exploration (particularly fossil fuels). After correcting for various confounding effects, a lower gravity field might indicate an oil or gas pocket (low density), or a higher field might indicate an iron deposit (high density). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holding altitude constant, anyway.  If you're 8,848 meters above sea level (the height of Mt. Everest) or on the ISS, you'll experience more gravity if Everest is beneath you than if the Mariana Trench is.  Though as u/crunchsmash noted, in either case you'll weigh less than you do at sea level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, density of rock plays a factor. The Mariana Trench is subduction zone so has dense cooler plates displacing warmer less dense mantle. This means it actually has quite high gravity  compared to the average you would expect for an oceanic plate. Iceland and Hawaii being on hotspots (in Icelands case being mainly due to the midatlantic ridge and Hawaii being due to a mantel plume originating from the CMB) have lower gravity at sea level than being in the ocean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP's question already conceded the relationship between gravity and mass. I think (s)he was asking about other confounding variables. Isn't acceleration a confounding variable? Or does acceleration inflict a separate, gravity-like effect on the accelerating object?</p>
<p>I recall an experiment many years ago that bolstered the theory that Earth's rotation caused spacetime shear/torsion. Isn't that another example of motion distorting an effect that's substantially similar to gravity?</p></div>		</li>
