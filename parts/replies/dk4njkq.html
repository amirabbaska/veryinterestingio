			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking about the problem backwards.  The value of the dollar was fixed to the value of gold.  You could think of $1 of being a portable version of 1/35 tr oz of gold.  You're carrying around a bunch of gold in your pocket, not USD.  So of course you'd trade 1 USD for 1/35th tr oz of gold... they are the same thing!</p>
<p>One problem that happened was the value of gold moved around a few times, so foreigners weren't sure how hard it would be to acquire 1/35th of an oz to get a dollar.  This made deals where &quot;You pay me a dollar a month for the next 10 years&quot; style deals risky, because you weren't sure how much gold would be mined over that time, etc, etc.  What if the value of gold doubled in that time?  It'd screw up your nice, boring 5% interest rate that you'd agreed upon.  So it made international deals in USD risky for both sides.</p>
<p>There were other problems, but this is the first one you run across.</p></div>		</li>
