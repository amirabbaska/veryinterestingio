			<div class="markdown"><p>Sober 14 years now, and this has always been the most difficult aspect of my alcoholism/ drug addiction to explain to people. When I see a person drink a beer at lunch and then go on about their day, it makes absolutely no sense to me. My brain cannot even process how people can just have one drink and then not follow it up with 20 more. You could say &quot;Well, you just have one drink and then you stop.&quot; I don't know if I don't have the neural pathways needed to understand that sentence,  but I couldn't do it if I tried, so my only option was no more drinking. Ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sober 9 months now. One of the many thoughts that helps me stay away from it is the realization that I don't want one or two drinks. I <em>do</em> want to get drunk, but that passes if I give it time, and I know that life is way better without it.</p>
<p>I would <em>so</em> much rather have one soda or one iced tea than one alcoholic drink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hearing your side of it makes more sense of my experiences with my friend/ex roommate. I tried to help him and he just couldn't get him to stop drinking I never really understood why he couldn't control himself while it was literally ruining his life around him. I got sick of watching it and not really being able to do anything so I told his sister (I grew up with his sister/family as well) and got them to move him home so he wouldn't end up dieing on me or something. I had a lot of resentment towards him though and it put a big wedge in our friendship that still hasn't even fully recovered. I think he's doing better now but I know he still drinks and I feel like it's only a matter of time, I think his brain is wired like yours and needs to give it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of whats so fucked up about addiction. You destroy absolutely everything that matters in your life, which then feeds you even deeper into your addiction until nothing matters anymore but the addiction itself. Your health, your friends, your family, money - nothing matters. You have every right to distance yourself from him. Addicts will often try to make you feel guilty for not &quot;helping&quot; them, but in reality there is nothing anyone can do to help an addict. By definition, it is truly a hole that only the addict themselves can dig out of ... they have to make that decision by themselves and stick it out.</p>
<p>I feel addiction an emotional/ psychological issue, but I DO NOT believe it is a disease- where there is a will there is a way and anyone can quit, and all the excuses are bullshit. If I quit, anyone can, special snowflakes be damned. When and if he reaches his rock bottom, he'll have his &quot;moment of clarity&quot;, and he can choose to fight or die. All addicts reach that spot eventually. I hope your friend reaches that point sooner than later, makes the right decision, and you can repair your relationship.</p>
<p>And by the way, I'm sure your friend KNOWS his addiction ruined your relationship, and probably feels horrible about it, but he's just too mired in his addiction to effectively change the damage he has caused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this question is insensitive, but I'm curious and this is the Internet. </p>
<p>My understanding of AA is pop-culture.  I had always understood, perhaps mistakenly, that many of the steps of AA acknowledge a &quot;higher power&quot; that's popularly understood to be God. </p>
<p>How does that work in an AA culture that is mostly agnostics and atheists?  I'm really curious, because again my pop-culture sense has been that an atheist would have a hard time in my obviously flawed conception of AA. Honestly, that I'm wrong sounds like a good thing, but how does it work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a stab at the curious inquiries on what the whole God/higher power thing in AA is. I'm in AA and was at one point a belligerent atheist,  I used to love getting into arguments and debates with religious types. I had serious reservations about the spiritual aspect of AA when I approached them and asked for help. As I worked through the 12 Steps I realized that there was no requirement to believe in any specific, definable God.  I was asked if I could comprehend that there existed forces in the universe with more power than me. I literally looked outside, saw a storm rolling in over the high desert of New Mexico and told myself yup, I am not the most powerful force in the universe. Once I really started to think about it there were an innumerable things more powerful than I like the Big Bang, the ocean, the sun and the moon even emotions, ideals and morals. A room of alcoholics who were just as heavy drinkers as I was but had figured out some way to not drink in years were even more powerful than me, I couldn't stop drinking for more than two hours! OK, so then I was asked, did there exist even in the slightest of circumstances, the tiniest possibility that I may be able to somehow access the undefinable power present within any of those things and use it in some way? I was only able to admit that there was a possibility and I was only able to do that because I had heard people in those rooms say that they had somehow figured out how to do it as well. That was it, I didn't have to suddenly beleive in God, Zeus,  Buddha,  Jesus, the Great Creator, the Spirit of the Universe or any other type of old man wizard in the sky. I just had to concede that &quot;I&quot; was not a deity, lol, funny as that thought is, it was all it took. Now, the only reason I considered even flirting with this idea was because I was absolutely desperate to quit drinking and I had failed so many times that I couldn't fall back on anything, I was literally at my rock bottom as it related to holding on desperately to my atheistic beliefs. I was given absolutely free reign to beleive in anything even if it meant believing in nothing. I then worked the remaining steps and through them have come to be comfortable with the thought that if there is some type of basic higher power in this universe, even if it is something as fundamental as a &quot;simple math formula&quot; that ties everything together, I am not that higher power. Done deal, the 12 Steps are spiritual principles, not religious doctrine and should be treated as such. If you beleive in a Christian God, good for you, if you don't, awesome. You are welcome to AA if you have the simple desire to stop drinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah- I'm curious about this too. I had to attend an AA meeting during my psych rotation of nursing school, and I had no idea what to expect other than people saying, &quot;Hi, I'm so and so and I'm an alcoholic.&quot; The guy leading the group starts talking about his life story, and how we all had to read &quot;the big book&quot; (apparently this is a book that guides you through the 12 steps or something) and from what I understood, acknowledging your higher power is a big part of the 12 steps. I had  no idea religion was at all a part of AA, and I said in the essay I had to write that I would definitely not recommend it to a patient I knew was atheist, and provided a list of other recovery groups (such as SMART recovery, which others have mentioned in these comments), which  I thought would be more inclusive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make your higher power anything you want. I knew a lady that had an old shoe as her higher power and was sober for 20+ years. Plenty of people use their religion because so many people are religious.</p>
<p>The idea is more like the movie with Jim Carry, <em>Yes Man</em>. At the end, the guy that started the program tells him he's supposed to say no to stuff if it's ridiculous. The idea is that he just needed a kick start, by saying yes for a bit. Giving yourself to a higher power in AA is a lot like that. You need to give up control for a while until you get your mind right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my reply to the inquiry above yours, it may shed a little light on your question. Also, to discount a program which has helped literally hundreds of thousands of staunch atheists, due to attendance at one meeting where it is nearly impossible to get a full understanding of how it works is, IMHO, a disservice to your patients. Maybe present to them all of the options in an unbiased way and let them decide what might work for them. AA is one of the most inclusive organizations, at least in my experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grew up with a severely alcoholic mother with the kind of addiction you describe. At her worst, she was drinking a gallon of vodka a day and essentially had to keep drinking or the withdrawals would have taken her down. She has been sober for the most going on 10 years now except for a relapse that came out of nowhere. She remembers driving by a liquor store and the next thing she knew days had gone by which she had no memory of. It was like seeing that liquor store just triggered something and she blacked out after that. My mother absolutely has no hope of ever drinking in moderation. It's drink till you die or nothing.</p></div>		</li>
