			<div class="markdown"><p>1 or 2 screws me up. I swear that's why my glasses always seem off. Hate 'em!</p>
<p>The last time I went to the eye doc she did the ol' 1 or 2... 3 or 4... routine. Apparently I had her going in circles because she said I needed to take a break and let my eyes relax because she was getting mixed results. I still don't think I picked it right.</p>
<p>&quot;Both are equally shitty&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer, and the last time I went to the eye doctor she basically did this for me before asking me to read letters, which no other doctor had done so I asked. It was really cool to basically have the right lenses before she even asked me questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I was just going to ask, if the tests work so well then why don't we do that for everyone? The results of my last eye exam was &quot;well I can tell you are near-sided but you seem to have 20/20 vision...&quot; That doesn't make sense to me. Plus, I always get so confused when they keep asking me which lens is better, 1 or 2, 2 or 3, 6 or 10, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can be very slightly myopic (near-sighted), but not enough to where your visual acuity (20/20, 20/30, 20/50 etc) changes. Essentially, your doctor could tell that you are near-sighted by using the retinoscope, but you are not near-sighted enough to affect how well you see at a distance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because an eye doc scopes a certain refractive error (objective refraction) doesn't mean that's what you should be wearing. There's a reason the &quot;1 or 2&quot; part is called a manifest refraction. Far-sighted people (plus prescription) understand this a little more than myopes (minus prescription)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I hadn't been to this guy before and he didn't have a copy of my prescription. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son's optometrist said that with young children, they'll sometimes also do the '1 or 2' technique in addition to the retinoscope, but they're watching to see which image the child looks at longer. She says it's more of an art than a science though, and not every optometrist does it (she has a lot of very young and/or non-verbal patients).</p></div>		</li>
