			<div class="markdown"><p>ehh.... We &quot;tried that&quot; more than once, at differing altitudes, and yields bigger than Starfish Prime. Look for these: Yucca, Teak, Orange, Argus I, Argus II, Argus III, Checkmate, Bluegill Triple Prime, Kingfish.</p>
<p>A pretty good analysis of atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons, and their bad, and not bad effects, one should look at a paper called &quot;Anthropogenic Space Weather&quot; you can read it here: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309854824_Anthropogenic_Space_Weather" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309854824_Anthropogenic_Space_Weather</a> </p>
<p>It's worth checking out if you have ANY interest. There's even some coverage of using the massive engines of the space shuttle to blast giant holes in the ionosphere, to brief mentions of conspiracy fan faves, such as &quot;chemtrail&quot; experiments and HAARP experiments. A great set of references, too.</p></div>		</li>
