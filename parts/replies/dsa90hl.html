			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you are aware it is the Higgs <strong>field</strong> that's important, and the field is not composed of the bosons, it gives rise to the bosons. There are almost no Higgs bosons, if any, in existence at any given time outside an LHC class particle accelerator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the Higg's mechanism only accounted for a very small amount of mass in the universe, i.e. only for fundamental particles.  The vast majority of mass is found in the energy bound up by the Strong Force binding nuclei together.</p>
<p>The remaining mass (electrons and quarks) is caused by interaction with the Higg's field (not individual bosons).  If it takes so much energy at CERN to create Higg's boson, then how is it they're floating around everywhere &quot;creating&quot; mass?  If one does happen to exist, it should decay immediately.  I thought the discovery of the Higg's boson just confirmed the existence of the Higg's field, much like the photon confirms the existence of the electromagnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's correct. More than 99.9% of our mass is from protons and neutrons, and the sum of the masses of the quarks that make them up is less than 1% of the total. The rest is unrelated to the Higgs field.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There's a difference between Higgs particles and the background Higgs field. The particles are excitations of the field, and the minimum excitation has pretty high energy. But the unexcited ground state of the field still interacts with other fields, and that's where the masses come from.</p>

<p>Yes, pretty much. (But also, producing them and measuring the ways they decay is a good way to study the Higgs field.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kinetic energy (divided by c^(2)). Only the fundamental particle masses come from the Higgs field. Kinetic and potential energy are also mass and don't come from the Higgs field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Higgs field is exactly like water. But instead of water molecules there are little Higgs bosons. Thus if you have an object that interacts more with the Higgs field, then more Higgs bosons are displaced creating more mass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds nice, but I don't see how it's true.</p>
<p>The Higgs mechanism is that instead of the usual mass term in the field equation (where the mass is a constant coefficient), you have an interaction with another field, and that field happens to have a nonzero value in vacuum, so it behaves like the constant coefficient. There is no displacement of anything in that description, and there are no bosons (which are quantized excitations of the field, not the field itself). I don't see how your analogy relates to that.</p></div>		</li>
