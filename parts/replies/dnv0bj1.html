			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you mentioned the last part. The symptoms of depression can vary from day to day or week to week. One day you may feel overly happy and nothing is bothering you then SLAM, you are in a self-induced slum of emotions and bad attitude.
I've experienced depression and if I had to say what works best for me to pick myself up off my ass and change my attitude a little is exercise. Unfortunately. The majority of people who aren't depressed don't have the drive to get up and exercise so it's extra hard for someone battling depression but damnit, if anything, do it for yourself. Go for a run or get a membership at Planet Fitness. It's $10 a month for the gym and only  $20 for the whole shabang. Work out and go lay on one of those massage beds, hell even sit in the massage chair after that and watch tv. They order 40 boxes of pizza the first Monday of every month as well and you can eat for free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was struggling with my willingness to cook and maintaining an appetite earlier this year. Having that on top of losing a lot of weight from stress didn't make a good combination. I'm 22, 5'11&quot;, and earlier this year I was 105 lbs, it was messed up. I'm 137 now still trying to gain weight</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im 5'11&quot; as well and I swear I can't get over 145 lbs no matter how much I eat. I've even gone on super unhealthy junk food binges, I just don't gain weight. I do have a somewhat muscular base so I don't look way too skinny, but I was 160lbs in high school and I can't get back to that weight. Oh well, it could be worse I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was 148 in highschool and by all means still skinny at that weight. Between 17-21 I went down from 148 to 105lbs. Once I realized I looked like a heroin addict I knew I had to figure my shit out. Still struggling to get to a healthy weight but I don't look like a zombie and I can actually maintain a regular temperature so I'm getting there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm (29m) roughly 3 months post-breakup and am on the &quot;not eating&quot; spectrum of this. I should clarify I'm normally not a very depressed person at all, she just happened to be my most meaningful relationship and crushed me. I dropped from 195 to 164 with no real change at all in terms of my appetite coming back yet. I'll eat when I get dizzy or nauseous but that's about it.</p>
<p>..Depression sucks. As stupid as it sounds, the pain of it kind of nullifies the pain of not having my best friend around anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't think depression and a break up is the same thing. Everyone goes through breakups but there is a 100% chance you'll recover, time is definitely the healer for that while depression is an attack on the brain and its much tougher to defeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A year and a half. I haven't really been in a ton of short term relationships, and in all honesty this was one of the shorter ones. My longest was 4 years, with a couple others that roughly reached 2.. but while it lasted, this was the healthiest and happiest relationship I've been involved with. </p></div>		</li>
