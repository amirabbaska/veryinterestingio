			<div class="markdown"><p>Are they literal keys, do Mormons exchange keys instead of rings when they marry? I guess that makes sense, when you marry you can finally live in the same house as your partner under Mormon law, so you can finally exchange keys to let each other into your house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. By keys he is referring to priesthood keys, or the authority to use Gods power. Catholics claim to have the keys by papal tradition. Protestants decided they didnt need keys. Mormons believe the keys were lost  in a period of time after Christs ascension, but were restored by the resurrected Peter, James and John (among others) to Joseph Smith</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like it has been said by others, no, they are not literal keys. They are figurative. A scriptural reference can be found in Matthew 16:19. KJV is what I will quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words and power were given to Peter by Jesus Christ when he correctly states that Jesus is the promised Christ/Messiah. Many works of art (especially statues) actually depict Peter as carrying keys <a href="http://vatican.com/photos/gallery/st_peter_with_the_key_to_the_kingdom_of_heaven-p23" target="_blank">such as in this picture from the Vatican.</a>
These priesthood keys are simply symbols that the person performing the ordinance (e.g., a temple marriage) has the power to bind something on earth and in heaven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, there's no physical keys. The figurative keys are held by the officiator of the wedding. They symbolize the authority to authorize and officiate in weddings that are still in effect after death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His response to the Sadducees points out that they didn't believe in the resurrection anyway, so their question of marriage during the resurrection didn't make sense with their preconceived notions.</p>
<p>I always found his wording very interesting in that passage- over several translations and transcriptions, no doubt clarity is lost, but looking at the words in a slightly different context, it also makes sense for me that he is saying that marriages don't happen during the resurrection, but existing marriage contracts (at least those with eternal authority) would still apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much so. From a Mormon perspective, her marriages to all of her brother's kinsmen would have been temporal marriages anyway, marriages meant to fulfill a basic worldly need- having children, and not meant to be eternal in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not Mormon but seeing this made sense to me.  Being Pentecostal it always made me sad to think that the woman I will love for most of my life will all of a sudden seem not as important to me after me die.</p></div>		</li>
