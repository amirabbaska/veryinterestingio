			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to have a decent understanding of rainfall, let me ask you this: </p>
<p>I often notice that during a thunderstorm, a loud crack of nearby thunder results in a quick, burst-like increase in rainfall. Sometimes it lasts a few seconds, sometimes the intensity persists longer. Is this a documented phenomenon, or have I just been imagining things?</p>
<p>If it is the former case, does the pressure wave from the thunder &quot;shake loose&quot; more rain drops, or is there some other explanation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't imagining this. Storm cells with strong convection (rapidly rising air) are where lightning will most likely occur as the rising air is what helps the clouds pick up their charge. Directly under these cells is also where you'll get the heaviest rain. So in a thunder storm, if you hear loud thunder very nearby, you are probably either very close to some heavy rain, currently in heavy rain, or it's about to fall on you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, your explanation is correct. I am not aware of any evidence that lightning or thunder itself can significantly modify the rainfall intensity. Rather, both lightning/thunder and intense rain are a result of the intense core of a thunderstorm. There is correlation between lightning/thunder and rain intensity, but not causation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC all rain starts as ice crystals in the clouds. The convective precipitation you mention, would mean the updrafts keep the ice in the cloud longer and they get bigger before they fall, melting on the way into water drops. If they get too big, they don't have time to melt and you get hail.</p>
<p>Edit: I recalled incorrectly. See my reply below.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ice explanation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain#Coalescence_and_fragmentation" target="_blank">only partly correct</a>. But the ice formation explanation does explain some large rain drops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing, and is also known as the warm rain process.[20] In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, <strong>these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain</strong>.[21]</p>
