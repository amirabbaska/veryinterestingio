			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  And it's kind of interesting -- species vs species, larger animals live longer, but inside a single species, smaller animals live longer.  For instance, humpback whales live a lot longer than squirrels, but larger humpbacks live shorter lives than smaller humpbacks.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That also has to do with weight/height.  A race car or jet cockpit isn't designed for 6'2&quot; people, and every pound costs millions of dollars to send to space.  In most competitive racing, tight restrictions means the cars are on equal footing.  The best drivers operate at the limits of human ability, so the driver who weighs the least has the greatest advantage.  That's why horse jockeys are short as well, huge advantage over taller riders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a metric ton of other factors making this hard to pin down, but the short answer is &quot;probably&quot;. But you can offset it completely with lifestyle: diet and exercise are going to do a lot more than being 3&quot; shorter than the guy next to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how it works, you don't &quot;get&quot; a finite number of heartbeats. At the contrary if you exercice often which increases the number of heartbeats, you're more likely to live longer. It's a muscle, if you train it it's going to be more efficient</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cardiovascular physiologist here and that's not quite right. Cardiac workload can be accurately calculated with catheterization but can be approximated using the rate pressure product i.e. systolic BP <em> heart rate. You're correct in stating that they have greater blood volume but as a result they have greater preload which means they have a greater stroke volume. Now remember that pressure is nothing but the product of [flow </em> resistance](<a href="http://www.cvphysiology.com/Hemodynamics/H001" target="_blank">http://www.cvphysiology.com/Hemodynamics/H001</a>). That means that compared to a lean person with the same blood pressure an obese individual must have lower systemic vascular resistance. As it turns out they absolutely have lower SVRs when compared to lean individuals at the same pressure and there's some speculation in the field that it might explain the <a href="http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/11/17/HYPERTENSIONAHA.117.09790" target="_blank">&quot;obesity paradox&quot;</a>  in hypertension (obese hypertensives have fewer cardiovascular events than lean hypertensives). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey unrelated question. Does fitness affect blood supply too? For example, my rbpm is 48, can my blood also contain more oxygen than a average less fit person? Do I have less blood since my heart is more efficient? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what kind of fitness you're talking about. Aerobic fitness i.e. cardio increases capillary formation resulting in better oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle. Weight training not so much. If you are aerobically fit your heart gets bigger and pumps out more blood per beat which is why is needs to beat fewer times per minute to send the same amount of blood out to the rest of the body (cardiac output = heart rate * stroke volume). Aerobic exercise actually increases your plasma volume and therefore your blood volume as well. </p></div>		</li>
