			<div class="markdown"><p>Little known fact (I only recently read about it as a result of the recent investigations in the US), but apparently there are several methods that allow the government to basically say &quot;I'm sorry, but that information is important enough that you don't GET to plead the 5th.&quot;.</p>
<p>It's not easy to do, but there are procedures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with this. If a cop said &quot;we have all the evidence, tell us what you know &quot; even without any evidence this doesn't mean the accused is made to self incriminate. It's a tactic lots of people use.  </p>
<p>Now, saying &quot;we have the evidence and we know you did it and you are going to get the death penalty of you don't confess&quot; is different, because there is a threat involved.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but in rare instances and even then the burden of proof that the information is actually important is on the government.</p>
<p>Legally it is really hard to compell someone to be forced to give up their fifth amendment right.</p>
<p>Most of the time, people confused the Miranda right to remain silent with the 5th Amendment.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>You have been arrested for a crime that involved a firearm that you pitched after the crime was committed.</p>
<p>The cops can ask you where you tossed the gun  (information that can be admissible in court) without Mirandizing you first (interrogation without acknowledgement of Miranda Rights) but you still have your 5th Amendment rights to not answer. However, if you tell the cops where the gun is, it can be used against you in court.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>You are on the stand in a case and you have information about an upcoming terrorist attack that you had a direct hand in planning. The Court can [as far as my understanding goes] can compell you to answer the question, but I am not sure if your answer afterward is admissible as evidence against you. You can still choose to not answer but you may be charged with contempt and possibly obstruction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In example one, they <em>can</em> ask you, but without Miranda, it'd almost certainly be ruled inadmissible. </p>
<p>The second one is more complicated. You can not be forced to incriminate yourself, so you can refuse to take the stand at all, with the knowledge that in a jury trial, it's going to look like an admission of guilt. Once you take the stand, you've waived your right against self-incrimination, though if the evidence in question would result in new or different charges, then they'd be covered. I think the example is somewhat flawed, though, as that's more a subject of interrogation than cross-examination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wait, if you lie under oath, <em>how do they know you lied under oath</em>? </p>
<p>Or is it simply another layer of checking and you only get busted for perjury if whatever you said doesn't match up with the evidence? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the <em>oath</em> is unnecessary. They could just tell you that you will be charged for any falsehoods during testimony.</p>
<p>So, why is the <em>oath</em> still there? Because of tradition, and because it probably does make a couple people try a little harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is tradition, but it isn't a bad tradition. It also is useful to distinguish between when the &quot;whole truth and nothing but the truth&quot; and general information in other legal situations, that the average citizen isn't going to be in.</p></div>		</li>
