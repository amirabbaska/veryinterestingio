			<div class="markdown"><p>The Constitution doesn't grant us rights though. We are &quot;endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights&quot;, and the Constitution merely compels our government to secure and defend these rights. They are, at least in theory, our rights regardless of the Constitution. Hence why rights aren't subject to elections, a la the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p>It might seem nit-picky, but I think it's an important distinction. A Constitutional amendment to remove these rights would, in effect, dissolve the Constitution. At least that's my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't quite true.</p>
<p>The unalienable rights clause is from the Declaration of Independence, which isn't a legal document, at least not in the sense that it establishes laws.  Furthermore, the only unalienable rights it refers to are &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, which it doesn't elaborate upon.</p>
<p>Even if did establish a right to live, it certainly isn't absolute, there is the death penalty and plenty of wars.  If a constitutional amendment proclaimed the left-handed were non-citizens and had to leave the country or face the death penalty, there is no legal mechanism to prevent that.</p></div>		</li>
