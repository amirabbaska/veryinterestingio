			<div class="markdown"><p>My first thought was that it would be quite possible to create some overhead application that combines the packets from two different connections. </p>
<p>But then I thought about the TCP handshake. It would impossible to split it in two, so how does a client tell a server to send some packets over one connection and the rest over the other. That seems quite impossible? Is it only possible over UDP then? </p>
<p>I apologize if my knowledge is lacking on this subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Nope, you're right. TCP would render this unlikely/impossible, UDP would be unreliable but possible.</p>
<p>Longer answr: The OP actually referenced this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any connection that needs to maintain a conversation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, conversation refers to TCP, handshake included. The TCP connection (conversation) doesn't end until specified or times out (too long without data received).</p>
<p>UDP might be possible, since it doesn't need to maintain a single connection (it's basically fire and forget), so you might be able to make an intermediary connection that load balances between the two connections to your phone to speed it up, but that would be at the cost of reliability (no error checking, if something gets lost it's just lost). Ways around this too (send a smaller &quot;blueprint&quot;/checksum of the file to test for corruption) but at the point of writing the needed coding to make that all work reliably, it'd most likely be akin to creating a new standard all together, which will then only be utilized by apps and sites designed to do so, so you wouldn't see improvement on sites like YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false. Both connections can initiate the handshake and fetch whatever data they'd like. </p>
<p>Nothing needs to be made, this already works. For example <a href="https://msol.io/blog/tech/how-i-doubled-my-internet-speed-with-openwrt/" target="_blank">https://msol.io/blog/tech/how-i-doubled-my-internet-speed-with-openwrt/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you would need to create some sort of proxy server, which connects to services on your behalf and relays packets back and forth over your connections. But it would need to be protocol-specific, since TCP doesn't support that. So that server could connect to an HTTP server for you and shuttle requests/responses back and forth, but couldn't just do the same with raw TCP.</p>
<p>Now, maybe it's possible if both the proxy server and the client (ie your phone) support a different protocol. TCP does use sequence numbers, so in theory you could send packets to the proxy over multiple connections, and it could reassemble them into a coherent stream. But they'd need to be encapsulated, since each connection to the proxy would be its own stream with its own sequence numbers.</p>
<p>I'd have to research more. I think this could be done. However the need for the proxy server would be a bottleneck (it'd be similar to a VPN), the phones would probably need to be rooted to install a virtual network interface, and in practice it'd be better for online services to adopt a similar protocol themselves. But it might be interesting to toy with.</p></div>		</li>
