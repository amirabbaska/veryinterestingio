<p>Serious burns will remove several of the skins layers (which in nature most likely would be a death sentence) and the healing process just tries to &quot;close the wound&quot; as quickly as possible. Humans simply lack a healing process to restore deep burn damage, the focus is to cover the wound fast, so even under perfect conditions the healed area will still be different from normal skin. </p></div>		</li>
