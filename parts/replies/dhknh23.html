			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Anything with fluoride is good for strengthening weak enamel, but you're wasting your time using anything with less than 1000ppm ( parts per million) as this is what most toothpastes have. </p>
<p>Stannous fluoride is very good at strengthening weakened enamel, but it can stain teeth a dark colour. It is therefore best used not as a mouthwash but instead applied directly to problem areas by your dentist so it doesn't affect your smile! </p>
<p>If you have weak enamel or are prone to caries (tooth decay), the best thing you can do is to use a toothpaste with a high level of fluoride  - there are ones that have 2500ppm or 5000ppm, though the latter is chemist-only where I live. You get the best effect if you don't rinse after brushing, but just spit the excess and leave the residue to coat your teeth. &quot;</p>
<p>Ps/edit: thanks for asking this! She was really happy to answer, it was quite cute lol</p></div>		</li>
