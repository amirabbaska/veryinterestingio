			<div class="markdown"><p>And just for more nerdiness: </p>
<p>Lateral rectus is innervated by cranial nerve 6
Superior oblique is innervated by cranial nerve 4
All others are innervated by cranial nerve 3</p>
<p>This is why when you’re at the doctor’s office they have you follow a pen with your eyes. It’s to make sure cranial nerves are intact and this is the easiest way to do so for these 3 nerves. </p>
<p>Edit: spelling </p></div>		</li>

<p>My name is Sol. I brought all my shoes and glasses to the appointment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping someone would mention the nerves! I only know the cranial nerves for dogs and the associated tests for those (menace response, cotton ball tracking, etc)... not sure how well they translate in that sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh that’s cool! Vet? Or vet tech? </p>
<p>I’m sure they translate pretty well. I’m sure you might have to do things a little differently with dogs since they can’t verbally give you an answer but for involuntary movements I’m sure resting is similar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like showing people the difference between smooth tracking an object and trying to smooth track your eyes without following an object. Move you finger across your vision (really any moving object) and you eyes will track it in a smooth motion. Try to do it without following an object and it turns into a lot rapid individual movements. </p></div>		</li>
