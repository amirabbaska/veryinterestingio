			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more or less the correct answer. Tattoo ink particles are too large to be removed by the body's normal waste system.</p>
<p>Tattoo removal lasers breakup the ink using UV into smaller particles that can be flushed away.</p>
<p>Fading that people often see over time is most often caused by exposure to sunlight (i.e. lower power UV) that breaks up the ink much more slowly.</p>
<p>Tattoos that never gets exposed to sunlight have much more minimal fading and muddling provide that the skin itself doesn't get damaged/change that dramatically from injury, weight gain/loss, pregnancy, etc.</p></div>		</li>
