<p>makes them more susceptable to infection</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immediate since it is a burn. Very controlled when done as a chemical cauterization for nasal wall so the likelihood of infection is negligible there. When cauterizations were done on amputations, for example, the burns were significant and covered a larger area. Burns like that are very susceptible to infection.</p></div>		</li>
