From the rest of your post you seem knowledgable on the subject so you probably know that, but you might want to reword that first sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. But the birds <em>did</em> evolve from some theropods. But yeah, T. Rex and velociraptor wouldn't have been directly in the bird lineage (though iirc, Velociraptor and Microraptor were remarkably closely related to these early birds).</p></div>		</li>
