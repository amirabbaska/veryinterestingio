They really drove this point home a lot to explain many of the things Americans find weird about the Japanese, reasons why the Chinese think Americans are so weird, etc.</p>
<p>But if OP was looking for an explanation as to <em>why</em> America happens to be such an individualist culture, I think the current top comment hit on it: we suddenly had a <em>massive</em> amount of land to &quot;conquer&quot; compared to what we were used to in Europe, and homesteading/&quot;heading west&quot; was a big freaking deal for a large portion of our early history as a new country. </p>
<p>The government would basically just give you free land for a song and a dance as long as you made use of it by farming or raising cattle or whatever. They just wanted to get it tamed and settled by, well, white people. Or at least non-natives. Americans. Whatever you want to call it. Once you have a population living across it, it's a lot easier to retain control and prove you own it, rather than just pointing and saying, &quot;yep, everything to the left of here, all the way to ocean; that's all ours.&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of people made as much use of the free land policy as they could, by doing things like a couple getting adjoining lots of land each under their own names so they could had double-sized farms. And adult children would want to get their own land as soon as possible too, which entails moving off the family double-wide farm. </p>
<p>I don't have any sources to quote, I just remember this from various history specials I've watched over the years. I'm fairly certain this had a lot to do with us getting the idea in our heads that the kids needed to get out of the nest ASAP; there's land fucking <em>everywhere</em>- go get you some!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the response I was looking for, and you helped remind me about all I had learned in my history and sociology courses.  It is interesting to consider the sheer size of this country as compared to others around the world.  In those smaller countries, someone made the point that people really couldn't expand and move our due to literal space constraints...but I guess it makes more sense to do so here simply because of the sheer size of our country. What an interesting point, and thank you for your response. I love a conversation that is intellectually stimulating and drives a cross cultural understanding, rather than promote a divisiveness amongst different cultures simply due to lifestyle choices.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember reading somewhere that life expectancy is positively correlated with being part of a strong community.</p>
