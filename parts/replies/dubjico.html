			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's kind of a semi-joke, yes. It's more of a &quot;little wink&quot; style joke.</p>
<p>To be fair, in the original fiction story, Soylent just meant &quot;food made from soy and lentils&quot; -- even though that turned out to be a lie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is more than just soylent, in Australia there are over 100 brands of recognised nutrition formulas available for people on tube feeding, oddly enough, soylent isn't one. Nestlé is the biggest producer of hospital nutritional formulas. </p>
<p>I was on KateFarms Komplete, but now I'm on Neocate because katefarms changed their formula to include tomato extract and I'm allergic.</p>
<p>There's also TPN which is an IV formula designed to replace food for people whose digestive systems have completely shut down, or coma patients, etc </p></div>		</li>
