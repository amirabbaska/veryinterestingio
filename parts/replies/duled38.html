<p>I can attest to this. My first laptop was a gaming laptop and had an i7, quad core 2.0GHz. My current laptop, non-gaming, also has an &quot;i7&quot; but it's a dual core with hyperthreading which I consider to be more of a mid to high range i5.</p>
<p>At least it was still an upgrade, because I just wanted something less heavy and bulky than a gaming laptop. The boost clock gets up to like 3.5GHz which gives me over 2x as much processing power per core while using less battery due to improvements over 5-6 years. Even the iGPU is like twice as powerful as my gaming laptop's discrete GPU was.</p></div>		</li>
