<p>Isn't the brain a sufficiently powerful amplifier of small effects that even small, rare thing being influenced by a quantum mechanical effect can <em>not</em> be ignored? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it depends how large the effect is. You could probably work out mathematically how deterministic the brain is if you consider the extent of the connectivity and how much uncertainty quantum effects introduce. It could be that the effect is so small that no neuron in your brain during your entire life has ever acted non-deterministically, or that it happens many times per second.</p>
<p>A mechanical clock is made of particles that are quantum, but a properly built clock will never miss a tick due to quantum effects. A quantum random number generator is perfectly non-deterministic. The brain is somewhere between those two. Possibly arbitrarily close to the clock. But it should be possible to measure whereabouts it lies.</p></div>		</li>
