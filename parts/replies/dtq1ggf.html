			<div class="markdown"><p>You can’t really do that. The curvature of the lens is such a way that if it’s edges were straight, the shape of the lens would distort the picture in a way that would make the four corners look irregular. Lenses work the way they do because they are circular and semi spherical, almost like a bubble. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, if you took a lens, and cut a rectangle out of it, it would work just fine.  The downsides would be that you would lose some light, it would be more of a pain to manufacture, and it wouldn't fit the usual focusing mechanism as readily.  Here's a <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/15/4681783/slides/slide_25.jpg" target="_blank">diagram</a> showing what happens if you shade half a lens--making its shape a half circle.  The image just gets dimmer, but it still works.</p></div>		</li>
