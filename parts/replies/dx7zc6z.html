			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a significant group of individuals who would argue in the opposite. As was posted before as a response, game mode usually disables any processing. This means you receive the image as rendered, exactly. Most TVs extrapolate additional frames, but they are basically a guess at what is going to come next. This can make games and movies seem abnormally smooth. You also often lose a lot of the nuance and details in colors originally built into the game. </p>
<p>As for your point on the sharpness, not using game mode actually makes the game less sharp. The processing and frame extrapolation often blurs the edges of objects, game mode disables this and preserves the image sharpness, but often at the cost of making drops in framerate much more obvious.</p></div>		</li>
