All was going well until a lady behind me started clapping out of time. As a DJ this threw me completely and I lost focus on the post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your informative post! I do have a question for you. I feel like I am stuck on &quot;mind-wandering&quot; mode. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>so you just end up reading the words while not actually interpreting them while thinking about something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really hit home for me. It feels like my brain is always trying to save energy by skimming and even if I do really try to focus it takes a couple times to comprehend the information. Is there anything I can do to help voluntarily delegate tasks to my central executive mode? (Are there tips or exercises to help improve focus?)</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I zone out a lot while reading, so sometimes use this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sentence segmenter</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sentence-segmenter/jfbhkblbhhigbgdnijncccdndhbflcha" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sentence-segmenter/jfbhkblbhhigbgdnijncccdndhbflcha</a></p>
<p>The Chrome extension temporarily puts each sentence on a new line.</p>
<p>Replaces &quot;period&quot; &quot;space&quot; to &quot;period&quot; &quot;newline/paragraph break&quot;.</p>
<p>It can give you a better view of the length of sentences and sentence structure in your peripheral so you can better pace your reading (and breathing).</p>
<p>I find that I'm less likely to zone-out and glaze-over text while reading.</p>
<p>It's like using a pretty print command on a chunk of computer code: </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/rFKpaAn.gifv" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/rFKpaAn.gifv</a></p>
<p>It can help with rereading and skimming because you know that all the sentence starts are on the left side (can be easier to jump around and resume).</p>
<p>If you're not using a browser, you can do the replacement in Microsoft Word or Notepad++.</p>
<p>(After using a free program called Ditto to Ctrl+C multiple times, and pasting everything)</p>
<p>Microsoft Word replace</p>
<pre><code> . 

.^p</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<p>Notepad++</p>
<pre><code> . 

.\n </code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>save energy by skimming </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always skim on a first read-through </p>
<p>(beginning, middle, end paragraphs of a page, or</p>
<p>beginning middle, end sentences of a paragraph, or</p>
<p>first half of each sentence), so it's not bad if you zone-out occasionally.</p>
<p>Being able to not worry about stalling can help keep your motivated.</p>
<p>Content later on might help clarify the text that you read earlier.</p>
<p>It's similar to the advice of reading the abstract and, skipping to the conclusion of a paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omfg thank you so much for the &quot;pretty print command&quot; or whatever you called it!! This will help soooo much. Every damn time I open and try to decipher someone else's JavaScript or anything else similar it's always a pain in the ass and I have to make it pretty myself. Idk why I never thought to look for a tool to do it for me..</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Edit -- hehh wowweeee</p>
<p>I mean, thank you, but u/bboyjkang is the one who really deserved it for providing the details of that super cool tool. </p>
<p>Thanks, though  =]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you for your elaborate response <em>and</em> the gold!! The chrome extension is something I needed that I didn't even know I needed- I used to break up larger paragraphs by highlighting a few sentences at a time to kind of break it up or make it easier for my brain to digest.  Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>
