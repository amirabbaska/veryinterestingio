			<div class="markdown"><p>Its fascinating how (almost) all the organs liquify! I was listening to radiolab (episode 'black box'), and they did a memory test on the caterpillar before it became a butterfly. Turns out that memories the caterpillar created carried over to the butterfly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>inst it true that if you put a sea slug or something similar (i forget which) in a maze and it eventually finds the &quot;prize&quot; when you restart it it remembers and goes straight to the prize.</p>
<p>but the truley amazing thing is if you liquidise it and feed it to other sea slugs they go straight for the prize too (having never experienced the maze before)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the article cited below:</p>
<p>&quot;And some cells create imaginal discs—structures that produce adult body parts. There’s a pair for the antennae, a pair for the eyes, one for each leg and wing, and so on. So if the pupa contains a soup, it’s an organised broth full of chunky bits.&quot;</p>
<p>Does this mean that the cells from which the new leg generates are in the old leg, or just stored somewhere, waiting to be shifted into position?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of these imaginal discs as being composed of cells similar to stem cells - only they are driven to differentiate into a certain type of cell at specific times and they can only replicate a limited number of times. Not only do you get these ... somewhat differentiated cells (progenitor cells that make up an imaginal disc) ... but you also get larval cells that are essentially repurposed during metamorphosis. So to answer your question,  yes, the cells from which the new leg generates are stored in the larval insect.</p>
<p>I call them somewhat differentiated because, although they have undergone no development in the larval stage, their target fate is already determined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiolab did an interesting piece on this as part of their &quot;Black Box&quot; episode. Here is the entire <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/black-box/" target="_blank">episode</a>, and here is the <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/goo-and-you/" target="_blank">part specific to the chrysalis</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I don't want to spoil too much because its a great listen if you have 15-20 min, but /u/NemesisDragon is right. The whole mechanism isn't 100% understood, but it's not like the caterpillar just grows wings, it literally transforms. </p></div>		</li>
