Any power sharpening systems short of a proper cooled grinding wheel will heat up and ruin the temper of the tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends. If it gets very hot (above a temperature that causes a change in atomic structure (to austenite in steels)) then rapid cooling in water may result in a very hard and brittle drill bit (martensite in steel). Heat treatment of metals is quite a complicated process which has various threshold temperatures and cooling rates that can dramatically affect the metal's strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's take some of the complicated out of heat treating steel.</p>
<p>Heating it to a cherry red with a torch and quenching it freezes the crystal structure in the hardened but full of stress form.</p>
<p>Subsequent heating to a straw yellow and no hotter relieves those stresses, removing the brittleness and leaving the majority of the hardness.</p>
<p>Doing this by hand is easy to learn. Treating one part by hand and eye can yield a very high quality of hardness and toughness. Doing it by hand for 1000 or more parts per day is not physically possible. Scaling up the process is what introduces the complexity.</p>
<p>Gunsmiths 150 years ago heat treated the receivers of their rifles by case hardening them. Build a fire in a hole in the ground, get the part hot in the fire, throw in some bones to supply carbon and bury the whole mess. Tomorrow, the surface of the parts will have a very lovely blue and yellow mottling that is very hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Softer than it was when it was properly hardened, but not as soft as it was when it was heated.</p>
<p>If that sounds a bit cryptic, it's not a direct answer. It depends on the maximum heat that it got up to and the speed it was cooled at. It's fairly common to keep the drill tip wet all the time while drilling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that isn't because the bit got hot, it is because the bit is made from cheap/improperly heat treated metal. There's no way you can get the shaft of that drill bit hot enough to soften without utterly destroying the cutting points on the bit.</p>
<p>Cheap drill bits like that are often jokingly known  as being made from   &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=chinesium+drill+bits&amp;hl=en-US&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=556&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=sivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsgJ-8n5LYAhUY9WMKHUgeAvMQ_AUIywEoAg" target="_blank">chinesium</a>.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I'm sure you know, but OP may not, heat treatment is quite a bit more complicated than heating something up and then quenching. Some materials will air quench (all the A series tool steels, for instance), some will oil quench, some are water quench (plain carbon steels; 1060, 1095, etc.). The temperature to heat to, how long it has to stay there, how fast it needs to cool and in what media, what crystalline structure results, and then drawing it back from the maximum hardness to something you can actually use... These things are all a fairly exact science. It's not a simple subject.</p>
<p>I was only a machinist for a couple of years (the industry collapsed in Michigan when GM et al. started spinning off subsidiaries and closing down plants), so my experience is likely a lot less here than for most machinists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you control quench based on part modulus and chemical composition, you can push towards a preferred method of quench. Depends on the alloy for sure. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Amazing stuff.</p>
<p>You can machine it with cutting tools.</p>
<p>Heat treat it.</p>
<p>Then it becomes the cutting tool to machine more of the same.</p></div>		</li>
