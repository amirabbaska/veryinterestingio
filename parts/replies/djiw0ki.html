<p>TIL. I used to find that even a little bit of cilantro tasted soapy. It wasn't until I was in my 30s that I developed a taste for moderate amounts of it. Now I love it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always found this to be an amazing fact. So many people claim their pee doesn't smell after eating asparagus. Turns out everyone's pee stinks, it's just some can't smell it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Both producing the smell and being able to detect the smell are independent genetic variations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source on that out of curiosity? I've done a ton of searching and haven't found anything conclusively saying that some people are immune to <em>having</em> stinky pee, just that some people can't smell it. Will keep looking though! </p></div>		</li>
