			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I was disappointed when the comments were barren, but I'm glad you found one with good explanations. I'm notorious for this. I'll pace alllllllll over the apartment when I'm on the phone and it freaks my dogs out (I feel bad), and at work when I call out, I HAVE to be standing and mini-pacing at my desk. I also have a few fidget items to help with it. Weird tendency we have.</p></div>		</li>
