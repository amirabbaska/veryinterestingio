			<div class="markdown"><p>OP didn't ask about tanning at all, the question is about sunburn, which we perceive as redness and inflammation - I'd say this couldn't happen because a lot of the blood from the limb would simply leak out, there's no blood pressure for vasodilation to cause redness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never mentioned tanning. Tanning would be the melanocytes redistributing melanin and darkening from oxidative stress (which probably would happen) from mostly UVA, or producing more melanin in reaction to mostly UVB and is in reaction to the direct DNA damage. The UVB kind of tanning takes a couple days though, so the arm would def be dead.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think you misunderstand; while we perceive sunburn as redness and inflammation, that inflammation is only a symptom of the burn itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, and this is why transplants work.</p>
<p>There are varying speeds of tissue death, especially depending on cause of death etc. </p>
<p>Falling into an icy but not frozen river, for instance, would delay tissue death even if they weren't able to resuscitate you. </p>
<p>On the other hand, your cells will die more quickly at high temperatures than low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Question for you. If I wear sunscreen properly, apply new costs every 2 hours etc -- would I still be damaging my skin if I was getting tanned?</p>
<p>As in, if I get colour from the sun, does this AUTOMATICALLY mean my skin was damaged? Because I still get darker through sunscreen....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, yes. Tanning is the skins response to UV exposure to try and protect against further damage. But this typically means that if you get a tan, your skin has had at least some UV damage. </p>
<p>If you are still getting tanned through your sunscreen, then it isn't doing its job of stopping UV getting to your skin. This is kind of a problem in the way sunscreens are tested. People typically apply sunscreen about 1/3 the recommended thickness, so that SPF30 could really only be having the effect of an SPF10. I find it best to use SPF50, and make sure it's broad spectrum too so that you get decent protection from UVA as well as UVB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The purpose of sunscreen is to absorb or reflect the UV rays so they don't go into your skin cells. If you wear sunscreen but still tan, then some of the UV rays are making it through. You should use higher SPF, reapply more frequently, or consider covering up with clothes. </p>
<p>A little bit of a tan doesn't mean you will absolutely get cancer, but it's good to be cautious.</p></div>		</li>
