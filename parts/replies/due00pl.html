<p>Gene dosage, nondisjunction, environmental factors, all affect this overall outcome. Plus some more unmentioned factors. </p>
<p>Im no lobster scientists but Ill ELI5 how genes work a bit. So the lobster is hermaphrodite and has two colors on its body. </p>
<p>Hermaphros typically have genes for both male and female as they usually exhibit the reproductive organs in some way (depends on species).</p>
<p>Since two colors (phenotypes) are shown and not intermediates, this is an example of codominance. Meaning two different genes, that encode for differing phenotypes (ex. One color is yellow and the other is blue) are expressed equally. </p>
<p>So how does that all occur? Well. Gene dosage is probably the next most important factor. Think of your genes and how they relate to your body like drugs. Too many drugs, youll shock the system and die. Not enough and the system just doesnt have what it needs to function. Too much of one gene can be lethal and so can too little. You may have genes that are in you right now but arent expressed because of dosage. </p>
<p>Sometimes the environment plays a role. Temperature is a huge factor. Cant remember what animal, but not long ago a thread hit the front page with reports that only females were being born because of global warming raising the temperature of the breeding grounds (aquatic). In this situation, a high temp caused the outcome for sex in an organism. Again, im not a lobster scientist.</p>
<p>Nondisjunction is harder to explain with words. If youre interested theres plenty of figures for meiosis and mitosis and all that good stuff on google images. But basically, its when chromosomes and chromatids fail to separate. This creates problems and cells usually end up dying or being destroyed because of it. </p>
<p>EDIT: If your interested with how ANY genetic trait is calculated, maybe take a look at population genetics and transmission genetics. I dont think Im personally able to explain much more without being super long-winded and too in depth.</p></div>		</li>
