<p>Also...just to add.. it's not ONLY U.S. teams. They are all U.S. except Toronto, which is Canadian. And there was former team in Montreal which has since moved. Toronto joined in 77' though.</p>
<p>[â€“]/u/LarryMahnken 6 points 1 year ago* </p>
<p>So, first, a little history of Major League Baseball that will help you understand.</p>
<p>The rules of the modern game were first codified by a club of New Yorkers in 1845, the Knickerbockers. Their rules made the game faster than base-ball games had been up to that point (the three strikes rule and the fair/foul rule were significant improvements), and the popularity of the game spread rapidly, and was solidified as a national game when soldiers during the Civil War taught it to each other and to prisoners. Even before the war, organized baseball clubs were being formed around the country and became a popular spectator sport. Fans started being charged admission for the more popular teams, and once money was in the mix, it wasn't long before team organizers saw the value in getting better players on their teams, and started paying the best players salaries (under the table, of course). It wasn't until 1869 that the Cincinnati Reds became openly professional (and went on to win every game until finally losing in 1870... which basically wrecked the popularity of the team).</p>
<p>But the Reds had shown that people would pay to see an openly professional team, and soon other teams became openly professional, and formed the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. The National Association existed from 1871-1875, and was dominated by the Boston Red Stockings (who were basically the same team as the 1869 Cincinnati Reds, and would ultimately become the Boston, then Milwaukee, and now Atlanta Braves). The league was plagued by inconsistent scheduling, players hopping from team to team, and questionable competitive integrity (professional ball players made good money, but not so much that they wouldn't take money from gamblers to intentionally lose a game).</p>
<p>In 1876 several team owners came together and decided to change the power structure by forming the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, which had strict rules for admission, mandated that teams play a complete schedule (and in the early years they expelled teams that didn't complete their schedule), imposed harsh rules restricting player movement (that would remain in place until after the 1975 season), and banished for all time any player found to have intentionally lost a game.</p>
<p>It was so successful that before a decade had passed a competitor league, the American Association had formed, and quickly became popular due to their lower ticket prices, willingness to play on Sundays, and sale of alcohol to fans. By 1884 they were a legitimate challenge to the superiority of the National League, and the two leagues agreed to have their respective champions play each other at the end of the season.</p>
<p>So, at this point baseball was only played professional in the United States, so the series was legitimately considered the world championship of professional baseball, and thus called the &quot;World's Championship Series&quot;, later colloquially shorted to &quot;World's Series&quot; and ultimately &quot;World Series&quot;.</p>
<p>This continued until 1890, when the players rebelled against management's restrictive practices and formed their own league, the Players League. Unfortunately, three leagues were too many for the country, and the Players League folded after one season, while the American Association collapsed a year later. The National League absorbed the best teams from two leagues, and for a few years in the 1890s the top two teams in the league played each other for the Temple Cup.</p>
<p>In 1901 Ban Johnson converted the minor league Western League into the major league American League, and after two years of war with each other, the AL and NL agreed to cooperate and play a postseason series against each other, which again incorporated the &quot;World Series&quot; name, though that wasn't official at first.</p>
<p>So, the TL,DR version is: it was the World's Championship Series when it was first established, and at the time it was an appropriate name because nobody else played professional baseball. By the time other countries (most notably Japan) started playing high level professional baseball, the World Series name was already established as the name of the Major League Baseball championship, and is only thought of as that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The team moved? As in, the club found another stadium in another city?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The MLB usually grabs the best talent out of Japan and Latin America where baseball is actually very popular. There are a lot of Cubans and Dominicans who end up in the MLB one way or another. I also think that there is a player from an African Nation right now as well. The end game for players in pretty much any league in the world for professional baseball players is playing in the MLB.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, I watched his first game last week or so. He even got on base. After something like 7 years in the minors, that's a dream come true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best explanation is marketing.  Who wants to be North American champion when you can be World Champion?  The NBA does the same thing.  Both lean on the credibility of their talent, which is pretty strong for the most part, so it mostly goes unchallenged.</p>
<p>I'm sure in 20 years the way basketball is growing internationally there could be some international leagues approaching NBA status, which would challenge the status quo.</p></div>		</li>
