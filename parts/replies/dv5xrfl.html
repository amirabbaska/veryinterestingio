			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be pretty amazing if the outside temperature of the pipes was around -130C.  Any sane engineer would make sure the pipes would be insulated, otherwise the energy costs in maintaining the pipes at that pressure and temperature would get absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the pipe is carrying liquid nitrogen to a vaporiser (which it almost certainly was) then there's no point insulating it. It could easily be below -130Â°C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I agree, but the ice was a couple feet thick in summer which made me feel like the pipes underneath might be close to liquid N2 (at atmospheric pressure) temps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubtful, unless they were really, really bad pipes/dewars. The outside surface shouldn't reach anywhere near -130C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not know the exact answer but I'm going to try a guess. According to the phase diagram linked to above, the sublimation point is -80C, 1ATM. This describes the situation where as the dry ice evaporates, at -80C, it replaces all the atmosphere around it with CO2 at 1ATM, and then remains at equilibrium at that temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>In order to sublimate further, some of the CO2 gas needs to move away, to lower the partial pressure. Normally this would happen through diffusion or convection.</p>
<p>If you speed this up to the point that the partial pressure of the CO2 gas is kept 0.003ATM, by for example blowing away the gas with a fan, you will be bringing in new air at ambient conditions, and only 0.3% of it will be CO2. This air will be bringing in new heat to replace the cooling produced by the sublimation.</p>
<p>To work out the resultant temperature would require something similar to calculating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature" target="_blank">wet bulb temperature</a> in evaporation. You would need to work out the latent heat of sublimation of the dry ice and compare it with the heat capacity of the volume of air that you would be cooling.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could place the dry ice in a vacuum chamber and pump it down to 0.003 atm, that would cool the ice down to -130.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory yes, if the dry ice was that cold. you could cool something to that temperature with water ice too if you made the water ice really cold. There's nothing that stops a solid from being a lot colder than it's freezing point.</p>
<p>In practice you aren't going to find dry ice that cold where you can buy or obtain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to cool anything to the temperature range of 1-4 K, you bring it in contact with liquid helium (which boil at 4.2 K), and then lower the pressure of the helium with a vacuum pump.</p></div>		</li>
