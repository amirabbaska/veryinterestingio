			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I'm not sure you directly answered OPs question, but this was incredibly valuable for <em>me</em> to know about cheat days in diets. I'm a compulsive overeater, and even though I'm not obese, I can't stick with diets (even with cheat days) because I just instantly get into a deprivation mentality. Without cheat days, I burn through all my willpower way too quickly. <em>With</em> cheat days I don't stop at any given 130% normal intake point. Too much &quot;finish everything on your plate, don't waste any food!&quot; when I was a kid. I can't gauge my own fullness on junk food anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>CICO works well for many people but for compulsive overeaters, if you are one, it may not be the solution in the long term</p>

<p>So what might work better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had an over-eating problem for most of my life, I've found a few strategies that help me and still let me feel like I can eat like a normal person: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shop strategically. The only snack food in my house is low calorie and individually packed and the only food I have has to be cooked to be eaten. String cheese, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't buy things you like to binge on. I love walnut brownies and sour cream and cheddar potato chips, so much so that I eat every single chip and brownie same day. Recovering alcoholics don't usually have fully stocked liquor cabinets, you don't need a fully stocked pantry. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out of sight, out of mind. Take what you want to eat and put the rest away. Don't keep your brown rice next to your mac and cheese. Put the stuff you should be eating front and center. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality control. I love fattening food and I still eat it. However, it has to be something worth the calories. Wedding cake at my friend's wedding? Worth it. Homemade pumpkin pie made by grandma on Thanksgiving? Worth it. A bag of greasy chips that aren't really that good that I've eaten thousands of before? Not worth it. Slice and bake pillsbury cookies that always taste a little off? Not worth it. Setting matters here, too. Two glasses of wine because I'm bored and watching tv? Not worth it. Two glasses of wine at your anniversary dinner? Worth it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realizing that there is no end goal. You will never lose an amount of weight that means you can never gain weight. I have lost 75 pounds and for the rest of my life I can gain those back. This means that there is no finish line, but there is also no rush. You're going to have bad days. Accept it, move on, every meal for the rest of your life is another chance to do better. </p>
</li>
<li>Medication. Vyvanse is a drug used to treat ADHD and binge eating, there are others as well. If you really feel it's out of control, there is medicine that can be prescribed. I was on it for a few months and was able to develop other coping strategies than eating, and I haven't returned to my old ways after I stopped taking them. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What seems to work for compulsive overeaters is a system of four prescribed meals at regular intervals. Four to five hours between breakfast and lunch, the same between lunch and dinner, and then three hours between dinner and a final snack.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's highly recommended to give up flour and sugar as these are trigger foods for most people. The interesting thing about that is that once you give them up and after a short period of detox, a person is unlikely to crave them again. </p>
<p>Breakfast consists of:
85 grams of starch (rice/potatoes/corn etc.)
or 28 grams if it's in dry form (oatmeal or rice/corn cakes, popcorn etc.).
40 grams of dairy
55 grams of protein
150 grams of fruit</p>
<p>Lunch and dinner:
85 grams (women)/115 grams (men) of starch
85 grams (women)/115 grams (men) of protein
225 grams (w)/280 grams (m) of vegetables
150 grams of fruit </p>
<p>Late snack:
40 grams of dairy
85 grams (or 28 grams) of starch
150 grams of fruit </p>
<p>This ensures that a person gets all their nutritional needs per day at intervals that guard against hunger (and therefore potential binging or cheating), and that their cravings are under control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know this advice but when I started CICO I kind of settled into this type of plan. My primary rule was 6x5, which means meals under 600 calories no closer than 5 hours apart. As I lost weight, gained more control over my appetite, and my calorie targets dropped I changed it around 6x6, 5x5, 5x6, etc. My schedule was all over the place so I didn't have set meal times. </p>
<p>I didn't pay attention to macros at first, but one of the benefits of this type of plan is it's repetitive so I quickly learned what left me hungry with 3 hours to go before my next meal. And with set calorie counts for every meal I experimented quite a bit, trying new things, and also developing standard meals I like but improvising with them as I learned more to increase protein, fiber, fresh veg, etc. </p>
<p>I lost 100 lbs in 10 months. No cheat days except a couple of holidays with family events, but even then it was more &quot;I'll just do whatever&quot; than &quot;I'm going to eat as much as I can!&quot;. </p>
<p>I found this method didn't work so well when I started adding a lot of exercise, which really put my appetite on a roller coaster. Now I exercise in the late afternoon and eat almost all of my calories in the evenings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, if I ate this much starch, I would certainly not lose weight. Be sure you are creating a diet plan which works for your body, too. I have to reduce my intake of all carbohydrates, not just flour and sugar, to sustain weight loss. I do have to deprive myself to lose weight. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to weight loss or weight maintenance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that I need those cheat days.  But even my &quot;cheat&quot; days are more controlled and different from how I used to eat.  I just love food and eating.  If I am craving something and I put it off for 2 weeks, I will end up giving in then going overboard with it.  Where as if I crave something and plan around it and get that food I'm craving in the next day or so, it's a lot easier to keep it under control while I satisfy that craving.  It's different for everyone I suppose, but cheat days really do help me stick with the lifestyle change.  Also, things like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years... those are going to be &quot;cheat&quot; days no matter what.  I love food and I <em>love</em> the holidays.  It would feel like a punishment not to indulge on those occasions.</p>
<p>I have a friend who lost a lot of weight by watching calories and carbs.  He is maintaining by treating weekends (or like Fri &amp; Sat) as regular &quot;cheat&quot; days.  He eats well during the week then kind of cuts loose a bit on the weekends.  Probably not every single weekend, but yea.  He's kept his weight off for years this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense and that never worked me longterm as much as I hoped it would. Also I think there seems to be a difference between men and women in this regard. Research on intermittent fasting seems to have shown that.</p>
