Beach sand can be loaded into a barge directly and transported anywhere in the world easily, Desert sand you need to load on tiny trucks which takes hundreds or thousands of VERY long several hundred mile trips to fill the same barge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically it was much harder to transport fuel for the glass melting furnaces than to transport sand via waterways.  Glass making factories or towns were therefore often located near waterways with nearby gas or coal deposits, until the advent of power transmission that removed that restriction (Fostoria, OH is one such example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons I can think of: The sand and the sand.</p>
<p>Building on sand is a massive problem; foundations for stability and weight bearing would have to be pretty deep. And the desert isn't even that flat which trains like.</p>
<p>The other problem is going to be sandstorms. Even if we get our tracks laid, they would probably get burred extremely quickly. </p></div>		</li>
