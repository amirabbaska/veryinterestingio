			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think every flea market in the 80's had at least one booth selling stripped books. I always wondered why they didn't have covers, but assumed the damage was why they were so cheap. When they started putting that notice on the copyright page it explained a lot. </p>
<p>I wouldn't buy a book like that now. It's not just effecting the publishing company. It also means the author didn't receive a royalty payment. At least with used books, the author was credited and paid for the initial sale. But as far as the publishing world is concerned a stripped copy never existed. </p></div>		</li>
