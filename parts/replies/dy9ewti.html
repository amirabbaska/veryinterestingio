			<div class="markdown"><p>Total guess: this is a +5 / -0 tolerance situation; eg, when the rocket is accelerating to the minimum velocity required, it's <em>really</em> important to hit the minimum, and not a huge deal to exceed it a bit.</p>
<p>And orbit height is correlated to velocity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would you go about reducing these uncertainties? Say there's a satellite that for some reason needs to be placed ultra-precisely, where in the construction-launch-correction burns cascade could you make the easiest improvements?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once on-station we conduct periodic stationkeeping maneuvers to maintain our orbits.  For the older satellites, this means large East-West maneuvers every month or two (In-Track, to manage the Semi-Major axis and drift rate) and even larger North/South maneuvers every year or so (To manage the inclination)</p>
<p>Our newer satellites actually do about one of each per week, which keeps them right smakc where we need them.  It's a little less fun though, if I'm being honest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geostationary satellites typically use on-board thrusters to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#Orbital_stability" target="_blank">maintain position</a>.  This is likely your best bet for getting a satellite in an ultra-precise orbit - first just get it up there, then make <em>it</em> go where it needs to go.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want to be extremely precise you need some sort of very low thrust (ion propulsion for example) on the payload itself. There is a limit on how precise you can be with a booster or even an upper stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is the tolerance for the GTO apogee so far off in relation to the others? With my limited knowledge i would have assumed that GTO are much “rounder“ than other orbits. With perigee and apogee very close to each other and both within tight tolerances.</p>
<p>Afaik GTO are generally much higher than all other satellites (a necessity because of their special orbit). Can they afford the high deviations because of their high altitude?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A GTO is actually elliptic, as it is a transfer orbit to the final GEO (Geostationary Orbit) which is indeed very round. In most cases the launch vehicle brings the payload to a GTO, from there the payload uses its onboard propulsion to go to GEO.</p>
<p>In a GTO the apogee can be extremely high (often higher than the apogee of the final GEO), so the tolerances are also higher.</p></div>		</li>
