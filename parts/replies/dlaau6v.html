			<div class="markdown"><p>A tin can like a coffee tin or something will do a bit better than a Pringles can if you've got one laying around. I've actually never made one out of a Pringles can, but I'm wondering if the material inside is as RF reflective as it used to be when it was popularized as a cantenna construction material. I have used a coffee tin though and got about 10x (+10dBm) received signal strength increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about the pringles can not being super reflective. That's why I wrote a paragraph about how awesome tin foil is :D I bet the coffee can would be supreme as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe this isnt the right place to ask this, but what are the typical home wifi users's possible applications for this? stealing wifi from far away? broadcasting your home wifi to the pokestop across the street?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially if you only have one computer and don't want to use a cable, you can point your WiFi towards that one computer and get a stronger signal.</p>
<p>I've used something like this to get a signal from the first floor router to the third floor computer. Boosting helped stability and bandwidth, but especially stability. Gaming on WiFi is terrible enough with Wifi, you don't need tiny connection losses to make it worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what did the implementation look like? Do you put the router so you have line of sight to aim a pringles can from the router up the stairs? Can you disregard walls and stuff and just point the pringles can directly at the destination?</p>
<p>Also, does stuff in other parts of the house experience some signal loss? Noob questions.</p></div>		</li>
