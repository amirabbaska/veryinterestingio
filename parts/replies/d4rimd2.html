			<div class="markdown"><p>Lost my nan to Alzheimer's. I always went to her every summer and made sure to stay for a couple of days.</p>
<p>Every summer she would wait for me exited, usually with her delicious baked cookies. But since the diagnose, every summer she would remember me less. During the last 3-4 years she didn't know who I was.</p>
<p>She thought I was a visitor/guest, other times she thought I was her uncle or something other she remembered from her childhood. She really struggled to understand what was going on. Sometimes she even thought I were her son(my dad) and would hug me and don't let go(guess she really missed my dad)</p>
<p>The last summer I saw her was the worst. She could barely cook or even take care of herself. It's just a horrible disease, very heartbreaking. Take care and don't hide your affection or love to your old ones. Appreciate them whilst they're still around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My great grandmother had AZ and passed a few years back at the age of 99. She would always struggle to or completely forget who was visiting her in the nursing home, but she always remembered who I was every time. So close to 100 years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but that doesn't sound as AZ, at least it wasn't the death reason.</p>
<p>My grandmother died at 82. In the end, she had problems breathing because of AZ, but long time before that she started forgetting small thing like someone called, later names, then who all her family were, then all her adulthood memories, after that her childhood memories and near the end (a couple of years before), she forgot how to speak. All the process endured about 10 years and ended with her being even less capable than a newborn for everything.</p>
<p>That's why AZ is so hard for the family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Degeneration refers to the death of neurons (brain cells) and the connections between them so essentially brain tissue that was once healthy dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual how is pretty uncertain, as far as our current knowledge stretches. The two things we do know are: 1) neurones (brain cells) die in vast numbers, leading to the degeneration of the brain seen in the image. 2) In Alzheimer's brains there is a build up of a protein, called amyloid-beta. </p>
<p>The problem is we do not know the directionality of this. I.e we do not know if the protein build up causes cell death, or is a product of processes leading to cell death. Some research shows that this protein actually protects cells from harmful pathways, while others show that it disrupts the cells natural processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Mutations cause misfolding of normally helpful proteins in the brain. In some cases these proteins clump up and choke the neuron to death. In other cases the proteins misfolding leads to destabilization of the microtubules which fall apart and kill the neuron. The problem is with faulty proteins not the immune system.</p></div>		</li>
