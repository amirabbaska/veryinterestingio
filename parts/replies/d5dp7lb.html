<p>That's pretty much how the place looks just now.  In winter it's pretty rainy and gets down to about 4°C and in summer it gets highs of about 25°C, so if you don't mind a bit of rain it's t-shirt weather all year round.  And just look at the scenery!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting fact is that no palms are native to the Mediterranean part of CA, where all the people live. Obviously they still thrive there. </p>
<p>The only palm native to the state has a tiny range limited to dessert canyons with water near Palm Springs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although you are definitely right for the most part, all palm trees do need mild climates to survive and the vast majority of them can't survive hard freezes. There's only a handful of palm trees that can grow in most of the US and those same type are used over and over again. </p>
<p>I have seen people try growing palms in NYC (and succeed for a long time). Windmill palms for example do need protection every decade or so because 5F + high winds + snow will tear them apart. There were some nice windmill palms living in my neighborhood before the past few winters up here in NYC!</p></div>		</li>
