<p>The nerves that control things on the face connect directly to the brain through the scull, so they are not likely to be damaged as easily as the spinal cord.</p>

<p>And if something does get through your skull and severs a nerve that's right next to your brain, it's pretty likely that the injury will be fatal anyway. So there's some selection bias going on: the nerve that controls blinking isn't necessarily any more durable or better protected than the nerves that control your legs, but any injury that prevents you from blinking is very likely to also kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true also, but it really is better protected. Spine is much, much easier to break than your skull.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly true. Cranial nerves are often affected in Traumatic Brain Injury, and many of those patients survive.</p></div>		</li>
