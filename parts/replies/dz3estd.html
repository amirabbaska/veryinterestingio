			<div class="markdown"><p>Story: A friend of mine (passionate long distance runner) had a standart surger and in the wakeup room his heart rate droppes below 20 bpm and the systems started beeping and nurses where already rushing to reanimate but luckily his dad was there to tell him that he's an athlete and thats normal for him</p>
<p>On another note he also told me that when runners get old they kinda have to do a reverse training where they slowly decrease the size of their heart over the year because when your heart is big af and you suddenly can't do cardio anymore it really fucks you up (heart rhythm problems etc.)</p></div>		</li>
