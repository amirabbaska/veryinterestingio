<p>The unionised form is a little bit polar. Just not nearly enough for this use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditional soaps are sodium salts of these same fatty acids. Suffice it to say, the sodium ion forces the fatty acid molecules to ionise, which greatly increases the number of polar molecules that work as a surfactant.</p>

<p>Not so much the sodium ion itself, the ionization comes from an acid-base reaction. That could be with eg. the hydroxide ions from sodium hydroxide. The sodium ions are just there to subsequently form a salt with the deprotonated fatty acids.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What does this even mean? The hydroxide used in the saponification is what made it ionized, the sodium is just a counter ion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware, i just wanted to simplify it for the general readers. Other people have added more details about the acid base chemistry. The key point here is that the fatty acid is ionised. The exact mechanism of that ionisation is an aside.</p></div>		</li>
