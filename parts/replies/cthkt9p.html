			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said about alcohol really resonated with me. I'm from Scotland and we are restricted to only buying alcohol between 10:30am and 10pm, while the rest of the UK can buy it 24/7 I believe. Originally put into law to try and tackle high levels of alcoholism, I think it's having the opposite effect, people buy in bulk at 9:30pm, drink all night and make trips to the shops drunk at 10:30am.</p>
<p>The whole attitude towards drinking is ridiculous. We get told horror stories about drunk people hurting themselves and others all through school, then when you actually have your first drink and it doesn't happen you feel like you've been lied to your whole life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It reminds me of a lot of the United States as well. Drinking age is 21 here so you have kids going through most of university illegally drinking. The whole &quot;binge drinking&quot; phenomenon is very strange to a lot of other countries who let kids start drinking younger and have a much more relaxed relationship with alcohol. One of my coworkers is Polish and she's made the comment more than once that American teenagers &quot;scare her&quot; with their obsession with drinking and the party culture that's revolved around getting as drunk as possible at college parties. I mean all of us who have gone through school I'm sure are familiar with the whole &quot;I can drink xxx shots and be fine!&quot; type attitude on a lot of college campuses. </p>
<p>I'm not saying I was any different - I partied like the rest of them in college. But it is interesting how Americans drink vs other countries. I did a short abroad trip to Spain and one night went clubbing with a big group of Americans. Since I wasn't sure of my surroundings I didn't drink much, but a good chunk of them got themselves blasted in this bar and I vividly remember a lot of the Spanish people in the club pointing and laughing, shaking their heads, looking pretty confused at the belligerently drunk kids acting like idiots. One dude even asked me while we were are the bar &quot;Is this normal for you guys?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh, interesting.. That's like weed here in Sweden. We here all these horror stories of how bad it is, and then people realize it's all lies and then they don't believe anything they have been told about any drug, ever. This leads to us having one of the highest amounts of drug related deaths in Sweden.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2013, a total of 460 drug-induced deaths were reported in Sweden, continuing an increasing trend since 2003 when 211 drug-induced deaths were reported. Of the 460 cases reported in 2013 some 345 were male. The mean age of victims was 40 years. For almost all cases (451) toxicology reports were available, and the data indicate the presence of opiates in the majority (415) of these cases.</p>
<p>The drug-induced mortality rate among adults (aged 15â€“64) was 69.7 deaths per million in 2013, more than three times the European average of 17.2 deaths per million.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are ranked third in Europe when looking at total amount of drug induced deaths, which is crazy when you look at our small population.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>In Norway, we had prohibitition between 1916 and 1927. Then we hit a &quot;great depression&quot; in the 30's, which basically lasted until WWII ended and left us piss poor.</p>
<p>Until we struck oil, we were essentially a rather poor industrial nation, and alcohol caused a lot of problems. This in turn spawned a very restrictive alcohol policy, where the goal was to prevent both alcoholism, alcohol use and moonshining. For some reason, the policy has stayed restrictive ever since. The official idea is still to some extent that greater availability leads to increased abuse, an idea that is as outdated as it is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would've thought with the new 'progressive' generation up and coming red-fever wouldn't really be an issue.</p>
<p>But then again, I suppose the plutocratic upper class that leads America's government and it's media is dominated by older generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was dirtied long before the internet. You can thank Joseph McCarthy and many Republican businessmen before him who equated all social reform, like child labor laws and women's suffrage, with communism and socialism. The motivating factor is greed. Anything that could potentially restrict corporations from making more money has been demonized in this country as &quot;socialist&quot; and low-income Americans fall for it even though the interests of corporations are rarely in line with those of the individual. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the catch. Social democracy only works in the absence of Americanization. The internet is the biggest danger to social democracy since the Soviets collapsed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Xenophobia is widespread, but very few are open about it. Expect to hear many sentences start with the words &quot;I'm not a racist, but...&quot;. In Sweden, the rather openly immigrant-hostile party &quot;Sverigedemokratarna&quot; is the second largest party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every non-swede should take what this guy is saying with a large amount of scepticism. There is no major problem with xenophobia in Sweden, just a major problem of people calling others racist for questioning <a href="https://swedishsurveyor.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/immigration.jpg" target="_blank">taking in so many refugees</a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in Norway, you don't see any racism, but there is plenty of cultural supremacy. It's very different but definitely a problem. The best way I can describe it is this:</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think less of you because of your race, but because you were raised in such a primitive and hostile culture. It's really not your fault, let me help you become Norwegian.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
