			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for this? In Pokemon games, movement is on a grid, and you can only encounter a random battle Pokemon as you move into a tile, so it seems very odd to imagine they wouldn't just run the RNG one time for each movement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This particular method of RNG isn't present in all pokemon games, it's only present in the first generation. It's been one of the staple techniques of speedrunning Pokemon RGB (edit: and Y too) for years now - commonly referred to as <strong>DSum Manipulation</strong>. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, agreed. I do not see why the game would need to run a separate thread to generate pseudorandom numbers at 30Hz when it's trivial to just generate them on the fly, as needed...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a separate thread; the Game Boy had a processor comparable to an Intel 8080 (and similar in architecture). The RNG's used for many things, and they probably had it run regularly to ensure random numbers were available when needed to avoid skipping frames or other bad side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DOOM also just had a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/dujFjVd.png" target="_blank">hard coded string</a> of 'random' numbers it used.</p>
<p>If you changed them all to zero, shotgun had no spread, the screen wipe was 'flat' instead of staggered, and a bunch of other things were wonky.</p>
<p>sometimes for video games, a random string of integers is sufficient, depending on the complexity of the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's a list of numbers to pull from, so if you need a shotgun spread x and y, you pull two numbers, need a death animation from a choice of 5, pull a number, and it gives you the next number in the list.  the game isn't complicated enough to need true randomness, this list of numbers works well for getting non-human predictable patterns in a simple environment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reddit Random Comments code isn't great random, either.</p>
<p>See in the URL ? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/781ujb/what_is_h" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/781ujb/what_is_h</a></p>
<p>The 781ujb</p>
<p>I dunno what they use to generate those 6 character codes, but I set up an auto mod to respond to posts with an A, B, C, D etc at the end of that string.  If it ends with &quot;a&quot; then reply with 1, if it ends with &quot;b&quot; then reply with 2, if it ends with &quot;c&quot;, reply with 3 etc.</p>
<p>It tends to return only 3-4 phrases out of the 26 I shoved in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 781ujb is a base 36 number which increments by 1 each time a post is made. The next post in that case is 781ujc (until 781ujz after which it rolls over to 781uk0)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah that wasn't for my bot - that was when I was scripting AutoModerator responses (as a mod in some subs).   Automod scripts are very limited in their abilities.  That's why I'm making a bot from scratch.</p></div>		</li>
