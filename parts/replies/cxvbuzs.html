			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Europa has a shell of ice, and it's believed that under the ice is a liquid sea. It has been theorized that tidal heating (technically, also Rossby waves) would provide the energy to melt the subsurface ice and maintain liquid water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wouldn't be the only factor. Jupiter exerts a pretty hefty tidal force, and that would be the primary source of heat. Radiation from its Van Allen belts and magnetic field may also play a role. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation from the Van Allen belts also radiolytically splits the ice into oxygen and hydrogen, and the oxygen at least sticks around long enough to be recycled down to the sub ice ocean- meaning that the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/10/europa-ocean-oxygen/" target="_blank">Europan ocean is fully oxygenated.</a>  That's huge for life because no other common oxidant is as good for breathing as oxygen- it was t until oxygen reached fairly high levels that life on Earth became massively multicellular about 600 million years ago, for example.  So Europan life may actually be multicellular </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rogue planets were detected by something called Microlensing, which is a really neat consequence of General Relativity. A study came out a while ago that claimed there were more free floating planets than stars in the galaxy, but this is considered controversial in the astronomy community. For what it's worth, I'm sure they exist, but I think the frequency is off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for radioactivity, I was thinking a bit about this. Essentially, the planet would need to be rich in a material with a suitable half life. The half life would need to be long enough for the temperature of the planet to remain roughly constant over a time scale long enough for life to evolve.  The evolution of life on earth took around a billion years, so you'd probably need a material with a half-life significantly more than this: I'd say at least 10 billion years. There are some known isotopes that fall into this category, for instance Thorium-232 (half life of 14 billion years). Even good old Uranium-238, which is fairly common on Earth, might just fit the bill with a half-life of 4.5 billion years.</p>
<p>The next requirement would be that the density of the material (in terms of how rich the planet is in the ores) would be need to be such that the rate at which energy is released from the decays and absorbed by the planet (and converted to heat) would have to balance the energy radiated into outer space (think Greenhouse Effect). This would depend on many things such as the atmosphere of the planet, the ratio of surface area to volume, and the type of radiation emitted by the material. Radioactivity accounts for less than 1% of the Earth's energy supply, so I would ballpark the amount needed at ~100-1000 times more than Earth, assuming an Earth-like planet. I see no reason why this is impossible.</p>
<p>Life on this planet would be exposed to a substantial amount of radiation, but I see no reason why life could not evolve to be much more resistant to radiation damage than us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be exposed to more radiation?  Of most of the decay were happening a few kms below the surface, wouldn't the radiation generated be completely blocked by layers of dense rock above it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend what type of radiation. Gamma rays can penetrate quite a bit of shielding, for instance. For comparison, on Earth around 15% of our exposure comes from Gamma Rays emitted by decays underground.</p>
<p>One can also be exposed to radiation through a chain of decay processes that eventually release something that can seep to the surface. On Earth, this commonly happens via Radon gas. </p>
<p>Our largest source of radiation exposure (around 50%) comes from Radon, which ultimately comes from Uranium decay, and ends up in our basements. I'm sure I read somewhere that Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking.</p>
<p>So, even on earth underground ores are responsible for the majority of our radiation exposure.</p></div>		</li>
