			<div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;early human&quot; he doesn't mean humans from 10,000 years ago who hadn't built civilization yet. He means evolutionary, like the group of &quot;humans&quot; that existed between us and apes. From a biological point of view, humans have had a consistent level of intelligence for thousands and thousands of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah pretty much. Certainly since we became homo sapiens (about 300,000) there is little to no innate difference. If you're talking about other humans, e.g. neanderthals, there is more and more evidence to suggest they were equally intelligent as well. &quot;Early humans probably couldn't think in coherent thoughts &quot; seems an extraordinary claim. Especially as a personally would have thought other animals such as chimps and dolphins would be capable of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no real specialties to back this up, but I bet “coherent thoughts” go way farther back the intelligence spectrum than even monkeys and dolphins. I would guess were separated more by the complexity of thought rather than nature of cognition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about our entire evolutionary history. The first primate that was more similar to humans couldn't think much. They could do what most animals do; think one or two steps ahead and rely mostly on instinct and socially learned behavior. We've come along way from then, being able to think about multiple tens of things at once (consciously and subconsciously).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have vastly overestimated how complex an organism has to be to think in “coherent thoughts”. I agree that abstract thought advanced and probability became more coherent, but I think your making an arbitrary distinction about something that’s actually a sliding scale. The idea of acting on “pure instinct” is something I think only done by the most basic organisms.</p></div>		</li>
