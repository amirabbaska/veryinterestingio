			<div class="markdown"><p>The script on old documents is similar because those writers were trained and hired to conform to a standard form for official purposes. The same writers' casual handwriting would have displayed individual style, other than a minority who might decide to use their formal &quot;business hand&quot; for everything. </p>
<p>I was taught a few scripts in school. We drilled and practiced and were graded on conformity from first grade on, even printing (which was no longer allowed after 2nd grade). Everyone in my class still had unique personal handwriting, but on tests and papers, our work was nearly indistinguishable. You could tell that some were more skilled and uniform than others, but you'd be unable to match a written page to its author in the class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second paragraph is correct, and almost all the other answers in this thread are bad guesses. Certain scripts were the standard for certain periods. E.g. spencerian script in the U.S. between 1850 and 1925. Then Palmer then Zaner-Bloser then D'Nealian. </p>
<p>So why the wide variety? Firstly there was a movement away cursive to print to allow children to write at an earlier age. There was also a movement towards speed over legibility to allow writing to compete with the typewriter. The script of Palmer onwards focused on using different muscles when writing than that of the Spencerian age. There was also less of a focus on standardisation. Now combine these all together, and as long as the writing is legible, it is deemed good enough, then you get a wide variety of styles of handwriting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, hand writing used to be used much more, therefore it was something education focused on. Even at 32, I recall grade school emphasizing good penmanship. I don't know how much kids these days are taught as far as handwriting. But is imagine that keyboard skills are taught much earlier. I didn't have my first typing class until 9th grade. Although I seem to recall a 4th grade teacher introducing it, I believe it was her own volition. She was younger and saw how things were changing. </p>
<p>With the technological improvements humanity has made, hand writing became less important, typing took its place. It still weirds me out that my childhood had no internet. It existed but not in my home til 96-98. </p>
<p>So when all the world seems to be going to shit, remember how far we've come. Nowadays typing is even becoming less important as voice dictation software dramatically improves. </p></div>		</li>
