			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Constantly watched&quot; might be overstating it, but it is true that fraud is much easier to detect now than it used to be (which is why many creditcard companies offer zero fraud liability for customers).  In my experience, companies today use third-parties to process transactions just because it is way simpler than developing their own proprietary  process.  The fact that it is also safer for customers and the company is a nice bonus.  The fear of being audited for compliance is mostly an issue when a small company grows and suddenly has different PCI rules to follow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm from you are NEVER supposed to give your credit card details to anyone over the phone or on paper.  It's never asked of you, it just isn't done. I was so surprised when I moved to Canada and I was expected to do both of those (on different occasions) to make a payment... Even my local flower shop once asked me to write my details down for them so they could charge me later (their system was offline when I was there). Like, no. I could never be comfortable with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can store at most the first 6 and last 4 digits of the card number and it is not considered sensitive.</p>
<p>(although there are slightly different rules per card brand, and if the card number is longer than 16 digits.)</p>
<p>They can save the full number (or PAN) if they have a business need to do so, and they protect it (for example, with encryption). The answers in this post seem to suggest that no one is storing the full PAN anymore, but actually it is quite common. Riskier, but common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the part about never storing CC data...  that's not true.</p>
<p>PCI details HOW its stored and accessed but PCI compliance is not 100% enforced on all merchants. Mom and pop's online bait and tackle shop isn't really doing PCI audits.  They have an old copy of PC Authorize and import all your CC info via text files or something along those lines.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saving the full credit card number is definitely a valid business requirement in some cases. For example, a number of state and municipal election commissions (New York State Board of Elections and NYC Campaign Finance Board come to mind) require keeping of all credit card numbers from political contributors to be stored in full.</p></div>		</li>

<p>eg. 4462 start would be visa debit.</p></div>		</li>
