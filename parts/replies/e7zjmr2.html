			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely yes, cones have a high light threshold, as apposed to rods which are very sensitive to light, so even a tiny amount of light will stimulate them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I might misunderstand your question, but...</p>
<p>If you are dark adapted, your cones are mostly off and your vision is dominated by rods. When you’re in daylight, your rods are saturated and turn off, and your vision is dominated by cones. </p>
<p>When you’re dark adapted a bunch of light all at once requires you to readapt! This can cause you to squint since all the cells need adjustment. </p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any cell damage to bright lights, though. Rods and cones are very good at being thrown about in different light levels. </p></div>		</li>
