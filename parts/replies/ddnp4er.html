			<div class="markdown"><p>So maybe someone can provide clarity for me on this instance...</p>
<p>I recently delivered a baby that had the karyotype of 69, XXX (I.E., Triploidy). The baby had many gross abnormalities: low set ears, absence of nasal bone, protruding eyes, tetralogy of fallot and more.  Obviously it/she did not survive. The pathology report said no evidence of a partial mole and no abnormalities in placenta. Both pathology and MFM said it was not a partial mole, but have to follow HCG to zero. </p>
<p>So why are some 69,XXX karyotypes a partial molar pregnancy, but mine seemingly just ended in a tragic miscarriage without any known/present malignancy? </p>
<p>Any clarification or further education is much appreciated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Med student, so my understanding of this is still relatively incomplete, but hopefully this makes sense. The reason for the differentiation depends on when the duplication of chromosomal material happens and what the future risks and consequences are respectfully. In your situation there is nondisjunction of the chromatids during meiosis thus, the ovum (or sperm) has 46 instead of 23 chromosomes, when fertilization occurs the morula/blastula/embryo has 69 chromosomes from the get go. With moles, you have two variants both stemming from the same pathology. A partial mole occurs when after viable fertilization occurs 23+23=46, there is an aberrant duplication of either the male or female sets of chromosomes leading to a 23+ (23 x 2)= 69 (XXX, XXY, XYY)(Another scenario that causes this is when the ovum does not properly seal out additional sperm from entering and two sperm fertilize the same ovum). In a partial mole fetal parts can be seen because you have all the working machinery its just disordered. A complete mole most frequently occurs when a sperm enters and empty egg and duplicates, or two sperm enter an empty egg. This results in a 46 XX chromosomal genotype and in this case no fetal parts are observed (since mom's machinery isn't there) and the moles are classically described as a cluster of grapes. The important aspects here are that Triploidy (your case) carries a low recurrence rate and shows no increased risk of cancer. Moles on the other hand, specifically complete moles carry an increased risk for the development of Choriocarcinoma. Thus, often times with moles, women's HCG levels are followed as there are dramatically increased when the mole is present and eventually renormalize after removal. A consistently increased HCG level could indicate cancer, or the persistence of some part of the mole.</p>
<p>This was super long winded and probably unclear at parts, but I hope that helps.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I am sorry for your loss. My cousin went through the same thing. I hope you are doing well now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incredibly helpful (and easy to understand)! Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. You'll make a great physician!</p>
<p>Good literature that is reasonably easy to digest is hard to find. Do you have any articles I could forward non-redditors (my family)? Again, thank you. </p>
<p>Doing better.  The battle back to wellness was both physically and mentally difficult, and still a process. Only 5 weeks removed from it.  But I just keep pressing on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am also very sorry for your loss. The following wiki article may be a good place to start if you are still curious about the science behind your baby's condition: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triploid_syndrome" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triploid_syndrome</a></p>
<p>In my limited experience, the degree of mosaicism is also very important. I saw a child with Trisomy 12q on my pediatric clerkship that was still alive much longer than anyone would have predicted, not in small part due to the fact that the aberration was somewhere around 50% mosaic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, this is way outside my element so this might be a stupid question, but are these molar pregnancies  the main reason that women have miscarriages (other than environmental factors like the mom doing drugs etc) ? Or is this just one of many reasons that an (otherwise healthy) pregnancy is not viable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my understanding they are not the main reason for miscarriages, and actually the vast majority of miscarriages happen so early on women don't even know they are pregnant. Moles occur pretty erratically and I would assume happen much less frequently than spontaneous abortions due to just random chromosomal anomalies or poor cell signaling for organ and structure differentiation.</p></div>		</li>
