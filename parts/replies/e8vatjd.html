			<div class="markdown"><p>They stop pinging after a period of time.  They can last quite a bit longer under water. Air France Flight 447 was 2 years I think until it was found and recovered, so they really are pretty rugged even if underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like they have invented a Black box that ejects from the plane and floats. Makes much more sense.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The black box has definitely stopped pinging.  However, where the plane crashed (most probably) is so deep and vast, officials never really knew where to zero in.  To search for it, they had to know exactly where it crashed and calculate exactly where it landed due to its currents .  Even if they knew the crash site, it was more than likely out of range due to the depth of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Really sad and I always hope we will get an answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sonar pingers only last for a short time. For the first few days after, they assumed that it had gone down somewhere in the South China Sea, and then, when Radar data was found, that it went down just south of Indonesia. By the time the Satellite provider realised that the plane's equipment had unexpectedly left message in their logs, the pingers were almost dead - and by the time they had analysed those messages and got an idea where it might be, they certainly were dead.</p>
<p>It also went down in very deep water, so even if the pingers were working, it would still have been challenging to find them.</p>
<p>It seems now that the pilot was in charge of the plane throughout it's journey, and so locating it would be a matter of reading the mind of a dead man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pinging sonar, and you have to be close enough to active sonar like that to hear it.  If they had been lost in the Atlantic, they'd stand a better chance at detection because of all the SOSUS Nets (US Defense Sonar networks), which listen to that ocean all day.  The searchers in that first make made some educated guesses as to where the flight might've crashed and listened for the pinging, but never heard it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A navy jet crashed at sea and the black box wasn't recovered for 6 years. A civilian found the Black box, and on the side it said reward if found. So he called the navy but it was the first time anyone has asked about the award so it took awhile for the government to find money and setup an account to pay him. </p>
<p>The data was still recoverable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I said, only vaguely related, just an interesting (albeit slightly terrifying) story.</p></div>		</li>
