<p>Depressed people either don't feel these things</p>

<p>Clinical Depression here. Everyone's experience with depression is different so take this as my own personal experience. </p>
<p>Depressed people can feel happy, but not unadulterated joy. When you're deep in depression doing anything feels like you're exhausted and even the smallest things require a great deal of effort to do. </p>
<p>Get in the shower? I might as well run a 5k. </p>
<p>Often when you see us smile its because we're doing it to make other people feel at ease. Or hope that it will make us feel better because all we want to do is get back to our bat cave and curl up into a ball and be left in silence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's also why Botox makes people look unsettling for a while. It's like you can't read their emotions. Because they literally can't move the affected parts of the face. Though, I haven't really heard anyone talk about Botox for a long time.</p>
<p>&quot;The eyes are the window into the soul.&quot; It's one of those ideas that people occasionally regurgitate without really understanding it, because it's lyrical. Some writers will take it literally, to strange effect. Leading to the impression that if you got an eye transplant like in Minority Report, people might think you were sad all the time.</p></div>		</li>
