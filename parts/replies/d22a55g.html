			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be pedantic: it is not about the focal length, but the perspective distortion caused by the distance between camera and subject.</p>
<p>With that 24mm, the camera is right up close to that person. With the 70mm, the camera is at a comfortable distance (a few meters).</p>
<p>The 70-100mm gives a more relatable perspective distortion not because of the focal length, but merely because of the distance to the subject. That exact photo could have been taken with a 24mm and then cropped. That would have given the same distortion as the 70mm lens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the fact that you are more used to seeing your face mirrored, the non-mirrored version of your face looks slightly off and wrong to you and that makes you feel like you are uglier in photos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly right -- most of the effect seen <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/jpaJQ" target="_blank">here</a> is due to perspective distortion, which is due to the distance to the subject, and not focal length.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure it's right to say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That exact photo could have been taken with a 24mm and then cropped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, let's get into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics\)" target="_blank">optical distortion</a>.  That 24mm is likely to have inherent barrel distortion -- particularly if it's not an expensive professional lens but something on a point-and-shoot or smartphone.  Barrel distortion will tend to <a href="http://clickitupanotch.com/2014/06/lens-distortion/" target="_blank">make your portraits poor</a>.</p>
<p>The 70mm might tend more towards pincushion distortion -- and an even longer telephoto would definitely increase the amount.  I'd say that pincushion would be beneficial in a portrait.</p>
<p><a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-distortion" target="_blank">Here's</a> a decent article about optical distortion, which also talks about perspective distortion (not a factor of the lens) at the end.</p>
<p>Finally, you have to consider depth of field.  At the same subject-camera distance, the wide angle lens will have deeper DOF.  Again, that's bad for portraits since you're more likely to have the background in focus.  You can maintain the same DOF by <a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/depth-of-field.htm" target="_blank">bringing the wide angle closer to the subject</a>, but then you run into the same perpective distortion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in the real world, lens length is going to be the factor that affects distance from the subject, since lens <em>diameter</em> is severely limited by the device the vast majority of people use to take pictures (cell phones and compact digital cameras), and therefor the quality of the lens will not allow the same clarity of image to enlarge and crop a photo taken from far enough away to equalize the curvature of the lens across the image (even if the image resolution is high enough to enlarge it that far). People rarely complain about images taken with good DSLRs in the hands of professional photographers (or competent amateurs), but cell phones and compact digital cameras with tiny lenses are what produces the complaint &quot;DON'T TAKE MY PICTURE! I look horrible in photographs&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. But I want to add two points. Lighting plays a huge role in photos, and our eyes can see a lot bigger range from light to dark and are therefore more forgiving than a photo. But probably more to your point, some people just aren't comfortable in front of a camera ore are yet to have a good and natural photo taken of them.</p></div>		</li>
