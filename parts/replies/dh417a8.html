			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a small amount of extra detail, SO(3) is the Lie group of rotations in 3 dimensional real space. They are given by 3x3 orthogonal matrices with determinant 1. </p>
<p>SU(2) is the Lie group of 2x2 unitary matrices with determinant 1, and is isomorphic to the 3-sphere S^3 . The 3-sphere (like the 2-sphere) is simply connected since any closed loop can be shrunk to a point.</p>
<p>I know of the existence of the 2-to-1 map from SU(2) to SO(3). Quite how that pertains to the animation however, I'm not quite sure. Maybe someone could try and fill in the details.</p></div>		</li>
