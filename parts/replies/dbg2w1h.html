<p>This is incorrect and very misleading. For example, being post-menopausal is not a &quot;disease&quot;, but it is <em>associated</em> with a greater risk of bone density loss. Subsequently, there is a wealth of research into the benefits of Vitamin D and Calcium supplementation both to treat osteoporosis as a disease-in-progress, but also to PREVENT it in populations who are by no means guaranteed to develop it, but <em>might</em>. </p>

<li>Bischoff-ferrari HA. Which vitamin D oral supplement is best for postmenopausal women?. Curr Osteoporos Rep. 2012;10(4):251-7.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just one example of vitamin supplementation being a scientifically proven preventative measure in an otherwise healthy/normal population.</p>
<p>Scurvy is another example. It can be both treated and prevented by vitamin C supplementation, especially in populations who are at risk due to diet. </p>

</ul>
<p>Saying that &quot;a fully balanced diet would prevent most of these too&quot; does not negate the fact that vitamin supplements do very much work, both as curative and preventative measures.</p>
<p>It also does not negate the fact that many people do not and will not ever have adequate diets. Flogging this dead horse of an argument is comparable to dismissing discussion on lung cancer because people shouldn't be smoking. </p>
<p>Saying that &quot;supplements don't prevent cancer&quot; doesn't negate the fact that there are other benefits to supplement use.</p>
<p>Saying that &quot;there is very little that can make healthy people healthier&quot; not only incorrectly presumes that everyone who takes supplements is optimally &quot;healthy&quot;, but also that supplements are taken with the purpose of &quot;augmenting healthiness&quot; rather than to help avoid/reverse deficiencies. </p>
<p>And it is a major fallacy to promote the idea that unless a nutrient is delivered to your body by flesh or plant matter, it is of zero value. </p>
<p>Armchair shotgun scepticism and calling everything you don't like &quot;snake oil&quot; is not a helpful contribution to science.              </p></div>		</li>

<p>You make a good point about osteoporosis and vitamin D but you cannot transition from quote above (with emphasis on healthy/normal population) then go on and cite scurvy in next line. Scurvy acquired precisely because you aren't &quot;healthy/normal&quot; when it comes to your diet.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do see your point, but I'm regarding &quot;Normal&quot; as something very different to &quot;Optimal&quot; here.</p>
<p>For example, if you live in a country where you're bombarded by sunlight and you have an exceptionally high calcium diet, your requirements for vitD/calcium supplementation are lessened. But what's normal for this person is not the same as what is &quot;normal&quot; for someone in Scandinavia, yet I don't think it's correct to regard all Scandinavians as &quot;abnormal&quot; or &quot;diseased&quot;. </p>
<p>Then if socioeconomic or environmental factors are behind a low vitamin C diet (eg. university students) the line with what can be regarded as &quot;normal&quot; becomes contentious. But again, I would hesitate to call a generalised epidemic issue a &quot;disease&quot; even if scurvy itself is more tangibly a disease process than low bone density.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fact that scurvy can be completely averted with a vitamin C supplement alone really says everything I want to say against the argument that &quot;vitamin supplements are completely worthless&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, most people don't have a fully 'normal' diet. Many people stay indoors way too long, for example, due to office work and general indoors culture, which makes a lot of people at risk of being vitamin D deficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is either a very confused or dishonest and certainly specious representation of the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in elderly women. For example, the Ooms study (which used 400 IU per day) is directly contradicted by the Macdonald study (which found no benefit associated with 400 IU per day). Both studies were conducted in women with a vitamin D deficiency; the mean 25-OH vitamin D level in the Macdonald study was less than 35 nmol/L (deficiency is &lt; 50 nmol/L). The third citation you provided recommends only supplementation in women with an identified deficiency. </p>
<p>I recommend the USPTF guidance on the subject as a good, evidence-based approach based on meta-analysis of these data (URL below). They found insufficient evidence for routine supplementation of Ca/vitamin D in community-dwelling elderly women, but evidence of moderate benefit in women with vitamin D deficiency or a history of falls (so not the normal/healthy population). </p>
<p>Likewise, your comments about Scurvy are similarly specious as this is not a normal/healthy population. </p>
<p>At no point did I argue that people should not be screened for disease, nor did I argue that people with a diagnosed condition should not be treated. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few things to say about your comment.</p>
<p>Firstly, you say if you eat a healthy diet then a multivitamin is unnecessary. I feel like thats a completely redundant and irrelevant point, because the people who would be asking about the benefits of a multivitamin are not the people who already lead healthy lives.</p>
<p>Secondly, you only address people that already have healthy diets. You say that people who have healthy diets, dont need multivitamins. So what about people who have unhealthy diets? Do multivitamins help them?</p>
<p>And my third point, is you say to focus on making yourself happy. Now im the type of person who eats horribly, i know i my diet is awful, but those foods make me happy because i enjoy eating them. Im also the type of person who was blessed with a metabolism that allows me to eat those foods and still be skinny. And i also know that some day my metabolism wont be as good and all the shitty food i eat all the time will catch up to me. So will consuming a multivitamin now help me later in life? Your post says nothing about that.</p>
<p>My major point is to say that you talk about multivitamins affecting people with a certain type of diet, and not people who have an entirely different diet, so your statement is not necessarily complete. </p></div>		</li>

<p>multivitamins don't help you if you eat a good diet...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem, of course, is that many people don't eat a well balanced diet and, cognizant of that, they take multivitamin supplements.</p>
<p>No one is suggesting that multivitamins are a panacea but, equally, to suggest they're worthless as supplements is to ignore the very real lack in people's diets. </p></div>		</li>
