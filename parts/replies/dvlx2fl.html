<p>It's possible that people now feel that they have to step up their game if they want to have a shot; I know I do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>People around 40 right now and younger just seem to be much more capable of getting their act together health-wise.</p>

<p>I think it's more that they were able to see evidence of the absolute worst of the worst while still pretty young. With the two biggest being smoking and tanning. </p>
<p>But I think younger people now are just as resistant as any other generation to taking on 'new' big changes later on. The stats on weight in particular are pretty horrible. Even when people do make some effort there it's usually while desperately clinging to bad habits. Snacking and sugary drinks being some of the things that younger people just seem horrified about giving up. </p></div>		</li>
