<p>In contrast, our system entrusts the voters to properly &quot;punish&quot; those who &quot;lie.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely true, and shortcuts to the real ELI5 answer: because people don't care anymore.  Voters accept lies, and many on both sides have bought into the further lie that &quot;the other side lies, but my side doesn't.&quot;</p>
<p>But I think it's even more that people don't care.</p>
<p>They don't punish politicians for lying by voting them out, so the politicians have no incentive not to lie.</p>
<p>Congress has a super low approval rating, but individual congresspeople have very high re-election rates.</p>
<p>Those bastard politicians are a bunch of liars and cheats!  [pulls lever to retain incumbent representatives].</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see the problem the other way round. &quot;We&quot; only elect people who lie and tell us what we want to hear. I think politicians can excuse themselves these &quot;lies&quot; because it seems the only way to get elected, at which point you can U-turn and enact policy that you truly believe in. I'm in the UK and it seems no different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relavent story to explain your point:  <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2017/01/26/511798707/the-pros-and-cons-of-nprs-policy-of-not-calling-out-lies" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2017/01/26/511798707/the-pros-and-cons-of-nprs-policy-of-not-calling-out-lies</a></p>
<p>TLDR:  NPR stopped calling lies that word and instead will call them false statements because we can't really be sure what is a lie always and not all his false statements are said with &quot;malicious intent&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard NPR use the word &quot;lie&quot; before, but only in cases where the 'false statement' was repeated, and after the person making the statement was informed it was incorrect.  </p></div>		</li>
