The material contains particles that show a particular magnetic alignment when it was formed.  Once that material cooled, the alignment was locked in.  So, over eons, some material showed one orientation, while other material showed the opposite orientation.</p>
<p>A flipping magnetic field wasn't discovered until folks examining core samples from various distances from the ridge noticed a discrepancy in magnetic field alignment of material in the sample.  Once the flip was suspected, many more samples were taken to pinpoint the flips.</p>
<p>We know how fast the Mid-Atlantic Ridge expands, so it was easy to date each flip by its distance from the ridge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When igneous rocks form (such as the sea floor forming along the trans Atlantic trench), they contain a mineral (?) magnetite. As the rock cools, this mineral's magnetic fields matches the orientation of the strongest field around it (eg: the Earth's).  Using the appropriate tools you can measure the strength and orientation of this field and compare it to the Earth's current field.</p>
