			<div class="markdown"><p>Sophomore year of college. Never once got sick from drinking. Cheap easy drink of choice was Bacardi Big Apple flavored rum. Then one magical night I ripped a bunch of shots of it in about 15 minutes for...some dumb reason. Woke up on the floor the next morning after my roommate got me a trashcan and kept me on my side. Same deal, can't even smell that artificial apple smell now without getting nauseous flashbacks.</p></div>		</li>
