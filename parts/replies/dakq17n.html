<p>As far as I understand, the current theory points to Mars being much smaller than earth, which caused the core to stop its movement very early. This also stopped the process by which a magnetosphere is created.</p>
<p>Another explanation is the lack of a big moon, as it is theorized that earth's moon keeps the core's movement constant thanks to tidal forces - beyond the normal length of its movement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This &quot;fact&quot; is highly overstated in the layman literature. Yes, the solar wind helped to deplete Mars' atmosphere, but here's the thing - even if Mars did have a magnetosphere, this still would have eventually happened, it just would have taken a bit longer.</p>
<p>Mars' big problem for holding on to a thick atmosphere is not its lack of magnetosphere, but rather its size. Its just not massive enough to have a very high escape velocity, which means it's relatively easy for most atmospheric molecules to eventually get moving fast enough to leave the planet entirely.</p>
<p>After all, consider Venus: it has no intrinsic magnetosphere, yet it maintains an atmosphere 92x thicker than Earth's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I didn't know Venus lacks a magnetosphere!</p>
<p>What is the accepted theory for this? As Venus is comparable to the earth in size, the core's rotation should decline comparably slowly - is it the lack of a moon that would have added additional movement thanks to tidal forces?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People love to bring up the lack of a magnetosphere and atmosphere without realizing that life exists in forms far less <del>in</del>eradicable than what you see or what most scientists study.</p>
<p>Life can survive inside rocks kilometers underground using chemical energy to multiply once per millennia. Same goes for kilometers under ice. There are fungi in Chernobyl that <em>eat radiation from a nuclear meltdown</em> for fucks sake - an atmosphere and magnetosphere are <em>not</em> necessary.</p>
<p>If Earth were bathed in radiation orders of magnitude greater than what Mars gets, most <em>species</em> might die, but in a hundred thousand years they'd already be specializing into various niches and reclaiming all the land adapted for radiation resistant cells and protective behaviors.</p>
<p>If life was ever widely spread in and on the surface of Mars like it was on ancient-Earth then it is inconceivable to me that it isn't still there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is not a certainty. Even the extreme life you mention exists on a planet with an atmosphere and magnetosphere and has evolved from the earliest organisms that were aided by the those (and other specific) circumstances present on this planet.<br />
Life has shown a great skill in <em>adapting</em> and <em>surviving</em>, that much is true (and your examples are a great indication of that). However, it doesn't prove that life can <em>originate</em> under those extreme circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think everyone odds thinking way too much about this in earth terms now. Yes some organisms have adapted to extreme environments here, but they didn't form originally there. They formed in an atmosphere and magnetosphere that was already here with complex chemistry existing. Life would have to have formed there under incredibly inhospitable environments and we don't know of the building blocks were there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, wish I had read further down before replying up above.  No sense in looking for life on Mars, let's spend the limited budget elsewhere.  And yes everyone, I do know about extremeophiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I woudn't be so sure to dismiss this. Mars is the easiest extraterestial body for us to research - in the time we get a submarine to Titan, we can run several mars missions.</p>
<p>And there is a non-zero propability of life, including some very good places to search for it (for example liquid season flows)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes no sense. The Martian atmosphere is thin because it's lack of a magnetic sphere has allowed solar winds to strip it away from the planet. A young Mars with an active core and magnetic shield protecting it most likely had a substantial atmosphere which could have supported a temperate climate where multicellular organisms could have thrived. The issue is time and our current understanding of the window for which Mars life would have had to evolve to that point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The point is, that bigger lifeforms are way more complex and therefore also way more proned to climatical changes (and other alterations in the environment)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the big point to make, I would say. Microbes, as a general rule, are able to survive in many different environments and use a wide variety of energy sources so there could be an environment on Mars where a microbe adapted to use the nutrients present. Multicellular life requires much more specific conditions for survival (as far as we know) and it's unlikely they ever existed on Mars. However, there could be somewhere on Mars where microbes evolved to use and survive on the specific conditions there.</p></div>		</li>
