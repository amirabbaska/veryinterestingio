			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a good way of putting it. I kind of glossed over this part because of explaining things like orthogonal coding to a layman is beyond me. I think you summed it up nicely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I like to explain orthogonal coding is as an analogy to a foreign language. If youre conducting a conversation in English (your native language) and there are people next to you speaking in Swahili, while you can sense that noise, it's essentially giberish to you and doesn't impact your ability to understand your English convo. If the Swahili convo keeps growing in volume, eventually it will drown out your convo which is analagous to an overall rise in your noise floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you very much kind sir! We just did a huge expansion of our WiFi were I work, and had to explain something similar to the suits.
&quot;Why doesn't my cellphone work in the warehouse&quot;
me: because there isn't a cell tower in the big metal building you call a warehouse, and I call a Faraday cage.
&quot;Well why can't I just use the WiFi?&quot;
me: [face palm]
&quot;and what's a 'Faraday cage'&quot;
me: [rolls eyes]</p></div>		</li>
