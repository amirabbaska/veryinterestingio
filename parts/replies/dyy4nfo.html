			<div class="markdown"><p>The term hive mind is often associated with paranormally linked creatures from fiction - while a colony of honey bees definitely cooperates effectively, I felt like I should clarify for people that they are not telepaths, and communicate with sounds, body language and smells just like non-eusocial animals.</p>
<p>I know that's probably not what you meant, but some people might not really think about the manner by which bees communicate and think it just happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned by another user, they would create another queen. Sometimes if the worker bees recognize the queen isn't cutting it, they'll make another one and overthrow her when it reaches maturity.</p>
<p>On a side note, queen and workers come from the same type of egg. To get a queen from a worker egg, the workers give the larvae a lot more food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to note: when referring to honeybees, a swarm is specifically a colony-level reproduction event. A colony will raise a new queen, and when the new one is almost ready, the old queen and approximately half of the colony will leave to start a new colony elsewhere. </p></div>		</li>
