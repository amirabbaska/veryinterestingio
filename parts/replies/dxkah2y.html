			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just one way of modeling the system. There are various other ways to model it, such as the polariton model where a photon plus some atoms together make up a particle (well, quasiparticle) called a polariton. That particle has mass and thus travels slower than c. Here is a nice youtube video with explanations of the phenomenon:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mention a polariton description in one of the comments but honestly one should really only talk about such a description in certain circumstance.  A classical EM wave is not at all a quantum mechanical object, in the language of quantum electrodynamics it's what is called a &quot;coherent state&quot;, which is a state that has no notion of &quot;number of photons&quot; and is in essence a weighted superposition of all states with different numbers of photons.  So light from say a laser or a light bulb which is incident on a material boundary is not really very well described as a stream of photons.  Furthermore, a polariton is a valid quasi-particle description of a material system only SOMETIMES.  Specifically, in what is called the &quot;strong coupling&quot; limit.  </p>
<p>So it may seem attractive to say &quot;it's a photon that becomes a polariton that becomes a photon&quot;, which I discuss a bit in this response I gave to /u/hobopwnzor :</p>

<p>But you're really doing some pretty lazy alchemy in saying that.   Laser light isn't, like &quot;a million photons at energy E&quot;, it's a fairly different object, and a polariton is only &quot;quasiparticle-y&quot; under a certain set of conditions and scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking of things such as &quot;a photon that becomes a polariton that becomes a photon&quot; when I wondered what happens when plasmons intersect with polaritons at the surface of an object. One is a wave travelling through the electron cloud mostly at the surface of an object (if I am recalling this correctly) and the other is travelling through the object as a wave of shifting dipole positions (this is my summary of what you've just written). I don't know enough to figure this out, but I suspect that this is how the Enterprise's tachyon emitter works. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about an exciton polariton though, aren't you? There's a different notion of polariton that is applicable to the single photon level:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of voltage, as light, hits the surface of a material. That voltage causes nearby atoms to distort, and electrons move one direction while the nucleus (full of protons) moves the opposite direction. That distortion is the polarization, since the atoms are being affected by a polar (positive/negative) force, and they develop positive and negative poles in response.</p>
<p>It's like when sound or a physical object hits a surface and makes a sound. The inertia of the air or object is transferred into the material, but rather than moving the material as a whole it affects the individual atoms. The closest atoms are pushed into the farther atoms, creating a pressure wave: sound.</p>
<p>In the case of light, the polarization of the material causes atoms to be more negatively charged in one direction (the side where all the electrons are) and more positively charged in the opposite direction. That cancels out the incident light. The polarized atoms cause other nearby atoms to become polarized (just like a pressure wave pushes on atoms in front of it), and they pass their polarization onwards. Because polarization involves physical movement of the electrons, this is much slower than light. Once the wave of polarization reaches the far side of the material, the electric potential just continues on as light again.</p>
<p>It's a bit like the light is temporarily canceled out until the electrons move around, but that's not totally right. The original light is still there since its what is causing the electrons to move around, but its spread around a lot into moving the electrons.</p>
<p>/u/cantgetno197 also mentioned that the polarization of the atoms gets a lot more complicated and involves magnetic fields. When the atoms are polarized, they start generating magnetic fields and interacting with each other in addition to just inducing polarization. That gets too confusing for a lay explanation, IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this explanation there are two mutually exclusive cases, &quot;material&quot; and &quot;not material &quot;. How do you explain the case where the initial material continuously thins off into vacuum (e.g. photon leaving Earth's atmosphere)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If anyone ever told you light is slowed in a material because it makes a pinball path, that is utter BS.  If someone told you that it's gobbled up by atoms and then re-emitted randomly and this produces a pinball path, that's even more wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I took a college course about the solar system, the professor described light traveling through the sun's radiative zone in a similar way. Under such extremely dense conditions, does light get absorbed and reemitted in random directions like he said? If not, how does light behave in the radiative zone of the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very different situation.  I'm by no means an astronomer but the interior of a star is a plasma and you're going to have transmission dominated by things like Thomson and Compton scattering and I'm sure a healthy amount of true absorption effects for good measure (like I said, ask an astronomer).   In that case you really do have pinball.  But that's not what is happening when light is passing through your glass window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From someone with a nuclear astrophysics degree (not quite an astronomer  but close) you're right. That is the constant absorption and reabsorbtion in the super dense plasma. Hence you can say photons from stellar fusion actually take thousands of years to escape the sun. But as you can't distinguish one photon from another that's kind of a misnomer.</p></div>		</li>
