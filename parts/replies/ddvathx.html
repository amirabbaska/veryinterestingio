			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert, so take this with a grain of salt. But I've been told that little dog syndrome is actually just the results of poor training. In that certain behaviours are tolerated in small dogs, that are found to be unacceptable in big dogs. For example if my hypothetical miniture poodle growls and acts aggressive towards a stranger, it's not nearly as big of deal as when my hypothetical German Shepherd growls and acts aggressive towards a stranger. Thus my German Shepherd would get that behaviour trained out of him. While my miniture poodle is ignored. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes the most sense to me. Because people don't perceive it as threatening so they don't worry about it. Whereas a big dog, you absolutely know that dog could do some damage, so you are very aware of the responsibility to train them well. Little snappy dogs are just seen as &quot;divas&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert either, so you are probably right. That was my unscientific, anecdotal experience. I've seen little dogs that are behaved perfectly fine. I think that most dogs are not trained well enough to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. I have a small Yorkie poodle that used to be quite vicious. With training, she became less confrontational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you read the provided pdf it talks mostly about aggression as dominance. I'm pretty sure Cesar wouldn't subscribe to any of the &quot;myths&quot; in the end of the article. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder whether there's another reason - does it say something about primate psychology i.e. us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people with little dogs don't bother training them well because they don't think the dog can do any damage.</p>
<p>So if a big dog is behaving badly, the owner corrects the behavior. If a little dog is behaving badly, a lot of owners ignore the behavior and it never gets corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I think, too. Most people don't show concern when a 25lb dog is aggressive, so the owner ignores the bad behavior. Owners of larger dogs take it very serious, because people will judge their dog harshly and the owner as well.</p></div>		</li>
