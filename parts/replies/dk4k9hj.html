From the article:
&quot;The agency says it's still working on how to separate males from females before the mosquitoes are zapped.
Next steps before this irradiated mosquito can become the answer to controlling Zika: Lots of research verifying survival, mating skill, and disease reduction.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both. There are strains of mosquitoes that are threatened by some in the wild genetic modifications. The modification produces wingless female offspring but fully capable males. Eventually these strains of mosquitoes could be completely irradicated as those males continue their work.</p>
<p>Sterile males are also at times released in mass to curb populations. The goal here is to make mosquito breeding grounds a sausage fest jam packed with infertile DTF options. This means fewer babies, and can curb reduce population quite succesfully.</p></div>		</li>
