			<div class="markdown"><p>Noise isolation likely work best as earbuds which are uncomfortable for many people so then noise cancelation would be a better option. I have a pair of Parrot Zik headphones and absolutely love them. They have decent isolation and also cancelation which I use on long bus rides or planes to block out most of the engine noise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an audiophile but I've spent a bit of time lurking their sub, mostly out of curiosity. They don't like noise cancelling tech because there is supposedly a noticeable difference in sound quality. If you're someone who is interested in hearing all the subtle nuances of your music, you may find noise-cancelling headphones to be lacking. But if you really cared about all the subtleties of your music then you probably wouldn't be listening in a noisy environment anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. The characteristics that make good noise canceling speakers don't make good sounding speakers. Source: my former boss with a phd in noise canceling headphones. </p>
<p>The only good ones I've heard including the ones he designed are Bose QuietComfort and that's coming from someone who hates the terrible sound quality of Bose products. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Active noise cancelling is also fatiguing. I'd also say most audiophiles in general don't like the sound signatures of most of the manufacturers that make active noise cancelling. Bose for example I hate their headphones haven't found one I personally like. Then add active noise cancelling which makes my ears hurt usually and it's a no go.</p>
<p>As far as needing to hear music well in noisy environments:Planes would be a great place I could kick back with some jazzy lofi and and relax. Something like the Sennheiser HD 280 would work here. Good sound isolation and a decent sound quality. Also if you are in a studio tracking multiple instruments you'd wanna isolate the room noise and hear the mix more so also a great place for needing a mix of both nuance and needing to block out the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both have their applications but they may not work equally well in the same scenario. </p>
<p>Not all frequencies are canceled out equally well through isolation. While a screaming baby will pierce very distinctly through ANCs, it might be blocked out by noise isolating headphones. The constant rumble of a jet engine and the hissing sound of an airliner's air conditioning is canceled out rather effectively by a set of ANCs wheras noise isolating headphones do very little with that (especially the jets). </p>
<p>On a different note: I've heard that ANC manufacturers were able to greatly reduce a baby's screaming (obviously not 100%) but had to remove that feature when somebody failed to help their baby while wearing ANCs and the kid suffered some grave injury or even died. Anybody able to confirm that?</p></div>		</li>
