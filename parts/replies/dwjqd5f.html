			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your answer the best. The question asked is broad, almost of metaphysical nature, does randomness exist. What you do instead is take op's question and narrow it down which allows a practical answer. </p>
<p>Now, reading the origin question I for one am curious of <em> does random exist in nature </em>?  Does the definition of randomness rely on a set? And if so does that set have to have a constant cardinality?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Random means unpredictable. Uniform means all outputs are equally likely. If you take two numbers from a uniform random generator and sum them, you'll get a gaussian random number. You still can't predict it. (Although because it's not uniform, you can start to make more accurate guess.)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the sum of two uniformly chosen random numbers has a triangle-shaped distribution.</p>
<p>The Box-Muller transform provides a nice way of getting two Gaussian random numbers from two uniform random numbers.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Muller_transform</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the example, I didn't know you could do that - had to test it in Excel. A nonuniform distribution seems obvious after thinking about it for a minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are right that randomness is much more general than uniformity. I suppose there are a number of ways to interpret OP's question, but I saw it as a question about determining uniform vs nonuniform randomness. There is plenty more to say about periodic sequences, transcendental numbers, metaphysical arguments, even philosophical discussions about randomness, etc. etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! I'd like to ask though, why did you write k/(10x^2 )?     </p>
<p>I mean, I understand that to be more sure of your answer you'd need more trials, but why does it specifically increase with k and not, say, sqrt(k) or k^2 ? I am assuming, from your answer, that you did not add the factor of k arbitrarily, or for simplicity, since you mention that for k=3 we have a confidence of 99.7% (aka 3 stdev's).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, and actually I got that wrong at first. I edited back in the correct expression which goes like k^2 . The reason is because k is precisely the ratio of the excess to the uncertainty - that is, N*x = k sqrt( N/10 ). It's the number of standard devs above the expected value that you observe. When you then isolate N, you end up with k^2 on the RHS.</p></div>		</li>
