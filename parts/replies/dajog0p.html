			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in 2009, there was a swine flu outbreak at my brother's school (he was 13 at the time); he was seriously unwell, but not dangerously so. </p>
<p>Then I got it. Way, way worse. Was hospitalised for 3 days, and apparently my biggest risk wasn't the flu, but 'cytokine storm', which sounds cool but is definitely not. My entire body felt like it was going to explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Cytokine storm is exactly why. It's kind of like you immune system exploded and it's responsible for the fevers and the chills and all that. Definitely not fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was normal practice in the US and still is in most parts of the world. I was born in the early 80s, and literally almost everyone got the chickenpox, just like almost everyone gets a cold. We knew that chickenpox was much more mild in children. For almost all children, it's just a nuisance. You get itchy spots for a few days and have to stay home from school. Complications were extraordinarily rare in children and usually were just if something got infected (which was still very rare). If you talked to an adult who said they never got the chickenpox, you didn't really believe them. It was a true oddity. Imagine someone trying to tell you they never had a cold!</p>
<p>So, it made sense to expose your kids to the chickenpox when they were young. It's a weird disease, because the younger a person is, the milder the disease would be (generally speaking). So, it was better for your kid to get it as a 6 year old than a 12 year old. </p>
<p>People certainly had chickenpox parties. When my sister was about 7 (probably 1991), she got the chickenpox close to her birthday. My mom threw a birthday party for her and sent out invitations inviting everyone who either already had the chickenpox, and people who <em>wanted</em> their kids to get the chickenpox. I don't think anyone declined to come. </p></div>		</li>

<p>but it's similar to why H1N1 (Swine flu) wrecks young, otherwise healthy adults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the reason H1N1 was more dangerous to young healthy adults than usual contrary to the usually more susceptible elderly had to do with the elderly having a resistance to a strain similar to H1N1 which the younger people were born too late to encounter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they think the 1920s flu epidemic was a novel flu strain like H1N1 but from what our immune professor told us it is worse in better immune systems that can actually have this massive cytokines release. I don't think the previous exposure is the main reason, but I wouldn't doubt it's multifactorial. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spanish flu killed mostly the young, healthy adults. It didn't (usually) kill children, the old or the infirm &quot;simply&quot; because their bodies were too weak to cause the damage to themselves. </p></div>		</li>
