			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's weird when it happens. Earlier today, I saw the trailer for Annihilation which is written and produced by the director of Ex Machina.</p>
<p>Then 5mins later, I go into the thread about &quot;who would you kiss&quot; and someone mentions Alicia Vikander who took a leading role in Ex Machina.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likewise, people aren't going to repeat numbers because they don't see that as random, whereas it would be expected if truly random. </p>
<p>Just like with the coin flipping. People can tell the difference between random flips and person-generated &quot;flips&quot; (just picking heads and tails, not flipping). This is because person-generated flips won't have a long string of one outcome (7 heads in a row) because of the illusion that it isn't random. Meanwhile, the random flipping will contain longer strings, and it is what people look for when comparing the two sets.</p></div>		</li>
