Though, interesting story, my father set our voicemail password as Pi to 6 places (3.14159) so I tend to use that number for all calculations because it's burned into my brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I can make sense of it, I just find it crazy that stuff like that happens. I'm studying engineering, so we end up with a lot of identities like that without necessarily going over how they come about. </p>
<p>You're just minding your own business doing a problem that seemingly has nothing to do with circles, exponentials, or imaginary numbers, but Euler's equation will probably still pop up somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He explains this phenomenon with animations, which reeeealy helps to see what is graphically happening in using e, raising e to a power, using i as that power, and including pi to that power. His videos are amazing if you want a visually intuitive sense of some otherwise mind-blowing math. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting to note, the pi constant at least when Euler was working with it was simply a variable figure for whatever circle constant worked best for the problem at hand. </p>
<p>The reason we know it as ratio of circumference to diameter is because in his most well known book he used that ratio for an example problem. His most often used constant was in fact 2pi, circumference to radius, which many mathematicians argue should've been the constant that we know today due to its ease and regularity in trigonometry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Euler was using &quot;pi&quot; when everyone else was using...whatever. There was no ubiquitous pi constant at the time. It was popularized by Euler, like I said, as a variable circle constant that was misconstrued as the pi we know today from an early problem where he defined it as such.</p>
<p>But he would define it in other problems as tau, pi/2, pi/4, etc. It all depended on what was most useful. </p>
<p>Earlier in history both pi and tau estimates were discovered and used but were not named and varied across cultures depending on how precise their methods used were. </p></div>		</li>
