			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you mention natural frequencies, can I pigyiback with a question that's been itching for years :</p>
<p>Does air have a natural frequency ???</p>
<p>Yes, I understand that a gas may not really be an elastic body, yet, if you temporarilly create a zone of high pressure ( by snapping your fingers, for example), the air will rush to lower pressure zones, presumably overdoing it a little, making the low pressure zone higher pressure than average, then air rushes out again, overshoots a little ( a little less each time) and so forth. </p>
<p>Isn't it a form of elasticity ? </p>
<p>Even if you create a high pressure zone only once, wouldn't that create a sound wave. And if so, what determines the frequency ? Is there a natural resonance intrinsic to air at given pressure/temp ???</p>
<p>(Talking about a gas moving freely, not a column of air in a cylinder or anything)...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  Because air isn't an elastic body, there is nothing to pull it back from &quot;overdoing it&quot;, so instead of an oscillation you end up with a wave front with a specified energy.</p>
<p>You can set up a standing wave, where a wave and it's reflection combine via superposition to create a wave with larger amplitude than the original, but that's more a property of the space you are working with, instead of air itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ouah, thank you. Your answer made me understand something that had bugged me for years. Now I re-thought it in a probabilistic way.</p>
<p>Here's how it goes (in my mind) :</p>
<p>You're looking from above at a crowd of people having a picnic in a park. They (air mollecules) are evenly spaced because they don't like to be too close to others. Now if a dog comes and craps right in the middle, some people will move away, creating a zone of low pressure.</p>
<p>When, then, the offending poo is removed, people will fill the space again, but they won't all rush there, creating a zone of high pressure. There is no overdoing, as I falsely conceptualized that there was.</p>
<p>Edit : u/xyzpqr (see below) has made me see the error of my ways. Turns out my image of people in a park is pleasant, but inexact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>natural frequency arises from the ability of an object to oscillate in the absence of external forces. for this to happen you need both the initial disturbance (to deform the object) as well as some sort of rigidity to provide the restoring force (to pull itself back into shape). air does not have an original shape so. it's acoustic properties always derive from its container, be it a flute, wine glass, or even the earth (entire atmosphere contained by gravity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, taking the risk here to look like an idiot by replying to my own comment, because it's a different, if related, question.</p>
<p>Is there any way to make exactly one puff of pressure disturbance in air, and not a wave ?</p>
<p>My point is, all the ways I know about to create sound are either pushing the air, like a membrane does in a loud-speaker, and that membrane will resonate, creating a wave and not a single puff, or striking two things together, like clapping hands or striking two sticks together. In that case, the hands or the sticks will also resonate, resulting in a wave, however short in duration.</p>
<p>Say I want to create one and only one variation of air pressure, for example, locally, the pressure going down, only once, then back to normal.</p>
<p>Is there any technology that does that ? (I'm thinking flash of light, or electro-magnetism, or piezo-electric, or I don't know what...)</p>
<p>Edit : as u/ihml_13 pointed out below, I formulated it wrong. I mean can we make not a (multicrested) train of waves, but just one (one-crested) perturbation (which, yes, would then propagate as a wave, but I'm interested in the thing having only one crest.) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>any local change of pressure you generate will cause the propagation of that local change through the air as a wave. </p>
<p>its important to note that a membrane doesnt resonate with the air, but with the frequence of the magnet moving it. your hands dont really resonate with anything in a handclap. you are creating a high-pressure zone between them, the propagation of which is the sound you hear.</p></div>		</li>
