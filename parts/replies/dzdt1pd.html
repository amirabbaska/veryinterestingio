to shop around I'm sure is part of the reason why US corporate tax has been very high by world standards until very recently  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The corporate rate in the USA has also been pretty high because personal tax rates are pretty low relative to other nations. Nations like Denmark have top effective rates of up to (and over) 50%, but a corporate rate closer to 20%. Until the recent cuts we were at around 35% for both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wellll, that's only recently though. If you go back to early 80s and before, max personal income tax in the US was <em>significantly</em> higher than it is now.</p>
<p>It's one of the arguments I use against people who want to say the 50s were great but know nothing about them. Sure, let's go back to the 50s. MAGA. Give us the 50s tax rates back. We'll balance the budget in no time at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This gets into the proposed logic for the tax bill last year lowering the corporate tax rate. Which is probably a good way of answer the ELI5 question, but was a very dubious way to justify passing the tax bill.</p></div>		</li>
