<p>I remember when they first recorded this, it was huge, and it blew my mind to see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation, thank you! A follow-up question if you have time: In the video, immediately after the return stroke (at about 0:18), the leaders that are present to the right look like they're being &quot;sucked back&quot; into the return stroke. What's going on there?</p>
<p>If I were to guess, I'd assume it's because the charged particles in the leaders now have a much lower-resistance pathway in the return stroke and so they reverse course and use that path, but I know very little about electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so if we took an imaginary cross section through a lightnight bolt, (like we can a tree to see it's rings) what would we see?</p>
<p>A circular cross section of an ion path with electrons moving down? With air around? Is the glow just from the edge of the circle or all around? What is moving down the lightning path, just electrons? Where are the photons emitted from? What are the ions: oxygen and nitrogen ions, or just one? What is the structure of this channel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the leader stage, before the easily visible return stroke, a cross section would consist of an inner channel that is electrically neutral and a charged outer wall that is either positively or negatively charged depending on the polarity of the discharge.</p>
<p>The inner channel has a rather low electric field, as the charged outer wall acts as a shield. The channel consists of electrons, positive ions (primarily nitrogen) and some negative ions (primarily oxygen). There are various types of ions present, though N2^+ and O2^- are the most common. The chemistry of the channel can be quite complex with many different species (some short lived) and reactions between them.</p>
<p>The outer wall has a similar make up, but contains a surplus of either electrons (negatively charged discharge) or positive nitrogen ions (positive discharge).</p>
<p>During the return stroke, a large current consisting primarily of electrons flows through the channel. Although the channel is a good conductor, it's not perfect and the resistance of the channel causes it to heat up rapidly. This rapid heating causes thermal expansion which sends shockwaves away from the channel. These shockwaves are what we hear as thunder. The higher temperatures (and longer timescales) mean that in the return stroke ions play a more significant role in the plasma chemistry, whereas in the leader stage the chemistry is largely dominated by electrons.</p>
<p>Finally, photons are emitted by the various exited states of the background gas, primarily nitrogen and oxygen. If you'd create a discharge in a different gas, it'd have a different colour. In air, the nitrogen emissions are by far the dominant factor. Discharges in very pure oxygen are much harder to see, since oxygen doesn't emit as much in the visible range. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this clear explanation. Can you go over what causes the channel in the first place? Am I right in thinking the following: the very start would be one electron moving through air which can knock off other electrons causing a &quot;path&quot; of a small number of ions; and these ions (and the electric field) attract further electrons and create further ions, and so on. Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>
