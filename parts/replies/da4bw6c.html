			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Any frequency of light that doesn't pass through air won't make it from the sun to the ground, so there won't be any light to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air is transparent to many wavelengths meaning it lets some part pass, it may also be opaque for some. If the air was really <em>opaque</em> to a creature, it would mean the creature only sees the wavelenghts the air blocks. For the creature to have any use for eyes, it would be in a medium that's actually transparent so that it can see objects away from it, so precisely not air.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that water would fit our constraints, so I don't think there's many such creatures on earth, as I can only think of creatures with eyes in water or air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is half-right, the true answer is, no, and that the glass is transparent to all animals. Agreed the butterfly sees some change in color, but we've all seen through colored glass just fine. To make it opaque, one would need to scatter the light, commonly achieved by roughing up a surface. In this case, however, the light would need to scatter only for particular wavelengths. Common glass is simply not remarkable enough to do this job. That being said, novel optical properties are being created every day in labs, and a material that blocks 100% transmission of a particular range of wavelengths could be invented that is selectively opaque/transparent to different animals.</p></div>		</li>
