			<div class="markdown"><p>Quebecors are a confusing people.</p>
<p>They are Canadian to people outside of Canada, and French to people inside of Canada.</p>
<p>They identify themselves as being much closer to France than anyone else in the world.</p>
<p>They get insulted when French media is translated from Quebecois French into French when it is sent to France .</p>
<p>They work hard to try and isolate themselves further by claiming that language and culture are the same thing. They do their best to make it illegal to speak anything but French for fear of losing their culture.</p>
<p>They get offended really easily by any comment on them that doesn't cast them in a positive light, if the comment is from outside the province. But inside the province, you can say whatever you want, as long as you are French speaking.</p></div>		</li>
