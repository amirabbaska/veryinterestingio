			<div class="markdown"><p>Tim Hortons was bought out by Burger King years ago and shortly after moved to a version of their coffee. The old provider was picked up by Mcdonalds, so even though they only server the regular roast, it's the old stuff that Timmies used to sell!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former coffee shop employee: while the cofffee should be the same every day, sometimes the grind is finer, sometimes there are slightly more beans in the grinder, sometimes I add some other roast just to finish it off. Plenty of reasons why different batches might have more or less caffeine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I've seen if they're out, and you order a coffee, they might wait for it to get about halfway through brewing and then pour your coffee.</p>
<p>I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure the first half of the brewing produces a stronger coffee than the second half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert on this subject so maybe someone else can jump in, but your idea that sleep effects caffeine effect makes sense. Since if you don't sleep well, more adenosine will bind to the receptors before the caffeine can which may give you the feeling of tiredness that you have to process out first and then afterwards you'll have the full effect of caffeine since it's still blocking the adenosine at that point. So it may just have to deal with the fact that you won't reach that same point until a certain time has passed which is why you feel the need for more on some days versus only 75% on another. Try this next time to test my theory (only if you want :)). Drink your normal cup of large coffee over a longer span of time and see if you eventually hit the same 'super wired' feeling you feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably more to do with diet the night before, amount of sleep, quality of sleep, adenosine, and maybe even water intake.  Wired feeling may not even be from caffeine but from the water in the coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roast is the most important factor.  Most people think that dark roasted coffees are stronger than the lighter roasts, but it's actually the opposite. The longer the bean is roasted, the more caffeine and oil is extracted from it.  For more pep in your step, drink light roasted coffee (preferably made with a french press). </p></div>		</li>
