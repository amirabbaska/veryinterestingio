			<div class="markdown"><p>You could. It's called white coat hypertension. Some people's blood pressure is significantly higher when doctors take it. One common cause of this is that people are so desperate for it to be low (they may have been told that it is higher than Xx/Xx they will need a medication they don't feel they can afford or their risk of a great attack or stroke is elevated Yy% at that BP) that they get stressed and make it higher.</p>
<p>The other possibility, which is almost certainly true to some extent, is that the machines are both slightly miscalibrated. Maybe one reads a little high, the other a little low. When you use them one after the other you get quite a large difference. They might both be reading high, but one is a lot higher than the other.</p>
<p>This can also happen with manual BP. People can consistently misread in the same way as a miscalibrated machine. This happens because the sounds are somewhat subjective and there is disagreement about whether diastolic is the 4th or 5th sound - some people never get to 5, for example.</p>
<p>It's also caused by cuff placement and body position. </p>
<p>It's not an exact measurement but it's very useful even so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, i heard that terminology before, i just never feel like i have symptoms of high blood pressure, and if you investigate a bit 140/90 is first warning signs when you should take some medications, i am also tall 2m, but not fat, could that contribute or is that a myth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being tall could contribute. Possibly.</p>
<p>If you think about it, your blood pressure has to be high enough to supply the part of your body which is furthest up from your heart. 120/80 mmHg means the highest part of you could be about 1.5 m above your heart - at which the the systolic would be zero (because Mercury is 13 times as dense as water so 120 mmHg is about 1560 mmH2O.)</p>
<p>If you are tall then, in order to ensure blood flow to, for example a hand held above your head, your bp would need to be a little higher than someone shorter.</p>
<p>I don't mean to suggest this is a huge effect and, in any case, it would most likely be dynamically managed by movement and other effects but, in my head (which may or may not represent reality)  it make sense at least a little.</p>
<p>The short and tall of it is that the are lots of effects.</p>
<p>I'd recommend getting your bp checked by another (or even plenty of other) machines and even people - mercury, properly done, is still very good if you can find it. It's probably fine other than the spikes when you worry about it ☺️.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up “Whitecoat Hypertension”. I suffer from it greatly. To the extent that if they need an accurate b.p. reading from me I either need to be fitted with a 24hr ambulatory b.p. monitor or I have to take my own at home.  The mere fact of having a doctor (hence “Whitecoat”) can cause b.p. to markedly go up in some people. </p></div>		</li>
