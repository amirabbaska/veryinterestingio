			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it depend on the tree? A grown living tree is more than 50% water and the human body is made up of about 60%.  I'd want to say it makes more sense that a human isnt essentially fibrous like a living tree.  Specific trees are more prone to damage from wind and lightning strikes like Douglas Pear, which are notorious for branches peeling off from wind gusts.  So aside from the resistance a human body has to electricity compared to a tree, wouldn't the sheer force and power from current and voltage do that, is it really the density of water in the tree that makes it more possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the density of water. If I punch a tree, the bark is going to crack and fall off. If I punch you, you don't expect your skin to fall off so you? A lightning strike that creates a small explosion will not only damage the area it exploded in, but also crack through the whole tree. If an explosion occurred inside out body, it would damage the explosion site, and the rest of the force would shockwave through our body and dissipate out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water itself doesn't actually conduct electricity. You need impurities like salt, which the human body has a lot of too. If our bodies contained less salt and various electrolytes, we wouldn't conduct electricity as well and might explode from being stuck by lightning as trees sometimes do.</p></div>		</li>
