			<div class="markdown"><p>The state of a monatomic molecule in a classical gas is simply its position in phase space (3 components of position and 3 components of momentum). Any available phase space location is equally probable in a microcanonical ensemble at equilibrium. Of course there are constraints, like the gas molecule must be located within the walls of the container, and it cannot have more energy than the entirety of the gas, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Closed means that no particles can escape the system, and I'm using isolated to mean that energy cannot enter or exit the system. If it's closed and isolated, it cannot exchange particles nor energy with its surroundings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. Then I ought to have been more clear - I was talking about a closed and isolated system.</p>
<p>I don't know if the universe qualifies as closed and isolated - I've heard conflicting things on the issue, actually - but this was originally a thought process based on the idea of a &quot;tiny universe&quot; which would have no surroundings with which to interact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the thermodynamic limit when the number of particles goes to infinity the microcanonical and canonical ensemble are equivalent. This is a well-known result. See, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6608" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6608</a> for a detailed overview. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The box will contain at least 10^24 atoms, which means that the fluctuations around the average energy will be suppressed by [; 1/ \sqrt{N} \approx 10^{-12} ;]. This is for all intents and purposes essentially 0. </p>
<p>Taking the thermodynamic limit is standard procedure in statistical physics. Of course it is never completely true, but for a large enough system it will be a more than adequate approximation. </p></div>		</li>
