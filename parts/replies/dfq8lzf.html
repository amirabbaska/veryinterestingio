			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the &quot;power&quot; setting is actually % duty cycle. The magnetron turns on and off but always uses full power. Setting 5/10 is on for 50% of the time and cycles on and off. You can hear the magnetron turning on &amp; off (over the sound of the fan).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, like [BRAND] with its [FEATURE]. Just kidding, /r/hailcorporate can go fuck themselves. Panasonic microwaves have an &quot;inverter&quot; feature which allows for truly variable microwave radiation intensity so it can do 35% power for example constantly for a slower cooking time to not burn food or have those extreme hot/cold areas. It's a better idea than pulsing 100% power on and off. Again I'm not shilling for the brand, so if anyone has any other companies that they know of, feel free to post them below</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true, Microwaves will heat anything with an electric dipole (ie, things that will orient themselves in an electric field).  Water is one, but many molecules are electric dipoles (ie, any polar molecule - so almost all oils are dipoles meaning that).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The microwaves only penetrated the edges of the soup, (as they are tuned to be absorbed by water) much of which is in direct contact with the bowl, and the heat transferred to the bowl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bullshit. The absorbtion band for water is outside the frequency range of the microwave. It heats through dielectric loss.</p></div>		</li>
