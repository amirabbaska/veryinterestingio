			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, that's an answer I can appreciate. My undergrad was in ChemE and I took a couple of MetE classes and a corrosion class, but I never had this simple tidbit pointed out to me. Had no idea it was all about the chromium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really the chromium that changes the magnetism, it's the nickel (300 series) and maganese (200 series) that stabilizes the austinitic phase. This prevents martensite formation, and thus the austinitic steels are not heat treat friendly. The chromium plays more to hardenability, as it is what allows for precipitation hardening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not all about the chromium, but it's a nice simplification. It's about the electron configuration/bands: aka crystallography - determined by the composition and highly influenced by the chromium, but also by other elements - and the iron content.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course, I'm used to carbon steels...</p></div>		</li>
