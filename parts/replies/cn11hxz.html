			<p>re: the structural changes point #1--housing.  Even good credit risks (i.e. people with good credit scores/money down/steady job for multiple years) were talked into sub-prime mortgages because &quot;hey! Houses are a good investment and you can refinance into a 30 year fixed in a couple years! In the meantime, here's a very very low payment!&quot;----except then values dropped, jobs disappeared, and suddenly no one can make their payments.  Everyone loses, except the guy on Wall Street who bet against those mortgages.<br><br>Source: that's what happened to us.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes you are right. The low rates were seductive. And then even home owners who were doing everything right ended up with house values that fell, sometimes even below what the mortgage value was at. So it was cheaper for them to walk away. It was a horrible domino effect that just shredded the housing market for everyone. </p>		</li>
