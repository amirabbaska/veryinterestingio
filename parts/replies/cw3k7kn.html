			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, you still need to eliminate a lot of cars before a city like Beijing is smog free. In large cities, effectively all smog is due to cars since the power plants are further out and they can cleanse most of their NOx emissions through lime scrubbing. Catalytic converters help, but not enough to prevent smog in a still air valley city of 10+ million people.</p></div>		</li>
