			<div class="markdown"><p>Mating between two different strains enables the creation of progeny seeds with a mix of genes from both parents. There are a couple concerns related to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>IP/breeders rights - Producing these herbicide-resistant or otherwise engineered strains can require thousands of man-hours of expensive research. Therefore, many companies stipulate how and whether farmers are allowed to breed their engineered strain with other strains as a means of protecting their investment/product. As the video does a good job of explaining, this concern is much more about the practices &amp; policies of the agriculture industry than it is about biology or genetic engineering.</li>
<li>Containment as mitigation against unforeseen outcomes. It is possible that while the engineered strain of GMO has been proven safe for humans, a hybrid strain may be less safe. Alternatively, there is a (very) small chance that engineered genes could be transferred to other plants (via horizontal gene transfer), which could have unknown outcomes. For example, imagine a weed is able to acquire herbicide resistance genes from a GMO, thereby making a weed strain that can proliferate even in the presence of herbicide. My understanding is that this possibility is seen as unlikely, but a concern nonetheless. (Plant engineers should jump in here if I'm mistaken!)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breeding GMOs with non-GMOs is not necessarily a bad thing. It does raise concerns when plants such as bt-corn cross breed with wild plants because it could give them an unfair advantage in their ecosystem by giving them pest resistance. But in practice this rarely happens and even when it has in the past it has not become consequential. I hope this answers your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hasn't been an issue yet. But that could change as we still aren't 100% sure what long term effects GMOs will have. Hopefully everything turns out great!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because some people are fear mongering about companies who own patents for that GM seeds will sue the farmers where those hybrids grew. Hint; nothing like that ever happened, not with GMOs, not with Monsanto.  But they keep bullshitting about this, about terminator seeds, cancer, autism, etc. Just another conspiracy theory, doing more bad than good.</p></div>		</li>
