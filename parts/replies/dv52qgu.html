			<div class="markdown"><p>Angler fish is even better. The big angler fish with the light baits are the females. The males are tiny little fish that look for females, and promptly bite onto the female and become a pair of balls for the rest of their lives.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The males are monogamous, being fused onto a female gives them no choice. The females, however, can have more than one male attach. She has her own creepy harem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a YouTube video that talks about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/tn9IDkM-_90" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/tn9IDkM-_90</a>
It's honestly one of the most interesting animal facts I've learned.</p>
<p>Some highlights: not all species of males combine permanently with the females. But the ones that do great this weird Anglerfish Centipede situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey Nax, I know we just met, but would you like the live in my canal? I know it’s serious, but hear me out. I’ve got a stable job, financially sound, and I’m not uncomfortable at all sticking pop tarts into my bodily orifices (I know they’re your favorite) so just like, mill it over a few days, we can talk about it more, it’s a big step.  But I really feel like I have a connection to you, and I’d really like to have you inside me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another true monogamous creature is the anglerfish. There's over 300 species, and the male is tiny compared to the female and looks nothing like the female.  When a male finds a female, he bites her and his mouth fuses to her, and gets all his nutrients from her. He essentially becomes a sperm producing parasite.</p></div>		</li>
