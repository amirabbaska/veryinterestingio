			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that Titans are two generations removed from chaos.</p>
<p>At first there was nothing; chaos, the void and absence of all things. Then Gaia was formed. Gaia gave birth to Uranus. Uranus and Gaia got it on and had the Titans (among other things).</p>
<p>But Uranus was pissy, and locked the Titans in Tartarus. This pissed off Gaia. She gave Cronus a sickle and he castrated Uranus.</p>
<p>Now the Titans come to power. Rhea and Cronus have the Olympians, but Cronus is deservedly skeptical of children at this point. He eats all of the Olympians as they're born. Rhea gets pissy and tricks Cronus into eating a stone instead of Zeus. Zeus grows up and beats the crap out of Cronus, and he pukes up the other Olympians. Then the Olympians overthrow the Titans.</p>
<p>Where do humans fight into the narrative? The mythology of humanity is split into five (or four) ages. The origin age is the Golden Age, when the Earth produced enough food for everyone. The Golden Age ends when Prometheus (a Titan) steals fire from Olympus to give to humanity. Zeus chains Prometheus to his rock and creates Pandora's Box to reduce humanity from their god-like state.</p>
<p>So the Titans actually ruled over humanity during the Golden Age, not a chaotic period.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much the outline for most creation myths and how they explain the major pantheon of gods. Specifically similar to Norse mythology because they both use Giants and Gods--not dissimilar from Mesopotamian mythology either</p>
<p>Edit: except the Norse version has a giant cow in it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically prometheus ends the garden of Eden, the ultimate blissful state humans are supposed to have lived in before everything went bad, because the humans got something the Gods didn't want them to have because it sends those tiny creatures on their path to maybe rivaling them one day. (fruit of) knowledge/fire. That is also still part of the creation myth.</p>
<p>But you are right. I oversimplified things a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually kinda worse, man had fire. He tricked Zeus into accepting the lesser quality of the animal as the sacrifice leaving the greater part to man. Zeus took fire from them to punish them, so Prometheus took fire from the sun itself to give to man. The other titan involved in making man (Prometheus shaped us) gave away all the good traits before he got to man so instead Prometheus got the idea to give us the ability to stand up like a god and fire. Zeus basically took one of the few things mankind had and thus Prometheus righted everything by giving it back to us.</p>
<p>It wasn't even the gods having a problem, it was Zeus specifically. Each generation the male chief eventually grows so fearful they destroy their young until their spouse has their child overthrow them. </p>
<p>Prometheus was also punished literally for refusing to tell Zeus which of his kids would kill him (preventing Zeus from breaking destiny). </p></div>		</li>
