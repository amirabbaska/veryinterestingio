			<div class="markdown"><p>As a veteran and now a contractor in Afghanistan, I would blame the military pushing people out and the troop limit overseas.</p>
<p>Everytime they announce a draw down of troops there is an equal influx of contractors to make up for it. Its all just to show &quot;Hey, I'm pulling out of Iraq just like I said I would&quot;. </p>
<p>All that adds up to more money, because contractors obviously get paid a considerable amount more then military.</p>
<p>I am uneducated in how the whole system works, just the experience of a lowly aircraft mechanic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everytime he says something generally understood, but doesn't want to research exact numbers or they don't exist he says *citation needed. </p>
<p>For instance &quot;There's a lot of water in the ocean<em>  </em>citation needed</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a very real frustration in that, in the military's eyes, they're being hamstrung over the long term for the benefit of those who hold their budget in their hands, and it's a bipartisan problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose it doesn't matter much that we spend far more on defense than any other country, including Russia and China.  I'd imagine it's not unlike going from a high paying job to a lower paying job - you're used to having that higher level of income, and if it goes on long enough, that becomes your new &quot;neutral&quot; point, right?</p></div>		</li>
