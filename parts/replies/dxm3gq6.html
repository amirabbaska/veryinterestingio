<p>No, Not in the sense that your asking... Every wing has a center of lift... a swept back wing has a center of lift that is further back along the aircraft fuselage. Allowing for the center of gravity to be further back as well. This is good because the further back (to an extent) the better it is for aircraft stability.</p>
<p>Also, it is best kept the CG slightly aft or slightly forward of the center of lift so that the vertical stabilizer <the T at the the back of plane> can trim so the the aircrafts mean center of lift is equal to or matches the center of gravity...</p>
<p>Flight is a very complicated dance of lift, balance and speed and a swept back wing provides a larger area of adjustment for all three. speed as described in other comments and balance and lift as described above.</p>
