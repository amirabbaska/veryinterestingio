<p>When you have people who say offensive things and use freedom of speech to defend themselves, they're wrong because the government can still censor anything without social value or anything inflammatory, or anything hateful ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uhh... This is incorrect. There are very few things the U.S. government can censor.</p>
<p>For example you cannot yell 'Fire!' in a crowded theater.</p>
<p>You cannot make terroristic threats -- like 'I'm going to blow up this plane!'</p>
<p>Statements would likely cause immediate panic and harm -- not offense! Panic! There's the difference.</p>
<p>But you could say, &quot;Ebonians are criminals. Ebonians should be sent back to Ebonia.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement is inflammatory -- meaning it may cause people to become offended. Or it may cause more people to dislike Ebonians. But it will not cause immediate panic.</p>
<p>One other kinds of speech not allowed is libel or slander. As long as you are talking about a public official, or a matter of public concern, you cannot be accused of libel or slander. To be plain, you may express an opinion about a matter of public concern, like a religion or a group of people.</p>
<p>Since the subject of Ebonians is a public concern, you can say anything you want about Ebonians. You could say, &quot;Ebonians are a menace to soceity&quot;. The U.S. Constitution protects you.</p>
<p>All of society may believe that your opinion is inflammatory. All of society may believe your opinion is hateful. But you are protected by the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. </p>
<p>You will never be arrested. And those who try are themselves breaking the law and will be punished.</p></div>		</li>

is that considered </p>
<blockquote>
<p>directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action&quot; and &quot;likely to incite or produce such action&quot;</p>

<p>So does the violent tendencies and thin skin of the audience determines if violence is likely, and thus making my actions illegal?</p>
<p>Because i know i'm likely to get a beat down from the trump supporters (or wear a trump hat in a Berkely march).</p></div>		</li>

<p>No they cannot. That is why KKK parades cannot be outlawed, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/19/a-history-of-the-aclu-defending-confederate-veterans-the-kkk-and-rush-limbaugh/" target="_blank">ACLU will rightfully sue any government who attempts to do so.</a>
As long as they are not inciting immediate violent action, their speech no matter how hateful and without social value, is protected by the first amendment and cannot be censored by the government.<br />
It seems that many Americans don't even grasp the most basic concepts of their most fundamental laws.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Um, is it just me or is that totally wrong? The point is that the government CANNOT censor you and should not. Offensive speech is surely not welcome, but you cannot arrest or stop people from using words. </p>
<p>Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is totally wrong. The SCOTUS has upheld all kinds of racist, bigoted, or otherwise hate speech on numerous occasions. There are exceptions but they usually have to do with public safety (yelling Fire in a movie theater type stuff). Brandenburg v. Ohio is a relevant case for inflammatory speech.<br />
R.A.V. v. City of St. PaulÂ for hate speech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouting fire in a crowded theater is actually <a href="http://civil-liberties.yoexpert.com/civil-liberties-general/is-it-legal-to-shout-%22fire%22-in-a-crowded-theater-19421.html" target="_blank">perfectly legal.</a> It's never been literally decided, but the implications are important. Shouting fire means just saying something that could be dangerous would be illegal, that's not how the SCOTUS views the second amendment. Rather, you have to <em>specifically</em> call for violence (i.e. let's all violently run out of this theater and trample each other).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I never understood that. Can't they just charge them with something else?</p></div>		</li>
