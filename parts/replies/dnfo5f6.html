			<div class="markdown"><p>THC (tetrahydrocannibidiol) is a psychoactive and binds to cannabinoid receptors, which affects how pleasure, memory, thinking, concentration, movement, coordination, and sensory and time perception work. The THC side of weed is why weed is classified as a psychedelic. High amounts can cause visuals and hallucinations. (My experience with high amounts I might imagine some things but usually fall sleep / don't remember anything to see any vision changes). But it doesn't effect vision like alcohol as it binds to cannabinoid receptors instead of slowing down all receptor time in the brain.</p>
<p>CBD (cannabidiol) is non-psychoactive, but holds beneficial properties such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>anti-depressant</strong> - combats depression and anxiety</li>
<li><strong>anti-oxidant</strong> - helps the body protect from harmful molecules called free radicals</li>
<li><strong>anti-inflammatory</strong> - reduces inflammatory (swelling etc)</li>
<li><strong>anti-psychotic</strong> - combats psychosis</li>
<li><strong>anti-convulsant</strong> - suppresses seizure activity</li>
<li><strong>anti-tumoral</strong> - combats tumor and cancer cell growth</li>
<li><strong>anti-emetic</strong> - combats nausea and vomiting</li>
</ul>
<p>tldr; CBD will not affect any of the senses (non-psychological properties). THC is psychoactive causing all the affects of marijuana, it is a psychedelic and visuals and hallucinations are common in high amounts. But, won't cause visionary effects like alcohol as it does not reduce receptor time.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I am wrong :)</p></div>		</li>
