			<div class="markdown"><p>On your last point: a friend of mine works with kids and and sees his fair share of rambunctious kids falling and hurting themselves. When they fall he plays it off as a joke that they pulled on purpose -- as if they're some sort of tumbler comedy act -- because when he does this kids who were tearing up while looking for an adult to cry to just stop.</p>
<p>His anecdotal and unscientific reasoning is simple: kids know the response they get from adults if they're hurt. They know if they cry and run to their parents they'll get a certain response from mom and dad that they find desirable. Some kids are conditioned to seek out attention for every little bump and subverting that expectation while still giving them positive attention fulfills the same need they're wanting met but does so without making a big scene about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d completely agree with this. My response to my kids falling or bumping their heads when they were little and I could tell it wasn’t something serious was to say, “whoops! Try again!” or something along those lines. Since they didn’t get a big reaction, they would only lose it if something really, really hurt. Now that they’re older, we know that tears mean something’s likely broken. </p>
<p>On the flip side, my nephew is 5 and every single time he gets the slightest injury a big deal is made out of it. He gets a special bandaid, he gets coddled, and he gets an ice pack. 9/10 times the bandaid and ice pack are completely unnecessary. As a result, any slight mishap leads to him screaming and bawling his eyes out so he gets the attention and special things he wants. Unless he’s at auntie’s house. Auntie don’t play that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We usually made a little a joke about our kids getting a bump etc, once we could see they were find. The good outcome to this is if we hear them do a certain cry - it’s go time because it’s probably going to be a hospital trip (having five this is not an irregular occurrence). But 97% of the time a kiss and a cuddle is all that’s needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom used to threaten to cut off the finger or whatever limb had a little scratch as a joke til me and my sister learned it's probably not so bad at first. So we started to only complain with real injuries and I used it with my daughter. It's a good system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid and injured myself pretty badly once, I didn't actually start crying until people started mentioning that I was injured. Crying for me wasn't a reaction to the pain or injury. It was a reaction to social stimulus that seemed to expect crying in response to injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall my sister getting a mild injury (something like a scrape or cut, I don't recall exactly) while my parents were out.  She was fine until they got home a couple of hours later, at which point she burst into tears.</p>
<p>She was at least four, but no more than eight.  So definitely social stimulus at that age for her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed this with my young nephew, too. Most of the time when he hurts himself, he has a moment of &quot;whoa!&quot;, and if none of the adults go &quot;oh no you're okay!&quot; and fuss over it, he doesn't cry. This just goes for little things, like if he trips and bumps his knee, or drops a toy on his foot, of course. </p></div>		</li>
