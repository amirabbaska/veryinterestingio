			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was common knowledge that sociopaths actually often use their knowledge of their own lack of empathy to their advantage. Many sociopaths are very good at blending into society because not only do they understand that they lack empathy, but they can still recognize empathy, and also understand when empathy is socially expected and can mimic it at will. Many sociopaths are good at identifying empathy in others, can recognize situations where displaying empathy is what is socially expected of someone, and have learned how to mimic empathy very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of depends on how we apply “sociopath” since it’s not specific to psychiatry.  Many people with antisocial personality disorder totally lack empathy, but also lack self control.  They know they don’t care about others/enjoy hurting others, but may be the guy that’s viciously punching a man to death for his wallet without remorse.</p>
<p>Intelligence is still a factor and people with factors that would lump them into “sociopaths” occupy the same bell curve as everyone else, so your manipulators and blenders would be in the minority.  We’re just more likely to label them as such when the others may get lumped in with other crime (a guy who panic shoots a clerk during a robbery and a man that laughingly shoots a clerk during a robbery committed the same crime with the same consequences but different emotional responses) since we do tend to cultivate the Hannibal Lecter image of the cultured sociopath.</p>
<p>Most seem moderately aware, ranging from laughing and considering it a bonus to manipulating it for career gain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception, but it has been shown that psychopaths/those with Aspd do not lack empathy categorically. It is more as if there is an empathy switch in the brain and the psychopaths default is off. It has been shown that if they are instructed to empathize, they can display levels of empathy almost indiscernible from those of nt's.
Furthermore, you conflated a lack of empathy with sadism, a common mistake, but they are not the same. Simply lacking empathy does not necessarily mean that you enjoy hurting others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me wonder if there are psudo-sociopaths.  People that are almost a sociopath but can have empathy to ones close to them but have a hard time being empathetic to others.  Is it really black and white?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also kind of occurred to me what if people are just aware of the process of empathy, I mean they might feel empathy but they could then choose to ignore empathy or choose to employ empathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Empathy is very rapid and requires almost no thought. You see something sad, cringey, heartfelt, and at that moment you're in their shoes experiencing the same feeling. Someone that lacks empathy would have a noticeable delay or just forget to show emotion. Think about a situation where you watched say UP or some other movie and cried.</p>
<p>I'd imagine it's detectable to some degree if the person is put in a new situation or is not clued into the emotion? Just guessing though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's better to categorize empathy as understanding emotions and sympathy as feeling them. Sympathy is when you laugh along others to something that's not that funny. The aforementioned use of empathy would be when you know how someone feels, only without necessarily feeling it yourself. More of a logical understanding, like being described in this thread.</p>

<p>However empathy technically includes sympathy as sympathy is oft listed as a category of empathy. Also some people have completely mixed up the meanings of empathy and sympathy, like a Grammarist article going around and being used a source in the Wikipedia page for sympathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard an interesting radio interview a few months back about a scientist who was studying brain wave patterns that differentiate sociopaths. He was going through the double-blind test results and found a positive result in the control group pile. Thinking it must be a mistake, he had an assistant access the identity, and discovered it was his own brain. He redid the test - and by his own study discovered he matched the markers od sociopathy. He has since written a book about being a borderline sociopath, and the reasons he believes sociopaths are capable of being positive and constructive members of society with the right support networks. Kills me but I don't remember his name. Show was, I think, Criminal, but I'm not certain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His name is James Fallon - he was actually researching Alzheimers, as well as sociopathy for an unrelated research project. He was the subject of really fascinating Atlantic article that you should definitely check out if you're interested in learning more. It helped me understand a lot of my then-SO's behavior (and maybe a little bit of my own, too). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2005, James Fallon's life started to resemble the plot of a well-honed joke or big-screen thriller: A neuroscientist is working in his laboratory one day when he thinks he has stumbled upon a big mistake. He is researching Alzheimer's and using his healthy family members' brain scans as a control, while simultaneously reviewing the fMRIs of murderous psychopaths for a side project. It appears, though, that one of the killers' scans has been shuffled into the wrong batch. The scans are anonymously labeled, so the researcher has a technician break the code to identify the individual in his family, and place his or her scan in its proper place. When he sees the results, however, Fallon immediately orders the technician to double check the code. But no mistake has been made: The brain scan that mirrors those of the psychopaths is his own.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a throwaway for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed a few yeara ago, but ive always known I was different.</p>
<p>It is however, incredibly difficult to talk about without being immediately shut down, judged, or called a liar.</p>
<p>But I'll try to be as honnest as I can, in the interest of answering this question.</p>
<p>The biggest part of this is that there is a misconception that no empathy means you cannot care. It is true that I am unable to understand how others are feeling. I dont have that empathic bond with my fellow humans. There are however people in my life that I would like to keep around. Its a conscious decision for the most part, but its my version of the bond everyone else feels to other people.</p>
<p>I have done my fair share of bad things in the past, I'm not proud of them, but I dont feel all that much guilt either. I simply know that to repeat them would not be beneficial to my future.</p>
<p>I do see my condition as a disadvantage, and I try my best to emulate those around me, or substitute my own methods in order to try and experience some of the same things.</p>
<p>I really dont know if that helped to answer the question at all, its not something im used to talking about. If you have any specific questions I'll do my best to check them in the morning and get back to you.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that I am in no way speaking for all sociopaths, as you said, other factors determine the effects it can have on the individual and how they handle it. This is just from my point of view. Thankfully I got lucky I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly, you are saying you were diagnosed with sociopathy? What about psychopathy? Have you ever checked how you score on the <a href="http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/Hare-Psychopathy-Checklist.html" target="_blank">Psychopath checklist</a>?</p>
<p>You said that one reason you don't talk about the condition is that you are judged. How does being judged negatively, for this reason or any other, make you feel?</p>
<p>For the people in your life that you want to keep around: can you say with any certainty that you do or don't <em>love</em> them? Would losing any of them be emotionally devastating to you? I can imagine not feeling empathy to an extent, but for some reason it is much harder for me to imagine never feeling love of any kind.</p>
<p>Thank you for your honesty, and sorry if any of my questions seem rude.</p></div>		</li>
