			<div class="markdown"><p>we can measure the extinction of light from other stars. Based on how much light is absorbed we can calculate the average particle density of interstellar space. If we were actually inside a nebula the stars around us would be much dimmer, if visible at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but probably not in the way you're thinking. </p>
<p>Right now, we're in what's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Bubble" target="_blank">the Local Bubble.</a></p>
<p>It's a relatively small region of space where the interstellar medium seems to be about 10 times less dense than the average of the Milky Way. </p>
<p>However, within that Local Bubble, we're probably passing through what's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud" target="_blank">Local Interstellar Cloud</a>, which is denser than most of the rest of the Local Bubble, but still less dense than the average of the milky way's interstellar medium. </p>
<p>Calling this a cloud of gas would be a bit misleading. It's still only 0.3 atoms per cubic centimeter; where the ISS orbits, that number is I think in like the billions or trillions. </p></div>		</li>
