<blockquote>
<p>Crystals also have asymmetrical ground states. As a crystal reaches its ground state it always has some bits that are pointy and some bits that are smooth. It's not the same on all sides, so it's asymmetrical, just like the magnets.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Now some people think that there might be some weird objects that have asymmetrical ground states across time rather than space. That's what they mean by time crystals.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the ground state of the 'crystal' is asymmetric across time. That essentially means that the crystal can move without releasing any energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still confused, what does it mean to be asymmetric? Are we referring to its shape? So it can move in space without releasing energy, does that mean it doesn't interact with other matter so once it's in motion, it will not stop moving since energy cannot be extracted?</p>
<p>Am I thinking about this wrong? Everyone seems to be talking about the ground state of this matter, any idea what happens when you give it energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A crystal is defined as something that repeats regularly in space. So basically atoms arranged in a lattice.
A &quot;time crystal&quot; is something that repeats regularly in time and is not at all a crystal in the ordinary sense. At least it doesn't have to be. </p></div>		</li>
