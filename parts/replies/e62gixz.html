			<div class="markdown"><p>Why the different colors at the same time though? It would suggest the thickness of the film varies accross the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly it! The colour you can see being reflected reflects (pun intended) the thickness of the bubble skin at that location on the bubble. </p>
<p>The reason there's loads of different colours is because the thickness of the bubble skin isn't the same across the whole bubble/changes over time :)</p>
<p>E: added some extra stuff and made it clearer </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what? I thought it depends on the angle...</p>
<p>Although I'm not so sure anymore because last time I blew bubbles was <em>very</em> long time ago and I never walked around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably true too, but I think there's another big reason. When light reflects off the bubble at a greater angle, the light that travels through the film needs to travel further. Therefore, the color gradually changes according to the angle of the bubble's surface you're looking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>Minimums and maximums of interference on certain angles differ based on the colour, or rather, wave length. Which means that at different angle exposes different colour, as most of the time others will have interference minimums in their place (or in other words, won't be visible to human eye).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This video illustrates thin film interference well, you can clearly see how as the thickness of the film changes so does its relationship with optics:</p>
