			<div class="markdown"><p>So once the rocket is moving, it doesn't really need anything to <em>keep</em> burning thrusters as an object will stay in motion according to Newton's Law right? So why do I always hear &quot;it would require X amount of fuel to cover Y amount of distance in space&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know where you've heard that, but it is not how things work. Your first sentence is correct. What you <em>do</em> need is enough fuel to change your velocity the right amount to get on the correct path, at which point you just coast. </p>
<p>Once you're in a given orbit or escape-path you will stay on that path indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spacecraft burn their engines at specific points in a mission. Let's say you want to go to Mars. First a big rocket can burn to put you up into Earth's orbit. Then you can do another burn to speed up enough that you escape the pull of Earth and (hopefully) glide around the Sun until you get to Mars. Now you're likely going very fast relative to Mars, and due to energy conservation, anything going to a planet is also going fast enough to escape from the planet. So you zoom in next to Mars and do another burn in the opposite direction, slowing down until the pull from Mars curves your trajectory into an ellipse.</p>
<p>All of these things require fuel of course. Instead of &quot;x amount of fuel for y distance&quot; think about it more like &quot;x amount of fuel for y mission.&quot; You can go somewhere in many different ways but there are methods and time windows that let you do that very efficiently.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is quite right.  The idea is to plan the flight path so you arrive and Mars arrive at the same space in space at the same time at roughly the same speed.  <a href="http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Smars1.htm" target="_blank">This</a> explains it much better.</p>
<p>Edit:  I misinterpreted stuff and am wrong but I was thinking /u/commiecomrade was suggesting you go there in a straight line</p></div>		</li>

<p>You both have the same mass. Now you push your buddy as hard as you can. He will get pushed away from you, but because of Newton's third law you will also get pushed away from him. </p>

<p>There's a beautiful little example of this in Episode 4 of &quot;The Expanse.&quot; The characters are on a larger carrier spacecraft (that is under thrust) and are running along a gangway to a smaller spacecraft that's docked. All of a sudden the thrust of the carrier spacecraft cuts out, putting them in micro-gravity, and the float off the gangway. The one character clips a tether to the other, and then pushes her away to get himself back down to the gangway, whereupon he hauls her back down via the tether.</p>
