			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the more specific answer is that the same problem could occur is multiple places in the code.  An error code can be searched in the code to establish the exact location of the problem. </p>
<p>While he core problem may be that there is no connection to a server, telling the use which server is pointless as they won't communicate that info properly to the developer. </p>
<p>But if you tell tech support that it says &quot;unable to connect. Error XM-345&quot; tech support can look up that code and search the knowledge base. And the developer can look at the code and track down exactly which line of code failed to connect to a server. </p>
<p>So &quot;unable to connect&quot; might have 100 different error codes based on WHAT couldn't connect. </p>
<p>Another problem is localization. You could write a different error message for each type of connection failure. But then when you translate the app to Hindi, you have to translate each of those messages.   So you just translate &quot;could not connect&quot; and move on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this didn't address the question. Instead of saying &quot;Error code abc. Check xyz.&quot; Why not just say &quot;Could not connect to server. Check xyz&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Instead of just saying &quot;No internet connection&quot; It says a bunch of gibberish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just quoting OP for relevance.  It didn't just show the error code, but an error message that was ostensibly not useful or intelligible to the OP, so I answered in that context.</p>
<p>Systems that only crank out an error number or extremely abbreviated description are somewhat rare today but in the past that's come down to resources: disk space or even display space (&quot;PC Load Letter&quot; being a popular example due to the old HP printers' single line display).<br />
When building a program, the first priority of error output is it needs to be useful to the programmers.  That's why you sometimes see those overly complex, &quot;gibberish&quot; errors.  </p>
<p>At some point, someone has to go back through all the error codes/output and <em>translate</em> those to simple, friendly language, as well as (like I described before) include the likely causes (if the end user is expected to rectify the issue).  All of that takes more programming, time and money.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>maybe this helps here.</p>
<p>Try to run this program with a small number then with 0, then with some letters insttead of a number....</p>
<p>you will notice interesting differences.</p>
<p>the &quot;gibberish&quot; in this case is actually readable by humans because its a very standard error and microsoft already provides info for it.....</p>
<p>if you are writing your own exceptions though then you sometimes do things that are way more complicated to explain than dividing by 0 so your errorcode has to just be findable by users online and/or by devs/support - with a trace (wich can be hundreds of lines / and extra info) hidden from the user in a log file.</p>
<p>To actually answer the question you have to notice that the title is different from the text. An exact error code is very different from &quot;a bunch of gibberish&quot;...</p>
<hr />
<p>You can just say &quot;I cant lift my feet very well&quot;</p>
<p>Your doctor [diagnosis module of the program or sth like that] might just tell you: &quot;something blocks the activation of nerfes below your knee and there could be many reasons for this. Just dont step up so hard and try not to bend it....&quot;</p>
<p>If your doctor sends you to a specialist [customer support / google] with a note of &quot;Osmiplastosis at the left furunkel&quot; you have no clue what that means, but the specialist will know where to check and what to check and what he may can do about it... </p>
<p>The specialist then starts to look from there. With that info he can check you up very fast and sees that the problem comes actually from your spine......</p>
<p>Now the specialist gives his full diagnosis [errorcode + stacktrace + log... whatever] to a surgeon [dev] to fix it...</p>
<hr />
<p>In the case of op he got the doctors diagnosis for the other doctor and probably the specialists diagnosis for the surgeon... wich I, as surgeon, would say is a misstake.</p></div>		</li>
