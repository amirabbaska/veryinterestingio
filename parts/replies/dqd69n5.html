<p>I t was already confirmed that when the brain sleeps, blood flow and other activity in different brain regions changes throughout the sleep cycle, hence the cause of the different sleep stages, so that each region can remove waste and do other maintenance activities at different times. The change in blood flow helps fluids move around easier, and it's also what causes the different levels of consciousness we experience throughout the sleep cycle. And that's what the different brain scanners already pick up, the images we see are a direct representation of blood flow activity in each brain region. And the deeper we sleep, the bigger and longer those changes in blood flow are throughout the brain. I've seen a paper on this before, I'll post it when I find it.</p>
<p>So people with &quot;holes&quot; in their brains, those aren't holes, those are regions with too much inflammation and very little blood flow, due to the lack of waste removal causing buildup and diminishing blood flow. Well there are other things that cause the &quot;holes&quot; that the scans show, but that's what the holes signify, lack of blood flow/activity. That is why unhealthy diets and lack of sleep show the same holes in the brain as neuro disorders show, which have both been described as lower brain activity in one region, aka less blood flow, and accelerated brain activity in the other, aka more blood flow due to the increased pressure caused by trying to pump the same amount of blood through an inflamed brain that isn't getting enough waste/buildup removed or has other issues (benign tumors, other growths/blockages).</p>
<p>We've already had dozens of papers explaining all of these things, I don't know why you redditors here keep ignoring those papers. The brain has been proven to get more and more inflamed as the lack of sleep causes more and more buildup with less and less waste removal, thereby reducing more and more blood flow while also increasing blood pressure (because the heart beats whether or not it knows there are blockages throughout the body). The brain scans we have, that actually record brain activity aka blood flow over time, have proven it time and time again and were even interpreted as such by top brain researchers.</p>
<p>We need sleep to allow the brain to methodically deflate itself and expand its blood vessels/tubes at different times to facilitate waste removal and cell regeneration. The drastic changes in blood flow in those different regions is most of what causes those different sleep stages, or rather the sleep stages cause the different brain regions to deflate or re-inflate.</p>
<p>If we stay awake, we never allow those brain regions to do that as efficiently as they do when we sleep. If our brain did that to us at the same level it did when we slept, we'd put ourselves in danger, due to the massive shift in consciousness it causes when it's physically going through that process, as trying to move around with certain drugs in our system would be dangerous. Waste removal and cell regeneration still happens, but at a drastically slower pace than when we're asleep, and that's why we suffer from brain inflammation, leading to increased blood pressure and tissue damage due to more and more restricted blood flow as waste and other gunk accumulates and the stuff that's still alive isn't getting fed and nourished in a timely manner. It's again, why they cause us to experience <em>similar</em> symptoms as other neuro conditions associated with improper blood flow throughout the different brain regions, like ADHD/Anxiety/Depression/Bipolar/OCD (similar but not exactly the same).</p>
<p>It's why eating a healthier diet with reduced junk food, cutting out added sodium and refined sugars, cutting out excess calories, and sleeping more, have been proven to drastically reduce inflammation and symptoms associated with all these mental conditions. We have proven all of this already, each thing individually and how they work altogether.</p>
<p>Again I will edit this with sources, but I'm surprised that some people keep saying we don't know, when countless documented research has already literally directly stated all of this already. So we DO know. We don't know how brain cells calculate math, there's still a lot we need to learn about how the brain works, but we definitely know at least 99% of the reasons why it needs to sleep, we have seen all kinds of brain scans in motion showing these things, along with the other diagnostics tests scientists have done and interpreted. Sleep reduces build up, facilitates cell regeneration and other maintenance to the different structures of the brain, consolidate the different kinds of memories (memory of events, and muscle memory), we have seen this, and have done enough experiments to know how well the brain does each thing with and without sleep.</p>
<p>So we know <em>why</em> we need sleep, it does all of these things exponentially better than without sleep, and we need to be lying dormant so that our brains can safely do this especially as our consciousness shifts throughout the process, and not just for safety but to reduce the activity throughout the rest of the body so it can focus its blood and neural activity on the brain itself rather than spreading out through the rest of the body while it's all active, but then it still needs to fix and maintain the rest of the body as well as the brain. We know it does this with and without sleep, and we have a history of experiments being done to differentiate between what it does and how well it does it with and without sleep.</p>
<p>Kinda like why we need to turn off our computers and turn electricity off to certain parts so that things can be worked on and replaced without sudden shortages or data lost from the RAM sticks and so on. Imagine trying to swap out ram sticks while you have a lot of programs loaded and the computer is on. That's what the brain needs to do to transfer things from dead cells to new cells. How else do we retain certain things as we replace cells in our brain just like the rest of our body replaces blood cells? If we just continuously let old brain cells die and put new ones in place, we'd be walking idiots, because we wouldn't have efficiently allowed things to be transferred in and out of each other during that very important process of brain cell replacement in our sleep.</p>
<p>I forgot to add, I explained why the brain itself needs sleep, but forgot to talk about the rest of the body. We evolved to sleep, as evidence and logic and reason and deduction have all pointed out, to facilitate the recovery and waste removal of the entire body, not just the brain. Sure, according to science we can't say &quot;This is 100% true and there is nothing further to add.&quot; But for people to keep saying &quot;We don't know.&quot; is 100% wrong. So redditers, stop being so dismissive and saying &quot;We don't know.&quot; when we literally understand every single thing about sleep except for how to view another person's dreams.</p>

<p>Are you saying to reduce junk food, reduce sodium, reduce sugar, and reduce calories, or are you saying reduce junk food, but add sugar, add sodium, and add calories. The wording is unclear and I can’t tell if you’re saying “forget conventional wisdom about healthy eating” or that conventionally healthy eating is good for your brain in more ways than most people know?</p>
<p>Btw, thanks for that thorough explanation. I’ve heard it’s something about clearing waste or something, but never so clearly explained with so many good sources!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK.  Now my question has been asked here before by other people, but I don't know if the answers were explained <em>within the context of your above reply</em>:  </p>
<p>If sleep cycles are mostly about neurological maintenance and upkeep, why is it then, that &quot;oversleeping&quot; can leave people feeling similar to being sleep deprived or hung over?  </p>
<p>Additionally, if a person were to plan on sleeping for an extended period and wanted to avoid such symptoms, how could one best mitigate them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, and sources much appreciated.
What's your take then on why other organisms without nervous systems also experience such periodic dormancy? I was under the impression that sleep has been around much longer than brains requiring blood flow control and waste removal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I focused too much on the brain. The brain needs sleep and we can see more reasons why now with newer research, but besides the brain, the entire body needs rest for many of the same reasons. The brain just has more complex needs in terms of what it does to its neural networks and the general area of the brain that we are learning more about. </p>
<p>The rest of the body is much easier to study and figure out what it's doing in its resting state; general removal of gunk and dead crap, making new stuff, fixing broken stuff, using stored energy to do those processes rather than allocating most of the stored energy for externally active processes, like running around and doing physical labor, and fighting and hunting, and traveling, and all that. The bodies we have today just can't do both things optimally at the same time. It seems that we evolved to feel sleepy and actually have stages of unconsciousness to ensure that we would always do those nightly maintenance repairs and recovery and waste removal. Imagine if we never evolved to fall asleep, it would be a disaster to our brains and bodies with how long it takes to do those things and how little we'd sit or lay still to make it happen. All the stuff I've read makes it seem like that's exactly why we evolved sleep hormones and the sleep stages. I'll re edit citations later so I don't sound like I'm purely guestimating.</p>
<p>Side note:</p>
<p>Our healing factor is magnitudes slower compared to Wolverine's. According to how fast he heals the rest of himself and processes things out like poison, and his apparent physical stamina and all that, it seems like he can digest food way faster, heal his brain way faster, remove cellular waste way faster.... I think it's inaccurate to depict Wolverine as the type of being that needs to sleep at all, other than to calm himself in between all the shit he goes through.</p>
<p>His hour long lunch break would recover him faster than a regular damaged athletic human being bed ridden and fed nutrient dense shit and IV fluid for a whole week. Wolverine just totally does not need sleep according to everything else we've learned about the power and speed of his healing factor.</p>
<p>So I wonder, totally off topic, if one day we'll develop the bioengineering technology to accelerate the brain and body maintenance in our own selves. Maybe something more realistic like 2-4 hour machine assisted sleep. Maybe people could safely stay awake with super advanced drugs for days at a time, and be perfectly fine after getting some high-tech sleep. I wonder how that would work..... Anyways I'm driving home now, I'll go find those sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's fascinating how ubiquitous it is in nature. </p>
<p>Obviously some primordial organism discovered that by &quot;resting&quot; at certain periods, it gained an evolutionary advantage the rest of the time. </p>
<p>And this advantage has been passed onto the rest of us, with no organism seemingly having found a better solution. </p>
<p>It probably goes back to the first photosynthesisers - when the sun was gone, they were doing practically nothing anyway. So those which evolved a mechanism to keep &quot;busy&quot; during this downtime probably found they were able to produce more energy in the daytime than their cousins who were dormant during the night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is always needed. Insomniacs don't go without sleep. It's classification is broad. Classic insomnia is failure to get restful sleep for at least 3 days per week for at least a month.
However conditions where someone is &quot;asleep&quot; but continually wakes up exhausted, such as those who sleep walk, or restless leg syndrome, may also be classified as insomnias.</p>
<p>So you can see there's far more to it than simply &quot;not sleeping&quot;. For the most part insomniacs get <strong>some</strong> sleep, be that a couple of nights a week, or a couple of hours per night. Just enough to keep you going, not enough to help you feel well.</p>
<p>Actually not sleeping at all is far more serious. It can be fatal in as little as 3 days, but more typically death comes with 7-10 days. Which are no doubt the worst 10 days a human can experience. Incredibly rare for this to happen naturally though. It's more typically doctors or Chinese gamers who are going heavy on the stimulants to keep them going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. People want to know where sleep comes from, but I think the real question should be &quot;Where does wakefulness come from?&quot; Certainly the body takes advantage of the downtime to perform vital housekeeping, but a more important purpose of our biochemistry is to sustain consciousness. Consciousness is what gives us agency and separates us from plants. Sleep is what we have in common with them.</p></div>		</li>
