			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you develop a new test for X, you compare the results with the 'truth', which usually means the gold standard or a combination of established tests. So someone, in some way determined that the test they used is 95-100% correct, which is, of course, a simplification, since both false negatives and false positives can lead to incorrect results and both are of interest in assessing the quality of a given test. The article is behind a paywall but in the free version (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/aaa0698.abstract" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6239/aaa0698.abstract</a>) they write</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that VirScanâ€™s performance in detecting known infections and distinguishing between exposures to related viruses is comparable to that of classical serum antibody tests for single viruses. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd expect the full version of the article to either cite here a previous publication that found these numbers or something in this article that shows how they arrived at these numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be interested to know if we, as nurses caring for so many sick people, have a better immune system. I'm constantly amazed at how rarely we get sick (there are a few outliers, of course) given how often we come into contact with unwell patients. </p>
<p>There are days when I will triage &gt;100 people. Can't wash my hands after <em>each</em> one- but make a point to wash after each child I touch and frequently through my shift. (And all the other times we're supposed to)</p>
<p>My skin is intact, I eat well &amp; sleep well, despite rotating shift work for &gt;33yrs. Be interesting to know if we're just lucky or better equipped after so many exposures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article years ago about sex workers in Africa who would do their &quot;work&quot; several times a day who appeared to be immune to HIV. They dug themselves out of their economic situation and stopped for a period of time, but if they fell on hard times and ended up back in sex work, many contracted the virus. The article theorized that their immune systems were on high alert constantly during the sex work and were able to fend off the virus, but once they stopped, their immune systems &quot;relaxed&quot; and weren't ready immediately when they had to go back. On mobile, or I would try to find a source. I could be misremembering some details. Could be the same thing happening here. Do you notice that you get sick after going back to work after vacationing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well Fleuvage pointed out this is during a triage situation, and if you're triaging, it's because you have multiple urgent situations that you don't have the resources to handle. And if you see 100 patients like they mentioned, that's 2 minutes minimum between each patient, that's more than 3 hours of hand washing. Yes good hygiene is essential, but even skipping one in every three washes means another hour on a shift that can be used to treat people; people who can probably afford to be treated by someone without freshly washed hands, but can't afford to not be treated in time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would that we could-- minimal hand contact with each person-- and everyone waiting means a squirt of sanitizer between people is it till there's a little lull-- then I can get up to the sink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would have to wash their hands like every 8 minutes for that. They don't have the time. That would certainly be the ideal but it's often not practical.  </p></div>		</li>
