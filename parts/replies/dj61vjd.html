			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the person I need to ask. Have you tested people with ADHD and how they cope with higher/lower temps? I ask because I'm diagnosed. With cold weather I can be as hyper as I want to be but I'm terrible at taking hot weather. I've done manual labor outside for years so I was pretty well conditioned to it as much as I could be and still being a lightweight at 150lbs, I got over-heated long before most of my peers. </p></div>		</li>
