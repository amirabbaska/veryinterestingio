Some customers think they're getting the best toothpaste at a higher cost, other customers think they're getting a savings vs the premium offering. Win win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on mouthwash? In undergrad I had a dentist/microbiologist guest lecturer in my bacterial pathogenesis course that said mouthwash clears the flora as intended. However, combined with a more acidic modern diet, it creates a growth advantage for acidophiles like strep mutans, which promotes dental caries? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key difference is that in a Petri dish this is true, but in vivo the bacteria produce a biofilm.  A biofilm dramatically reduces the effectiveness of topical applications of an antibiotic.  Some studies suggest you would need a mouthwash that was between 100x and 500x the concentration (which in many cases is impossible) to be effective.  Mouthwash is largely ineffective without first physically removing the biofilm -- brushing and flossing-- to better expose the bacteria so the mouthwash can reach.</p>
<p>As far as creating a more acidic environment, there is a huge variation of ph levels in different  mouthwashes, but let's say for the sake of argument that this is the case.  Let's take soda as an example.  Coca-Cola is around pH 2-2.5.  When you drink it, it only alters the pH in your mouth for a few minutes after a swig -- not even long enough for one division cycle of bacteria.</p>
<p>Strep mutans makes its own acidic environment by metabolising carbohydrates over longer periods.  Mouthwash as an acidic contribution would be negligible.</p></div>		</li>
