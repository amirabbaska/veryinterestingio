			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot recall smells at all, but smells make me recall memories more the older I get.  </p>
<p>Cold plastic,  I cannot smell it without being in elementary school again waiting in a cafeteria to get my food.</p>
<p>Freshly mopped bathrooms in stores, hospitals, businesses, with cheap soap take me back to Basic training every time I walk into one.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar experience. My memory of taste and smells is much sharper than my memory of images. I can easily recall even subtle flavors but ask me to draw or describe something I just saw a minute ago and I can't (not well anyway). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too. I'm terrible at drawing from memory. Now, sound I'm good at. I have some massive blue jays that live in the woods by my house and I can actually get them to fly to the front of the tree line mimicking their call. I've done it several times since we moved here a few months ago. I used to get mocking birds doing to sounds from close encounter of the 3rd kind and the mocking jay whistle from hunger games. I drove my theater teacher nuts when I had a hard time memorizing lines but could belt out briefly studied musical numbers from the year before in their entirety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smell and taste are some of the strongest sense for triggering memory, which is why you're instantly transported to a certain place or time when you get a whiff of that candle or taste that dumpling soup.  </p>
<p><em>Recalling</em> those specific senses are much more difficult.  Can you make yourself smell that cedar wood from your grandmother's chest?  No, but you can visualize it - and that's what this question is getting at.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But can you do the equivalent of visualizing the tastes and smells? I can recall an ”idea” of what a smell is like, but I can't recreate the actual sensory experience.</p>
<p>Whereas I can visualize an image or imagine a sound and it's pretty much the same experience as actually seeing or hearing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe so. Today I was listening to The Alton Browncast and he was interviewing Duff Goldman. Duff mentioned making a banana curry cake. I can totally imagine that flavor. I can imagine the difference in yellow and brown mustard, Benedictine and Chartreuse, patchouli and nag champa...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I think this applies to almost everyone. People just aren't being precise enough with their language or aren't thinking focused enough on the difference between recollection and true sensory recreation. Unfortunately this happens in every reddit thread about this kind of stuff, interesting premise but turns out there's not much controversy beyond semantics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine a citrus fruits in my head and start salivating... </p>
<p>It seems like this thread is revealing that we are all a bit different in our ability to recall sensory experiences.  Some people have stronger association with sound, others with smell... pretty fascinating altogether.  </p></div>		</li>
