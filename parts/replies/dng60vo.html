<p>I think that it's actually the heat signature from the launch of the carrying vehicle that is detected first, then the warhead trajectory(ies) is/are predicted from that. Geostationary satellites are very good at detecting large IR heat signatures and I believe a number of countries use them.</p></div>		</li>
