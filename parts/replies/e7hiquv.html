			<div class="markdown"><p>Coherence basically just means &quot;these things can interfere&quot;.  Interference between something like a green and red laser is possible, but when you are using visible light the interference pattern would be really difficult to see since the difference in frequency is in the order of GHz (10^9). It would take a really expensive detector to detect something oscillating at 10^9 radians/second. Phase is crucial because if the phases don't match. Phase is easier to adjust and gives a much more responsive interferogram. There is something called coherence theory that goes into detail about how much multiple things can interfere. </p></div>		</li>
