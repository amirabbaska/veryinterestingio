			<div class="markdown"><p>Because hot air has a different refractive index to cold air, causing the light to change direction lots as it goes through different-temperature air. If there were no eddies in the air, everything would just look a little squashed near hot things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The refractive index, from what I understand, is a function of its density as well- hot air is less dense than cold air and so has a different index of refraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny, I was flying in a King-Air the other day with a window just over the engine.  We were moving fast enough the air was mixed well enough that everything through that patch of air just looked blurry, not wavy.  I work in Computer Graphics, so the first thought in my head was actually &quot;their terrain needs higher resolution textures&quot; before I remembered that was real life and figured and looked out a different window to make sure it wasn't my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it has to do with the density of the air, which affects the refractive index of the air. Usually air that is hotter rises since it is less dense and air that is colder sinks since it is more dense, so the air is usually arranged coldest near the ground and hotter as you get away from the ground. However, on a very hot day the ground absorbs a lot of heat from the sun, and then it radiates to the air around it so the air just above the ground is hotter than air above it. As light is going from colder to hotter air, it bends away and can bend enough to reverse direction and start going back up. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because of differences in density. If you mix any two liquids, or any two gasses, or even a liquid and a gas, that are of different densities, you bend light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This everything has an refractive index. The higher this number the more light passing through is bent. </p>
<p>Most gasses have a very low refractive index thus you cant see them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My job can relate to this. (Automotive refinisher) when dealing with strong solvents (endura paint is a good example) I can see the solvents evaporating from the can. That is actually how paint drys, there is solids and liquids mixed in a can and when sprayed onto a vehicle the liquids evaporate, leaving behind a solid that is adhered to the vehicle</p></div>		</li>
