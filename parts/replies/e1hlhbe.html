			<div class="markdown"><p>Overrated anyways. If it's strictly showering, one of you is standing cold and wet. If it's also sex, water has a way of washing away all the nice slippery juices and leaving you rubbing wet skin on wet skin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also we tend to have longer hair and I have really long hair, when I shower the hot water doesn't directly touch the back of my neck and upper back and ears and head as much because of the hair barrier so that could be a factor too. If I shower with my hair tied up I have to turn the temperature down so my neck and back doesn't burn lol.</p></div>		</li>
