			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for bringing this to everyone's attention. In the United States, many food products (especially those that have been produced for a long time and may have at one point been a good product to dilute/bulk up/otherwise adulterate to make extra money) have standards of identity that define their composition. They are all clearly listed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and are easily googleable, moderately interesting to read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. If there are no other additives then it still is considered juice since they just put back in the percentage of water which was taken out. (Of course that doesn't really mean that it tastes like freshly squeezed, we all know that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mixing up different things here. No pun intended. Coke and other Softdrinks come in concentrate everywhere in the world when served at fastfood restaurants. They are mixed in so called &quot;Multiplex&quot; machines. This is done because the syrup or &quot;base&quot; yields much more mixed product so they cut down on mass to transport and to store. Also using local water and adding carbonation is cheaper, again because of transport and because it costs less to buy just the concentrate.
It is still a &quot;drink&quot; because the concentrate obviously has more than one ingredient. </p>
<p>Concentrated orange juice still is 100% juice because ther water was simply taken out, so mixing it back in still counts as juice. If anything else was added, sugar, carbonation, anything then it HAS to be called &quot;drink&quot; otherwise it still can be, and is considered 100% juice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what part I'm mixing up? Perhaps I've worded it poorly, but I agree with what you've written. If you're referring to the mixing of the syrup in fast food places, I suspect at mine, the multiplex machine was built into the dispenser. I'm reasonably sure when I worked there there the syrup was pumped directly into the dispenser along with the gas and water. </p>
<p>If you're referring to the juice part, I think the mix up is that I've assumed OP is seeing 'concentrate' on labels of products and wondering why. 100% Reconstituted juice will not have juice concentrate written on it (again, labelling laws vary so may not be true everywhere) and only fruit drinks (those that are not purely juice) will have concentrate written on them. </p></div>		</li>
