			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, cool. That's what happens when ya reach a certain state in meditation. </p>
<p>I tried explaining it to my teacher as if my body fully relaxes and the last thing is the eyes but he said what he always says, pay no mind to it, it's not important.  Which is true, but it's nice to hear it's actually a thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, wanted to post this and it seems you're seven hours ahead of me.</p>
<p>Have you tried doing this with your eyes open? It has some interesting implications that rarely cross our minds. Also the way we're used to focusing our eyes seems to me like we're always looking at things crosseyed. I've kind of got the hunch that a lot of really 'esoteric' information is referring to nothing more than some pretty basic body functionalities that we're jumbling up for some reason.</p>
<p>Also don't get me wrong, just because they're basic doesn't mean they don't heavily impact the way we're perceiving reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have, yeah.  In the beginning I found it easier to get into it with a slightly open gaze.  And in day to day life, I sometimes soften my focus to take in the whole scene.  It paints a different picture for sure.  </p>
<p>I feel ya there. Esoteric information, in my opinion, is nothing more than some fun facts for those of us not in the specific fields who work with the information.  I used to take the collection of knowledge as some higher truth but it's meaningless when depth isn't reached.  </p>
<p>Take any science and keep disecting it until you get to a point where nothing can be understood.</p>
<p>I dunno.   I might have missed your point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact, as you can't imagine, our eyes drift towards our ears when we fall asleep for the reason I described above.</p>

<p>Interesting. Is that true in the REM phase too? Am I &quot;inverted cross eyes&quot; when I'm dreaming?</p></div>		</li>
