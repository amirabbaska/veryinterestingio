			<div class="markdown"><p>I was walking out of a forest during a lightning storm.  While still in the midst of trees I was also about 100 feet from a chain link fence.  I heard a buzz/clicking sound and saw a flash running down the length of the fence (up/down not left/right).  There was no boom, it clearly wasn't a lightning strike but so far I've been unable to figure out what it was that caused it (and possibly how lucky I was to not get hurt if that was the case)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best guess is induction.
Lightning storms ionize the air and come with powerful electromagnetic fields.  It could be possible for the storm to induce a high voltage in the large metal fence, which would explain what you saw.<br />
Just a guess based on what little I know lol.  If anyone knows better feel free to correct me.</p>
<p>But yeah the moral of that story is definitely stay the fuck away from any metal in a lightning storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A terrifying way to look at this is that your head or umbrella or tree you're under also sends out a positive streamer. </p>
<p>If that connection is completed first that object will get struck by lightning. Lightning rods intentionally setup to act as a more likely target and safely grounded conduit for things around them.</p>
<p>The taller the tree or structure the less vertical distance from the negative charge. That's why you are told to not seek shelter under a tall tree or stand on a very flat area like a golf course without any cover. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_(plasma_physics\)" target="_blank">Of additional note: if you have a current (moving charges), it produces a magnetic field.  You then have moving charges in a magnetic field, which experience a force.  If one does the math, one finds that the force points towards the center of the moving charges, and works to compress those charges into a thin &quot;beam&quot;.</a></p></div>		</li>
