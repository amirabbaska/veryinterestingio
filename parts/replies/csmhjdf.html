			<p>interestingly that is what happens. Above a certain temperature (temperature of the electroweak phase transition) all standard model particles become massless and will thus move at the speed of light.  Atoms will be decomposed at much smaller temperatures though.<br><br><br>Edit: In order to explain some things and hopefully create less confusion I decided to explain  it in a bit more detail.<br><br>If you go to higher and higher temperatures there will be some phase transitions (and interestingly it would be the inverse of cosmological history !). The first one is pretty basic. Atoms will be ionized and you will have a plasma. Increasing the temperature further will lead to a decomposition of the nuclei and it will become a quark gluon plasma. Due to the high temperature/energy also usually not occuring particles like exotic quarks will appear aat different points of temperature (this depends on their masses).  If you go to even higher temperatures the higgs field will leve its broken phase and go into a symmetric phase (there is an awesome analogy with a metal rod. if you do not know it you could look it up. It sows the other direction, but still is great.). When this happens the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field gos to zero. Thismeans that it will not lead to particle masses anymore</p>		</li>

			<p>Consider a metal rod that stands on the ground. The whole setup is rotationally iunvariant if you rotate along the axes defined by the rod. Now if you apply enough pressure on the top of the rod it will bend in a special direction (much better to visualise with a picture), which in turn breaks the symmetry of the system. This is what happened to the higgs field. A kind of pressure forced it into a non-symmetric state. If you go to high temperatures this pressure will be gone and it will be symmetric again. The same would happen to the metal rod if there was only elastic (reversible) deformation. <br><br>At least for the first part of this was mentioned in the Nobel prize talk of Nambu IIRC. If something is still unclear feel free to ask.<br><br>Edit: I just checked the slides of the talk and indeed there is a picture of the rod. I guess if you watch the lecture there will be a nice explaination. I cannot check that because I am at work. Both can be found <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/nambu-lecture.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>		</li>

			<p>The thing what happens at some point is a phase transition (think of liquid water changing phase to vapor). In the one phase (the so called symmetric phase) there is nothing that gives the particles mass and in the other one (which we are used to) most particles have a rest mass. If you have a massless particle it will not get any mass because of its energy as in the case of the photon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Okay, this thread is thoroughly confusing me now. We're discussing temperature. But temperature is just the speed/energy of particles, isn't it? If I'm understinding this thread, at a high enough temperature, particles lose their mass through a phase transition (unable to interact with the Higgs field?). But if temperature is just particle energy then what we're really saying is that at a high enough speed particles lose their mass. Am I misunderstanding the relationship between temperature, energy, and speed? (Or is it velocity?) Are we saying, for example, that if a human were somehow able to accelerate indefinitely, getting closer and closer to c, accumulating more energy, they would suddenly lose their mass at some threshold and fall apart, and all their atoms would &quot;devolve&quot; into subatomic particles as if in a particle accelerator? That doesn't make sense to me, and I don't think that's what you're saying, so clearly I'm misunderstanding something. Or is that correct...?</p>		</li>

			<p>Temperature is a statistical quantity of an ensemble of particles. This means a single particle does not have a temperature. So a single particle can be accelerated to close to the speed of light without getting massless as long as there is not a background of other particles that are hot enough.<br><br>To clarify once more. consider a moving  particle like an electron . It got a definite mass if it is using through space. If it was in a plasma of temperatures of a TeV (imagine a plasma lik in the sun ust imuch much hotter)  on the other hand it would be massless</p>		</li>

			<p>So by what mechanism do the particles disconnect from the Higgs field when they're collectively moving in a disordered fashion (high temperature) but not disconnect when they're moving either individually or collectively in an ordered fashion (traveling at high speed)?<br><br>Edit: Apparently the loss of mass is because the Higgs field becomes symmetric at high temperatures, which results in it ceasing to cause mass. But how does that happen at high temperatures but not high speeds? I read another comment that talked about particles still having mass in their rest frames and only losing it in their collective reference frame, which makes a bit of sense, but I'm still not sure I understand it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Disclaimer: I try to explain these things by analogies that most people can understand. Do not take everything literally !<br><br>If you have a region of high temperature, there are lost of particles that interact with the higgs field that forces it to change its phase (analogous to ordinary matter. High temperatures lead to the vaporisation of water). Imagine it as a bubble filled of gas within a liquid, where the gas represents the symmetric phase. In this phase particles do not feel obstruction by the higgs field, but in the other phase they do.  <br><br>I also try to answer the other question by analogy. Consider a strong electric field. A single electron even with a lot of energy will not have much impact on the field. However if you put in some kind of metal structures you can shield a region of space from the electric field (basically a faraday cage)</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; If the particles are moving close to the speed of light, wouldn't their mass approach infinity<br><br>Yes, in one interpretation, but my opinion is that it's a very flawed one. Einstein used it a lot, but I think it can lead to a lot of misconceptions about relativity and mass. I find it's a lot easier to discuss <em>total energy</em> and <em>momentum</em>, which together form something called a Lorentz 4-vector, which have a magnitude equal to the mass.<br><br>&gt; as m=E/c^2<br><br>No, that equation is valid only for particles at rest.<br><br>The real equation is:<br><br>E = m c^2 / sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2 )<br><br>where m is the <em>rest mass</em>, v is the speed of the object, and c is the speed of light. Note that as v-&gt;c, E-&gt;infinity because the denominator approaches 0. That's why you can't ever go faster than the speed of light, more or less: You would need an infinite amount of energy just to reach it in the first place.<br><br>This all assumes that m is independent of v (which it would seem to be, because it's the <em>rest</em> mass, after all; i.e., the one that you would measure if you were in the same reference frame as the particle.<br><br>The thing about this discussion is that you don't care about the reference frame of each particle, but the frame in which an arbitrary box will contain particles whose momentum, on average, cancels out. In <em>that</em> frame, the particles would lose all their mass, at least as seen in the effect mass plays in interaction whose center of mass is that frame.<br><br>But that doesn't mean they would have no energy, just that it would be proportional to their momentum. That's because my equation is actually not fully correct. The <em>real</em> equation is:<br><br>m^2 c^4 = E^2 - p^2 c^2<br><br>where p is momentum. That's the equation of the magnitude of the Lorentz vector, basically Pythagoras' theorem when one dimension has imaginary units (so when you square that length you pick up a negative sign).<br><br>For massive particles, momentum is just mass times velocity <em>but</em> multiplied by that 1/sqrt(...) factor if you need to take into account relativistic effects. But for massless particles, p = h f, where f is the frequency of the wave that represents the particle and h is Planck's constant. That describes all hyper-relativistic particles (ones for which mc^2 &lt;&lt; E), at least to good approximation.<br><br>But that's <em>not</em> what is meant when we say that the particle masses vanish. It's not just that the m^2 c^4 term remains constant but becomes insignificant in comparison to the other particles, but that it <em>actually becomes smaller</em> and then vanishes.</p>		</li>

			<p>No quarks do not have a mass above the temperature of the electroweak phase transition. All masses in the standard model are proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the higgs. At high temperatures the higgs field is in a symmetric phase, which means that the expectation value is 0. Thus making all particles massless.</p>		</li>

			<p>Don't sell yourself short. Nothing is simple in biology and anything that looks simple is only so because we can't handle thinking of it in its actual complexity so we simplify. Biology arises as an emergent phenomenon from the beautiful physics and chemistry that underlie it. Dead/alive...simple until you think of things like viruses and prions. What even constitutes a single organism when you think of super organisms such as ant colonies or slime molds or humans in a city? When does that live or die?Active/inactive proteins?? Proteins are chains of pieces of sticky chewing gum that fold in intricate ways to form vibrating blobs of atoms that jiggle through uncountable microstates and internal conformations with unbelievably complicated dynamics that utilize quantum-mechanical effects including quantum tunneling to catalyze all the reactions in the insane web of reactions we call life. (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_catalysis</a>). We like to subdivide some of these internal microstates into ensembles that we call &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;....or inactivated...or pre-active or voltage dependent active, or use dependent active.... <br><br>That all being said, discussing the upper limit of temperature by string theory is a serious mindfuck. I think with biology things are so actually complex and our understanding of biological laws so weak when compared to the laws of physics that we don't even know enough to be able to phrase similar questions so succinctly in Biology. <br><br>Anyways tl;dr, bio only simple because too complex and we oversimplify so our heads don't explode.</p>		</li>

			<p>momentum is not mass times velocity <em>by definition</em>, that's just the form it happens to take in Newtonian mechanics. The momentum of a photon is its energy divided by c.</p>		</li>

			<p><br><br>&gt;Wait, what?  If momentum is mass times velocity, and there's no mass, there's no momentum no matter how fast it's going, right?  Or is that one of the things that breaks down at the quantum level and all bets are off?<br><br>It doesn't work exactly that way in special relativity. Momentum being mass times velocity is only correct for slow massive objects. For very fast objects, the relation between velocity and momentum is nonlinear. The closer you get to the speed of light, the massive increase in momentum can bring only very tiny increase in speed.<br><br>In fact, at speeds very close to the speed of light, most of particle's energy is due to its momentum and you can ignore the mass enterely. These conditions are called hyperrelativistic and are very close to how actual massless particles (like photons) behave.</p>		</li>

			<p>When you say that they have energy, are you stating that they have a   non-zero GeV value as well?   Maybe in such a way that yes they're affected by gravity, but not affected by gravity in the more typical way in which only particles which interact with the Higgs field are. </p>		</li>

			<p>According to the standard model, the mass you get from the Higgs is equivalent to the momentum that photons have. From relativity's perspective, it's energy, not any rest mass, that counts. Photons cause gravity due to the energy in their interaction with the electromagnetic field (that's actually all a photon is), and a particle like an electron gets its mass from the energy bound up in its interaction with the Higgs field, among others. The energy of a photon E = hc/λ, so it's effective &quot;mass&quot; is just E / c^2, or h/(cλ). <br><br>This mass value determines how much gravity the particle exerts; get enough light in one place, and it can actually form a black hole. But you don't even need mass to be affected by gravity, since really it's just a change in the shape of space. Under the effect of gravity, straight lines curve into orbits. That's why your mass doesn't affect how fast you fall, you and everything else are just following the same curved path through spacetime.</p>		</li>

			<p>Every physical particle that you can think of will have some energy associated to it. As has been repeated so many times in the comment section the equation that relates Energy e, momentum p and rest mass of a particle is e2=p2+m2 where I have  omitted factors of c and 2 means squared. A timelike(massive) particle s e and p can vary depending on which frame you  are measuring these quantities in but the rest mass remains the same in accordance with the above equation. <br><br>A light like particle has zero mass energy is simply its momentum. And these particles will ALWAYS move with the constant speed c and will have zero mass no matter which frame you are measuring it from.<br><br>It's this particular property that differentiates the way a time like or massive particle interacts with gravitational field from the light like particles.<br><br>There are another set of particles that you can cook up that can have negative m2. That is when p2 is greater than e2. These are space like particles and can go back in time. Hence its ruled out by physical constraints. These will also have a constant negative m2 no matter which frame you are measuring it from. And as it happens these too interact with gravity albeit in a weird way. <br><br>Edit autocorrect screwed up the apostrophes</p>		</li>

			<p>This is what experiments like RHIC that try to create quark-gluon plasma are all about.<br><br>Well, actually &quot;atoms&quot; breaking into components happens all the time in many common situations because that's just plasma. Odds are you have some fluorescent lights around you - those contain a substance so hot that its atoms break up into ions and electrons. They're not bare nuclei though, just atoms with less electrons than usual.<br><br>At a higher temperature, you do get bare nuclei and electrons bouncing around, and then at an even higher temperature, the atomic nuclei &quot;melt&quot; into their component quarks and you have quark-gluon plasma. This has been created in a lab (almost certainly), but only for a very short time and in such a way that it's difficult to measure all the things they want to measure.<br><br>I think LHC has some QGP experiments planned or ongoing as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fishify, as a fellow physicist I'm a bit disappointed in you for giving in to the standard lay answer here instead of educating people about what temperature actually is.<br><br>Temperature is not energy density.  Temperature is a <em>derivative</em> of energy with respect to entropy of a system.  It can be positive (the usual case), infinite (rare), or even negative (hotter than hot!).<br><br>For everyone who's not already a physicist: <br><br><em>Entropy</em> is the <em>logarithm</em> of the <em>state function</em> of a system.  The state function is the number of ways you can rearrange the elementary particles in a system, and end up with the same macroscopic description.  Take the logarithm, and you get a measure of how many bits of information are contained in that micro-description (or, alternatively, how many bits of information you're missing even if you have the full macroscopic description of the system).  So a low-entropy system can't be rearranged much without changing your description of it (you know a lot about the system), but a high-entropy system can be rearranged a lot (you don't know much about it).<br><br>The lower the energy of a system, the more all the systems in it settle down to their ground state until, at absolute zero, there's generally only one state the system can be in (OK, a very small number of them...).  To get more entropy in the system, you have to add some energy to give the components of the system &quot;room&quot; to jiggle around.<br><br>In some systems, the state function is invariant with respect to energy: as you add more energy, you don't change the number of ways to rearrange the system.  Such systems have <em>infinite</em> temperature and are &quot;absolute hot&quot; -- regardless of how much energy they contain.<br><br>Some even weirder systems can go the other way:  if you overexcite the system, the entropy <em>decreases</em> as you add more energy to the system, so the temperature is <em>negative</em>.  The obvious example of a system like that is a laser medium.  Such systems are &quot;hotter than hot&quot; and will leak energy into any surrounding normal medium.<br><br>So in the best understanding of what temperature actually is, there's no absolute maximum temperature of any kind.<br><br>/u/fishify's answer about the Hagedorn temperature relies on a model of flat, empty space and free particles in it: individual free particles in empty space happen to have a linear relationship between their kinetic energy and their entropy, so it's tempting for people to treat temperature as a sort of fancy term for energy density.  It isn't.  The Hagedorn temperature is more of a maximum energy density per particle, than an actual maximum temperature.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks!  <br><br>It was really quantum mechanics that brought them into the same realm.  In the classical regime, entropy is only defined up to an additive constant since there's no definition of a &quot;unit volume&quot; of parameter space.  But in the quantum mechanical realm there are discrete states to any system, so there is indeed such a thing as zero entropy.  <br><br>Entropy is a slippery concept, because physical entropy, like Shannon entropy, really does measure ignorance -- which is something about you, the physicist, rather than something about the actual system you're studying.  It's deeply tied to the idea of quantum collapse, and it can do slippery and weird things like change from observer to observer based on the observers' states of knowledge.  I remember seeing an awesome example in the Russian dusty-plasma experiment on ISS:  they diffused some black and some white dust into opposite sides of the experiment, then imposed a strong magnetic field -- mixing up the black and white particles so the container appeared fully mixed.  At that point, an fresh observer would have assigned the experiment a high entropy (since the particles were mixed up).  But a knowledgeable obesrver would assign it a low entropy since the particles were still highly organized -- even though the organization was not directly visible.  When the field was turned off, the system relaxed back to its original state (black dust on one side, white dust on the other).<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>In a dusty plasma, the dust grains are (to a good approximation) attached to particular field lines.  Imposing a strong field (in that example they did it by passing a current through the middle of the volume) changes the shape of the field lines - in that case, it made them very complex.  But that is a reversible change: removing the imposed field allowed the field lines to relax to their original shape, carrying the dust back to its original distribution.</p>		</li>

			<p>The string Hagedorn temperature is entirely speculative. It shouldn't be conflated with the following. The colder quark matter Hagedorn temperature is a real phenomenon that is accessible in colliders. But it's not an absolute hot more than 100 °C is the absolute hot in water. Like a boiling point, it is a phase transition. Once there is enough energy per massive particle, the particle can emit a boson that decays into two new massive particles. But if the compression is kept, this is a blob of quark matter.<br><br>The string Hagedorn temperature is a higher-temperature analogue. It would tear the strings apart and allow freedom of motion in extra dimensions. But this is another phase transition. It's not a logical hard limit like absolute zero.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Hagedorn temperature is a phenomenon that depends on the energy only. It doesn't matter what is colliding as long as they provide enough energy for making meson pairs. Mesons have a single known mass so through mass-energy equivalence (E = mc^2) this is equivalent to a single energy per particle, i.e. temperature, regardless of material.<br><br>In practice, though, it is easier to reach it with heavier particles. The LHC was built into the same tunnel as LEP, the Large Electron-Positron Collider. The LHC collides protons, which are 1800 times heavier, so it can reach higher energies.</p>		</li>
