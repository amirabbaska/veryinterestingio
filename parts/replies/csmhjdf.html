			<div class="markdown"><p>interestingly that is what happens. Above a certain temperature (temperature of the electroweak phase transition) all standard model particles become massless and will thus move at the speed of light.  Atoms will be decomposed at much smaller temperatures though.</p>
<p>Edit: In order to explain some things and hopefully create less confusion I decided to explain  it in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>If you go to higher and higher temperatures there will be some phase transitions (and interestingly it would be the inverse of cosmological history !). The first one is pretty basic. Atoms will be ionized and you will have a plasma. Increasing the temperature further will lead to a decomposition of the nuclei and it will become a quark gluon plasma. Due to the high temperature/energy also usually not occuring particles like exotic quarks will appear aat different points of temperature (this depends on their masses).  If you go to even higher temperatures the higgs field will leve its broken phase and go into a symmetric phase (there is an awesome analogy with a metal rod. if you do not know it you could look it up. It sows the other direction, but still is great.). When this happens the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field gos to zero. Thismeans that it will not lead to particle masses anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what experiments like RHIC that try to create quark-gluon plasma are all about.</p>
<p>Well, actually &quot;atoms&quot; breaking into components happens all the time in many common situations because that's just plasma. Odds are you have some fluorescent lights around you - those contain a substance so hot that its atoms break up into ions and electrons. They're not bare nuclei though, just atoms with less electrons than usual.</p>
<p>At a higher temperature, you do get bare nuclei and electrons bouncing around, and then at an even higher temperature, the atomic nuclei &quot;melt&quot; into their component quarks and you have quark-gluon plasma. This has been created in a lab (almost certainly), but only for a very short time and in such a way that it's difficult to measure all the things they want to measure.</p>
<p>I think LHC has some QGP experiments planned or ongoing as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fishify, as a fellow physicist I'm a bit disappointed in you for giving in to the standard lay answer here instead of educating people about what temperature actually is.</p>
<p>Temperature is not energy density.  Temperature is a <em>derivative</em> of energy with respect to entropy of a system.  It can be positive (the usual case), infinite (rare), or even negative (hotter than hot!).</p>
<p>For everyone who's not already a physicist: </p>
<p><em>Entropy</em> is the <em>logarithm</em> of the <em>state function</em> of a system.  The state function is the number of ways you can rearrange the elementary particles in a system, and end up with the same macroscopic description.  Take the logarithm, and you get a measure of how many bits of information are contained in that micro-description (or, alternatively, how many bits of information you're missing even if you have the full macroscopic description of the system).  So a low-entropy system can't be rearranged much without changing your description of it (you know a lot about the system), but a high-entropy system can be rearranged a lot (you don't know much about it).</p>
<p>The lower the energy of a system, the more all the systems in it settle down to their ground state until, at absolute zero, there's generally only one state the system can be in (OK, a very small number of them...).  To get more entropy in the system, you have to add some energy to give the components of the system &quot;room&quot; to jiggle around.</p>
<p>In some systems, the state function is invariant with respect to energy: as you add more energy, you don't change the number of ways to rearrange the system.  Such systems have <em>infinite</em> temperature and are &quot;absolute hot&quot; -- regardless of how much energy they contain.</p>
<p>Some even weirder systems can go the other way:  if you overexcite the system, the entropy <em>decreases</em> as you add more energy to the system, so the temperature is <em>negative</em>.  The obvious example of a system like that is a laser medium.  Such systems are &quot;hotter than hot&quot; and will leak energy into any surrounding normal medium.</p>
<p>So in the best understanding of what temperature actually is, there's no absolute maximum temperature of any kind.</p>
<p>/u/fishify's answer about the Hagedorn temperature relies on a model of flat, empty space and free particles in it: individual free particles in empty space happen to have a linear relationship between their kinetic energy and their entropy, so it's tempting for people to treat temperature as a sort of fancy term for energy density.  It isn't.  The Hagedorn temperature is more of a maximum energy density per particle, than an actual maximum temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  </p>
<p>It was really quantum mechanics that brought them into the same realm.  In the classical regime, entropy is only defined up to an additive constant since there's no definition of a &quot;unit volume&quot; of parameter space.  But in the quantum mechanical realm there are discrete states to any system, so there is indeed such a thing as zero entropy.  </p>
<p>Entropy is a slippery concept, because physical entropy, like Shannon entropy, really does measure ignorance -- which is something about you, the physicist, rather than something about the actual system you're studying.  It's deeply tied to the idea of quantum collapse, and it can do slippery and weird things like change from observer to observer based on the observers' states of knowledge.  I remember seeing an awesome example in the Russian dusty-plasma experiment on ISS:  they diffused some black and some white dust into opposite sides of the experiment, then imposed a strong magnetic field -- mixing up the black and white particles so the container appeared fully mixed.  At that point, an fresh observer would have assigned the experiment a high entropy (since the particles were mixed up).  But a knowledgeable obesrver would assign it a low entropy since the particles were still highly organized -- even though the organization was not directly visible.  When the field was turned off, the system relaxed back to its original state (black dust on one side, white dust on the other).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The string Hagedorn temperature is entirely speculative. It shouldn't be conflated with the following. The colder quark matter Hagedorn temperature is a real phenomenon that is accessible in colliders. But it's not an absolute hot more than 100 °C is the absolute hot in water. Like a boiling point, it is a phase transition. Once there is enough energy per massive particle, the particle can emit a boson that decays into two new massive particles. But if the compression is kept, this is a blob of quark matter.</p>
<p>The string Hagedorn temperature is a higher-temperature analogue. It would tear the strings apart and allow freedom of motion in extra dimensions. But this is another phase transition. It's not a logical hard limit like absolute zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hagedorn temperature is a phenomenon that depends on the energy only. It doesn't matter what is colliding as long as they provide enough energy for making meson pairs. Mesons have a single known mass so through mass-energy equivalence (E = mc^2) this is equivalent to a single energy per particle, i.e. temperature, regardless of material.</p>
<p>In practice, though, it is easier to reach it with heavier particles. The LHC was built into the same tunnel as LEP, the Large Electron-Positron Collider. The LHC collides protons, which are 1800 times heavier, so it can reach higher energies.</p></div>		</li>
