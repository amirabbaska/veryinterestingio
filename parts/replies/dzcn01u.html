			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I came looking for this. I work for the museum that has Leonardo (on loan, anyway). We have a very cute interactive where kids can &quot;feed&quot; Leo various Cretaceous plants (plastic discs on a touchscreen) and learn more about how they compare to similar plants today. (Spoiler alert: the animated dinosaur loves everything you feed him. Also, the plants we chose obviously all have a recognizable modern counterpart.) It also shows the fossilized remains of each plant, which like... I'm taking the paleontologists' word for it. It blows my mind how much we've learned in this area since I was a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teeth is the answer I was looking for. We can't tell for certain what they did with their teeth, but shape/size can give us a really good idea. While you can look at fossilized remains of stomach contents, or BMs, it's not a guarantee that they'll be there.</p></div>		</li>
