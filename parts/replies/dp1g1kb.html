			<div class="markdown"><p>That's almost right. The charge moves at between 50 and 90-something percent of the speed of light. The electrons in DC or AC move much, much slower. It is called drift velocity and it depends on the size of the conductor and the current. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what material they’re moving through, but it’s actually usually slower. Fractions of millimetres per second. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this somewhere above so will just paste it here because it seems like you're already answering it and maybe capable of answering it more completely and accurately:</p>
<p>How far does a given electron move? That's always been something I've wondered. It's probably in the realm of nano meters if not less right?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm basically picturing either a bunch of electrons flowing back and forth like a liquid, with about a foot range (which I know is wrong but helps) or the possibly more accurate electrons vibrating at a about an angstrom per millisecond. What's more correct? I'm really wondering, does an electron move far from its &quot;original&quot; atom (Cu nucleus), and if so, how far (in atom lengths)?</p></div>		</li>
