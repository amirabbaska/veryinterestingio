			<div class="markdown"><p>HPV causes cancer causing mutations.
Preteen (12ish) girls in the U.K. are vaccinated against HPV to protect them from cervical cancer before they can catch it (HPV) by sexual contact.
The vaccine is now being rolled out for teenage boys from 2019/20 to protect them from HPV mutations in their throat and mouth and anus</p>
