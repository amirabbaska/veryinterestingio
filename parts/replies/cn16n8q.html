			<p>Hey, this was an answer. But it doesn't focus on the question. First, you're saying how it's a complex problem with many variables, then you're completely ignoring how it's only supposed to deal with the disparity between millennials and their parents economic experiences. <br><br>In addition, you seem to gloss over everything not related to education by saying, &quot;oh, and there was a shift in pretty much everything else&quot;. <br><br>You're making one point on something not directly related to the question, then are sitting on the fence for the rest of your answer. There is no real information in this answer. :(</p>		</li>

			<p>Your right, there is no real information in there because it isn't able to be answered,especially in a comment. <br><br>This question doesn't belong in this category or needs to be heavily rephrased to belong here. This sub is for an explanation of concepts. There is no specific concept that is being identified. First, you have to choose which side your on. Second, it is so broad spectrum that it would require tons more information than a comment to give a good explanation.<br><br>He is asking the question why does it appear that millenials are worse off, that is not a concept. That's asking you to dictate a position and back it, more of an askreddit question. If your interested in a few possible answers, send me a pm and I can put some information together for anyone to read and decide what they think. But providing a bad answer is worse than providing no answer at all. </p>		</li>
