			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently there's a high level clade in the animal kingdom literally called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria" target="_blank">Bilateria</a>', suggesting we're all descended from one bilateral common ancestor. Even most invertebrates are in that clade, like crustaceans and insects.</p>
<p>It seems that starfish, well known for having 5-fold symmetry (if not more), are also in that clade, so it suggests that bilateralism can evolve into other forms in some situations. Each arm is bilateral in that case.</p>
<p>In fact it seems that the only creatures outside Bilateria are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploblast" target="_blank">jellyfish and the like</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Starfish are closer to vertebrates than to most invertebrates.</p>
<p>Also, they DO have bilateral symetry as larvae. But one side grows more than the other, and end up with secondary radial symetry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plants and animals' common ancestor is far earlier than the evolution of anything even remotely like Bilateria. It was all still pretty much single celled organisms that far back.</p></div>		</li>
