			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it sounds odd, and like a bunch of woo woo, but have you checked his iron levels? I used to get very frequent nose bleeds. After getting them at work a lot, my old boss mentioned she used to get them as a kid and was diagnosed as having low iron. She said she started taking iron pills and her nose bleeds stopped.</p>
<p>I figured I didn't have anything to lose (except a few dollars) and bought iron pills. After I took my first pill I noticed a difference in &lt; 12 hours. I used to wake up with nose bleeds, have to watch how I moved my head while I slept so I didn't bump my nose etc. I had no nose bleed when I woke up the next morning!</p>
<p>Prior to trying iron pills I used a humidifier, tried Vaseline, etc with no relief. My iron levels had been on the low side of normal prior to taking a supplement. </p>
<p>My son has the same issue. I try to take my iron pill once a week. But honestly, I usually forget for a few months, and then I get a nose bleed.</p>
<p>As to how to get the blood out of the clothes/bedding, oxyclean. </p></div>		</li>
