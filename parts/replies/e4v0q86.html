It's a machine that we don't have to fuel and can't really do maintenance work on, is the cost of labor on the ground to tell Hubble where to point and shoot and the cost of radar dishes and computers to send and receive signals really $100m / yr? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The variety of costs include (but certainly aren't limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>The maintenance and upkeep costs of the communication facilities, which NASA will either maintain themselves, or have to pay someone else for the fraction of time they use.</li>
<li>The costs of organising &quot;calls for proposals&quot;, and the travel and accommodation costs of the peer reviewers. Each annual CfP results in approximately 1000 proposals (<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/panel/CYCLE25Orientation.pdf" target="_blank">Slide 3</a>), each of which is reviewed by 6 reviewers (<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/panel/" target="_blank">info on review process</a>). The <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/panel/panel-members.pdf" target="_blank">list of historical reviewers</a> covers 48 pages, with about 30 reviewers per page; assuming each reviewer only did one cycle (many do more), that's 60 people to fly in to grade the proposals.</li>
<li>The funding given to those whose proposals are accepted - yes, NASA pays you to use their equipment (this is a quirk of the US funding system, and isn't how research works worldwide).</li>
<li>The costs of the mission experts who advise on the capabilities of the instruments, those that confirm that accepted observations are technically feasible, and those that manage the scheduling and uploading of the accepted observations (and scheduling is highly non-trivial, given that targets can't be observed behind the Earth, behind the Sun, when they're not doing something interesting, etc.). </li>
<li>The costs of the staff responsible for controlling and monitoring the spacecraft's systems. When the telescope is in orbit and essentially unserviceable, you want to be very careful what you do with it - plenty of satellites have been lost because their computer systems got into an unrecoverable state and we could no longer communicate with them. If your solar panels stop orientating themselves towards the Sun, or the cooling system turns itself off, you want experts on hand <em>immediately</em> to fix the problem. The Kepler/K2 mission gives some examples of this - equipment failures meant it could no longer do its primary mission, but they were able to devise and implement a completely unplanned observation mode; they have also been able to recover K2 when it managed to put itself into &quot;emergency mode&quot; and shut down most systems (e.g. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-04-kepler-recovered-k2-mission.html" target="_blank">this news article</a>).</li>
<li>The costs of ongoing work to characterise the instruments in better detail. For example, there has been plenty of research into the ongoing deterioration of the detectors in HST due to the hostile environment in space, how this (subtly) affects the results, and how best to handle these issues.</li>
<li>The cost of software development and support for planning and analysing data from HST. I would imagine that this is no longer a major cost for HST, as very little has changed in a long time, but it would be an important cost in earlier years.</li>
<li>The costs of an IT system that can receive, process, store, search, and provide to researchers (and the public) the entirety of the data that comes from HST, plus any metadata about those observations, and to do so perpetually. As of 2016, the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes contained 2.5 PB of data, of which a few hundred TB were from HST observations (<a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/reports/BigDataSDTReport_Final.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>).</li>

<p>dont get me wrong i would double the budget if i were in charge</p>
<p>but some fat could be trimmed to extend operations until the bitter end if that becomes necessary. which, govt budgets subject to political pique, can happen</p></div>		</li>

<p>But that part doesn't really count, as you could simply reduce that cost by funding less grants. What's more important is, how much needs to be invested in base infrastructure before it becomes &quot;profitable&quot; (in a scientific way)  to allocate research funds to it? Because you allocate the same total amount of research money anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suggest you start googling and get ready to spend the afternoon discovering just how much it takes to run the Hubble.  First, there's multiple teams working various aspects of the mission.  Then there's the teams that run the relay satellites.  Then there's the teams that runs the ground-based relay stations.  Then there's the teams that works the simulation of the Hubble to help troubleshoot issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really not even that many people.  $100 million pr year would be $100,000 for a thousand people, with nothing left over for offices or desks or satellite time.  A common rule of thumb is that labor is about half the cost of an employee, so that's like 500 people being paid 100k/year.  And assume that about half the people are receptionists, managers, HVAC technicians, janitors, accountants, HR, etc.  And it would really only fund about 250 people who are actually focused on the science, even assuming that a NASA project doesn't have unusually higher expenses per employee than some vague typical rules of thumb.  (Despite the fact that most businesses don't need to operate spacecraft in orbit.)  Honestly, ~250 scientists, engineers, programmers, etc., just wouldn't be an insanely huge number of people for peering into galaxies billions of light years away.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I’m not disputing your number, but why does it cost $100,000,000 to operate Hubble. The telescope itself is not receiving physical maintenance so there is no cost there. Earth based technology to support a 30 year old project can’t be getting upgraded with annual regularity. If there is 1,000 people working on the Hubble project they would be making $100,000 a year. I genuinely wonder how Hubble can be generating costs of $100 million, I suppose accounting and deferred costs probably have a role. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It look like there are 400 members of the Hubble team (<a href="http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/team_hubble/duty_roster.php" target="_blank">link</a>). I pasted a few quotes from that site that explain the general job duties of that crew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The focal point of all Hubble operations is the Flight Operations Team (FOT), which is located at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Here, Hubble's controllers monitor the telescope's health while overseeing its movements and science activities. The controllers direct Hubble's movements by sending commands via satellite to the telescope's onboard computer. The majority of Hubble's operations are programmed in advance, but controllers can also interact in real time with the spacecraft, telling it what to do and when to do it.</p>
<p>Each year astronomers from dozens of countries vie for precious minutes of Hubble's unrivaled view of the cosmos. Astronomers from around the world submit observing proposals to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).</p>
<p>A review committee made up of experts from the astronomical community determines which proposed observations address pressing scientific questions and make the best use of the telescope's capabilities. Each year more than 1,000 proposals are reviewed and approximately 200 are selected, which represents roughly 20,000 individual observations.</p>
<p>Scheduling of the viewing time falls to staff at STScI. Once a proposal is accepted, the observation is carefully planned — along with thousands of others — for the most appropriate viewing time. Planning viewing time is tricky because there are certain times of the year during which Earth's revolution around the Sun causes a &quot;geometry&quot; in which the target is too close to the Sun to be observable.</p>
<p>Consequently, technicians must schedule each observation down to a fraction of a second. Observation information such as which instrument to use, what filter to use, and how long the exposure should be must be converted into a detailed technical list of second-by-second instructions. These instructions are loaded onto the telescope's computers a few days before the scheduled observation.</p>
<p>The raw data collected by the telescope have a long way to go before they become actual Hubble images. As Hubble completes a particular observation, it converts the starlight into digital signals. The digital signals are then relayed down to a ground station at White Sands, New Mexico through two orbiting Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). The ground station then relays the data to Goddard Space Flight Center's ground control system, where staff ensure its completeness and accuracy.</p>
<p>Goddard then sends the data via data lines to the Space Telescope Science Institute for processing and calibration. Institute personnel translate the data into scientifically meaningful units — such as wavelength or brightness — and archive the information on 5.25-inch (13.3-cm) magneto-optical disks. Hubble sends the archive enough information to fill about 18 DVDs every week. Astronomers can download archived data via the Internet and analyze it from anywhere in the world.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the operating costs are for making Hubble do what it does, i.e. be an operational astronomical observatory. Several million a year is spent on the costs of deciding what to observe. Thousands of astronomers propose observations, and roughly a hundred spend time reading the proposals and ranking them, finally spending a week gathered together in the same room to hash out the final selection. This takes organization, and hence money.</p>
<p>Then, once it's decided what to observe, the observations need to be planned and scheduled, which is quite complex and involves many constraints like not pointing the telescope at the sun, moon or Earth with the shutter open, and other observatory safety considerations. This requires experienced scientists with years of teianing, which doesn't come cheap.</p>
<p>Then, each instrument and subsystem needs it's health monitored. More experienced scientists needed here.</p>
<p>Bringing the data down to the ground requires use and scheduling of a large radio telescope in the deep space network. These costs 10s of millions a year to run, but the costs are shared between missions.</p>
<p>Oh, and that data needs processing into something that astronomers can use. This requires dedicated scientists as well. </p>
<p>Astronomers who are allocated time also receive funding from that $100m budget to make the most of the data they obtained. This is usually spent hiring and training junior scientists. Some of the money will be spent on presenting the work at conferences and in journals as well.</p>
<p>Almost all of the above requires large amounts of computing resources, and some money is used to support NASA super computers for data processing and simulations to help interpret the data.</p>
<p>All this adds up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, not really. Hubble downlinks via TDRSS, DSN isn't involved. Maintaining the TDRSS system, on the other hand, costs money too. The Hubble project effectively pays for their frequency allocation on the TDRSS constellation, and downlinks that way.</p></div>		</li>
