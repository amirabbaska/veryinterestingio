			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been another fMRI study since the 2014 study that found that the representations of code and prose in the brain have an overlap, but are distinct enough that we can distinguish between the two activities. Another interesting finding of this study was that the ability to distinguish between the two is modulated by experience: more experienced programmers treat code and prose more similarly in the brain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not have too much insight into this, but there's been a few papers on &quot;readability&quot; metrics for source code:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-tse2010-readability-preprint.pdf" target="_blank">Learning a Metric for Code Readability</a></p>
<p><a href="http://softwareprocess.es/z/ruse-camera-ready.pdf" target="_blank">A Simpler Model of Software Readability</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/students/dorn-mcs-paper.pdf" target="_blank">A General Software Readability Model</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jad5ju/publications/fse2015.pdf" target="_blank">Modeling Readability to Improve Unit Tests</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/pubs/ICPC'16-Readability.pdf" target="_blank">Improving Code Readability Models with Textual Features</a></p>
<p>The problem with most of these is that we know there's a difference between &quot;readability&quot; and &quot;understandability&quot;, and that understandability can have different meanings in different contexts (e.g., a novice learning a programming language probably needs the code to have different features than an expert performing debugging tasks). At least one study has addressed understandability from the perspective of maintenance with a pretty good human study, but I'm not terribly familiar with follow-on work:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~zpf5a/papers/FryISSTA12_PREPRINT.pdf" target="_blank">A Human Study of Patch Maintainability</a></p>
<p>A paper did come out at this year's Automated Software Engineering conference claiming that readability metrics do not actually capture understandability, but I think that their methods are dubious, and I'd advise taking it with a grain of salt (note: this is just my likely biased opinion, it did win a best paper award):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, did they show you code you'd written, or were intimately familiar with? When I look at code I understand very well, not only do I interpret the code I'm seeing, but I also perceive abstraction, interdependency, and other sorts of nuanced relationships. I'd liken it to the difference between reading a story for the first time, and already intimately understanding how characters think and feel and interact with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there were two code-related tasks. In one, we were shown short clips of code and asked questions about the value of variable X on line Y, for example. In the other, we were asked to review GitHub pull requests and asked if we'd accept the answer or not. The study wasn't really concerned as much with the correctness of the answers as much as making the subjects think about code. </p>
<p>Intuitively I'd guess that you're correct about the neural representation being different for code that you're very familiar with, but this methodology is very new (at least from a software engineering perspective), and these are some of the first results concerning neural representation of code. I'd be very interested in the comparison of representations of familiar and unfamiliar code, but it's an inherently expensive study to do, both in terms of money and time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am adding to this because yes writing and reading programs seem to require two separate skill sets. </p>
<p>While reading code you start with the overall picture of what you assume it does and then dig into the individual steps and chunks of logic behind those steps. </p>
<p>When writing code the overall picture requires you to determine the discrete steps needed to accomplish this overall picture. Then work on each step individually and possibly break them down even further to begin writing them out.</p>
<p>Natural language contains many givens, assumptions, and ideas behind much smaller information transfer.</p>
<p>Made a sandwich.  Three words, and you can see how in your head how I may have gone about doing this. Even with the token knife sitting on edge of sink for a second one.</p>
<p>To tell a computer to make a sandwich you first have to tell it where it is going to make it, what tools it will use, describe each step from bread, fridge, tools, toppings, and how they need to interact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point about making a sandwich. I think these are more similar than you may be leading on.</p>
<p>Consider that you can't just say &quot;make a sandwich&quot; and see the sandwich get made in front of you without any pre-established/pre-written functions. You call them &quot;assumptions&quot; or &quot;givens&quot;, but in programming we rely on these <em>extensively</em>. </p>
<p>In natural language, my command &quot;Make a sandwich&quot; (or the computer equivalent: <code>sudo make me a sandwich</code>, as the joke goes) calls a series of pre-learned functions in my friend (who is making the sandwich for me). Those functions are: find suitable plate, remove plate from cupboard, put plate (correct side up) on counter without breaking it, find suitable knife, pick up knife, put down knife to free up hands, find bread, remove bread from pantry, open the bread bag, pull out appropriate number of pieces, put pieces on plate, close up bread bag, put remaining bread back on counter,  etc. etc. We don't have to think through those because they're part of our code library. </p>
<p>If you doubt this, tell my toddler -- she fully understands the <em>idea</em> of what it means to make a sandwich, but has absolutely zero built-in functions / &quot;code libraries&quot; with which to sequence the actual making of the sandwich. </p>
<p>The required discrete steps to accomplish the task (in programming language, or in natural language) are the same... it is just that in natural language they're so deeply embedded into your understanding of the world that you don't think of them as the individual parts that make up the aggregate &quot;Make me a sandwich&quot;... you just think of making a sandwich for your friend and the separate parts just seem obvious. This is what I understand to simply be: Fluency. </p>
<p>This brings us to OP's question: Does the brain interact with programming languages in the same way as natural languages. I don't have any better sources than those which have already been posted, so I won't be able to contribute more evidence one way or another.... but I am <em>very</em> curious to read more studies that follow this question more deeply. My suspicion is that it will prove out to be similar (if not the same), but that is based <em>solely</em> on my own personal experience, which I realize is not a valid source for the purposes of AskScience!</p>
<p>For what it is worth, <code>bash</code> is my &quot;programming&quot; language of choice (I'm a sysadmin, not an actual programmer)... I'm fluent in it in a way that I don't have to think &quot;command a, then command b, then command c&quot; and so on... my mind decides what result I want and I invoke the &quot;words&quot; necessary to get that done. I'm not thinking: &quot;Now what command would go well here to get this or that job done&quot; - I know the outcome I want, and the path to get there is just there in my mind. This is fundamentally different than when I'm working in perl, for example. I also write in markup enough that, while it isn't a programming language in the sense that OP is asking, I do feel like it is similar. I don't even see the markup any more; my brain sees the markup and I see it formatted in my mind. It is actually pretty neat when I start to think about it!</p>
<p>Anyhow... thanks for your contribution about the sandwiches. It really got me thinking on this!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are saying about calling up subroutines and stringing them together, but I think you are skipping the part where you know WHICH subs to call up and in what order, and knowing all of the necessary ones to put in the sequence to achieve success. I write programs for my CNC machine daily, and I know from expensive experience that computers are DUMB. You have to tell it exactly what, when, how fast, which direction, size of tool, etc. Programming is by necessity a hyper-detailed affair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an assumption that you are making about programming: that it's only about discrete, ordered operations, when this is only a subset of programming. For example: VHDL is still a language and is still broadly considered to be programming, however it is <em>not</em> a set of discrete, ordered, operations.</p>
<p>You could also compare to certain functional programming paradigms, where order is only assumed in terms of data flow (ie. Function outputs to inputs).</p>
<p>If you want to go even broader, there's also languages like XML, DDL (&quot;part of&quot; SQL), HTML/CSS, etc. Which are more just descriptions of structured data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Programmer reading this sandwich analogy.... Brain says, you should learn about inheritance. You'll only make the sandwich once if you do it right the first time. But later if you start a Jimmy Johns, you can throw the sandwich on the menu. Then again, what is a sandwich, really. Its just layers of stuff from top to bottom. So does it really need to be sandwich or can it just be a sequential list of objects. But if its just a sequential list of objects, it could be anything really. So should be make it AnythingReally because then we could put it on any menu.</p>
<p>So yea, reading code is different than writing code and architecting systems is different than later. So asking if the brain interacts with programming languages like verbal languages is analogous comparing riding a bike to hot wheel car because they both have wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfectly to the point with a great elaboration. You bringing inheritance up though makes me think of how verbs are conjugated and how that relates.</p>
<p>She is a runner. She ran earlier. She will run later today. She was running down the road. There will be multiple runs to get coffee. She runs too much.</p>
<p>Same base word and idea, but now is being inherited to convey when the action occurred. </p>
<p>There is so much more to programming then just our ideas of a natural progression of a root word could be reused on many ways. Especially when you can even swap out words, the idea remains the same.</p>
<p>So while the code eventually may do the same thing, it can be built using different methods and paths to get there. Now you need to think more of along the lines of which method is more flexible, which makes it easier to change later, will I remember what justDoAction() does a year or two down the road. Will biggie smalls be able to understand what my code does. </p>
<p>Many algorithms although functionally identical can take many different shapes and paths to accomplish their jons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, &quot;make a sandwich&quot; isn't the equivalent of telling a computer all that. It's the equivalent of calling makeSandwich() which is already defined, because the person you're telling to make a sandwich already knows what a sandwich is and how to make one. If you teach a baby how to talk, the baby still won't know what a sandwich is or how to make it until you tell them. Sandwich-making isn't inherent to language; you'd have to already define that to the reader in the same way you'd have to define the sandwich function to a computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if a study where a person is put into the mri machine and, for 30-40 minutes either writes code or writes in their native language. What they are doing is not told to the observers. Those observing the imaging have to try to figure out whether they are writing or coding.</p>
<p>Then they would compare their results to what the person in the mri was actually doing. </p>
<p>I feel this would probably be a fairly conclusive way to test something like this, but i have no idea really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that this is a very difficult experiment to set up. First, you'd need a nonferrous keyboard to go near the magnet, and there would likely be RF interference (I know someone that tried to set this up with a rubber keyboard, it didn't work so well). Second, MRI requires you to keep the area under study (i.e., the head) still, and it's already hard to get people to stay still when they aren't doing something like typing.</p></div>		</li>
