			<div class="markdown"><p>Like /u/Thaddeauz, you're missing a big factor: parent empires.  For example, at its height, New France ran from the Mississippi delta all the way North to the Great Lakes basin to Hudson's Bay, West along the Missouri to the mountains, and East along the St Lawrence to encompass all of Quebec, Labrador, and all the maritime provinces of Canada.  (That's why there are French city names like Louisville, Des Moines, and the natives called Cheyenne, Sioux, Iroquois - all French spellings.)</p>
<p>America won because it was planted by the British Empire, which won out over the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the French in various European theatre conflicts.  These world powers signed over much of their New World territories to the British when they negotiated peace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot to be said for access to markets through shared languages and political alliances. This is especially true within the United States, where the Spanish colonies of California and Texas have fared substantially better than their Mexican neighbors, and the Dutch colony of New York has continued to flourish while other Dutch colonies failed.</p>
<p>This equally demonstrates, however, that the origin does not matter whatsoever. Connection with economic engines does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am reasonably certain that if you gave the north america to the spaniards, and the south america to the brits, you would have today a very strong south america and a piss poor north america. Culture and how you handle problems has also a lot to do with it, but saying it is racist, under the assumption that all men are equal. All men have equal rights, but they don't have equal behavior, response, and discipline, either as a single or as a group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to agree, this is my line of thinking. Each and every English speaking country is turning out to be really freaking successful. </p>
<p>New Zealand, a two islands in the middle of nowhere, and they are far better than my country that is in south east of Europe, just 1500km from Germany, France etc.</p>
<p>It is amazing, even South Africa, before Apartheid was ridiculous, they had nukes, they were the first to install head mounted aiming displays for tracking and attacking targets in the Air-to-Air combat in the 1970s (US started working on these systems in the 1990s - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet-mounted_display" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet-mounted_display</a>). I know correlation does not mean causation, but it really seems so.</p>
<p>It might just be a culture related thing, as Brits had a certain approach to their problems, and they imprinted that on all the colonies that were populated by a significant amount of people descendant from Brits themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helps when nations British colonize aren't decimated by diseases. The British also reduced the wealth and riches that India had drastically and also had problems in Equatorial Africa. New Zealand, Australia, and Canada were largely undeveloped while it was still under direct rule. </p>
<p>You may be allocating their current wealth (Canada, Australia, NZ) on what the British did instead of what they did for themselves. I think that may be a mistake. </p>
<p>The colonial govt definitely makes a difference though and North America would have been a mess if it was settled by  Spain, France, etc. But the British and would not have developed South America or tropical Africa into super powers either - history shows they failed with colonies they possessed in Guyana,  Belize, Volta, Guinea, etc.  </p></div>		</li>
