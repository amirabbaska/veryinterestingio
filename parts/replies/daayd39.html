			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be buried, but while many answers say that 'it will/can interfere with the flight deck instruments' the true reason is certification.</p>
<p>The FAA must test and certify every electronic device that is allowed to operate on an aircraft. In the airline world, we just recently (Past few years) were granted access to operate EFB, or electronic flight bags. </p>
<p>Electronic flight bags are ipads/surfaces that contain all of our charts and manuals. It took the FAA YEARS to certify because they need to run tests and ensure that these devices will not only work, but not interfere with our aircraft. Testing and certification takes years and a whole lot of money. Once these tests are complete we can't simply go buy a new iPad or Surface when the new model comes out, we need to use only the model approved until the FAA re-certifies a newer model.</p>
<p>For example, the Surface that I use is an older, less efficient model of the newest Microsoft lineup, and while the newer surfaces would operate smoother and quicker, I can't just go and purchase one and install my chart software on it, because that particular model hasn't been cleared by the FAA yet.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for you and your iphone? Well, the FAA doesn't want to waste time, money and resources on testing every single electronic device that is out on the market to ensure that they're &quot;safe&quot;, so the easiest solution? Turn them off, or turn them to a non-transmitting mode. </p>
<p>tl;dr- It's not so much the interference, it's the red tape that's involved with FAA certification to allow PEDs to be on while in flight.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the interwebs...  &quot;Many GSM phones support three bands (900/1,800/1,900 MHz or 850/1,800/1,900 MHz) or four bands (850/900/1,800/1,900 MHz)....&quot;</p>
<p>So cellphones operate on a frequency that is 800-1000MHz higher than what VOR &amp; ILS operate on. VOR and ILS operate on the high end of the very high frequency (VHF) band. Something like 108MHz-117.9MHz. That means that the antenna for either system isn't designed to receive anything else but VHF. Lets say it does pick up a cellphone signal, the first step of demodulating the received signal is to filter out unwanted noise. Cellphone signals are unwanted noise. </p>
<p>A cellphone could affect systems that operate on its same frequency range. Systems like TACAN and IFF both operate on 960MHz-1215MHz. </p>
<p>USAF avionics guy here... I've never been told to turn my phone off on a military aircraft, and typically service is lost within the first 2 minutes of flight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was going to say. Knowing how strict the FCC is, I doubt the two technologies would share the same bandwidth and now that I see the actual frequency values I doubt you would hit the plane's frequencies with harmonics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In small planes it does happen - I can often hear blips when a text message is coming in for someone on the plane is getting a message. But phones operate on very quick transmissions so even if you do experience interference, it is VERY quick and doesn't affect anything. </p>
<p>It could be a greater issue if 300 people were all receiving messages, but on an airliner those people are much further away than on a private plane, so it's still not an issue.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>USN missile/radar guy here. No doubt the request is overly cautious, but you can't really compare military and civilian equipment. Part of the whole &quot;milspec&quot; designation includes heavier EM shielding. Military gear is designed for operations in a potentially hostile EM environment. Not typically hardened enough to protect against a full EMP, but certainly more robust than civilian counterparts. Not all of the overinflated prices on military gear are unwarranted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also point out that aviation is replete with redundancy. So while it may be true that only an unshielded radio would be susceptible to interference, eliminating the sources of interference is a backup for the shielding. We are also talking about potentially hundreds of phones being used on the same flight, of all makes and models. This is difficult to test adequately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, the FAA made it the individual airlines' responsibility to test all phones against all aircraft equipment they use if they want to allow cell phone use during flight. It's far more trouble than it is worth. </p></div>		</li>
