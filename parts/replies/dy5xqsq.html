			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't, well not with traditional instruments. However, there's things that allow us to make these predictions from earth.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can measure time, and perform experiments, here on earth in regards to special and general relativity. That is, we can do experimentation here on earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take as an axiom that the laws of the universe here on earth, are the same as the laws of the universe far away, or long ago.</p>
</li>
<li>We can observe photons from the universe, and apply 1 and 2 to predict phenomena far away and long ago.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to measure time in different places is to have two atomic clocks side by side and verify they're in sync.  Put one in a car and drive up to the top of a tall mountain or take it on a plane ride.  When it returns, it'll be running ahead of the clock that stayed at sea level.  </p>
<p>Time moved more slowly for the clock that stayed in the higher gravity field.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's just take speed. If you are on a spaceship going 1/2 the speed of light, and have a clock, the clock still ticks and you live 70-80 years, same exact thing. On earth, you also live 80 years according to the clock. There is no difference.</p>
<p>It only matters when you compare the two clocks. If you never compare, it doesn't matter. Everyone on your spaceship dies in 80 years, according to your on-board clock. Everyone on Earth dies in 80 years, according to Earth's clock.</p>
<p>However, in the comparison, the spaceship's clock goes slower than the earth's, or the earth's goes faster, whichever way you want to look at it. Same thing.</p>
<p>That's all there is to it. Time changes depending on mass and speed, but only in comparison to other clocks.</p>
<p>The same thing would be - forget about Earth for a minute - if you are traveling 1/4 speed of light, you are at &quot;normal&quot; speed, but if another space ship is traveling at 1/2 speed of light, then both are traveling at <em>their</em> normal speed, but the 1/2 speed of light clock would be slower, <em>as compared to</em> the 1/4 speed of light spaceship clock. It's all just relative.</p>
<p>It's no different than a lot of other things conceptually. For example, let's say you and another person, both here on earth, were of equal athletic ability. They play each other in tennis, let's say, and are equally matched.  The other person moves away from you, but then starts playing a sport - could be basketball, martial arts, tennis, whatever - the other person goes and practices 5 times per week. They just do it, they live it for 2 years. It is &quot;normal&quot; everyday time for them of 2 years. Now the both of you get together, and play tennis. They fucking kick your ass, as is understandable. That is a sort of time-dilation. You stayed at your current level, they come back and from <em>your</em> standpoint, instantly got better, but from the <em>other's</em> person, they did NOT instantly get better, they lived the life. This experience happened to me. I used to practice twice a week with someone, then I kicked it into overdrive and practiced 5 times a week for 3 hours a day. When I went back, my former practice buddy was shocked that I so easily kicked his ass, without trying. I was surprised that it was so easy, given that we were equal skills before. Time dilation on both sides.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I know these things aren't supposed to be for literal five year olds, but that doesn't mean they have to be a dissertationa either. They should change the rules of the sub to say everything needs to be in plain English. Otherwise why not change the sub to &quot;ask the experts&quot;?</p>
<p>What's the point of having the sub named ELI5 if the answers aren't supposed to be simple?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if we found really massive Earth-like planet and colonized it, would people there live longer than on Earth? Of course disregarding all other factors.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So then is time relative or not? Because that second quote doesn't deal with anything relative, it specifies that time actually runs faster/slower depending on gravity in given point of the universe.</p></div>		</li>
