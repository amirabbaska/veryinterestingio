			<div class="markdown"><p>Building on this, there are further considerations;  </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-us/support/welding-solutions/Pages/aluminum-faqs-detail.aspx" target="_blank">this FAQ</a>, there are two broad categories of aluminum alloys, each of which has particular challenges;  </p>
<p><strong>Heat treatable alloys</strong> : These are alloys which can go through heating / cooling cycles in order to strengthen them, in much the same way that steel can.  As the FAQ says, welding can result in much higher local temperatures than the final 400^o F step of heat treatment.  So, further post-welding heat treatment is needed or the weld area can be up to 40% weaker than the base material.   </p>
<p><strong>Cold worked alloys</strong> : These have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_hardening" target="_blank">work hardened</a> in order to make them stronger - typically because they can't be heat treated.  Welding them will lead to localized heating, which 'reverses' the cold working strengthening.  So, the welding would need to be done before the cold working process in order to retain strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>out-of-practice metallurgist here.  6061-T6 develops its strength via precipitation hardening.The heat of welding will undo that treatment, reducing the strength immensely. Also need to be particular in your choice of fill/wire.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the sensitive to gases present makes sense that it would require inert gas shielding.</p>
<p>The higher heat conductivity. Physically that means that it takes less energy to heat 1 kg of AL 1 Degree C than Steel so that means it heats up faster. Why does this make it harder? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No, that's heat capacity.</p>
<p>High thermal conductivity means when you heat the area you're trying to weld, the heat is dissipated to the rest of the piece rapidly, rather than staying where you need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: when you weld aluminum, the entire piece is going to get very hot. In steel, there is just going to be a local hot spot where you were working. I started on aluminum before doing steel and winced when I saw somebody grab the end of a steel part they were welding barehanded but it wasn't an issue. (This is for relatively short duration welds)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The faster something heats up the faster you have to weld and the smaller your Margin of error is. Light a piece of important paper on fire and try to light a piece of wood on fire. Now imagine they're both very important and you need to put them out as fast as possible. This is what it's like to weld very light gauge metals. I had to weld 2 inch ferrules into 26 gauge stainless hoppers. Took me about a week by the time I polished everything and made it all pretty(food grade) had the hopers been 16 gauge it would of taken two days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can easily destroy your base metal if you put too much heat into a piece. It can either burn through, or make too deep a cut forcing you to try to fill faster or make a terrible weld. </p>
<p>Also if it takes too much heat the area around the weld, the heat affected zone, will be much weaker than the weld metal itself or the base metal outside the zone. This depending on what the application is can make the whole thing useless as it will crack around the weld if too much weight or pressure is put on the piece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks. So it seems like the heat conductivity is really key. </p></div>		</li>
