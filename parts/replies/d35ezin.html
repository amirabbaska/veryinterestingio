			<div class="markdown"><p>A better example is gorilla glass vs bulletproof glass. </p>
<p>Gorilla glass is hard. Cell phone companies advertise their resistance to scratches. But drop the damn phone, and it will Crack. </p>
<p>Bulletproof glass is the opposite </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people don't have experience with bullet proof glass. It scratches very easily. Like after a couple months in the desert it will be covered in scratches that start impairing your ability to see through it. So they put different coatings on to try to prevent the cloudiness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, bulletproof &quot;glass&quot; is an extruded plastic called polycarbonate. Lexan is another brand name for it. A well-extruded 1/4&quot; thick sheet will stop a .22 slug from a foot away. It's extruded with moisture in it, giving it a bit of springiness and flexibility, which makes it easier to scratch, but the impact of any force gets dispersed throughout the sheet and never results in a shatter. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important aspect, gorilla glass changes hardness and toughness based on the version. My note 3 has GG3 and therefore is very hard while my note 4 (GG4) is less harder and has a bunch of scratches though it is supposed to be tougher than the Note 3 GG3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To test whether tempered glass is harder than ceramic, you simply have to see which scratches the other. Since ceramic covers such a range different materials you can't say in general which is harder.</p>
<p>But yes, this seems about right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>think of hardness as scratch resistance, and toughness as break resistance. Diamonds may never scratch but will break. Where as something very tough may scratch easily but never break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of this real world example.</p>
<p>Glass is harder than steel.  That is why you do not use glass cutting boards; they dull knives very quickly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, steel is tougher than glass.  That is why hammers are made out of steel and not glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(roughly..)</p>
<p>hardness measures how easily you can gouge a scratch in something.</p>
<p>Toughness is about how hard you have to hit it before it breaks.</p>
<p>a block of plastic is not hard, but it is tough. (You can gouge it, but hitting it with a hammer wont break it)</p>
<p>A block of glass is Hard but not tough. You cannot gouge it, but you dont have to hit it anywhere near as hard with a hammer to break it, compared to a block of plastic.</p></div>		</li>
