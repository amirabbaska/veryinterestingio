			<div class="markdown"><p>A better example is gorilla glass vs bulletproof glass. </p>
<p>Gorilla glass is hard. Cell phone companies advertise their resistance to scratches. But drop the damn phone, and it will Crack. </p>
<p>Bulletproof glass is the opposite </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people don't have experience with bullet proof glass. It scratches very easily. Like after a couple months in the desert it will be covered in scratches that start impairing your ability to see through it. So they put different coatings on to try to prevent the cloudiness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, bulletproof &quot;glass&quot; is an extruded plastic called polycarbonate. Lexan is another brand name for it. A well-extruded 1/4&quot; thick sheet will stop a .22 slug from a foot away. It's extruded with moisture in it, giving it a bit of springiness and flexibility, which makes it easier to scratch, but the impact of any force gets dispersed throughout the sheet and never results in a shatter. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important aspect, gorilla glass changes hardness and toughness based on the version. My note 3 has GG3 and therefore is very hard while my note 4 (GG4) is less harder and has a bunch of scratches though it is supposed to be tougher than the Note 3 GG3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To test whether tempered glass is harder than ceramic, you simply have to see which scratches the other. Since ceramic covers such a range different materials you can't say in general which is harder.</p>
<p>But yes, this seems about right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>think of hardness as scratch resistance, and toughness as break resistance. Diamonds may never scratch but will break. Where as something very tough may scratch easily but never break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of this real world example.</p>
<p>Glass is harder than steel.  That is why you do not use glass cutting boards; they dull knives very quickly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, steel is tougher than glass.  That is why hammers are made out of steel and not glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(roughly..)</p>
<p>hardness measures how easily you can gouge a scratch in something.</p>
<p>Toughness is about how hard you have to hit it before it breaks.</p>
<p>a block of plastic is not hard, but it is tough. (You can gouge it, but hitting it with a hammer wont break it)</p>
<p>A block of glass is Hard but not tough. You cannot gouge it, but you dont have to hit it anywhere near as hard with a hammer to break it, compared to a block of plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High carbon steel tends to be one of the best materials for knives that we have tried. There are things that can have a finer edge put on them, but will dull extremely quickly. Other, harder materials will hold an edge better, but will chip or crack more often, ruining the blade. </p>
<p>The best way to make a blade last longer is to care for it properly. Hone it regularly, sharpen it as needed, and for the love of Christ, keep it out of the dishwasher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, stuff like inconel, one of those superalloys used in turbine fans, isn't actually that amazing mechanically (it's not <em>bad</em> by any stretch of the imagination, but we can make far better materials for room temp use). </p>
<p>The advantage is they don't oxidise (rust) at high temps, and they have truly exceptional creep resistance, which means they don't soften and stretch as they get hot (think about a candle left in a warm room; without melting, it can still slump and deform... that's creep). The latter is very important when you have mm tolerances on things at high temp under a lot of load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>titanium is extremely soft, but ridiculously strong and tough. In steam turbines, if you're not running the steam hot enough, the water droplets will chew right through a turbine wheel.</p>
<p>EDIT: even after heat treating, pure (Grade 2) titanium has an HRC of 3. a cheap walmart knife might be in the 40s and a quality steel (s90v) knife can be in the 70s.</p></div>		</li>
