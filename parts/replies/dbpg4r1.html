			<div class="markdown"><p>this sounds like a load of baseless horse shit bro. i firmly disagree that touching &quot;a soap dispenser or faucet or door handle is like touching the genitals of 95% of everyone who have used it.&quot; </p>
<p>first off, thats just not true. stainless steel kills germs which is what a lot of faucets and handles are made of. Second, even if it were true, do you think peoples genitals in general are that filthy? I know mine arent. 3rd, bacteria from shit is pretty much the only thing you worry about, which aint genitals. 4th, &quot;95% of everyone who have used it.&quot; In what time period? Germs don't live that long on surfaces, and bathrooms are typically cleaned regularly. 5th, who says 95% of people don't wash properly? Your germ freak blog? The CDC? You know, 68% of all statistics are made up on the spot.</p>
<p>You know how many time's ive gotten ill from bathrooms? Never. Everytime I've ever caught anything, be it a cold, a flu, or norovirus, its been from much closer contact, like sharing a beverage with a contagious friend, or being stuck in a room with an infection person coughing and sneezing into the air, or poor sanitation in food service. </p>
<p>Granted, its always better safe than sorry, but I rarely wash my hands if I just took a piss and didn't get any peepee on my hands. Me touching my penis, then a door, then you touching the door is not going to spread any contagion to you. Have you ever performed oral sex before?? Did you get ill??</p>
<p>I can see youre a nurse, which makes me especially surprised you'd throw out crazy baseless statistics like that. Maybe youre accustomed to being afraid of staph!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1.) No, stainless steel does not “kill germs”. Its best qualities are being non-porous and dries quickly. Some metals have an oligodynamic effect, which can be helpful against microbes. Stainless steel isn't one of them. </p>
<p>2.) Filth has little to do with it. Viruses should be your biggest concern. The herpes simply virus can be transferred by touch from a person's genitals to a soap dispenser. If the soap dispense is plastic, like most, the virus can live up to 4 hours. That can be hundreds of people in an airport bathroom. One in three adults have HSV.</p>
<p>3.) Yes, bacteria is a concern, but as you mention, we rarely get sick from oral sex. Bacterial infections are, more often than not, merely annoying. Viral infections can be a lifetime. </p>
<p>4.) Some viruses, like HIV, die quickly. A flu virus can live for up to 24hrs on a hard surface. C. difficile, a sometimes deadly bacteria, can live on surfaces for 5 months. </p>
<p>5.) According to a study by Michigan State University, 5% washed their hands long enough to adequately kill germs, one-third did not use soap, and 10% didn't wash at all. I've timed people myself; it's scary. You should try. It's vigorous rubbing for 10-15sec. Watch 20 people the next time you get the chance: Count out at least 10sec of vigorous rubbing: See if you can find one person.</p></div>		</li>
