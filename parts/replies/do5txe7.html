<p>So what you're saying is...let's train tigers as the force multiplier would be even greater?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding crowd control on number 4, I was at the Occupy DC camp when the park police came and cleared us out.  They used a line of cops on horses to push the crowd out of McPherson park and into the road. Being pushed backwards by horses and pushed forward by the crowd was terrifying.  Those massive animals won the shoving match though. They won thanks in no small part to the horses they were riding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses have total command in such situations. Mounted police are also trained to know how to position themselves and how to use formations in their advantage. </p>
<p>Pro-tip for anyone reading this; if you're at any kind of demonstration or whatever, when mounted police show up, just give up and save yourself a lot of potential pain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also trained to side-step the horses to shove people, as well as weaving horses through crowds effectively slicing through them and separating people like moses.. really cool to watch actually</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were only a dozen or so horses at most too. The cops on foot created a funnel/walls as the horses in the center pushed. They forced a few hundred people to move with only a few horses that way. I don't know if it matters, but we were all walking/tripping over trampled tents, random garbage/stuff, and a shin high fence at the sidewalk. The protesters struggled with the debris and crowd, but the horses didn't seem to notice it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was this one time, in Vienna where about 20,000 mounted officers charged about 140,000 guys...and routed them.  </p>
<p>If machine guns and rifles aren't an issue, cavalry are utterly face-wrecking terrifying.</p></div>		</li>
