			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. The law is in place to keep corporations from collecting millions of gallons in one place and causing a drought elsewhere. You won't get in trouble for collecting rain water in a bucket on your own property realistically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. In most city its about money. I know people that have had to take down their own rainwater systems or get a huge fine. Even though collecting rain water is WAY more efficient since you prevent a lot of evaporation and don't use what the guys downstream need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you'll inevitably see places that do enforce these laws strictly, but most places will turn a blind eye to the lone bucket in the back yard or the barrel you water your flowers from </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess again. OP is talking about laws that don't allow collection of rainwater at all, as in not even in a water barrel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm aware. The issue is that the law outlaws collection of any kind so that a company, say Nestl√©, can't go into a town, buy a plot of land, and stick hundreds of barrels on it to collect water or some other loophole.</p>
<p>Nobody is going to get into trouble for collecting water in a barrel to water their garden when drier seasons come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can also fuck up the environment if you collect too much. eliminating a stream can cause feeder species like small fish and insects to die or leave which goes all the way up the food chain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that collecting too much rain water can screw the people who are downstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>....How? How does collecting rain from the sky somehow mess up the rivers?</p>
<p>Am I missing something here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You kind of have to think it through: where does the river water come from?</p>
<p>These laws were initially to stop large companies from moving in to a high precipitation area, and collecting all the water before it hits the rivers (where it's communally owned). However, there are now many stories of individuals being told to take down their rain collecting rigs (usually too small to have any effect on the actual flow). </p>
<p>It's a common, repeating issue everywhere: Law is made for common sense, good reason. Law is on the books for a while. Law is enforced by the letter, instead of the spirit, without any common sense behind the enforcement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, I think its like: when it rains, the water will run down hill into rivers and lakes. I suppose also into the sewage system for water treatment. If you collect the water, then less of it is running down. </p>
<p>Of course, if one person does it, it is fine. If you have a whole city, or big greedy corporation doing it, then there is less water going downstream to the communities down south. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, collecting the water from the river itself? I imagined &quot;collecting rainwater&quot; to be....like, just getting a giant barrel or something and letting it sit and fill up in the rain.</p></div>		</li>
