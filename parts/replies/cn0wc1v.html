			<p>So basically, risk getting killed or permanently disabled in order to not have your personal finances fucked over by having to pay for college. Great job, America. We're really winning the future here. </p>		</li>

			<p>Its a gamble, but it is the best deal in town. Like I stated, you can reduce your chances of death by doing a non-combat job like intel or aircrew. <br><br>EDIT: Do I like that it's the best deal in town? Absolutely not, I think education should be low cost or free, and that instead of pouring 3 trillion into the Iraq and Afghan wars we should have taken that money and invested in education and space exploration. ^two ^cents ^added</p>		</li>
