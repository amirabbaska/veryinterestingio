			<div class="markdown"><p>My problem is that I love my dentist, but hygienists are less consistent. Historically I have had good hygienists, but sometimes a new hire can really be a dud. Often they are let go after a few months if enough patients complain. Your dentist has no way of knowing that their hygienist is causing problems unless their customers let them know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i was a child our city <del>witch</del> dentist was a maniac. Now i think she has a private office with mostly negative reviews online about how shitty she is.<br />
I was scared about anything teeth related as a child and neglected dental care. I'm 20 and still get sweaty palms when i just hear the word &quot;dentist&quot;. I'm getting better tho, i cut down sweet foods and chocolate by a lot and floss and wash my teeth every day.</p></div>		</li>
