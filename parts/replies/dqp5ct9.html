			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, condolences. I merely have mild eczema on my hands and water feels itchy, washing up anything is a bitch (sure I can wear gloves, but then hands start sweating = become wet = same outcome). I love sweeping and dusting things off because those don't involve water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part the lungs have fluid and small hairs which catch the particles and then move them out of the lungs and into the throat. However some really tiny particles can get lodged in the lungs and cause damage, these are normally referred to as particulate matter (PM 10, PM 2.5) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmKz3wCoycQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmKz3wCoycQ</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right. Mucus and fine hairs, called cilia work to keep the particles from getting too deep in the lungs. Mucus is sticky and catches a lot of it. We sneeze, cough or swallow most of the dust out that way. If the dust gets into the lungs, the cilia move like waves and push the dust out.  Just like waves do to sand on the beach. </p>
<p>When the dust is super small and pointy, like asbestos, it can get past a lot of these and lodge itself deep in the lung tissue. This causes scarring and may lead to mesothelioma. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nose hairs stop a lot of this incoming stuff, but the lungs are also self cleaning. They are coated in a mucous which catches these particles, and this mucous is extruded from the lungs, and is then swallowed or coughed out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about how we evolved.  We came from Animals that lived <em>outside</em> in dust, dirt and more all their lives.   Thus a healthy person is <em>very</em> well equipped to handle &quot;natural,&quot; normal dust and dirt.   Stuff like super fine sand, pollen, human skin cells and other natural stuff.   Its the toxic stuff like hydrocarbon particulates (aka combustion smoke/pollution), heavy metal dust, industrial smoke, and things like asbestos that hurt the lungs.  Of course you have your tobacco too.  Actually the fun thing is to see HOW much sludge 100 cigarettes make </p>
<p>On other oddity of note is volcanic ash, instead of soft, rounded dust, fresh ash is like microscopic ninja stars made of razor sharp glass.  It cuts into the lung cells and tissue, and it can abjectly ruin the lungs of anything that breathes too much of it.   Though...a few weeks out in  nature blowing around and it all rubs together grinding itsself down into really fine sand....</p>
<p>Our lungs have mucus and cilia to constantly clean them, our nose and throat both clean the air we breathe and handle to the dust neatly.  In short the immune system attacks any microbes with a vengeance and everything is flushed down through the digestive system.  </p>
<p>Really the major concern with normal dust is dust overload causing irritation, and allergies.  </p></div>		</li>
