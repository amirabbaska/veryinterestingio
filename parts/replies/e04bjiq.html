I work in a machine shop on our Swiss lathes that use oil for cutting fluid we had the inside of the machine ignite when the chips from cutting the steel were so fine they were like grains of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fireworks used to or still do have powdered metal in them for the bright sparks. Source: made a titanium knife and grinder dust was super flammable, white hot shrapnel. you have to catch the dust in a water bucket with a drop of soap to break the surface tension or the dust will accumulate and catch fire on top of the water, which won't put it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most metal dusts are highly flammable! If they oxidize easily, they can burn easily. Since... That's all burning is anyway.</p>
<p>This includes even metals that don't obviously oxidize like Aluminum or stainless steel, since the reason they are stable is because of the small layer of oxidation that forms on them.</p>
<p>If you introduce enough air and enough heat, they go poof! As long as the heat is high enough to strip the oxidation from them quickly. Something that happens at a fairly low temperature for aluminum.</p>
<p>Sparks are actually burning metal. When you grind or strike metal, it imparts a lot of thermal energy to a small portion of the metal, and exposes a small surface of completely unoxidized metal to the air, which then oxidizes rapidly (burns).</p></div>		</li>
