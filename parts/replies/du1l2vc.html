<p>So..... location. OK. The brain knows different things are in different locations.</p>
<p>How does it know what is where?</p>
<p>I can't see how the brain would even begin to map something like that out. How does that work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the mapping is unique to different locations of the brain as well as different types of sensation, this is easiest explained by the proven Human Homunculus model for touch reception. This is a map showing how much of the brain's cortical space is allocated to touch receptors across the body. As an example, the Homunculus model shows the hands as large compared to the back due to the fact that the brain literally has more neurons bundled in the cortex to represent the location of the hands. Specific neurons in this &quot;hand bundle&quot; would be stimulated by touching a part of the hand. This is how the brain &quot;knows&quot; the location that has been touched.  The back being less sensitive, and having less receptors, requires less cortical space to account for it's location. It has less dedicated neurons per square cm than the hands do. This is the first area the brain would recognize a touch. The brain's cortex is broken up into over 40 or so areas associated with different locations and functions called Brodmann areas. Thee brodmann's map gives the best illustration of how we understand the brain to function via it's parts, while the Homunculus model acts as an example to show how space is used in the brain to represent location and function.</p></div>		</li>
