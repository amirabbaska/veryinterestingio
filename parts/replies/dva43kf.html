			<div class="markdown"><p>So, just an anecdotal opinion here, my hygienist spent a couple years trying to get me to buy an electric. I brush my teeth regularly and didn't see a reason. I know from her that my body chemistry has a tendency to harden plaque very quickly, which makes cleanings a bit of a pain. Anyway, after years I finally spent the money. Cleanings are way easier now. One of the things we tend not to do is brush long enough. My electric has a timer, so that's no longer an issue either. Go electric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the timer is a big thing too.  I know I don't brush my teeth long enough when I do it manually.  Also I frequently think &quot;when is this going to be over with?&quot; when using the electric toothbrush. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your gum line and in between is what you should be concerned with anyway. Your teeth are pretty tough in and of themselves. But plaque tries to build up in between, and also under the edge of your gums. Let it build up enough and that’s why they will bleed every time you brush. I started flossing once a day and using an electric brush (Phillips Sonicare) over a year ago, and my visits to the dentist have been noticeably shorter because they’re not taking 15 minutes to scrape before even cleaning. The hygienist hits a few spots, cleans, then the doc checks, and I’m out in 10-15 minutes total.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice!</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence: I picked up a Sonicare and my dental hygienist does a lot less of that not-quite-painful tingling gum-scraping thing these days.  Basically, it's far less plaque sticking to my teeth and it's EASY.</p>
<p>The thing has 4 'cycles' and it hums a bit when you're done with one cycle and need to move to the next quadrant.</p>
<p>Coupled with a WaterPik, my teeth haven't needed anything but a polish for years.</p></div>		</li>
