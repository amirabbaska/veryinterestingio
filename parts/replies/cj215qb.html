<p>Takes a long (possibly indefinite) time for UV exposure to destroy wood. Only the outer layer is affected (i.e. the point from the surface inward to the point where light can most deeply penetrate), and if there is no mechanism present to remove the outer layer then the inner layer will never be exposed to UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you have to remember that wood on earth is protected by the atmosphere which blocks a good percentage of UV rays and is opaque (100% blockage) to anything stronger than that. Wood in space would be exposed to UV, x-ray, and gamma rays. It would also be exposed to micrometeories that would slowly ablate the surface.</p>

See that little curve in front of the purple wavelength that quickly rises up to 100%? That is the band of UV responsible for skin cancer. We are lucky the atmosphere blocks the rest of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars do not emit gamma rays on a regular basis. The gamma rays in your picture are actually typically produced by the earth's interaction with cosmic rays. The moon itself would be the only real source of gamma radiation for the same reason. </p>
<p>I do believe that you are correct that over time that UV rays will eat away at wood but I also believe that the time period is wholey speculative as there do not appear to be any studies on it. The reason I believe that it would take a very long time is that here on earth studies like the one I linked have been done, and properly treated wood can apparently survive for a very long time in normal UV conditions while simultaneously being exposed to the elements. The factors that you bring up about micro-meteorites and gamma radiation are good points but they would need to be studied to come up with a real answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the extreme temperature changes in space might be enough to break apart the wood over time as water trapped within the lignocellulose matrix freezes and thaws. This, combined with UV degradation makes wood a poor choice of building material in space. Of course this would be slower then the same and additional  processes (fungal decomposition) that also occur on earth, but I certainly wouldn't trust wood to keep my moon home in an earth like atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. As mentioned before rotting is the process by which organisms (usually fungi) break down the lignin in wood. </p>
<p>You would gradually see structural integrity of the wood fail due to UV damage, but it wouldn't rot.</p></div>		</li>
