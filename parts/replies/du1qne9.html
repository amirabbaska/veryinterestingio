			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends where the temperature probe is located, evaporative cooling might influence the reading. Compressed air or decompressing air as it goes through an air intake duct can also alter reading.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where my car's probe is, but I've noticed that stop for a few minutes, it appears the radiant engine heat gives it a false reading for a few minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure they're usually underneath the car, so radiant heat affects it and also being shaded affects it while the car is off.</p>
<p>EDIT: I am being told that the sensor is not so much under the car as it is positioned in the lower parts of the front of the engine bay. bordering upon under but just enough above under that I'm completely incorrect in saying under.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth noting that vehicles use thermistors, not thermometers. They are more susceptible to radiant heating and less prone to be effected by driving speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind, even at highway speeds, has not got enough kinetic energy to make enough pressure to cause a significant temperature delta. The limit is less than 0.1 psi for ram air intakes at 60 mph or 100 km/h.</p>
<p>This is also why the vast majority of cars - even high performance cars - don't bother with ram air intakes. The issues from turbulence more than outweigh the increase in intake air pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind-chill isn’t measured - it’s calculated. You can determine that a 70 degree day with 10mph winds is equivalent to a lower temperature based on how fast those winds can remove the heat from your body. </p></div>		</li>
