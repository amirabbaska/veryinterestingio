			<div class="markdown"><p>I think based on new studies of the microbiome in allergy and disease development that washing your hands less often is better. Of course we should after using the washroom, handling chemicals, or really dirtying them. Majority of microbes are harmless or even benefitical to to humans; the more we clean the more room we leave for pathogenic bacteria to take it's place. </p>
<p>Additionally, our microbiome contributes sooooooo much to our health and immune function. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And shigella is sooooo infectious that the most virulent strains only need about five! Although this is bc they are toxin producers. </p>
<p>If we do the math we get a clearer picture of why this is he case. If two bacteria enter the body and divide every twenty mins (average for ecoli) how much bacteria will be in ur body after 24 hours if we assume no bacteria die off? Well the easy answer is 2^72. Do the math and that is equivalent to 4.7 x 10^21. That’s an astronomical number that’s unfathomable by human scales. </p>
