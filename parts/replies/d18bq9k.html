			<p>A little of bit of correction. A human ejaculation contains sperm in millions an NOT billions.

( source is 10 yrs of fertility treatment due to male factor)<br>I do not know statistic of the proportion of thawing succes of sperm, but. I think it is way more than  1% . <br>Also fertility clinics often freeze empryos , often at the 5-6 days old blastocyst stage ,when it has thousand of cells already. <br>Different clinics have different success rates, but good clinics have very high thawing success. For example this one claims 69% of frozen embryos survive the thawing process. <br>Moreover the thawing success strongly depend on the grade ( normality of the embryos) and high quality embryos have as high as 90% thawing success rate.<br> Source : <a href="http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.givf.com/fertility/embryofreezing.shtml</a></p>		</li>

			<p>My kids were graded excellent quality at their embryo tic stage :)<br><br>In any case embryo grading is a beauty contest. They have no idea of genetic material, so they grade based on looks: how symmetric the embryo is, how many cell it has etc.<br><br>Natural selection still come to play even if the embryo was created in a dish. Embryos that actually have abnormal genetic material most likely will stop developing at some point. They may not attach to the womb, or miscarried at early stages. <br>Very few of the lab created embryos actually develop al, the way to became babies.<br>However those which end up being born statistically only have marginally higher genetic defect then the rest of the population, and only if ceirtain procedure was done called ICSI. </p>		</li>

			<p>Very close, the glycerol prevents ice crystals (true) but dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is necessary to create a more permeable cell membrane which prevents the cell membrane from rupturing during the freeze/thaw process.

			<p>There has been for quite some time a method of cryogenically freezing material that doesn't require the replacement of water with antifreeze. Basically, to simplify this newer process: crystals form from the water in cells due to the gradual cooling and alignment of water in the cells as the tissue is frozen; thus, if you can prevent the gradual cooling of the water, you can freeze the tissue without forming ice crystals. This is accomplished by applying a subsonic frequency vibration to the material in question, preventing the formation of crystals as the temperature is dropped to cryogenic temperatures. There are several problems with this process when applied to organs, tissues, and organisms as a whole, as well as the same problems involved with thawing.<br><br>Edit: source: current U.S. Navy cryogenic engineer and lover of science.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's a bad idea. Rapid freezing of large tissues (whole organs or bodies) would cause massive stress fracturing. Cryonics organizations mitigate this by using vitrifying solutions (which turn into a glass-like state rather than freezing) and cooling slowly. There are still &quot;fracturing events&quot; with current techniques, but the idea is that if the future has the technology to revive cryosuspended organisms then repairing a clean cleave at the molecular level should be easy by comparison.</p>		</li>

			<p>I wouldn't think so, because low sperm count means like 5 million instead of 100 million, and you still only need one. In cases where there are problems with the shape and motility of the sperm, they use a process called ICSI where a scientist with a microscope selects the actual sperm that will fertilize the egg, in order to have the greatest chance of a viable embryo.  I guess it can be a problem if a wonky sperm gets there first, because it fertilizes the egg and locks out the other guys, but then leads to an embryo that doesn't survive. </p>		</li>

			<p>Former sperm bank employee, current andrology tech in a fertility clinic here. Sperm banks will generally wash a sample, which removes a lot of the debris and dead cells. However, the freeze and thaw process will kill many of the remaining sperm cells. When a fertility clinic uses frozen sperm, or any other sperm for that matter, they will further process the sperm so that the final product is nearly completely living sperm cells only -to the best of their ability. <br> And, pet peeve of mine, it does not take only 1 sperm. It takes millions.  You have to start with millions because the refining process is inherently inefficient. Also, for conventional (not ICSI) insemination, many sperm work together to get through the zona, and after that point,  it takes 1 sperm.  My 2 cents<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly.  It's like cargo cult thinking.  <br><br>&quot;That Inception movie was really successful.  Let's take that creative, signature sound effect deeply tied to the story of that movie and put it in every action movie trailer ever and they'll be successful too, because that's all it takes, right?&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Most cell lines can tolerate that level of DMSO in culture. In fact, a lot cell assays tolerate 1% DMSO, and that's measuring <em>behavior</em> of cells, not just trying to get them to live. It's very useful for testing compounds that aren't readily soluble in isotonic solutions (and no one wants to spend 6 months coming up with a suitable aqueous formulation). We do the same thing with janky as fuck primary cells that die if you look at them the wrong way. MECs, HUVECs, HRECs, and then other cell lines like MB-MDA-231, MDCK.2, Caco II, etc... Hell, when I culture 231 cells I'll leave the cells in the dish to proliferate in 0.5% DMSO after plating (we use 5% DMSO, not 10%) and not change media for up to 2-3 days. Those fuckers are hearty though.</p>		</li>

First of all, it is a weak pain killer, but more interestingly it will pass through a person's skin unimpeded and it will take anything disolved in it with it. This makes it very usefull for getting medicines into the body exactly where you need it, or to get stuff that won't survive swallowing into the bloodstream without having to inject them.</p>		</li>

			<p>It actually has some good uses, but is often discounted for pharmaceutical uses. Mostly because it has the odd property off announcing it's presence with a garlicy taste in the back of your mouth, even when applied to the skin, making double-blind studies (or any study with a placebo group) difficult.  It's supposed to be able to transport other molecules across cell membranes efficiently.  As to the veracity of any of this, I have no idea, but I knew I guy who made cannabis tinctures and salves with it, and rubbing just a few drops of the stuff would cause overall relaxation and topical tingling faster than any other weed product  I'd ever tried, along with the aforementioned garlicy taste.  Whether this was the placebo effect or not, I obviously don't know, but there seemed to be more to it than any other hippie-dippie remedy  I'd ever tried.</p>		</li>

			<p>among other things it permeates the cell (essentially creating holes in the cell membrane allowing more things to pass through). for cryopreservation it makes the cell walls a bit more elastic making them a bit more resistant to damage stress to the cell walls when freezing/unfreezing. We use it in our lab to deliver drugs easier into cultured cells since it lets the drug pass through the cell membrane. It’s also readily absorbed through the skin and while it’s generally non-toxic to people at the doses they tend to be exposed to, other chemicals dissolved in DMSO can pass through your skin with it which could potentially be more toxic</p>		</li>

			<p>On one end it has a nonpolar CH3 ('methyl') group and on the other is a polar SH ('sulfinyl') group. It can interact with both polar and nonpolar molecules. In the case of cell membranes it sort of wedges itself between the nonpolar fatty acid chains on the inside of the membrane and the polar phosphate headgroups on the exterior. This increases the space between the cell membrane components which can allow things to pass through. This is why DMSO is used in transdermal drug delivery systems like fentanyl patches, topical topical ointment, etc.  <br><br>I'm a molecular biophysics researcher who is currently studying the effects of DMSO on protein structure and function.</p>		</li>

			<p>As many as they can get, but not a lot.  In an  in- vitro fertilization process clinic aim to get around a dozen eggs. They  can get more from ceirtain generally very young women , but quality may be compromised at higher numbers .<br><br>Although egg freezing is  possible, freezing / thawing is much more successful in case of embryos than in case of eggs. Normally out of a dozen eggs maybe 10 get fertilized, and maybe 5-6 survive until the 5th day. Out of that they usually transfer the best 1-2 to the women, and they freeze the rest.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>This is a huge area of research. The horse racing industry, for example, is putting a lot of money into the development of new storage mediums and freezing thawing techniques. </p>		</li>

			<p>Just to add to this great answer, technically you need thousands of sperm. Only 1 sperm eventually penetrates the egg, but it takes many sperm to degrade the outer protective layers of the egg. 1 lone sperm couldn't do it alone.<br><br>It's like a video game boss where a whole group of players takes him down but the one a-hole who gets the last hit takes all the credit.</p>		</li>

			<p>What about fish? I've always wondered the same question, but with fish since a popular 'science experiment' in high school is to use liquid nitrogen to freeze a fish, then watch it unthaw in water and be perfectly fine. </p>		</li>

			<p>how long does it survive for? if I come back a few hours will it still be alive? a few days? was it frozen right through, or just the outside?<br><br>boom, mitigating factors!</p>		</li>

			<p>your experiment sounds sketchy<br><br>however there are antarctic fish that have basically evolved antifreeze for blood<br><br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/science/antifreeze-proteins-keep-antarctic-fish-alive-and-icy.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/23/science/antifreeze-proteins-keep-antarctic-fish-alive-and-icy.html</a><br></p>		</li>
