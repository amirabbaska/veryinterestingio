			<div class="markdown"><p>A little of bit of correction. A human ejaculation contains sperm in millions an NOT billions.  If a male has 20 millions or more, the sample is good.
Often man with infertility problem / low sperm count freeze their sperm and their sample often has only  a couple millions of sperm, in extreme cases only a few thousand or even just a few hundreds. ( source is 10 yrs of fertility treatment due to male factor)
I do not know statistic of the proportion of thawing succes of sperm, but. I think it is way more than  1% .
Also fertility clinics often freeze empryos , often at the 5-6 days old blastocyst stage ,when it has thousand of cells already.
Different clinics have different success rates, but good clinics have very high thawing success. For example this one claims 69% of frozen embryos survive the thawing process.
Moreover the thawing success strongly depend on the grade ( normality of the embryos) and high quality embryos have as high as 90% thawing success rate.

			<div class="markdown"><p>My kids were graded excellent quality at their embryo tic stage :)</p>
<p>In any case embryo grading is a beauty contest. They have no idea of genetic material, so they grade based on looks: how symmetric the embryo is, how many cell it has etc.</p>
<p>Natural selection still come to play even if the embryo was created in a dish. Embryos that actually have abnormal genetic material most likely will stop developing at some point. They may not attach to the womb, or miscarried at early stages.
Very few of the lab created embryos actually develop al, the way to became babies.
However those which end up being born statistically only have marginally higher genetic defect then the rest of the population, and only if ceirtain procedure was done called ICSI. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very close, the glycerol prevents ice crystals (true) but dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is necessary to create a more permeable cell membrane which prevents the cell membrane from rupturing during the freeze/thaw process. It doesn't have to be as cold as liquid nitrogen, -80C is cold enough.</p>
<p>Single/individual cells like sperm and stem cells are easy to get the glycerol to coat the cells. But multicellular organisms it's impossible to get all the cells coated at once, and super fast, with glycerol/DMSO.</p>
