			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes and no. There is age related vision deterioration that does get worse with time. Changing focus gets slower with age,  adapting to different light levels also gets slower with age. Then there's age related cataracts, which can be removed but can also come back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My late husband had cataracts.  He had them removed and they implanted corrective lenses rather than just a regular lens.  He had to wear glasses for reading and driving but gee, he could wake up and see fairly clearly after years of horrible eyesight.</p></div>		</li>
