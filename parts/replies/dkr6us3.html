			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have only one listening station, you get a sphere of possible locations.</p>
<p>If you have two stations (distant from one another), you get the intersection of two spheres (a circle) of possible locations.</p>
<p>Repeat the process for three stations and you get down to two possible points. But one is in space and the other is underground, so you don't really need a fourth station to deduce where it is.</p>
<p>Then you use trigonometry to find the depth and coordinates of the origin point and you're done!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I lied, you look at the differences between the S and P waves to calculate depth; this makes sense and both waves will have different velocities, so how far apart they arrive should give you a depth. <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/determining_depth.php" target="_blank">https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/determining_depth.php</a> (I am a mining geophysicist, so usually earthquakes aren't what I'm looking at)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still just triangulation: the waves aren't originating on the surface, they're from where the earthquake occurs. They usually project it to the surface. I'll try to find a picture, I'm still at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A dense material has less distance between atoms. A shockwave moves molecules until they hit another molecule. That molecule then moves in the same direction. It's much like billiard balls. The shorter the distance between molecules the faster the movement travels. It's an easy thing to observe if you put a few hard balls in a level trough or channel.</p>
<p>This example takes 14 balls if the balls are 3 inches in diameter. They all have to be identical in size, shape and weight for consistent results. </p>
<p>First place five balls a foot apart with the last ball a foot away from the end of the trough. Perhaps use an object at the end so you can tell exactly when the last ball hits it. Hit the first ball hard enough for the chain reaction to cause the last ball to hit the target. Measure the time it takes. Do it a few times so you can become consistent with how hard you hit the first ball and can get a consistent result.</p>
<p>Now put enough balls in the trough to cover the exact same distance as the first experiment but with the balls an inch apart and the last ball an inch from the target. Hit the first with the same force as the you did when you got consistent results from the first test.</p>
<p>The second test will have a much shorter time between hitting the first ball and when the last ball hits the target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As one looks very microscopically or at quantum levels, does the speed of the shockwave eventually depend on some function that includes the speed of light?  I would think it must since particle interactions have to depend on this at some point... I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually /u/arbentor isn't entirely correct. Density isn't the only factor which contributes to velocity through a medium. In gases and liquids, bulk modulus is also taken into account and for solids both bulk and shear modulus are taken into account. In reality, velocity actually decreases with increasing density but you see a jump in value say between speed of sound through air and speed of sound through water because the bulk modulus is so much greater in water. One fairly intuitive example is with helium and sulphur hexafluoride. When you breath in helium and talk, your voice goes up because helium is less dense than air, the sound travels faster which makes your voice higher. Opposite is true for sulphur hexafluoride.</p>
<p>A good example of the difference in velocity of liquid and solid of varying density is also explained in good detail <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/101895/why-does-sound-travel-faster-in-iron-than-mercury-even-though-mercury-has-a-high" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a point on the speed of sound through materials. it probably generally true that density determines the speed of sound. But lots of other factors effect the speed of sound.</p>
<p>Iron has a speed of sound of 5120 m/s and a density of 7.874 g/cm3.</p>
<p>Beryllium has a density of only 1.85 g/cm3 and a speed of sound 12,890 m/s</p>
<p>Also ,diamond: 3.515 g/cm3 18,350 m/s (</p></div>		</li>
