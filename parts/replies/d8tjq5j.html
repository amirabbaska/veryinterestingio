These types of detectors (hetero-photo-transistors, if anyone is curious) are super hard to tune but I guess if you put enough space junk in a big open space eventually it will sort itself out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am impressed on a near daily basis with the human sensory apparatus. I'm an audio engineer, and hearing is perhaps even more impressive than eyesight: A loud sound is about a million million (10^12) times greater than that of the weakest sounds. Vibrations of the ear can be as small as 10-8 mm or smaller than a hydrogen atom!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only sorta amazing.  We have sensors that can do that.  What's much more amazing is that it can do it, and then go on to operate normally and not go to complete rat shit in daylight.  We're talking about a sensor that can operate with high precision and reliability over something like 12 to 15 orders of magnitude (or more?  somebody smarter than me can work out the math). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on from military experience. Cigarettes can be seen from ~3 miles away, and ~6-8 miles away with night vision goggles. This is the final point where you can actually make it out as something rather than it blending into the surrounding area, and is during perfect conditions with no light pollution. </p>
<p>While there was a myth forever that Lucky Strike cigarettes got their name from this, the phrase was taken from those cigarettes which were popular at the time. The phrase &quot;A Lucky Strike&quot; was in reference in snipers during WW2 (and WW1 as well, although it became a thing during WW2) getting kills because of the amber of cigarettes at night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Lucky strike&quot; is a mining term. That's how's Lucky Strike cigarettes got their name. The brand was created in 1871, well before the world wars.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should have said Lucky Strike tobacco. It was originally a chewing tobacco brand, so obviously nothing to do with striking matches or lighting cigarettes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone wondering the real story, half a minute on google turned up this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The founder of Luckies was inspired by the era's rush for gold searching. Only some of the gold diggers (about four out of 1000) were fortunate enough to find gold and this was often referred to as a lucky strike. By choosing this expression as the product's name, it meant consumers who were choosing the brand were lucky, as they were choosing a top-quality blend.</p>
