			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on the track. If electronic artists intend to include elements that take advantage of soundstage and depth, open-backs will compliment them nicely. Closed-backs are more often recommended for people who listen to that kind of music though, due to the fact that closed-backs have better bass response to compliment the genre, and don't necessarily need a wide soundstage. Imaging on the other hand, the perceived direction of certain sounds, is still a big element in electronic music. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Open and closed-back refer to the nature of the enclosure. Open-back headphones allow for airflow between the outside of the headphone and the driver. Closed-back, as the name suggests, closes it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HD 518 and 558's have the same drivers as the HD 598, differing in their enclosures. I would recommend the 558s. It can be bought for cheaper and can be modded to sound nearly identical to the 598s. Look up the foam mod.</p>
<p>Also look into the SHP 9500S. They go on sale for $50 or under quite often, and some say are onpar with the Sennheisers. Zeos has a really good review of them on Youtube. </p></div>		</li>
