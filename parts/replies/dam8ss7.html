The binding of chemokines and other signals to receptors are thought to cause changes in the cytoskeletal organization that orient actin microfilaments to produce pseudopodia or little projections of the WBC, moving the cell towards the highest concentration of signaling molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With recent research into cancer cell attachment, these processes have actually become quite well understood. There are obviously still some missing puzzle pieces, but we've managed to put together amazing models of exactly how cells move in response to signals. It's beautiful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the specifics of WBC chemotaxis, but to add to the chemotaxis and gradient tracking discussion I can provide a brief description of how E. Coli cells are able to move up gradients of attractant and down gradients of repellant. E. coli moves in biased random walks through the use of flagella which are capable of turning in two directions, clockwise and counterclockwise. When the flagella are all spinning the same way, the cell moves in a straight line called a &quot;run&quot;. When one or more of the flagella start to spin the opposite direction, the cell turns around randomly, a process called a &quot;tumble&quot;, until the flagella start spinning together again and another run starts. These runs and tumbles make up the random walk. The bias comes from the cell signaling pathways that control the direction of rotation of the flagella. When the cell is moving toward a food source, or away from something harmful, the length of the runs is increased and the frequency of tumbling is decreased. To put it briefly, the direction of rotation of the flagellar motor is controlled by the phosphorylation of certain internal molecules, which is controlled by cell surface receptors which bind to external molecules. There are also some feedback loops that allow these signalling pathways to be robust. This is a very simple model organism but other types of chemotaxis are likely to use some forms of biased random walks. (Student here btw).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Bacteria do that because they're too small to effectively sense a concentration gradient without moving.  Amoebas and mammalian cells can chemotax straight up a gradient without random-walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is most likely not mediated via transcriptional changes, as these would be a) too slow, and b) not easily directed. What actually is assumed to happen (this is still apparently not completely resolved in the case of eukaryotes), is that the external gradient of chemokines is sensed via specific receptors that span the cell membrane, or, more precisely, not the gradient is sensed, but those receptors with stronger binding are activated more strongly. This causes a secondary intracellular signal gradient (likely via  PIP3), which in the end leads to polymerisation of aktin filaments into the direction of the gradient, towards which pseudopods (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopodia#/media/File:Chaos_carolinense.jpg" target="_blank">little feet of the cell</a>) are formed. I would speculate that some form of lateral inhibition is involved here (the side of the cell that detects some chemokines inhibits surrounding or contralateral receptors) which would amplify the signal. Sometimes this motility can be mediated via cilia, however, leukocytes do not have cilia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what is their actual source of movement? I'm assuming blood cells don't actually think &quot;shit! We got one! I'm coming!&quot; and head that direction. So it it purely a chemical reaction the draws them to the target? Like this gradient is released and they naturally just find the strongest source of it. Like mold finding a damp place to grow? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically there are chains of amino acids called epitopes that are recognized by proteins/antibodies presented by your immune cells that are able to differentiate between your cells and foreign cells. If they see foreign epitopes, they release chemokines/cytokines (attracting, activating, or even deactivating other immune cells/pathways) and phagocytose what it's attached to, then trim the surrounding residues off. Then they present that epitope to other cells, activating them, which in turn releases more chemokines/cytokines and thus creates an immune reaction pathway.</p>
<p>The chemokines/cytokines are extremely specific - it's not just one marker that attracts all your immune cells and wherever there's the most marker is where the cells where go. It's more of a &quot;hey I found this type of parasite so we should have the Th1/2 helper cells come over here and help activate the local Eosinophils and Basophils for our anti-parasite response&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that's true... For example, when you read a murder mystery novel, that doesn't mean the book is beyond possible understanding. It just means that we haven't figured out how it works yet, which if we're talking about life, is largely true.</p></div>		</li>
