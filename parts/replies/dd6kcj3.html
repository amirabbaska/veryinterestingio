			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more of a question of axioms than practicality. Why is 2 defined as 1 + 1? Couldn't we swap 2 and 3 as digits, so 1+1 = 3 and 1+3 =2?</p>
<p>And the answer is &quot;because we decided to make that the way we do things and if you want you can substitute any other set of 10 symbols to use as digits and write in base 10.&quot; Rearranging is confusing to us but not really problematic to math in general. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Symbols are just arbitrary.  What I hope OP's student is getting at is why does the Platonic concept of 1, added to the Platonic concept of 1, equal the Platonic concept of 2?  You could say 一 + 一 = 二 if you want (although the Chinese numerals make it just a bit too easy if you ask me, while not being any less arbitrary).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you hold up two pencils and say &quot;1+1=2&quot;, you are really saying a statement about the cardinality of the union of two disjoint sets of one element each. This is subtly different to saying about the natural numbers with addition. Distinctions like this become more pronounced when we consider the infinite. I.e. infinite as a number of things (cardinality), the 1st, 2nd, 3rd... infinite-th thing (ordinal numbers) and infinity as a &quot;number&quot; (limits of sequences) are all very different objects.</p></div>		</li>
