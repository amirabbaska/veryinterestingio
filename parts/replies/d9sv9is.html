			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool to understand some of the biology.  My daughter had a pet snail that escaped and we thought the dog at it.  About 2-3 months later we found on the back of a picture frame.  My wife put in a shallow dish of water and in an hour it started moving around again. Amazing that it can survive that long without food or water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An operculum is a structure that covers and closes a cavity. Many fish have an operculum that covers and closes their gills.</p>
<p>And thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea. Bought it in chinatown for my ex and I think they do it for some reason to keep them alive longer. Not sure. The bastard is still alive and he stinks. I gotta clean the cage every couple days. I wish he would just die and maybe my ex too for making me take care of this thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wonderful world of terrestrial snails gets even more bizzare when you look at their mating habits. These are creatures that shoot calcified missiles into each other as a pre mating ritual. They are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_dart" target="_blank">love darts</a>. Take a close look when you find an intertwined mating pair and you often spot them sticking out .</p></div>		</li>
