			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that for sure. The swallows currently living on my balcony trade places in the nest a couple times an hour and as one flies in to feed the babies the other sees it and gets ready to take off and get out of the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not nearly to the degree as humans though. I will look for it, but a while back I read something about how humans evolved such variance in our faces compared to other animals. It's due to how hyper-social we are. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I am a feline artist. I've sculpted and painted hundreds of cats at this point. I can now discern the tiniest details in cats' faces. I'm pretty sure I could pick out any cat I know from a clowder of similar cats by merely looking it in the face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think cats and dogs do have a great deal of facial variation but weâ€™ve been artificially selecting them for centuries in ways that have increased that variance. Not sure how well we can compare to natural populations of animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like gorillas and chimps look different facially. I've wondered if it's because they're more human like that I notice it or if it's because they're actually more distinct. </p></div>		</li>
