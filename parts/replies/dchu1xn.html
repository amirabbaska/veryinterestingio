			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common choice is silicon, but other chemistries are used as well, such as Gallium Arsenide (for higher efficiency, but at higher cost, typically for space or military applications) and Cadmium Telluride (lower efficiency, but lower cost and thinner/more flexible). (Thanks to /u/malachi410 for the correction!) <del>such as Gallium Arsenide and Copper Indium Gallium Selenide are used to create some of the more high-performance panels.</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe CIGS and CdTe thin film solar cells are less efficient than crystalline silicon cells.</p>
<p>GaAs cells are definitely higher performance but super expensive.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice ELI5 but just a little conceptual error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atom<del>s</del> <strong>cores</strong> are positively charged and to make them neutrally charged, negatively charged electrons surround them. They &quot;orbit&quot; the atom<del>s</del> <strong>cores</strong> at different energy levels. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A charged (positive or negative) Atom is called an Ion. The unit we call &quot;Atom&quot; includes the electrons orbiting the core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so ashamed. I was focusing on trying not to be too technical and stay in ELI5 mode rather than askscience and made a little blunder in terminology. Haha</p>
<p>At that point I was trying to decide if I should leave it at &quot;orbit&quot; or start going into orbitals and shells or discussing the lattice structures or anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Solar panels have a crystal panel that the light shines on, and inside there is a lot of circuitry which is connected to a battery or energy storage device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solar panels are not necessarily connected to an energy storage device, although they can be. The majority of home rooftop solar systems, as well as power-plant-scale solar farms, are just connected directly to the electricity grid. For rooftop solar, policy depends on the region, but customers are compensated (or their electricity bill is reduced) for the electricity they generate, and continue to be charged by the utility for the power they provide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are all connected to some energy storage device to <strong><em>some</em></strong> extent. Some are just better than others. The energy flows into something and it is either immediately used (lightbulb), stored for later (battery), connected to the energy grid and stored / used elsewhere, or its connected to its own circuitry which will then store the energy in its own materials, which could radiate it away as heat.</p></div>		</li>
