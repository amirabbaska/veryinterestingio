<p>And it is probably one of plants DNAs.</p>
<p>Human chromosome 1 is 250Mbase. </p>
<p>There are probably longer chromosomes, I amsure NCBI, EBI or that japanese website that always comes out when you search for nucleotide ids have the option to order results by length</p>
<p>This looks like the largest chromosome:</p>

<p>6th chromosome of wild emmer wheat, a relict crop found nowadays only in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>841 Mbase. In daltons, x650 = 547 Gigadaltons, or, answering original question, x100 = 84 billion atoms. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Only if you exclude crystals, otherwise the biggest molecule by far is a rock somewhere. Whether or not crystals count as molecules depends on who you ask. According to the IUPAC's definition, it is. According to many textbooks, crystals don't count.</p></div>		</li>
