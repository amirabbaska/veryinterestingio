			<div class="markdown"><p>When it's cold, blood vessels constrict to keep more of your heat around your central organs. Your normal skin has plenty of blood flow going to it, so a little constriction doesn't cut off all the blood. However, scars have very little blood flow since scar tissue is mostly a dead region of protein. When it's cold and you constrict what little blood flow they have, they turn purple or white since there's no red blood cells going there anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume them turning white is due to the fact that when it's cold blood is pulled away from extremities so the area especially around a scar would have less blood around it. Just a guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scar tissue has much worse blood circulation than surrounding tissue. People with poor circulation will have this problem as well, some people have their entire hands turn ghostly white.</p></div>		</li>
