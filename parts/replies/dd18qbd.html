			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems difficult to imagine. Octopi are supposed to be one of the most intelligent animals, but autonomous limbs (i.e. a non-centralized nervous system) is something I tend to associate with rather less mentally complex animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know octopi is the incorrect plural for octopus. It is a Greek base not Latin. The traditional plural for octopus is octopodes however you can also use octopuses or octopus. It all depends if you are referring to multiple different species or just multiple octopus with in the same species. I am on my cell at the moment but I can I cite sources later if you want!<br />
Have a great day!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer to anglicize foreign words. We say Pair-iss, not Pa-Ree. Octopuses, although the need rarely arises. Or pulpo, pulpi. Done.</p></div>		</li>
