			<div class="markdown"><p>What level of students are we talking about here?</p>
<p>The idea is that quantum particles are indistinguishable from one another. Meaning that if you exchange two particles of the same kind, nothing should change in the observed behavior. Since the observed behavior depends on the square of the wavefunction this means that Psi(x1,x2)\^2 = Psi(x2,x1)\^2 (with x2 and x1 being locations of the two particles).</p>
<p>The square of these two wavefunctions is only the same if Psi(x1,x2) = +Psi(x2,x1) or Psi(x1,x2) = -Psi(x2,x1).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Both kinds of particles exist, the particles with Psi(x1,x2) = +Psi(x2,x1)  are called bosons. (photons, Higgs particle etc.)</p>
<p>Particles that obey Psi(x1,x2) = -Psi(x2,x1) are called fermions (electrons are part of this group).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However if you have two fermions at the same spot x1=x2=a then you get Psi(a,a) = - Psi(a,a) and this is only true for Psi(a,a) = 0. In this case Psi(a,a)\^2 = 0 and so the probability of two identical fermions that you cannot distinguish from one another being at the same spot is 0.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's why two fermions being located at the same spot have to be distinguishable by at least one quantum number.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can also see that for bosons at the same spot x1=x2=a, it has to hold that Psi(a,a)=+Psi(a,a). That is always true anyway, so you do not get any exlusion principle for bosons and they can all share the same lowest energy state.</p></div>		</li>

<p>More importantly, I cannot thank you enough for your comment. This was most illuminating and easily understandable and I can now say that I understand Pauli's Exclusion Principle. </p>
<p>Can you please, also comment on the uncertainity principle in a similar way?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're using the square modulus in QM, so this statement would be true for any complex phase factor, not just +/- 1. The fact that only + and - are associated with 3d particles is, <del>as far as I understand, an</del> <em><del>empirical</del></em> <del>fact, not</del> a necessary  mathematical implication of <del>indistinguishability. So there is still some &quot;it just is that way&quot; left.</del>  the exchange operator being an involution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the answers are going to be because experiments behave in the way you expect if the Pauli exclusion principle is correct.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important. I don’t want to discourage “why” questions but sometimes asking why gets people confused about something that otherwise has a ton of application. </p>
<p>Orbitals exist. It makes oxygen greedy, carbon slutty, and nitrogen explody. As a result, you are here to learn about orbitals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are asking &quot;why does the universe behave this way&quot; then I would agree, the only correct answer is &quot;because it does&quot;. But you can still answer &quot;why&quot; with mathematics. A theory isn't powerful if it describes what experiments show, it's powerful if it <em>predicts</em> what experiments show. The existence of bosons and fermions and the Pauli exclusion principle are not imposed on quantum mechanics. Postulsting just a few axioms implies the Pauli exclusion principle. We don't have to assume the Pauli exclusion principle, or rely on experiments, we can show why it must be true based on some (hopefully intuitive) assumptions. This gives you a way to explain &quot;why&quot; under the framework of quantum mechanics. Of course, that's not the same as answering why the universe is the way it is. We had to assume the postulates with no proof that they describe how the universe really works, and they were still motivated by empirical results. But it still gives us a way to give intuition, which is already infinitely better than saying &quot;it just is&quot;. That Feynman video explains that there is a limit to how much you can ask &quot;why&quot;. That doesn't mean you shouldn't ask. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a proof in relativistic quantum field theory called the spin statistics theorem which explains that this behavior is connected to the fact that fermions have half-integer spin.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s turtles all the way down—one can ask why quantum field theory is a used, and the answer is that it’s a good model for describing many aspects of the universe. That’s always the fundamental best answer for “why” when it comes to science. </p></div>		</li>
