			<div class="markdown"><p>That's already confirmed; one of the previews had journalists construct a robot using the two Joycons, then steer it with the touchscreen through a covered maze to find a toy.  The only way to explore the maze was with the view from the right joycon's camera shown on the touchscreen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He wasn't in a real maze, so what do you think he was pointing the ir camera at?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the car has little reflective targets (the same reflective stuff the piano and robot use). You'd be tracking the IR view of the targets, so it'd be a lot different then a straight up view from a small camera. It's like night vision, according to the Telegraph article. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would increase the cost of joy con's, and I'm guessing they think 1 is enough. Or at least a decent compromise between functionality a lot of users won't use and cost that everyone will have to pay. </p></div>		</li>
