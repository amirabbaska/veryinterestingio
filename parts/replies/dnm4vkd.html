			<div class="markdown"><p>Those thoughts used to freak me out a bit, then one day I just thought, fuck it, I'm not doing this crazy shit, so why does it matter. Just let the idea play out. Yeah, so what if I did take this knife and kill every baby in the room? This is what it'd look like, the sequence playing in my mind. It'd be horrific, people would scream, someone would call the cops. Yeah, it'd be crazy, an adrenaline rush for sure.</p>
<p>But then I smile, get on with what I was doing and the thought just fades away. If you don't feel any guilt whatsoever about it, if you even let yourself entertain the idea because there are some fun elements to it like watching a horror movie, then it stops being so terrifying and it starts just being ridiculous and laughable.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason to feel guilt about things that happen in your brain if you're not acting on it. No one is sitting there watching your thoughts and judging you, no one is going to realize you thought them, no one is going to &quot;catch on&quot;. Maybe there is a small reality to them - if you actually wanted to, you could let that idea play out for real. But you never would. Not even drunk, not on your worst day. It's just a stream of consciousness and a lot of it you can't pretend to control.</p>
<p>Most of our lives we're going to have to live with not acting out all the weird thoughts we have and not give in to strange impulses. That's just life. We're known by and judged by our actions, not our thoughts. Take solace in the fact that you are the only one who knows what's going through your mind and come to terms with the fact that you'll never entertain these thoughts for real, and in a lot of ways they might be a lot less dreadful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intrusive thoughts man, they're crazy. Just the other day I thought, while driving up to an intersection what would happen if I just rolled through a red light. What are the odds I'd make it though without hitting anyone? Would I get badly hurt or kill someone? In the end I just came to a stop, made a left hand turn and grabbed a beer with a friend and watched some crazy football games. </p></div>		</li>

It's so terribly, nightmarishly wrong that it fascinates me a little and sort of entertains me in a horror movie kind of way. I bet you can guess what I imagine...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my husband first started having mental health issues related to anxiety, he was worried that those intrusive thoughts he was having meant he was, for lack of a better term, crazy. When he told the doctor at the emergency room that he had repetitive intrusive thoughts that something bad could happen, they put him on a 72 hour suicide watch. My question is-in someone with a mental illness, are intrusive thoughts seen as a threat to yourself or others, even when you don't act on them and realize that you won't?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean intrusive thoughts as in  &quot;<em>I can't control myself</em> and I'm going to do something bad&quot; or &quot;something bad is going to happen <em>to me</em> in particular&quot;? I would categorize the first scenario as a potential threat to others while the second would be more of a &quot;calm down and relax&quot; solution. Sadly, however, mental breaks, for lack of a better word, are often treated by a catch-all system with very little actual rehabilitation or genuine concern. It's gotten much more common recently to try and treat and validate mental illness, but more than likely, your husband was observed for 72 hours because of a standard procedure that may have been unnecessary, but is still a good practice just in case he was truly a hazard to himself. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a really good breakdown of what's happening. It feels gross to know your own brain is making up harmful scenarios like the car stopping suddenly so your straw goes in your eye and replaying it over and over and over. I agree it's your own brain running scenarios to try to train you to prevent them. Your dad's advice I love. My psychiatrist, at the beginning, would repay a little mantra: thought is not action </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem! If you have any questions feel free to ask.            </p>
<p>Also try not to think of it as &quot;your brain making up scenarios&quot; and more of &quot;your brain responding to external stimuli and asessing it&quot;.       </p>
<p>In a very straigthforward example it could be somebody straight up telling you to consider something. Your brain isn't going to discard that information.           </p>
<p>In less straightforward examples it could be very subtle cues. Hearing someone mention a song, can remind you of the music you had playing in your car, which can remind you you left your car lights on. The brain makes fast connections like that and if it hits a very important piece of info (your lights are on) it will emphasize it.          </p>
<p>Intrusive thoughts I believe can usually be traced the same way. Beeing in a theater could have reminded you of some movie you saw months ago with an intense scene of violence. Maybe even just being around a crowed of people was jarring.         </p>
<p>I sometimes see an ice cream shop and imagine a little kid getting his ice cream knocked from his hand and crying, which makes me really sad. My brain didn't make that up, it responded to the ice cream shop, maybe somtime 20 years ago I saw that exact thing happen in front of an ice cream shop, but rather than remember the specifics of when it happened, I mainly remember the emotions that came with it. The point is I didn't think about it because I enjoy it, I thought about it because I want to make sure it doesn't happen again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll be damned if that last line isn't the most helpful thing I've ever heard. I think that's the crux of it. When you circle the drain on a creepy thought like that it feels superstitiously like you will make it happen if you can't stop looking at it. It's less upsetting to think of it as a muddy recollection that's steeped in emotion. </p>
<p>How do you derail it though without medication? I feel like the more upsetting it is the harder I try to stop it and then the distress makes it more persistent. I know its something that has no universal answer but may I ask what you do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for this. My kiddos are still pretty young and occasionally a thought will pop into my head of them wandering into a pool, running into the road, choking on a snack, etc. I've always stressed that these final destination thoughts are negative and causing unnecessary anxiety. It's relieving to know that it's just my brain reassuring me that I'm a good parent for not letting those things happen. </p>
<p>I happy to have stumbled across this post when I'm awake in the middle of the night because I had a bad dream about something happening to my family. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys, I have anxiety, depression and OCD. There is no shame in seeking professional help or taking medicine. I have often thought, &quot;Am I being a baby by taking medicine? Do I just need to try harder?&quot;</p>
<p>Honestly, the medicine doesn't keep me from having the intrusive thoughts, but it helps me to move on from them, not dwell on them and not beat myself up for thinking them. All these wonderful, rational things you guys are saying, are true. My medicine helps me remember that :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I started on anti depressants, and after the initial side effects subsided, I'm feeling the most stable than I have in a long time. I had a healthy lifestyle with exercise and nutrition, but I still need the help of medication</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general this is great advice. I struggle a lot thinking if it's justified to ask for help, when I could just try and cope by myself. Things like: Are my problems major enough? Would asking help for them just annoy everyone?
Following that line of thought leads to me not being allowed to feel sad or ask help for anything. If you feel like you need help or support for something, it's big enough thing to ask help or support for.</p>
<p>Too bad I fail to follow my own advice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Think about it, would you feel annoyed if someone you love asked you for help? Of course not. Neither will they. It's so hard to take that step and get out of your own head, but it's so worth it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got ocd but it is extremely mild. I have a diagnosis but haven't really otherwise sought treatment.</p>
<p>Your second sentence is what I try to explain to people in those occasional times the ocd is bad. Mine tends to randomly manifest as hypochondria for the smallest thing. I'll have a small twinge in my back (probably just some muscle spasm) and for 3 days all I can think about is how I am probably dying of some kind of cancer and will probably fall over dead at any moment. </p>
<p>I know people with sever OCD live with such feelings all the time, and I can't imagine how hard it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. For a long time, I didn't take medicine because mine was primarily occurring during PMS. When it went away, I felt fine. That changed after I had kids, and it never went away. I went to my OB for a checkup, and when he asked how I was doing, I burst into tears. Having seen this thousands of times from new moms, he recommended medicine. </p>
<p>Looking back, I wish I had taken it sooner. It wasn't brave or strong to live a week out of every month struggling to control my own brain. The stigma around mental health issues just made me feel like medicine was for the weak. </p></div>		</li>
