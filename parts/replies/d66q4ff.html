			<div class="markdown"><p>According to relativity, you would have returned to Earth about 2000 years later relative to Earth time.  This is assuming that you've stopped moving for the 30 days after you've arrived at the planet.</p>
<p>Essentially, you've traveled 10 days to reach a planet that normally takes light 1000 years to reach earth, so by the time you've arrived at the planet, 1000 earth years will have gone by, even though you've only aged 10 days.  Stay for 30 days without moving, and nothing really changes.  Fly back to Earth another 1000 light years over another 10 days, to find that you've only aged a total of 50 days, while Earth has aged around 2000 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies if the following is stupid; am just seeking to understand. I imagined that the superluminal aspect of such travel actually meant just that. By arriving at the distant planet in just 10 days, there wouldn't actually be 1000 years that passed on earth. Those photons heading from the planet to earth are still traveling at c, and the reason one arrives faster is the folding of multidimensional space-time. So you 'jump' the space; the photons in transit are still on their merry way, and if you turn around and head back via the same superluminal travel mode, you'd get back to earth just 50 days later (even relative to earth). How am I thinking about this wrong? Thanks...</p>
<p>EDIT: after closer reading, it seems we're talking about two different scenarios - one superluminal, the other at relativistic speeds (sub-c). My bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, upon closer inspection, I don't believe I helped answer /u/JX3D97's question, either.  Yeah, the explanation I gave was specifically for sub-c speeds.  In the case of &quot;folding space-time&quot;, albeit not extremely knowledgeable on the theories, but I would assume that using a way to bend or fold space-time could take you from a point of origin to any place in the universe and back again at superluminal speeds.  This would allow you to move independently of space-time, therefore not actually being affected by the rules of time.</p>
<p>Also, about superluminal speeds, assuming you're restricted to space-time, I've found this insightful article:
