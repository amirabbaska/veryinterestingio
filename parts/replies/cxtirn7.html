			<div class="markdown"><p>Aging it longer doesn't always make it better. It can, but you need the right proof, the right casks, the right flavours, and you always need to be checking on it and changing casks as needed. As well, a company that sells whiskey aged 8 years is usually associated with a quality around the 8 year mark. If Jack Daniels had a couple casks that were 40 years old, that's cool, but you don't buy Jack Daniels to be aged for 40 years so overall it probably wouldn't be worth it for them as it wouldn't appeal to either their core audience or the high end crowd. Storing it in steel vats would stop the aging process, allowing them to sell it as their normal type, whatever that may be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, aging also means that some of your liquid is evaporating. If you don't stop the aging, you'll have a practically empty barrel.</p>
<p>Also, after touring a few of these places they do have a barrel that is extremely old. Normally they save one per year or something like that. One barrel in the scheme of things is nothing though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a home distiller I'll chime in. Alcohol aging has a perfect time limit. Aging longer than that produces off flavors. There's competeing chemical reactions going on and as it gets older different flavors form. Perfectly aged whiskey will have a small amount of acridity. Leave it too long and it's bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a distiller as well (pro) I'd say this is absolutely true. But also false as well. Wood, climate, pre use all are huge factors. I would age a whiskey for decades in a used re-charred French oak cask. A new unused #4 char american oak? 10 years max. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a man who buys a lot of whisky I'll chime in. This is true. However sadly we have trained the market to think older=better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the market. If you have huge demand for your 10 year line, but already have enough to satisfy demand for your 15 year line then aging the 10 year stuff is a waste. Better to keep it as 10 year ready for when you need more. </p>
<p>That's assuming there aren't chemical reasons you can't age it more as /u/Mobely suggested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the best answer here.  The short answer is they can't predict the future, so they do their best and then use various means to meet demand depending on how things turn out.  One thing you need to to consider is that a lot of whiskey is only aged for a few years and isn't as subject to these fluctuations.  Right now there is a bourbon shortage but it really only affects the ones that have been aged a lot (15 years, 23 years, etc.).  Some bourbons are aged for as little as three months.  So if there is a shortage of aged bourbon they can just raise the price of it and sell more of the cheap stuff.  Or they can eliminate and combine certain categories, for example phase out their 12 year aged whisky which they don't have enough of and start selling a 10 year aged whisky instead.</p></div>		</li>
