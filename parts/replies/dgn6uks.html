			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't done anything major. A couple audiobooks, some regional commercials, a few explainer videos... I'll be the AI in an upcoming indie game, which I'm excited about.</p>
<p>As for a YT channel, it's not something I've really thought about, but now I am. Thanks for the suggestion and praise!</p></div>		</li>
