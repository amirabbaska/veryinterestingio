			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. When painting looking to a 3D object, even if it's not moving and you are in a controlled environment where nothing changes, it's not simple to define shapes, color gradients, reflections, refraction, etc. </p>
<p>But when copying from a photography, it's already in 2D. The color shades are already well defined, the reflections and refraction is already calculated and your POV will not change.</p>
<p>So is much easier to notice (and even measure) the exact angle of a finger, the roundness of a ear, the refraction of a teardrop, the reflection of the subject's eyes, etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>color gradients</p>

<p>To add on to this, presence of shadows, perceived lighting color and so on can mean that the brain interprets one colour as a totally different one depending on context. Using a photograph would help the artist a lot in picking the correct shade for a particular place on the canvas. There was a comment on r/askscience a few days ago about this effect about this phenomenon, and <a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/optical-illusions-120401830739571-2/95/optical-illusions-4-728.jpg?cb=1227157374" target="_blank">this</a> picture from that thread explains what I'm talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, but what about art from later periods that wasn't created by copying photographs yet looks much more realistic than even the most revered Renaissance paintings?  </p>
<p>Take for example [this painting] (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Pisemsky_by_Repin.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Pisemsky_by_Repin.jpg</a>) by 19th century artist Ilya Repin, which was created from a live model. Even if we ditch the bias-inciting term 'photorealistic', it looks so much more <em>true</em> than OP's example. While that one looks like a <em>painting of a man</em>, this looks like a <em>man</em>. Clearly there must have been other developments that allowed for better realism besides photography?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is coming from fuzzy memory of an 8am art history class over a decade ago but I remember there was a period where mirrors and mock projectors were being used. I say &quot;mock&quot; because they weren't really what we think of as projectors today.   They were some kind of lenses and mirrors or something that could be positioned to project a view from one direction, to a wall to be painted.  For a time their use was shunned in the art world because it was considered &quot;cheating&quot;. But you'll start to notice certain things appearing in paintings like intricately folded table cloths with patterns morphed and folded over on themselves painted to exact proportion.  I can't remember if purposeful perspective alterations began after that or before it, but I believe that period influenced our understanding of representing perspective on a 2d plane, simply because it became easier to see exactly how a long corridor appears, when projected on a flat surface for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perspective on a 2D plane would be different from photorealism. I like to see comments here talking about something other than copying a 2D plane image because OP's post shows an example that could only be drawn from a flat photo. Anything less than photorealism is distortion and lost accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very likely that Repin used reference photographs for a portrait painted in 1880. Of course there are a few centuries of new technique development to manipulate the media, availability of better materials/pigments, a different set of expectations from art consumers as well as Repin's personal dedication to producing realistic representational art that distinguish this painting from OP's example. </p></div>		</li>
