			<div class="markdown"><p>It's this. It was way, way ahead of it's time in terms of how a film could tell a story.</p>
<p>If you look at 90 pct of the contemporaneous work it wasn't much more than a stage play played out on film with ornate sets.</p>
<p>Kane blows that away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched this movie as a teen and didn't really appreciate it. I watched it again a few weeks ago (inspired by a viewing of &quot;Shia LaBeouf Live&quot;), and was awestruck by the photography. I am an amateur, hobby photographer with enough understanding of the techniques to really appreciate what the film was offering. Everything from the dramatic use of lighting, to the use of depth of field, to the framing added meaning to the story. It's something that photographers try to do when they compose a photograph, and this is a whole film of those shots.</p></div>		</li>
