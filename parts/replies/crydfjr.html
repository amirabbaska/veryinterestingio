			<p>There is a guy, Guido van der Werve, who did exactly this. He stood on the north pole and rotated slowly for a whole day, thus staying in (or at least facing) the same time zone. There is a video of it at the Hirshhorn museum.</p>		</li>

			<p>Technically this is incorrect. If we really want to stay at the same time  indefinitely, we would start standing still at the pole, and very slowly have to spiral outward over the course of 13,000 years, then spiral back in during the following 13,000 years. In the middle we'd be zooming around the earth pretty damn quickly.<br><br>If we don't spiral then we're still changing the time of day with a 26000 year cycle as the earth's rotational axis precesses. </p>		</li>

			<p>No matter what you do on Earth, you're moving at Earth speed (S) around the Sun (D) and experiencing a change in time in reference to the rest of the Universe.<br><br>Since we're being &quot;technical&quot; :)</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, I do a ninja flip that rotates my head at the exact velocity of our relative motion to the cosmic background microwave radiation so my brain is at rest relative to the rest of the universe for an moment. It is awesome.</p>		</li>

			<p>Most plausible if you're doing so on your pirate spacecraft while in the midst of inter-galactic space. Appears to be within your abilities. Seems legit.</p>		</li>

			<p>upon further research it appears I must move my brain at .1% the speed of light or 800k mph if on earth, that would probably kill the brain.  :(</p>		</li>

			<p>isn't the point of relativity that there is no &quot;rest of the universe&quot; and that every reference frame is valid.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have to disagree and be pedantic - you'll be oscillating at least slightly since the earth spins.  You'll be moving at least a few feet in comparison to the sun.</p>		</li>

			<p>The earth's rotational axis is not on a simple 26k year cycle. Per <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#Movement_of_the_Tropical_and_Polar_circles" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude#Movement_of_the_Tropical_and_Polar_circles</a> the principal long term fluctuation has a 41k year period, with lots of shorter overlapping fluctuations, too. Since we're being technical ;-).</p>		</li>

			<p>Even that is technically incorrect!  OP said timezone so really we should be changing speed based on geopolitical timezone boundaries instead of (or in addition to) this depending how timezones are defined over time.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hirjd" target="_blank">hirjd</a>
			<p>Even that wouldn't work. Anything within a timezone has the time of that zone no matter how fast it moves. A beam of light shot west across the timezone will arrive at the west edge after it crossed the east edge in local time.</p>		</li>
