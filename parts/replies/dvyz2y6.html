A couple hours of quiet where people turn things off and don’t travel briefly in exchange for some really cool images of the Paris Underground and lots of international attention/coverage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's a terrible idea. It relies on telling Parisians to shut up for a minute or two. In fact it's involves asking Parisians to do anything other than be Parisians. They'll just tell you to fuck off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that you'd need a shit tons of roombas and not only flying ones, but also roombas that can do stuff like slip through small cracks and dive underwater since they are submerged part/collapsed tunnels.<br />
Also the matter of retrieving them since you can't expect a signal to work for long in the catacomb, but you also have no idea how far one tunnel can lead, you might be stuck after 50 metres, which make retrieving it easy, or follow a 10km long path and then it might aswell be considered lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably. A combination of indoor laser scanning and a good inertial navigation system (INS) would probably give a 3D model of the caverns. I think the major reason that's not been done is probably money, but I don't know for sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money is probably the main factor because in order to do it effectively you'd need more than one machine. You'd need to treat it like a network crawler in computer science, and spider out into the catacombs in all directions. I'm imagining a fleet of autonomous Roomba-like bots that do a few things: </p>
<p>1) scan the tunnels as they go and construct a living 3d map of the world.</p>
<p>2) maintain a wireless mesh network by dropping relays every time their connection starts to get weak, such as turning a corner. It can back up a few feet after realizing it's lost signal and then drop the relay, and continue on.</p>
<p>3) using a central control plane, the bots all work together on the mesh network to avoid places that have already been explored. They share their own sensor data back to the control plane, and a unified global map is maintained and shared back to the bots. Once a bot has explored a closed loop and has no new area to explore, it can be assigned a new unexplored path somewhere else; and since it already has the map it can know exactly how to get there.</p>
<p>4) depending on how extensive an operation this is, you could also have bots acting as mesh support, crawling the know network and swapping network relays that need new batteries. You could also use people for that part since you now have a map and can find your way back.</p>
<p>So yeah, money. That's a lot of equipment, custom software systems, robotic R&amp;D, and manpower to deploy and maintain it.</p>
<p>I might be a software engineer with experience dealing with fleet intelligence of robot networks :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A structure-from-motion system would even do a pretty good job of it using a simple video camera and an enormous amount of computer power.  Plus you get a totally awesome 3D map of the inside.</p>
<p>I'd agree that the LRF + INS instrumentation would do a better job though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called Dead Reckoning, and it's not very accurate over time because any error compounds. </p>
<p>You generally need a number of redundant sensors (uav swarms) and markers to do kalman filtering and curve fitting for an accurate picture without gps. It's a pretty complex engineering feat, but stuff that's actively being worked on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This exactly. If the accuracy of every step you take is based on the step you took before, with no way to sync up the data while you're gathering it, it's not going to end up as accurate as you want.</p>
<p>It would probably be accurate enough to get a half-decent mapping after some human adjustment, but it still feels like a bad solution to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a bit of reading, it sounds to me like they pick up all the returning signals, similar to traditional RADAR.  So if you send out a laser pulse and get back signals at 100', 130', 140', and 150', you can pretty safely assume that the distant target is 150' away, and that there is vegetation at the other positions.</p>
<p>I believe some clever math is used to determine from a series of measurements what the &quot;bottom&quot; object is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty solid answer, as the pulse penetrates it creates multiple X,Y,Z data returns. If you collect enough times the system can erase the first returns and use the last ones to see under objects. </p>
<p>For more look into LIDAR FOPEN.</p></div>		</li>
