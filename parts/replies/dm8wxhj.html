			<div class="markdown"><p>But in this case, they know there are 10 defects, so that's what they base their estimates on. We don't know there are x amount of organisms left to discover, it's just an educated guess, more or less, right? I understand they look at how many species have been discovered within a specific group so far, but that doesn't show how much is left. For instance, if I found a group of undiscovered lakes and throw out a pole in one of those lakes and catch two different fish, that doesn't mean there are going to be two new species in each lake. I would just be guessing that there are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the way it's done in astronomy is this: There's (for our purposes) a fixed, unknown number of asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter's orbits.</p>
<p>Say you make observations and locate 10 of them. Maybe all 10 were already known, maybe none were: You compare your observations with the orbital characteristics of the known asteroids, and find that 9 of them are new.</p>
<p>Then you repeat the next year, and out of 10 observed at random, only 5 were new. The following year, only 2. You can see that, as we identify a bigger and bigger fraction of them all, the rate of discovery from a random observation falls. From those falling rates, we can use statistic models to deduce what fraction of the total we've already discovered.</p>
<p>If biologists are able to estimate that they've only yet discovered 14% of organisms (I guess that's supposed to mean species?), that must mean that they keep finding and finding new ones all the time without straining too much!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct.  There are several models that assume the things people know follow the same patterns as the things people don't know.  With a bit of math and a good knowledge of what values are important, they can usually get a highly educated guess.</p>
<p>They can also use multiple models to make sure they basically agree in number.  One model is based on how many are identified versus unidentified. Another model is based on numeric regression, another model is based on linear regression, etc.  All the models tend to converge.</p>
<p>It isn't perfect, but it gives a reasonable estimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This still doesn't make sense to me. Can you please find a different analogy to explain? I get that the things people know follow the same pattern as the things we don't know. But wouldn't the rate be diametrically opposite then? The more we discover, the less we have to discover because in essence there is a finite number of organisms? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The guy is trying to explain what is likely a very complicated statistical model in laymens terms, it's not gonna be a perfect example and I think this was a poor example. The one about crimes is a much more accurate representation of what they're doing, although again, in layman's terms. </p>
<p>Just out of curiosity (and in no way am I trying to be offensive), have you ever taken statistics?  As someone who did and place a high amount of trust in them due to my experiences I have always wondered (but never asked) if people with (seemingly) lower levels of trust in statistics ever took a course, because I know HS doesn't require, which is a real travesty in my mind. Thanks for the response! </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's important to emphasize - its not like we're going to find a griffin or anything.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At its most basic level the definition of a species is the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring. There are of course exceptions, because there are <em>some</em> species that can produce fertile offspring together ***of a certain sex.</p>
<p>For example, we know that Donkeys and Horses are different species because if a Donkey and a Horse mate, you get a Mule (and Mules are infertile)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, our current taxonomic system is very outdated. It becomes very apparent once you start working with genomic data.</p>
<p>Especially in bacteria, it's been known for a long time now that they evolve too fast for the idea of &quot;species&quot; to be of any real value. Yet we still use the established system for a lack of a better one. </p>
<p>To answer your question: Yes, they are different species but of the same genus (i.e in Homo sapiens, Homo is the genus, sapiens the species).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question is difficult to answer because of the complexity of speciation. Often times it takes a combination of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to reproduction in order to say that the organisms have speciated. I believe a general rule is that if the two organisms can mate under natural circumstances to form fertile offspring due to lack of reproduction barriers (mating season differences, habitat location, incompatible genitalia, infertile offspring, etc.) then they are not different species or are in the process of speciation.</p></div>		</li>
