<p>Meaning if something falls into the event horizon, if we could see inside, from our point of view theoretically it should never reach the singularity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this like how we can never see an object the same refracted in a glass of water? We know the object is a certain size and shape, however when refracted, there is never an angle of perfect alignment? This may be the stupidest comparison, but I thought your quote was very intriguing and trying to make sense of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's more like a weird version of the Zeno paradox, where instead of a runner having to run consecutively smaller portions of a racetrack, he instead has to run increasingly &quot;longer&quot; portions of a track, since any distance traveled increases the amount of distance he has to travel. Replace distance with time (since they are proportional) and you realize why distance will never equal 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to think about it like an asymptotic line. </p>
<p>The distance the particle has to cover is represented by the length of the line in that segment. So if you have an asymptote that approaches 1 you can imagine when you go from .9 to .99 the length of the line is X. Then when you go from .99 to .999 the vertical component is longer, even though you only covered 1/10th as much horizontal distance. Going from .999 to .9999 the vertical component can be longer still, even though you only covered 1/10th of the previous horizontal distance. </p>
<p>From our outside point of view you max out at the speed of light in terms of your maximum speed, so ..... as the vertical part keeps getting longer and longer, up to infinity, then you basically start covering the horizontal distance toward the singularity more and more slowly.</p>
<p>The really interesting part is this means the 2 masses themselves actually have to have area as well. No two &quot;masses&quot; can share the same point in space. So where is the locus of mass? Where does it reside? It has to be distributed over space. Mass itself has to be some function of the interaction between things in different places. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does the time dilation increase into inifinity? Meaning, as you fell down towards the singularity and looked at the surrounding space shrink into a dot, you could see the end of the universe and time itself just before the dot completely disappeared?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you could magically survive the dilation, yes, from the perspective of a singularity the entire history of the universe whips by in zero seconds.  and from our external view, black holes are frozen in time, never aging, and same goes for matter that falls into it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no end of the universe and time itself. </p>
<p>Think about it. The universe used to be infinitely more dense than it is now, then it dissipated to where it is now. </p>
<p>If you had been alive back when it was infinitely denser, you would think &quot;now&quot; is &quot;the end of time and the universe&quot; right? If you conceptualized the universe dissipating until it became INFINITELY less dense, that would seem like &quot;the end&quot; to you. But it's clearly not the end....... it did dissipate till it became infinitely less dense, and here we are </p>
<p>Once it dissipates to infinitely less dense than it is now, it still won't have ended. Beings that live in that future time will just be infinitely taller than us, and infinitely less dense, but due to relativity they will just think of that as the new finite universe they live in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, i think it just turns into a string of pure energy and then forever travels toward the center, never interacting with anything. </p>
<p>I bet the energy coalesces into really really small galaxies and crap though. That's what free floating energy does in a pure vacuum with infinite time to just chill......</p></div>		</li>
