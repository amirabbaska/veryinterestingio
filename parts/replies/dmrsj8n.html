			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that SIDS may be linked to sleep apnea. Unfortunately, sleep apnea cannot be diagnosed after death, so those deaths caused by sleep apnea are considered death by SIDS. </p>
<p>Here is one paper pointing out a possible connection.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though not directly referred to as SIDS, the experiments by Harlow and Spitz in the 1940/60's showed that infants will die if they don't get enough socialization.</p>
<p>A baby with normal weight, healthy nutrition, and no medically diagnosed diseases or maladies will die if it is deprived of touch, talk, cuddles, play, and social stimulus.</p></div>		</li>
