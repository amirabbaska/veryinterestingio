<p>I) It is possible that a galaxy might start out as a chaotic cloud of matter with no discernible average angular momentum, but that over time it will inevitably evolve - at an increasing rate - towards some average angular momentum state?</p>
<p>2) Is case #1 probably the norm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is <em>always</em> a discernible (read: calculable) average angular momentum.  That determines in what plane the disc or ring will inevitably form.</p>
<p>If you replaced &quot;discernible&quot; with &quot;visually obvious&quot; you might be more correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>case #1 is the norm. If you look at galaxies every single one is either a disk shape, or an amorphous blob that happened because two disks hit each other (and projections all say will eventually form a disk eventually)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where are you getting this from? My lectures all suggested that disks are finely balanced structures, which eventually lose their balance due to interactions/mergers to form elliptical galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Centrifugal force is not erroneous, but only really makes sense to talk about in a rotating reference frame.</p>
<p>Let's say you are the Sun, and you are rotating in place such that the Earth is always directly in front of you. From this rotating frame it appears that the Earth does not move at all. Thus, there must be a net force of zero acting on the Earth. However, we know for a fact that the Earth is experiencing centripetal force due to gravity from the Sun. Thus, in a rotating reference frame centrifugal force acts outwardly and opposite centripetal force so that the resulting net force on the Earth is zero, and thus the Earth appears stationary.</p>
<p>And again, all of that is only the case when you are in a rotating reference frame. In an inertial reference frame centrifugal force doesn't exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a much better explanation, it's also important to note that even if they don't hit eachother, the gravity will pull both the orbits towards eachother on each close pass until they converge</p></div>		</li>
