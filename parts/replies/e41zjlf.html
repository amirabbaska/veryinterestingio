			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete costs a lot more, but it is significantly more durable. Around where I live, one of the interstates was made with concrete back in the 70s. They have to fill in a pot hole every now and then, but no major repairs have been required in the last 40 years. You'll never be able to say that about an asphalt road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But here in Canada, if any roads were made of concrete, they'd crack at least twice a year.</p>
<p>Sure, concrete is great, but our weather is stupid.</p>
<p>EDIT: My apologies, everyone here is telling me of many roads within Canada that are properly made and made of concrete. My knowledge pool was small, and I have learned from these responses. Except from the one guy who called me stupid. Fuck that guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the concrete roads I’ve ridden on have these annoying bumps for lack of a better phrase.  Seems like they are never as smooth as asphalt. You’ll notice this when crossing a large Bridge. The joints are massive and it’s not as pleasant a ride as smooth asphalt. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I know for certain that big rigs will sink through asphalt roads on hot summer days - used to work in a liquor warehouse and had a fully loaded rig deform our loading lot after it sat there for a couple hours while we unloaded it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use asphalt highways here in the north east. They hold up just fine to 18 wheelers as far as weight goes. The problem we run into is frost heaves. Basically water freezing under the road and pushing it up. Concrete turns into a crumbling mess in short order under such conditions where asphalts ability to stretch lets it last a few years longer before major work needs to be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the confusion
Not always, there are many types of concrete pavement.
One of which is continously reinforced concrete pavement (crcp)  this is a concrete pavement without joints you basically add a bunch of steel to handle all the stress concrete can't and boom jointless concrete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think you can because asphalt is rocks bound together with a tacky substance called bitumen, while concrete is rocks stuck together with a hard rock like arterial, cement.
Since the rock part is essentially the same, you would basically be mixing two binders with widely different proprieties and I don’t think that would come out good, depending  on  the ratio you might get cracked concrete or lumpy asphalt </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really since the properties of each are intrinsic to their composition. Tar is naturally flexible and so it needs to be present in large quantities to provide the needed flexibility. Likewise, concrete is very hard and weather resistant, which is where it’s durability comes from. Composites of the two would result in an overall weaker substance that fulfills neither role that the originals are best at. And it would probably be more expensive than either. It is much easier to have segmented concrete or continuous asphalt. There is a multitude of compositions available for both concrete and asphalt, so it is likely that a suitable material can be found without needing a composite. </p></div>		</li>
