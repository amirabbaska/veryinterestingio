			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two things at play, both relying on the Schwarzschild radius.  The first is that a black hole with the mass of the universe would have an event horizon (Schwarzschild radius) about the same size as our universe.  The second is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoop_Conjecture" target="_blank">hoop conjecture</a> says that if you compress a mass of matter down below its Schwarzschild radius, the increased gravity will continue to shrink that matter down until it forms a black hole.</p>
<p>The first one is just kind of a neat little fact.  The second one would seem to say the universe should be a black hole right now, but it doesn't apply because the universe is still expanding, and that overcomes the attractive force of gravity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but I'd guess they're playing fast and loose with semantics. In either that there are many sizes of infinity, or the difference between the universe and the observable universe.</p>
<p>Edit: this has been well answered above. I take it back. Sorry op</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the universe is all-encompassing, no matter how big or small you make it, it's still the universe. Think of it like being an orange. Now shrink that orange down to the size of a pea. It's still the same orange with all the same atoms that make it what it is. Just a little smaller. Now shrink the universe down past it's schwarzschild radius, it's still the same old universe, just smaller, and now also a blackhole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know the earth should be shrunk even smaller (less than 9mm radius). Its radius should be smaller than its Schwarzschild radius to call it a black hole.</p></div>		</li>
