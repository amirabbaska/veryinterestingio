<p>It is important to note that other factors may also be involved as triggers of thunderstorm asthma. </p>

<p>Now, that's not definitive of course, but it seems <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11493720" target="_blank">link</a> that ozone may be a more significant factor, as /u/hairybrain mentioned. It made for some nice reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another paper showing different information <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156336" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>Scientific articles -- especially those relating to health -- change rapidly. No one paper should be seen as the &quot;end all be all&quot; of an argument. It is much more likely that we are both correct and that ozone and pollen both play a role in Thunderstorm Asthma. Too often scientists try to totally disprove dissenting information rather then adding it into their own hypotheses.  </p></div>		</li>
