			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point to add; Ionizing radiation is, primarily, a stochastic dose-response relationship. That means exposure to ionizing radiation only has a statistical chance to cause adverse health affects (which is talking almost specifically about malignant cancers).</p>
<p>Dose matters, but at such negligible amounts it is statistically unlikely to cause any major health complications.</p>
<p>If you are curious about the allowable exposure levels check out NRC.gov, they have a list of regulations and explain exposure in detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, because the majority of a cell is NOT DNA, and therefore any destructive effects will likely just kill the cell or break apart that one specific molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Statistics are funny things.  If the odds are 1 in (some large number), and YOU are the one, none of those other people really matter. </p>
<p>I've gotten people to quite smoking by pointing this out.  They quote &quot;each cig takes four minutes off of my life&quot;.  I point out &quot;No, that's an average.  What you are doing with each PUFF (much less each cig) is playing Russian roulette with a gun with a few hundred thousand places in the cylinder; each one either kills YOU, or not&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if passing through you us the issue, remember that radio wave photons also pass through you all the time as well.</p>
<p>I find the fascinating part to be really thinking about the fact that nothing is solid; all matter is made of mostly empty space. Even atoms are just empty space with point particles interacting. We're not really solid as we imagine it; rather light photons are reflected by forces acting between atoms, and physical touch is just the forces between atoms in our fingers interacting with forces between the atoms of the other object, as in pushing same-pole magnets together. </p>
<p>In that context it seems obvious things will pass through us, but is weird to think of us as just zero volume points in space interacting with other zero volume points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matter is not actually made up of zero volume points. Quantum mechanics ruined that neat idea. (And actually, protons and neutrons are not zero volume anyway, since they're made up of interacting quarks.)</p>
<p>According to quantum mechanics - most relevantly, quantum field theory - matter is made up of interacting fields which extend throughout space. The &quot;points&quot; you mention are a phenomenon that occurs when field interact in certain ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that solidity of matter comes down to the exclusion principle between electrons.  The 'default' state of quantum entities is that they can all overlap; it is only the interaction of forces and the exclusion principle which work against this.</p>
<p>Neutrinos have no interaction with electrons, or indeed any other matter beside the probability of a weak force interaction (which is extremely low).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's wrong to say that ionizing radiation from naturally occurring radionuclides has no effect on our health, as it is a likely cause of random mutation and cancer. At best we can say that it's effect is uncertain, as we've yet to raise humans in the absence of radioactive isotopes. However, as K-40, C-14, and a handful of other isotopes have been present in the environment since before the beginning of life on Earth, it is safe to say that our bodies can deal with the radiation well enough to make babies and keep them alive til they make some babies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depends on what model you're using. threshold models shows us that there is almost/no effect under a certain amount of radiation as our bodies can repair the damage done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, any life expectancy after this could be considered a side effect of being able to produce the most viable offspring. Also being able to care for grandchildren would indirectly help select for longer life, if it meant the descendants were better able to make more viable offspring because of this.</p></div>		</li>
