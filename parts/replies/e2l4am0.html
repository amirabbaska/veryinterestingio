<p>Not exactly, the A through D cells were standardized at the same time, later the double A, triple A and quad A cells were standardized.</p>
<p>The A through D cells evolved from different manufacturers converging their cell designs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair they're trying to call it 4K, which does scale well - next 8, then 16 etc. Maybe in eight iterations we'll get to 1M! But the marketing people obviously wanted to go with <strong>ULTRA</strong> HD. Where are they going to go from there?</p></div>		</li>
