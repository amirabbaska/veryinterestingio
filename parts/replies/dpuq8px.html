<p>(This may just look like some dude's random blog, since he's just an &quot;independent science journalist&quot;, but if you read some articles you'll realize how painstaking he is about evaluating mountains of research, avoiding overgeneralization, and taking bias seriously)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, isn't being more flexible as a whole a good thing? I really don't care much for an effect on performance, I just don't want to be tight as I age. </p>
<p>Most of the older people I see seem really tight, inflexible, and have bad posture. My reasoning for doing static stretching has always been to try to avoid some of that. Am I wrong about this?</p></div>		</li>

<p>his answer is a clear &quot;no&quot;, and he's convinced me. Basically, what does it mean to &quot;be tight&quot;? It is really just the name of a feeling â€“ one of pain/discomfort associated with certain movements or positions. And the research described in that article indicates that stretching doesn't generally help with that pain/discomfort (for more than a few minutes anyway). See in particular this section for his argument that flexibility is not a useful general health goal in itself: </p>

<p>As to posture: the research he summarizes indicates that &quot;bad posture&quot; is not actually the result of inflexibility, nor is it even in general a significant cause of pain/discomfort:</p>

<p>This all contradicts what we've come to assume, but if you read through this guy's stuff, he is <em>extremely</em> careful about evaluating evidence and not leaping to conclusions, so I am inclined to be convinced by the conclusions he does draw. And its effect on me has been to finally just accept that sometimes I'm gonna be a bit uncomfortable, it's gonna get worse as I age but can be kept in check, none of it means that there's something profoundly wrong with my body, and there's a good reason that stretching and worrying about my posture for decades never did fuck-all to make my neck and shoulders ache less.</p>
<p>Incidentally there are plenty of things he cites positive evidence for benefits of, such as high-intensity exercise, resistance exercise, and mobilization drills. He wants people to spend their time on the things that actual deliver proven health results.</p></div>		</li>
