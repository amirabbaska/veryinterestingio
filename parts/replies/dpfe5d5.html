			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this one.</p>
<p>The center regions of the Milky Way, i.e. the area around Sagittarius A* (the supermassive black hole, SMBH), is densely populated with stars. </p>
<p>Before I go any further, a short word of caution! <em>Skip this part if you just want the fun stuff.</em> </p>
<p><em>We don't have strong enough telescopes to see anything more than the brightest stars in the area, especially if you're looking for spectroscopic data. If I remember correctly we can only really see up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification" target="_blank">A stars</a>. I know for a fact that most spectroscopic data up until recently was done on massive stars, i.e. mostly O stars and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star" target="_blank">Wolf-Rayet stars</a>. Most research assumes there is a broad distribution of star masses, even in the center. Still, papers like <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1993ApJ...408..496M" target="_blank">Morris et al (1993)</a> and <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/708/1/834/meta" target="_blank">Bartko et al. 2009</a> argue (using theory and observations, respectively) that the mass distribution is likely shifted towards the heavier stars.</em></p>
<p>OK! Now let's talk a little bit about what kind of stars are there. First; there are a lot. The region is one of the most densely populated in the Galaxy, which stands to reason given the massive gravitational force from the SMBH. </p>
<p>Second: There are both young and old stars. The distinction is important to a lot of the research about the region, as until the discovery of young stars close to the SMBH in the 1990s (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1990MNRAS.244..706A" target="_blank">Allen et al. 1990</a> and <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991ApJ...382L..19K" target="_blank">Krabbe et al. (1991)</a>), most scientists assumed tidal forces would prevent any stars from forming there at all. In other words, people assumed there could be no young stars. But then they were observed! So as is, a lot of the modern research is on the young stars and how they formed.</p>
<p>(To explain a bit further: one thought that the extreme conditions next to a large black hole would be unsuitable for star formation, as star formation generally happens when gas clouds fall in on themselves. Tidal forces from the SMBH would disrupt this, basically the black hole would rip any gas clouds apart. So the discovery of young stars in itself was a surprise.)</p>
<p>Since then there have been many seminal papers describing the region and the stars in it. Some particularly good ones: Ghez et al. 2003; Paumard et al. 2006; Lu et al. 2009; Bartko et al. 2010; Genzel et al. 2010; and Do et al. 2013. The short version is as follows: the old stars are everywhere, and their mass distribution follow a broken power law from Sagittarius A*. The young stars, on the other hand, seem to be largely on a disk with a sharp cut-off at roughly 0.5pc away from the black hole (<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/808/2/106/meta" target="_blank">Stostad et al (2015)</a>). </p>
<p>0.5 parsec = 1.63 light years, for reference. So all the young stars in the area are within roughly <em>one and a half light-years from a supermassive black hole.</em> </p>
<p>Let's put that into perspective, shall we? Remember, only O/WR and B stars have been spectroscopically confirmed, so we're just talking about the most massive stars. Let's add in old stars, too, which roughly double the number (still massively underestimating the total number, mind you). That means we have 400 stars in a volume of 1.63 light years cubed. </p>
<p>Alpha Centauri, the closest star to Earth, is about 4.3 light years away.</p>
<p>So let's go closer. The Oort cloud, the cloud of icy small objects surrounding the solar system, is roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud" target="_blank">0.8-3.2 light years from the Sun</a>.</p>
<p>So imagine the Oort cloud around us. Now, the Oort cloud is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud#/media/File:Kuiper_belt_-_Oort_cloud-en.svg" target="_blank">massive</a>, no way around it. But still -- imagine that ball around the Sun, and then fit 400 stars into it.</p>
<p>Yeah. </p>
<p>Now make that ball half the radius.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>400 stars!</p>
<p>It's insane. </p>
<p>And that's massively underestimating the total number of stars. The real number is much, much higher.</p>
<p>So to answer the first part of your question -- stars are everywhere near the center of the galaxy. They in general orbit the supermassive black hole, and in fact, seeing the stars orbiting around something we couldn't see is still one of the best pieces of evidence of the black hole actually being there. (Remember, you can't see black holes!) </p>
<p>Here's a very cool bonus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw" target="_blank">video</a> of some of the first stars we observed close to the black hole orbiting something unseen. (Note the scale here; the whole screen is about ~100 light days, or 0.3 light years wide.)</p>
<p>The second part of the question, about solar systems, I don't know much about. I'm assuming tidal forces would be too large to sustain planetary systems, but I haven't actually calculated it. The most challenging part, I'd believe, would be to form the planets at all, but at this point I'm guessing more than I'm doing rigorous science. Regardless, we're still far away from spotting any (potential and unlikely) planets, given that the center of the galaxy is so far away. Most exoplanets we've discovered are still much closer, and as far as I'm aware the only ones we've detected that are further from us than the center of the galaxy are ones detected by nontraditional means -- methods unlikely to work near all the light sources in the center.</p>
<p>In total, it's a really cool area full of stars and black holes and relativistic dynamics. Another, final, bonus: A gas cloud (or potentially a star, it's hard to tell) is supposed to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/star-hurtling-towards-massive-black-hole-may-seal-deal-einstein-s-theory-general" target="_blank">fall into, or at least right past, the black hole soon</a>. The observations we get from this kind of event is going to be incredibly useful for a whole host of theories, both about the region in general and relativistic physics. </p>
<p>Hope that helped!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this.  Since you inspired me, some forbidden layman speculation...</p>
<p>400 stars in 1.63 ly^3 , so.004 ly^3 /star, so .16ly average separation. That's 26.8 times closer than Alpha Centauri, so we'd expect the brightest star to be 26.8^2 = 722 times brighter.  That's 7 orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Ignoring everything about stellar distributions and shamelessly extrapolating from our night sky, that means if we lived there, we'd have...</p>
<ul>
<li>a handful of stars as bright as a bright ISS pass or maybe an iridium flash</li>
<li>on average, no stars anywhere near as bright as the moon.</li>
<li>dozens to a hundred or so stars as bright as Venus and visible during the day</li>
<li>hundreds of thousands of stars visible at night from an urban environment</li>
<li>mid-brightness stars about 10x as dense as the Pleiades across the entire sky</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting calculations! But you should take into account that these are mostly O and B stars, so much more luminous than Alpha Centauri. And, if you really want to see how dense this area is... Overall O and B stars form about 0.14% of main sequence stars. </p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned above there's reason to believe the mass distribution around Sag A* is very top-heavy, but if you shamelessly extrapolate that 0.14% -- let's up it to 1% in the area -- suddenly you have 20000 young stars. Add in the older stars and you've got 40000. </p>
<p>In retrospect I should have made it clearer how big of an underestimate the 200 number was. But would love to see your calculation with these numbers! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love to hear an astronmer's thoughts on it, but I would go download SpaceEngine and check it out yourself. As far as I know, SE does follow pretty close modeling as we know it.</p>
<p>As it is, it depicts galactic cores to be extremely dense (relatively speaking) with very hot, very heavy stars that are all orbiting Sagittarius A*. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Galactic_centre_orbits.svg" target="_blank">Here's a modeling of six stars we know of closest to the galactic core.</a> The tiny blob in the bottom right is our solar system, so you can see that having six stars in that proximity is very dense, especially since these stars are on the scale of 10-15 solar masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean stable solar systems? Binary systems are found even much further out in the galaxy. Usually star system won't have more than 2-3 stars. And they'd be stable in the sense I think you meant the word for millions of years. However distances involved would be of the order of light weeks and not lightyears between adjacent star systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does make me wonder what difference it would make to our scientific evolution if the nearest stars were this close to us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a factor for certain.  It is believed the galactic core has too much radiation from the relatively closely packed stars to permit something like life to form reliably.  Not to mention what happens when some of those stars go supernova.  That would really mess up the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Of course, there could be some sort of odd case here and there where a few Earths managed for form in all of that, but it is entirely possible that there are also none in there.  The spiral arms are very sedate places in comparison to the core.  The SMBH is really not even close to the biggest issue at that point, although it is the reason that conditions there are so extreme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we had a few dozen stars all within a few light weeks around us, how much brighter would the night sky be? As you get closer to the centre of the galaxy, would you eventually reach the point where it would be bright all the time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It entirely depends on what kind of stars, because they all have a different luminosity. Over 70% of all main sequence stars are red dwarfs. Those typically have a relatively low luminosity so you wouldn't see them in the night sky with the naked eye even if only 1 LY away. While class A and B stars can be seen dozens if not hundreds of LY away and some O and B type stars can even be visible to the naked eye over 1,000 LY away.</p>
<p>There aren't really much in our direct neighborhood though, so we mostly see stars of A to K sequence in our neighborhood. There are &quot;only&quot; a few thousand stars you can see with the naked eye in our night sky, given optimal and non-light polluted conditions. Now you have to consider that there are maybe around 50,000 stars or so in a 500 LY range around us, and only a few thousand of them are visible. </p>
<p>In the galactic core the stars would often be only a few LY away or in quiet a few cases less than 1 LY. The distribution of those bright A and B type stars would be substantially higher and you definitely would see a much brighter night sky with 10 times more stars of which many would be very bright A and B type stars which in our night sky only a few of them are.</p>
<p>It's all very hypothetical though since we don't know exactly what the distribution of stars is like in the centre.</p></div>		</li>
