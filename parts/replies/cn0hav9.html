			<p>and taxation is out of control. anyone earning minumum wage is paying well over 40 or 50% of everything they make in direct taxation unless they live at home (where parents would be paying property/school taxes etc.)<br><br>I am hoping to buy a home in 3 or 4 years. I will be seeking a location WITHOUT a school zone and will resist any attempt to install one. $7600 a year for school taxes AND 81% of our 1600 in property taxes ALSO goes to the schools. and they are shit schools. insane.</p>		</li>
