			<div class="markdown"><p>So interesting to see the differences in thought of an architect vs an engineer.</p>
<p>Your answers were more about real world aesthetics vs the logistical and real world limitations of mass flow and how the toilet works. Both are valid views and answers but I believe including both viewpoints is the BEST answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL. I haven't ever done residential work, but I have done pretty much anything else and currently focus on restaurants. but that being said, my focus is centered around my client and making his life easier. So low maintenance and ease of use is my primary concern. I let my engineering team worry about making sure it has enough water pressure (most of the time its fine, but sometimes booster pumps are needed but we work through that on a case by case basis).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to nitpick, but it's not about the pressure, it's about the mass flow rate. You have to have enough water entering the bowl over a certain amount of time (a function of it's drainage volume/rate and input). Without a fundamental understanding of thermodynamics, it can be very easy to confuse many of these concepts though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a certified plumber, but I do maintenance for both apartment buildings and an office building. Tankless ones are a gigantic pain in the ass to work on compared to residential tank toilets. Especially if they have any age to them where the chrome gets pitted, they leak like a sieve</p></div>		</li>
