			<div class="markdown"><p>To more accurately expand that last point, a lot of solutions have a freezing range.  The upper boundary of this range is called the liquidus and the lower boundary the solidus.  Within this range, certain constituents will solidify before other, which can appear as the liquid getting viscous as small solid particles nucleate out of the solution. This is taken advantage of a lot by metallurgists to control the properties of the metal once it's solidified by controlling which phase will solidify first and how quickly.  </p></div>		</li>
