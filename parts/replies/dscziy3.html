<p>It's not a myth that your body cares more about your head and core than it does your limbs, by design. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a myth that your head loses more heat.  The fact is that it is the most exposed.  Your hands and feet will go sub core temperature much faster, but if you have on a coat, gloves, boots and pants the only thing exposed is your head, even with a cap you still have cheeks and neck, which is the only part that is open air.  </p>
<p>If you...say run around in a pair of boots, boxers and a hat your head will still be warm.</p></div>		</li>
