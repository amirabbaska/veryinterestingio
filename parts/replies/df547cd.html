Some comments from older Redditors are sad in that they lived with it at a time when it was considered demonic, or mental deficiency, or completely fake. You at least live in a time when people know it's a thing and understand you're just a regular person with that thing they've heard about. I'm not trying to tell you how to feel or deal with a situation I can't really understand but I can tell you you might be projecting your feelings on to others. </p></div>		</li>
