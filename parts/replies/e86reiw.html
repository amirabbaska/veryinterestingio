			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movile_Cave" target="_blank">Movile cave</a> in Romania had an ecosystem totally separate from aboveground until scientists started poking around in it and cataloguing its many endemic species. Bacterial biofilms are an important food source for heterotrophs living there.</p>
<p>Edited to add: the olm also predates on cave-dwelling invertebrates like amphipods. Some amphipods develop a different ecotype depending on olm presence in the same habitat (morphological antipredator adaptations like longer spikes on carapace).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the Movile Caves are actually a neat example of what OP was talking about: a totally- or near-isolated cave ecosystem, independent of external input. Other cave systems depend on external inputs, like bat guano or prey washing down the river. In Movile the food chain is self-contained and based on mineral chemosynthesis, with grazers feeding on bacteria that themselves feed on minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been a few hypogean systems - that is, caves without any surface input - found to date. Most sustain themselves from a foundation of bacteria that digest limestone or take advantage of hydrogen sulfide deposits to power chemosynthesis. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4-9_1ir67Y" target="_blank">Movile Cave</a> is one such example of a completely isolated hypogean cave that can still sustain rather complex life-forms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well you could argue that limestone is made from the remains of marine creatures which indirectly means it's food that came from the outside, even if it did so a really long time ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the Greek, meaning &quot;mouse-hole: to dive in&quot;. Basically means &quot;cave dweller&quot;, which accurately describes the smelly reptiles, but it also referred to a Greek myth about hairy pygmies that lived in caves south of the region of Ethiopia - a tribe they called &quot;troglodytes&quot;. Another fun fact: chimpanzees have the species name &quot;Pan troglodytes&quot; because it was thought that they were the inspiration behind the Greek legends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related to the scope of the question, but you should google &quot;Whale Falls&quot;. There are whole eco food webs in the deep ocean that depend on dead whales that have sunk to the bottom. This is a huge caloric windfall and there are microbes and larger life forms that have evolved to feed exclusively on dead whales or other creates that live on dead whales. When the whale is used up, they have to somehow survive until the next whale falls from the sky</p></div>		</li>
