<p>There are some studies showing a small correlation with this or that. But generally, no, there are no specific characteristics of a high intelligent brain over a less intelligent one. </p>
<p>Even the situation with the astrocytes is not black and white.  More matter does not equal better cognitive function. It really comes down to a balance of connections and a healthy brain more than specific physical features like the size or shape of specific regions.</p></div>		</li>
