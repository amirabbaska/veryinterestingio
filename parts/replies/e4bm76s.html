Lady that wasn't able to sit up or roll on her other side was suddenly able to stand up. Her room also smelled intoxicatingly sweet as is normal with dieing people.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandma was strong willed and fiercely independent into her 80s. She still drove, mowed her yard etc. She was pretty healthy with only a few minor things over the years. She was just starting to have some minor decline, she found it hard to sew which was something she loved and would get tired easily.  She would have hated to be dependent on anyone. She died very suddenly in her sleep. I found her, she looked happy and peaceful just like she always did when she was sleeping. She just went to bed like always and never woke up. I was in my early 20s it was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through, she raised me, but in retrospect I’m glad she got to go on her terms without suffering </p></div>		</li>
