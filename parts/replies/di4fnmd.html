			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not perfectly written but the idea you're presenting is simply brilliant. I remember there was a great ELI5 answer about space and time being orthogonal (which is fundamentally what you're saying).</p>
<p>One note: the speed of light is not the max speed of spacetime, it's the ONLY speed of spacetime. Everything, including me and you, is moving at the speed of light through spacetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks man! i feel like im in the twilight zone for getting a compliment on reddit! I use to be really interested in this stuff and wanted to persue a career in astrophysics but that would have been a heck of a lot of work and a lot of luck. if any one is new to this stuff and wants a cool read i recommend an easier read: blackholes and timewarps by kip thorne.</p></div>		</li>
