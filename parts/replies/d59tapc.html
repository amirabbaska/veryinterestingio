			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. From what I remember from reading Kip Thorne's <em>Black Holes and Time Warps,</em> he hypothesized that a wormhole could be used for time travel if you took one end and subjected it to time dilation so that the two ends were in different points in time. But then someone else demonstrated that the gravitational waves travelling between the two wormholes would create a positive feedback loop and destroy the wormholes. Thorne then noted that since wormholes would always be moving in space at least a little bit, they would technically always be subject to a little bit of time dilation, meaning that any wormholes should automatically self-destruct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it supposed to be about actual travelling. I haven't read Kip Thorne's book just yet but he was one of the driving forces behind Interstellar where they use them as a direct tunnel to different galaxies or what have you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time doesnt really &quot;move&quot; forwards, rather it exists as space does, all given points at once, just takes however long(relative to the speed of light) it takes for us to get to the next point. </p>
<p>So if you consider living here on earth: 1second of time = 1meter of motion through space. </p>
<p>When you get closer to a black hole that motion is decreased drastically and exponentially because of density, its becoming so dense that you can barely move, think of a planet with high gravity you couldnt walk very easily, now think of a planet smaller than an atom that weighs more than 1000 suns and you RLLY couldn't move(not even light can move fast near a black hole!).... So as you move closer to the center spacetime condenses, like a .zip file on your computer, and time &quot;slows&quot; down: 1second = .001meter, .000001meter, .000000001meter of motion through space ect., and smaller and smaller until you reach the event horizon where time, for you, will &quot;slow down&quot; to almost a grinding halt while the rest of the universe experiences space/time normally. </p>
<p>So you can spend millions of normal earth seconds in a black hole and only experience entropy or &quot;age&quot; as if you spent one normal earth second outside of the hole. When you left the hole You'd be still younger as we inevitably grew older. </p>
<p>The implications are slightly terrifying. It shows that space only feels relative because time is absolute. It means that all time, past present and future, exist at once, and that we are merely experiencing one second/meter at a time, instead of all at once, and that &quot;free will&quot; is an illusion created from this experience. The fact is we are all born and will all die at a certain point (second/meter) in space, that is certain and predetermined. It's already happened, We are just enjoying the ride as it goes until it stops and then...lights out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is entirely incorrect. Time dilation near black holes does not affect objects near a black hole from their own frame of reference. From the frame of reference of an object falling into a black hole time is moving normally. An outside observer however will see the object slow down and actually stop at the event horizon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that it directly follows that because things move slower in certain circumstances then &quot;all time, past present and future, exist at once&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The short answer:
Inside a rotating black hole, our current theories of gravitation tell us that there is a region where not only does time go in a circle, it actually has to. This is only inside of the black hole, which is impossible to escape, so while it's technically time travel, it's confined to the inside of the black hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I interpret this as the physics definition of time breaks down and physics no longer works as we have defined the formulas, but globally time still goes ahead. Similar to how the newtonian physics no longer works in high speed and relativistic formulas are needed, the relativistic formulas no longer works under extreme gravity, but we have no possibility to experiment with that and find out how it actually works</p></div>		</li>
