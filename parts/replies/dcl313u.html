			<div class="markdown"><p>Vinyl record turntables turn on ball bearings which roll around on their bearing races.  The measure of the noise of the bearings is known as &quot;rumble&quot;, and this noise is picked up by the turntable needle and cartridge.  Good turntables have smooth bearings which produce very low rumble specs.</p></div>		</li>
