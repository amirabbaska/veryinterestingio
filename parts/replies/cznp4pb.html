<p>Edit: play around with kerbal space program. It's a great way to learn the physics behind all of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you're completely right. Your delta-v expenditure for an Earth launch would still be at least 7.6 km/s which is approximately orbital velocity in LEO. And you need a gigantic balloon to carry all of that mass up to 50km or wherever you release the rocket.</p>
<p>Balloon rockets sound nice but in practice would be totally unrealistic for orbital flights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that a disadvantage to this system? It's a lot easier to go faster when you are higher up. All the other replies are actual disadvantages.</p>
<p>edit: People seem to be replying with actual disadvantages already posted by other people which I referred. The point is just saying &quot;it's about going fast not high&quot; is not a disadvantage of any particular system it is a fact of achieving orbit (although have fun trying to achieve orbital speed in the atmosphere...). The idea of such a system is to use an aerostat to lift a rocket to high altitude so the rocket doesn't have to fly through atmosphere and have to worry about aerodynamics. You still have to fire the rocket and achieve orbital speeds. Many people are trying to do something similar but not using aerostats <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_launch_to_orbit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_launch_to_orbit</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of engineering challenges to this approach. An example is that you need to devise a way for the rocket to not shoot into the balloon. If the rocket is dropped it requires stronger attitude controls and if the rocket is shot through a doughnut shaped balloon there are difficulties with the creation of the balloon and the difficulty of the rocket not fouling on the balloon. Doughnut shaped balloons also behave unusually at high attitudes causing excess stress in the seams. In addition, high altitude balloons are usually not optimized for larger payloads.  Perhaps it could be worked out with time, but balloon carried rockets are somewhat of a fringe topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any reason we couldn't have a space station with a big winch cable coming down into the atmosphere. And a balloon on a winch going up into the atmosphere where they could meet up and exchange the rocket? the space station could then pull it up and it could launch from there instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What ratio of total chemical energy and what of total dV can be omitted with a balloon launch? I imagine it's not the same. A lot of dV is needed for a typical second stage but it doesn't have nearly as much umpf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of the fuel required for any launch is to punch through our relatively chunky atmosphere though. Though you will be at a disadvantage in that you won't already be moving at 700-something mph, you might make significant savings in fuel because of the relative lightness of the atmosphere at an elevated altitude. Though you'll still have to accelerate, it may be more efficient to do so at that height.</p></div>		</li>
