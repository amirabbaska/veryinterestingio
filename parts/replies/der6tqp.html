			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the similar boat.  I completed a fellowship and my goal was to get a civilian position in the DoD a few years back.  Unfortunately, they were having a hiring freeze, so I had to get a position as a contractor.  I then stepped out on my own to start my own business.  There are pros and cons to both, but I like to believe that things work out as they should.  There are several departments that come to mind that need chemical engineers.  Each branch of the Armed Services has a need as well.   I would recommend that you attend a career fair to get a quick sense of a broad set of companies that could use your skillset.  Check with your career center at your school â€“ there should be a number of options for you to attend.</p></div>		</li>
