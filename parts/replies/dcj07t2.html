			<div class="markdown"><p>If I shave against the grain I get insanely itchy bumpy irritation and the occasional ingrown hair. I havent shaved against the grain in years at this point but that's why I shave with the grain now.</p>
<p>I've thought about giving the safety razor thing a shot, but then I decide not to because I'm lazy and dont want to relearn how to shave.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just shave with the hairs, then feel your face. If you have spots that feel stubbly, try shaving against. If you still get itch, even with hairs that short, shaving against isn't ever gonna work for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I shave which ever way I want. The only thing I've read is that using conditioner instead of shaving cream is more efficient. Not sure if it makes a difference but I find it makes less of a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never gotten razor burn when using conditioner as shaving cream. I initially did it out of sheer laziness due to not wanting to go to the store to get more shaving cream, but it turns out that it works ridicously well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can shave against the grain with just a little slap of warm water on a couple days stubble. (or if I have to do it dry, with the grain)</p>
<p>I also know people that wince at the thought of shaving dry or against the grain as if it was equivalent to watching a slow motion high def video of someone having their fingernails pulled out.</p></div>		</li>
