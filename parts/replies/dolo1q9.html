			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a freak Halloween snowstorm awhile ago (Zone 7a, southeast PA), and there was a TON of damage/downed trees/power outages because of this. We know how to deal with snow here (mostly), but this shut us down for a couple days because the trees just weren't ready for it yet. Crazy. </p></div>		</li>
