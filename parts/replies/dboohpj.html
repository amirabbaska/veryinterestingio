			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this answer the question though?  This is about goosebumps and chills.  Not necessarily the &quot;random shudders&quot; that can happen even when not excited or cold.  OP seems to be asking about the random shudder that can occur when sitting around, in general conversation, or any other random time.  Not chills or shudders associated with thrill seeking, cold, and adrenaline.  I would like to know because I get these shudders frequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Research into finding answers costs lots of money. Nobody wants to spend lots of money researching something benign because they could be spending it on something life threatening. So a weird fact of life is that lots of these really common things that don't hurt you, have no answers, but experts in the area make pretty good guesses. Another one of those things is that random sharp stabby pain in your chest when you breathe in (I forgot the name of it). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point but I think the attempt at response from Quora OP was fairly comprehensive of all etiologies of chills.</p>
<p>Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interesting questions are: 1) why is the sensation pleasurable? and 2) <strong>why can this response be induced by stimuli unrelated to cold</strong> (music, aesthetic awe, primal scream, threat of loss, certain physical and tactile sensations)?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again you seem to be missing the thrust of the main question - which is about the shudder or tremble sometimes associated with no physical, audio or chemical input. The ones that some people say &quot;someone just walked over my grave&quot; after experiencing. </p>
<p>Those ones, what causes those?  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so... it asks 'why is the experience pleasurable?' while the sensation of chills isn't, at all (at least not to me)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The experience itself isn't what OP is asking about, and whether it is pleasurable or not isn't part of the original ask as well.  So even if the article sited describes why it's pleasurable, it still doesn't answer the original question.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this related to, or the same as ASMR? I encountered that acronym recently, and read about it on Wikipedia, and based on how it's described, it sounds like chills to me. I've experienced chills many times, in all sorts of situations, and if you asked me to describe them, my description would be very similar to what others describe as ASMR: a pleasurable, vibrating feeling that radiates outward from the neck or spine. But I went to r/ASMR, and nothing I saw there triggered the response in me. So either I don't know what ASMR feels like, and the description is just coincidentally similar to chills, or ASMR is caused by different things in different people. Which leads me to believe that chills and ASMR are the same thing, and that the term ASMR is dubious and pseudoscientific. Because people make videos and music designed to trigger ASMR, and act like it's a big privilege to be able to experience this response. But to me, the sensation is as normal as the need to sneeze, or the feeling of tiredness after a workout. It's just one of those things the human body does. It's nice, but it's not a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experience the chills described in this thread and I also experience asmr. They're definitely different sensations but I don't know how to explain it or why they are different. I wouldn't be surprised to find out they are somehow related in terms of biology or wiring in the body, they occur in the same areas of my body...but they feel vastly different and are induced by very different stimuli. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main theory behind ASMR is that it comes from grooming in apes. It's a sensation made to calm us in presence of another human caring and grooming us.</p>
<p>If you ever felt that, it would be mostly as a child in the doctors office, or in a quiet classroom.</p>
<p>The best way to experience ASMR is to be as confortable as possible and pop out a Binaural video with a good pair of headphones/earbud and appreciate the &quot;3D&quot; presence of the other person, because it's all about the proximity and intimacy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I used to experience ASMR when getting a haircut or a teacher looking over at my paper. That's why I'm a big fan of gentlewhispering's binaural style videos, it mimics that response in me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer to think of the chills as 'warm fuzzies'. Cause that's what it feels like to me. Not that I've had that feeling in a year or two, I miss that nice feeling actually. </p></div>		</li>
