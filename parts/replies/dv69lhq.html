			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone interested in this specific subject should read <em>Prime Mover: a natural history of muscle</em> by Steven Vogel (may have misspelled his name).</p>
<p>An extremely short and rough explanation is that muscles are grouped in bundles and humans optimized for using smaller sub-bundles, great for dexterity, but not great for power.  Chimps optimized for using large muscle bundles all at once, very powerful, but bad for dexterity.  There's a ton more in the book, and an even broader set of related topics in <em>Cat's Paws and Catapults</em>, but that's the abbreviated version for the purposes of this topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wouldn't rip your arm of though, there haven't been that many studies to find out how strong apes actually are. Tests in 1949 by glen Finch and a repeat by someone else in 1960 put the chimps at pulling the same weight as a adult male. </p>
<p>Of course chimps are about half as big as an adult male, so their muscles are still a lot stronger, but not &quot;Easily rip your arm of&quot; stronger</p></div>		</li>
