Weathering and erosion of rocks in the mountains produces sediment that is moved downstream by rivers and then distributed along the ocean shoreline by longshore drift.</p>
<p>In fact, coastal erosion is a big problem in many places, primarily because dams on the rivers have impounded that sand supply, starving the coastline of its primary sand source, and leading to the shrinking of beaches in many places.</p></div>		</li>
