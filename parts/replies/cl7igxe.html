			<p>A lot of this isn't true. I'm a respiratory therapist and ECMO specialist at a center that performs 20-30 cases a year and have been a specialist for nearly 2 years now. We have a 75% survival rate. <br>Most patients don't require much for transfusions unless they have an active bleed. We do replace clotting factors about once a shift but that's more to mechanical breakdown from the pump itself. Most issues with clotting though come from us because we don't want clotting, it will shut the pump down and the patient will die. <br>Hypoperfusion is rarely an issue and only happens in patients with previous issues with it. Most of patients are conscious during the cases as well.  Cases of &quot;pumphead&quot; are actually from intracranial bleeds caused by the massive amounts of anticoagulant we use to keep the blood from clotting. <br>CO2 is also not a limiting factor. The membrane of an ECMO pump strips the blood of all gas and we actually replace the oxygen and CO2 with the membrane as well.<br><br>Again source, I'm an ECMO specialist and I'm currently sitting at a pump now. </p>		</li>

			<p>I second this. I'm a nurse currently sitting at an ecmo bedside. The only reason one of my patients would be losing that much blood would be if the crashed onto ECMO during surgery and still had an active bleed. Also, as of almost two years ago, we walk some of our VV ECMOs (VV in most cases dealing with decreased lung function and VA usually dealing with cardiac disfunction).  Walking is very stressful on the patient and staff but in certain situations, necessary (like being listed for a long transplant). Our ECMO survival rates have increased dramatically over the past couple of years and it's saved many lives. <br><br>Also, as a side note: Get your flu shot! Flu season is busy ECMO season! We get A LOT of patients put on ECMO do to complications from the flu. I think we had around 20-30 flu ECMOs last year and none of them received the flu shot. <br><br>tl;dr GET YOUR FLU SHOT! </p>		</li>

			<p>Sadly, we're not really selective at all. Yes, ecmo saves lives but when you have crash 83 year old grandma onto VA ecmo, it usually prolongs death. Like someone else said though, our program is still learning. We've gotten good at it so now we're in this stage where me think we can save everyone. </p>		</li>

			<p>Two points on that.<br><br>One is that ECMO is certainly something you get better at, with practice. And by that I mean the whole shamozzle: patient selection, access device selection, timing and speed of the insertion, mode of use, means and intensity of anticoagulation, management of ECMO and pathology related complications, etc.<br><br>So if you're at an ECMO uber-centre, all of that is better, and although it increasingly represents a higher proportion of the ECMO'd, it's not representative of what might happen in a large, wealthy western city that just doesn't happen to have a place like this.<br><br>So, second point, I think you're underselling the black magic that ECMO is for the ill. It's a great answer to the OP's question in the sense that in a century, this night very well be mainstream for heart/lung failure. But it is transient necromancy. I know, and you know, a one in four death rate doing two cases a month is actually great. I would imagine most lay people would not really cope with that, despite it being better than many other more familiar treatments.</p>		</li>

			<p>You are very correct on both points. Necromancy is a pretty good comparison for ECMO as well. You can damn near make a corpse look pretty on VA ECMO </p>		</li>

			<p>Older intensivists will still say 'while you are on ECMO you are dead. Until we can take these pipes out, she is dead.'<br><br>This concept is changing, but does actually have some value. You still can't go home on ECMO. And especially for the lung failure side of things, it's a huge bridge to go to from being impossible to oxygenate, to being able to oxygenate at all on say, 80% with moderately high PEEP, to then weaning from that to something more sane, to then one day breathing 21% spontaneously. </p>		</li>

			<p>I informally separate intensive care medicine into white magic (usual care done very well), neutral wizardry from anaesthesia (pressors, inotropes, dialysis and ventilation) and black magic (hypothermia, ECMO, bypass, plasmapheresis). <br><br>This is not actually very helpful except when explaining how things are going to other medical people unfamiliar with the unpleasant potency of weapons we have to hand. </p>		</li>

			<p>It seems like most of the problems are with long-term use. Would it be possible to have a portable emergency device that pumps and oxygenates blood for when someone goes into cardiac arrest? In my layman's view, it seems like that would more effectively save lives than attempting to restart the heart with defibrillation. </p>		</li>

			<p>You're describing something we generally call ECLS, or extracorporeal cardiac life support. This is a very new area of research that's only been around for maybe 10 years. It's not small and portable, you just have rapid access to a CPB machine and appropriate personnel in the emergency department so you can throw someone on ECMO within 20-30min.<br><br>It definitely works, but only in very specific situations. First of all you have to remember that AV-ECMO has a lot of complications even with short term use. Take your index finger and then imagine placing two IVs the size of that through your skin and into your major blood vessels. Anything smaller would not have enough flow. It is nowhere near a benign intervention. In addition, you also need to do it to someone who's not going to be a vegetable. Some people wind up brain dead after even 2 minutes of no pulse. Sure you can put them on ECMO but they're brain dead. Being able to predict who is likely to have a good neurological outcome is important. Finally, ECMO is only a bridge to something (recovery, intervention, transplant, etc.), it's not the destination. The vast majority of people who have cardiac arrest have it for a reason - they're not usually young healthy people with no health problems. If there is a problem that caused their cardiac arrest that you can either fix or will resolve on its own with time (heart attack, certain toxic exposures) then ECMO is reasonable. But there is nothing worse than putting someone on ECMO who will never survive off of it. Telling someone on ECMO (who could easily be completely awake and reading a newspaper) that their heart is dead and they're not a transplant candidate, and that we'll have to turn the machine off and they'll die is a very awkward/difficult situation.<br><br>As a result of all of these large limitations, I've only been involved in two &quot;ECLS&quot; cases in the past 4 years.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. This thread has a ton of experts with very specific information that pertains only to the institutions in which they work. It's real-world but it's narrow in scope. <br><br>VV ECMO patients can walk and converse while on ECMO. It has been done in Germany for years and Duke published a paper on their ambulatory ECMO program in the past couple years. <br><br>VA ECMO Is more complex because the nature of the support indicates a more acutely I'll patient that requires both hemodynamic and pulmonary support. It's tougher to walk those patients both from an infrastructure standpoint and from the perspective of how much more relatively ill those patients are. <br><br>Hypoperfusion of the brain is much more a concern of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in the OR when doing bypass surgery. During that time, surgeons intentionally arrest the heart and 100% of the patient's perfusion (to all organs, including the brain) is from the pump. It's a short-term situation where ECMO is more long term (think an hour or two vs. days and sometimes weeks). <br><br>Someone described it as necromancy. That's not inaccurate, but you have to be aware of what it is - a bridge to something else. There's nothing curative about ECMO.  It's not antibiotics or gene therapy. It will keep you alive until you get better or are no longer alive. You may go &quot;on pump&quot; as a bridge to a heart or lung transplant and add many productive years to your life. You also may not and, at the end of the day, if someone gave you a 50/50 shot to live vs. a 100% chance of imminent death - which would you choose? </p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think you can characterize VA and VV ECMO that way; it depends entirely on the patient's specific illness.  For example, an ARDS patient may need deep sedation for their initial management, while a pre lung transplant patient can be fully awake.  A patient on VA ECMO as a bridge to an LVAD and heart transplant could potentially be awake and mobile, compared to the person who just arrested and is undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.</p>		</li>

			<p><a href="http://edecmo.org/saves/" target="_blank">http://edecmo.org/saves/</a><br><br>This is the website for UC San Diego's emergency department-based ECPR program, where they crash selected cardiac arrest patients onto an ECMO circuit in the emergency department. It's a pretty amazing group of people and I highly encourage anyone interested in emergency medicine/EMS/biomedical engineering or whatever to check out their videos and site. We're a long way from this being something many hospitals do, as it requires a lot of funding, expertise, training and practice, and cooperation of CV surgeons and an ECMO team. They're doing really cool stuff though and showing that in the right patients, it can really work.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is moderately widespread, but being being &quot;totally&quot; awake on ECMO is somewhat less common. I'll use this message as a placeholder while I look for an actual description, but (cough) we do withdraw treatments from the untreatable on a daily basis, either at doctor, family, or patient request. I would imagine it's not especially different.</p>		</li>

			<p>We routinely withdraw care, but it's usually on people who aren't with it mentally (brain dead, sedated, delirious, etc). The difference with the AV-ECMO situation is these people can be completely lucid. This makes it a bit more difficult.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are many technical limitations to making such a device portable. You'd need to carry a large volume of blood, which needs to be stored cold and warmed before infusion. You'd need a huge supply of medications on hand to keep the blood metabolically neutral. You'd need to gain rapid access to major vascular supply in the field. Then you'd need this hugely complicated, expensive, difficult to operate device floating around, and trained staff traveling with it.<br><br> For all these reasons and more, ECMO is nowhere near being a portable technology. There are very few indications for using the device that could be identified and managed in the field anyway, so there's little drive to move it to that stage. <br><br>Take heart attacks for example: either ACLS and CPR are successful in returning the patient to a sustainable rhythm, or it isn't. If it is, the therapy has kept your blood circulating. If the patient fails to regain useful contractile motion, there's no point to keep them on ECMO anyway.</p>		</li>

			<p>They do make portable ECMO machines, but use in the field would be near impossible. For one, a sterile environment is necessary to acquire the venous/arterial access needed to run the machine. Good luck with that in a ditch on the side of the road, or in this roach-infested home belonging to the patient. Secondly, paramedics can only access peripheral veins. Which takes it outside the scope of practice for a medic since both arterial and venous vessels are used. The Department of Public Health is going to require a lot research (which is very tough to get approval for here in the states) before it changes anything along those lines. Sure, you could start throwing nurses on ambulances, but you're not going find one willing to take that kind of pay cut, nor an ambulance service willing to pay for the nurse if the former doesn't work out. Lastly, I'd chalk it up to time. The process of creating your sterile field, maintaining it, and gaining both venous and arterial access in a manner compatible with the machine is going to be way too much time spent on scene. That process is going to take, now I'm guessing here, at least 15 minutes, and that's not taking into account that continuous compressions are in progress making it extremely difficult to hit those vessels you're aiming for without pulses.<br><br>TL;DR: Yes, it would be more effective, but the current state of all variables involved makes it highly impractical. <br><br>Sorry for the wall, I'm posted at a pee wee football game and need entertainment (current EMT and Medic student). Take all I say with every bit of skepticism you deem necessary. </p>		</li>

			<p>The only way this would happen in a field would be with a highly trained hospital transport team with an on call surgeon. No EMT would be responsible for this. Still that team would attempt to stabilize the patient and get them to the hospital that does ECMO before attempting this. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;However, research at least so far has shown mixed results on whether people actually live any longer while getting ECMO therapies.<br><br>My thesis for my M.S. to be a perfusionist focused on ECMO. Research in this area is kind of difficult to do because there's a very fine line between putting a patient on ECMO too early (and they may end up not needing it) and too late (they're too sick to be able to treat them back to 100%). Newer research points has taken an approach of putting patients on ECMO first and asking questions later. That way, they get the support they need and then their exact diagnosis can be determined. Like I said before, patients may get put on ECMO and not need it resulting in an unnecessary (incredibly high) cost, but, that's a risk I'd be willing to take, personally. Spot on explanation, though!</p>		</li>
