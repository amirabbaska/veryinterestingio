			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this isn't true. I'm a respiratory therapist and ECMO specialist at a center that performs 20-30 cases a year and have been a specialist for nearly 2 years now. We have a 75% survival rate.
Most patients don't require much for transfusions unless they have an active bleed. We do replace clotting factors about once a shift but that's more to mechanical breakdown from the pump itself. Most issues with clotting though come from us because we don't want clotting, it will shut the pump down and the patient will die.
Hypoperfusion is rarely an issue and only happens in patients with previous issues with it. Most of patients are conscious during the cases as well.  Cases of &quot;pumphead&quot; are actually from intracranial bleeds caused by the massive amounts of anticoagulant we use to keep the blood from clotting.
CO2 is also not a limiting factor. The membrane of an ECMO pump strips the blood of all gas and we actually replace the oxygen and CO2 with the membrane as well.</p>
<p>Again source, I'm an ECMO specialist and I'm currently sitting at a pump now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. I'm a nurse currently sitting at an ecmo bedside. The only reason one of my patients would be losing that much blood would be if the crashed onto ECMO during surgery and still had an active bleed. Also, as of almost two years ago, we walk some of our VV ECMOs (VV in most cases dealing with decreased lung function and VA usually dealing with cardiac disfunction).  Walking is very stressful on the patient and staff but in certain situations, necessary (like being listed for a long transplant). Our ECMO survival rates have increased dramatically over the past couple of years and it's saved many lives. </p>
<p>Also, as a side note: Get your flu shot! Flu season is busy ECMO season! We get A LOT of patients put on ECMO do to complications from the flu. I think we had around 20-30 flu ECMOs last year and none of them received the flu shot. </p>
<p>tl;dr GET YOUR FLU SHOT! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two points on that.</p>
<p>One is that ECMO is certainly something you get better at, with practice. And by that I mean the whole shamozzle: patient selection, access device selection, timing and speed of the insertion, mode of use, means and intensity of anticoagulation, management of ECMO and pathology related complications, etc.</p>
<p>So if you're at an ECMO uber-centre, all of that is better, and although it increasingly represents a higher proportion of the ECMO'd, it's not representative of what might happen in a large, wealthy western city that just doesn't happen to have a place like this.</p>
<p>So, second point, I think you're underselling the black magic that ECMO is for the ill. It's a great answer to the OP's question in the sense that in a century, this night very well be mainstream for heart/lung failure. But it is transient necromancy. I know, and you know, a one in four death rate doing two cases a month is actually great. I would imagine most lay people would not really cope with that, despite it being better than many other more familiar treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are very correct on both points. Necromancy is a pretty good comparison for ECMO as well. You can damn near make a corpse look pretty on VA ECMO </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like most of the problems are with long-term use. Would it be possible to have a portable emergency device that pumps and oxygenates blood for when someone goes into cardiac arrest? In my layman's view, it seems like that would more effectively save lives than attempting to restart the heart with defibrillation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're describing something we generally call ECLS, or extracorporeal cardiac life support. This is a very new area of research that's only been around for maybe 10 years. It's not small and portable, you just have rapid access to a CPB machine and appropriate personnel in the emergency department so you can throw someone on ECMO within 20-30min.</p>
<p>It definitely works, but only in very specific situations. First of all you have to remember that AV-ECMO has a lot of complications even with short term use. Take your index finger and then imagine placing two IVs the size of that through your skin and into your major blood vessels. Anything smaller would not have enough flow. It is nowhere near a benign intervention. In addition, you also need to do it to someone who's not going to be a vegetable. Some people wind up brain dead after even 2 minutes of no pulse. Sure you can put them on ECMO but they're brain dead. Being able to predict who is likely to have a good neurological outcome is important. Finally, ECMO is only a bridge to something (recovery, intervention, transplant, etc.), it's not the destination. The vast majority of people who have cardiac arrest have it for a reason - they're not usually young healthy people with no health problems. If there is a problem that caused their cardiac arrest that you can either fix or will resolve on its own with time (heart attack, certain toxic exposures) then ECMO is reasonable. But there is nothing worse than putting someone on ECMO who will never survive off of it. Telling someone on ECMO (who could easily be completely awake and reading a newspaper) that their heart is dead and they're not a transplant candidate, and that we'll have to turn the machine off and they'll die is a very awkward/difficult situation.</p>
<p>As a result of all of these large limitations, I've only been involved in two &quot;ECLS&quot; cases in the past 4 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You say that someone on ECMO</p>

<p>but another comment says patients on ECMO</p>

<p>can't be awake because of the hypoperfusion of the brain</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many technical limitations to making such a device portable. You'd need to carry a large volume of blood, which needs to be stored cold and warmed before infusion. You'd need a huge supply of medications on hand to keep the blood metabolically neutral. You'd need to gain rapid access to major vascular supply in the field. Then you'd need this hugely complicated, expensive, difficult to operate device floating around, and trained staff traveling with it.</p>
<p>For all these reasons and more, ECMO is nowhere near being a portable technology. There are very few indications for using the device that could be identified and managed in the field anyway, so there's little drive to move it to that stage. </p>
<p>Take heart attacks for example: either ACLS and CPR are successful in returning the patient to a sustainable rhythm, or it isn't. If it is, the therapy has kept your blood circulating. If the patient fails to regain useful contractile motion, there's no point to keep them on ECMO anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do make portable ECMO machines, but use in the field would be near impossible. For one, a sterile environment is necessary to acquire the venous/arterial access needed to run the machine. Good luck with that in a ditch on the side of the road, or in this roach-infested home belonging to the patient. Secondly, paramedics can only access peripheral veins. Which takes it outside the scope of practice for a medic since both arterial and venous vessels are used. The Department of Public Health is going to require a lot research (which is very tough to get approval for here in the states) before it changes anything along those lines. Sure, you could start throwing nurses on ambulances, but you're not going find one willing to take that kind of pay cut, nor an ambulance service willing to pay for the nurse if the former doesn't work out. Lastly, I'd chalk it up to time. The process of creating your sterile field, maintaining it, and gaining both venous and arterial access in a manner compatible with the machine is going to be way too much time spent on scene. That process is going to take, now I'm guessing here, at least 15 minutes, and that's not taking into account that continuous compressions are in progress making it extremely difficult to hit those vessels you're aiming for without pulses.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Yes, it would be more effective, but the current state of all variables involved makes it highly impractical. </p>
<p>Sorry for the wall, I'm posted at a pee wee football game and need entertainment (current EMT and Medic student). Take all I say with every bit of skepticism you deem necessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way this would happen in a field would be with a highly trained hospital transport team with an on call surgeon. No EMT would be responsible for this. Still that team would attempt to stabilize the patient and get them to the hospital that does ECMO before attempting this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>However, research at least so far has shown mixed results on whether people actually live any longer while getting ECMO therapies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My thesis for my M.S. to be a perfusionist focused on ECMO. Research in this area is kind of difficult to do because there's a very fine line between putting a patient on ECMO too early (and they may end up not needing it) and too late (they're too sick to be able to treat them back to 100%). Newer research points has taken an approach of putting patients on ECMO first and asking questions later. That way, they get the support they need and then their exact diagnosis can be determined. Like I said before, patients may get put on ECMO and not need it resulting in an unnecessary (incredibly high) cost, but, that's a risk I'd be willing to take, personally. Spot on explanation, though!</p></div>		</li>
