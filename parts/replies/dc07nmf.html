<p>Anecdotally, sleeping in a new place actually makes me sleep better; by which I mean I feel more rested after less sleep.</p>
<p>I suspect that it has to do with conditioning, because generally speaking when I've been in a new environment I've been traveling which means high activity levels the next day and less time to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also suspect that it has to with conditioning, and also just personal things to each person. </p>
<p>This is also anecdotal, but, I find it interesting, myself. I'm a very heavy sleeper. If it's not a matter of going to work so I don't lose my job, I will not allow anything to stop me from sleeping. It may gain my half attention- but I'm firmly going back to sleep.</p>
<p>With one exception. </p>
<p>The voice of someone who falls into the category of lust/puppy love.</p>
<p>They can whisper to me and gain my full, conscious attention.</p>
<p>Trying to fall back asleep would be pointless. I'm alert now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I would think it would vary depending on the person, even amongst the already diverse set of variables. </p>
<p>I would suspect the mental as well as physical health of the person would change how easily they are awoken. Really interesting topic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I just want to point out that there are numerous studies on the &quot;First-night effect&quot;, one such <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1966.tb02650.x/abstract" target="_blank">here</a>, a more recent one here <a href="http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(16)30174-9" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(16)30174-9</a>. It's kind of a bad example considering that statistically, <em>at least</em> 90% of the people are affected by it, and it's a very studied part of sleep research, it's always taken into account for the first 2 days when analyzing the data, and has been for at least 50 years.</p>
<p>While sleep and its effect is a topic that will be studied for at least another century, certain variables have been clearly identified as well. Stress and anxiety are two other well studied topics, and while everyone has a different threshold, the effects are generally fairly similar. There are other known factors, for instance, and this is generally critical in teenagers, people who do everything in their room. They eat in their room, do work/homework in their room, they play in their room, they watch movies in their room. The room become associated with stimuli, it does not become a place of relaxation, which leads to lower sleep quality; a fairly studied and understood effect.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is that there is indeed a lot of variables in play and not everyone is the same, but we also have a fairly good understanding of what works and what doesn't. Some people can go their entire life with no sleep trouble, but that is extremely rare. Most will inevitably get sleep quality issues, sometimes it's very simple, sometime there is a deeper issue, but ultimately, it comes down to the addition of various factors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and my best friend like to hypothosize on this, and we know enough evolutionary biology (it's his masters) to make plausible sounding ideas that are probably wrong.</p>
<p>He sleeps so, so light, especially in a new environment. When he visits I go all out making his room dark, cool, and some form of white noise. I do it all as a thank you because I sleep like a rock, so our conjecture is I sleep well and he functions as an alarm to any wild animals or other dangers. So my gratitude seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Again, we know just enough to come up with this and that we're probably over simplified or just flat wrong. But a working theory 'helps us sleep at night.' lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my theory, which is as good as any other. When my daughter was a baby we never shut the light off or made the room quiet when it was time to sleep. When she was tired, she slept. We could have 3 people over and she would sleep on my wife's lap as we talked away. She slept well, and still &quot;sleeps like a baby&quot;</p>
<p>Our friends make the room dark, and quiet when it's sleepy time. You can't drop a pin or the baby wakes up.</p>
<p>My daughter can sleep anywhere, anytime she is tired. Some people need it dead quiet to sleep and even the slightest light of a clock makes it difficult to sleep. Perhaps these were children of the structured parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My kids are total opposites when it comes to sleep. I can change my son's clothes, clean his ears, use power tools in the next room, our dogs bark at the mailman, etc. and he stays asleep. My daughter I assumed would be similar, nope. She's getting better, but up until about 18 months old, even the click of the door closing to her room (and me trying to ease off of it as gently as possible) would wake her up; she's still a pretty light sleeper and stirs when I check on her. Both raised in same conditions, both attend same daycare. </p></div>		</li>
