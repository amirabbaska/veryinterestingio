<p>In this case it's not a matter of what fraction of the total population you're counting, it's a case of how many individual measurements you're taking, and the number of molecules in that one drop is a lot. If the ocean were ten or a hundred times as big, it wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>This is where your model becomes important. This would be true <em>if</em> the salinity of the ocean was fairly consistent. But there are major differences in salinity between, say, the waters around Antarctica, the Louisiana Gulf Coast, and the middle of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>So, one eye dropper is far superior to 10 out of 20 socks if your model is that all the oceans are more or less alike. But it's far worse if your model is that geography affects salinity. That's how we end up with things like polls accurately projecting President Obama's re-election but failing miserably at predicting President Trump's election despite having similar numbers of respondents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that might not have been the best example because I'm assuming truly random sampling here, so go ahead and give the oceans a good thorough stirring-up before you collect your sample. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and I expanded on that point to show why things like the rule of thumb that n=30 is enough are highly dependent upon the model you're using. If you aren't careful, that kind of rule of thumb can switch from useful to highly misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Sweden, we are taught that a good rule of thumb is 1000 samples per strata.</p>
<p>So, If I want to sample how people vote: 1000 samples.</p>
<p>If I want to survey this by gender: 2000 samples.</p>
<p>If I also want to add age groups: 3000 samples.</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, it depends a bit on what you are measuring. If each sample is complicated and costly, you may choose to accept lower precision.</p></div>		</li>
