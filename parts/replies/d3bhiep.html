<p>In space, you need very little force to move around.</p>

<p>So why wouldn't this apply to the headphones as well? </p>
<p>Not to mention that their possible dimensions of movement are increased. </p>
<p>I'd expect <em>more</em> tangles. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure if you let them fly freely in space, they have a greater potential for tangling than by lying inertly on a table. But constrained to a pocket/bag/etc that is not the case.</p>
<p>Also, a recent research found the greatest potential for tangling wires/strings is if they roll down a surface, or are twisted between two surfaces. Twisted wires/strings tend to twist and tangle. In space &quot;rolling down&quot; is not an issue. They can still twist from friction against the pocket though - but not nearly as much as when you're walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual movement on your part would be less though. You'd be able to move across a room with a single push off a wall, vs. walking. The latter would jiggle the headphone cables much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it would take less movement to jostle the headphones, plus they would not resist knotting motions as much.</p>
<p>In a simple case, put your headphones on a desk and prod them with your finger. Odds are nothing happens. </p>
<p>Do the same in space and the &quot;prodded&quot; part will continue moving, rotation will ensue, the parts will start to wrap etc. Doesn't matter how small the force applied is. </p></div>		</li>
