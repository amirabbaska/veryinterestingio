			<div class="markdown"><p>As a result of that incident: &quot;Airbus also modified its computer systems; the on-board computer now checks all fuel levels against the flight plan. It now gives a clear warning if more fuel is being lost than the engines can consume.&quot;.
Kinda shocking how they didn't have this check before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically because when you glide, your weight is the force overcoming the drag. Let theta be the angle from horizontal to your velocity.</p>
<p>D = W*sin(theta) </p>
<p>L = W*cos(theta)</p>
<p>But also with aircraft you can get a lift/drag ratio which changes based on the plane you are flying, but once in flight it pretty much only depends on your angle of attack and position of centre of mass. Since you aren't burning fuel or otherwise changing COM during a glide and you can pick the angle of attack you want, you can also relate lift to drag/</p>
<p>L = LDR*D</p>
<p>so you get</p>
<p>L = W<em>cos(theta) = LDR</em>W*sin(theta)</p>
<p>-&gt; LDR = 1/tan(theta)           your glide angle depends only on your LDR which in a glide is just a function of your angle of attack.</p>
<p>Then you relate back to the lift or drag you have at that LDR to find your velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One huge challenge is the cabin pressure. An airplane isn't perfectly airtight - it's just &quot;good enough&quot; to keep up with the cabin pressurization system. When the engines shut down, the plane will lose pressure relatively quickly. The oxygen masks will drop, but they only provide a few minutes of air. They're designed for situations where the engines are still working, and pressure is lost for another reason. They provide must enough oxygen for the plane to dive from 30,000 feet to 10,000 feet where there's oxygen. The point is, the plane will have to dive in order to get to an altitude where there's sufficient oxygen before the masks run out. This will limit the plane's glide range, since they're sacrificing altitude. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways around this issue. Starting the APU is the best solution. But what if you're out of fuel? Cockpit oxygen lasts a lot longer than passenger oxygen. Let the pax go hypoxic and save their lives by making a longer glide. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most large airliners have a RAT (ram air turbine) which lowers into the air stream that will power basic systems.  The Gimli glider is a good example of it being used.  </p>
<p>That being said, it's harder to find a runway for 737, where you can set down a skyhawk just about anywhere.  :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the more modern FBW aircraft need hydraulics going. Moat older designs are cable driven and are fine. The 737 for example is cable driven with hydraulic assist, it'll take a bit of heft to fly it without hydraulics but it'll still do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this,<br />
It's not really the glide ratio which is the danger, in any aircraft - it's the momentum, which is the real issue.<br />
For example, My little 450kg microlight has a glide ratio of about 17:1 - which is brilliant, indeed giving thermals I can hang around into the 30's.  In an engine off event. I know that I can glide around and down at about 30-35 MPH.  That's a fairly survivable crash even into something horrible like a tree.<br />
An Airbus, flares at ~130 MPH - so will glide around 130 too plus or minus, I'm sure the exact specs are easy to find - but weighs around 250,000KG.<br />
There have been tales of Airbus traveling 100+ miles from cruise and landing safely.<br />
130 MPH and 250K-KG is not something you want to put down somewhere offdes.<br />
The Hudson indecent, is truly amazing, though and a testament to the design AND the Captain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting stuff. If I'm following... For a big plane with lots of momentum, it's much more important to find a safe landing spot. Because, the plane has to be coming in much faster, can't slow down, and will land &quot;hard&quot;? In your microlight example, you really just need somewhere flat without anything to hit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Things are a bit different for water landings - or rough field landings - the latter of which I have had a few.  You can stall right at the right moment of flare to ensure you and crew are safe with minimum forward velocity and distance to impact.<br />
In bigger planes, you can also do that but it's really just the start of an unknown nightmare, it takes a REALLY good pilot to do it (Hudson Example)  - I have been in an AFATO on a little 4 seat Skyline - no chance of reciprocal landing and so straight into (thankfully) field beyond.  We flared/stalled really late, probably 6-10 feet up but still slipped about 120m on the corn - lost gear and wrecked the air frame.  A scary roller coaster indeed.  That was about 1200KG  at ~60mph I estimate.<br />
(Height in feet - distance in M. Aviation eh?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a medium performance 500 kg &quot;microlight&quot; you can usually land in about 100 m. From memory the <a href="https://lf5422.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/a22-screen-shot-2016-05-18-at-22-00-35.jpg" target="_blank">A-22</a> I got my licence with needs 120 m between when it crosses the 15 m mark (&quot;tree top&quot;) to when it stops.</p></div>		</li>
