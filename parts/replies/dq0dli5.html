			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing much, just some slow release of Cl2 gas from the oxidation of HCl and O2 from decomposition of H2O2. It's just that in industrial quantities you never want Cl2 to leak so you have to be careful when using these two together, like when etching PCBs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your rate of reaction. Even at low temperatures, over long periods of time water will form from its constituent molecules. It’s just that formation of water gives out loads of energy, and the hydrogen atoms want to use that energy to form more bonds with oxygen, creating a chain reaction that outputs loads of energy that we call “combusting”. </p></div>		</li>
