			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I live in Barcelona and when I first moved here and had a stronger accent, the doctors always offered to switch to English, not realising that actually going to the doctors is the single easiest thing to do in Spanish because the words are all the same, except for things like basic organs which had Germanic names, so kidney becomes riñón which is easy to remember because it sounds like renal, the adjective. Lungs similarly are pulmones, the brain is el cerebro etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the main reason why Latin is still taught today. A lot of the world was colonized by Roman Catholics, who generally run the education system. Even in those developed countries which have since mostly taken the religious influences out of the public schooling system (such as Canada), those developments didn't occur until just a few decades ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's interesting to think how the words we use to define and interpret Latin <em>are</em> changing, though, and what (if any) effects that has on our interpretation of these Latin constants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>French and english got slammed together in 1060. It mixed Germanic anglosaxon with old french (which was functionally latin). Now both English and french (but more so english) are bastard languages.</p>
<p>Which is fitting cause william the bastard was the french guy who conquered england.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't get slammed together, the influence of Middle French on Middle English is mostly lexical, grammatically or syntacticly speaking, there was barely any impact, any recent-ish studies have even claimed that the influence is less than we thought. </p>
<p>Going the other way though, while French, like most of the other languages in the area had extended Areal contact with Germanic languages, it again (and to a lesser extent) manifests itself solely as lexical borrowings, and not really in a way more significantly than the other romance languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language" target="_blank">Anglo-Norman</a> was the form of French that was most involved in England (obvious by the name), but modern French is not solely descend from Norman French or anything.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, French was the result of the Germanic and Celtic tribes of Gaul adopting Latin as their language. For whatever reason, they seem to have adopted it less strictly than other Mediterranean peoples. Then, the Vikings came and added a lot of influence as well. They were later known as Normans. </p>
<p>The French (Norman) invasion of England had berry little effect on the French language, but a huge effect on English. </p></div>		</li>
