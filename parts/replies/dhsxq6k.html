			<div class="markdown"><p>verizon tried to tell me that if i had dish internet (they were trying to sell me on that over cable, hah) that i would have a dedicated internet line.  I quickly broke down to the guy on the phone how that's bullshit and he was trying to tell me that it would be faster than cable.  There is no fucking way my ping would be lower sending a signal to space and back versus using a cable locally</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, network engineer here. Just want to clarify something. Satellite, as you pointed out, has high latency.</p>
<p>Technically, bandwidth and latency are separate things. Bandwidth is how many 1s and 0s per second a transmission medium can handle, latency is how long it takes for those 1s and 0s to go from one place to another.</p>
<p>That <em>said</em>, depending upon the protocol you're using, latency can affect <em>throughput</em>, which is your effective, or actually-achievable bandwidth. Pretty much anything that uses TCP (which re-sends lost data to ensure that you always receive what you asked for) over a high latency connection will see drastic degradation in achievable throughput, essentially rendering you unable to actually use all of your advertised bandwidth with a single data stream. This is because the protocol has to keep checking back with the other side to confirm that all of the data was received, thus spending a lot of time waiting on responses instead of slinging 1s and 0s. (This is known as as ACK-pacing and its impact upon TCP bandwidth-delay product.) </p>
<p>The only way around that is to open enough simultaneous TCP connections that they can all add up to closely equal your available bandwidth (or as close as you can get with protocol header overhead). So that's one reason why satellite sucks, it might give you a reasonable amount of bandwidth on paper but unless you're running a lot of simultaneous data streams, chances are that you won't be able to actually see your actual throughput reach a reasonable percentage of that bandwidth in a single data transfer.</p>
<p>TCP handles the vast majority of data connections on the internet. But, let's say that you're not using TCP. Most video games or VOIP use UDP, which is basically a protocol that offers no guarantees that you'll get what you asked for, it just flings data across the internet and hopes it makes it to you. Problem here is that you almost always use UDP in situations where you don't have time to check, as TCP does, to see if you got the data. So, most UDP application data is latency-sensitive, making satellite once again a poor choice.</p>
<p>Satellite is thus only really good for low-bandwidth TCP connections like basic web browsing, high-count connections like torrenting, or non-latency-sensitive UDP connections like... uhhhh... well, I'm sure I'll think of something.</p>
<p>EDIT - DHCP! You can get an IP address assigned to your router via UDP perfectly fine over satellite. After that... good luck with everything else! :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's SPACE. To do anything in space is super sci-fi so automatically must be way better.</p>
<p>But seriously, if anyone ever runs in to this bullshit, ask them why - if satellites are so much better - the audio quality for satellite radio is horrendous compared to terrestrial radio, and why should you believe it would be any better for internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bungee cord analogy is really spot on. The stretch that is provided keeps us bound tight to the companies for service and worse yet when that bungee snaps it is us who gets the flying hook to the eyes and face which means we again have to bail out a broken system. With what? More bungee cords!! And money.  </p>
<p>The reality is that there is so much smoke and so many mirrors if they truly did improve we might actually break the fragile systems already in place. </p>
