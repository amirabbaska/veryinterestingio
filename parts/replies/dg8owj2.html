			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't at all. It shows compete ignorance of human development. If we killed 99 (realistically more) out of every 100 people and destroyed all modern facilities and implements, all you'd have is stone tools and stuff you could grow. You'd be &quot;green&quot; because you'd just be one of extremely few people, not able to extract resources and not able to do much damage. Make no mistake, those people had no clue what was going on.  They figured out how to survive. If you gave them a farm and a car and showed them how to use them, they'd be burning gas and depleting nutrients from the soil in a matter of days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our ancestors rarely lived in harmony with the other species of Earth. That's why we are the dominant species on the planet today. Just as we do today, ancient humans gained their advantage through the manipulation of their environment. The best example I can think of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire" target="_blank">Native Americans</a> use of fire to clear massive areas of forest (mainly to established tribal borders, grazing land for buffalo, and prevent larger environmental fires). Our ancestors were not really much different then we are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I wonder is where do people get the idea that prehistoric humans lived in harmony with nature. A more sensible assumption would be that they simply lacked the population and technology to make a noticeable impact on the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I'm not an interstellar galactic conquerer, for example. It's not because I naturally seek to confine myself to the cradle of humanity, it's because I cant afford a car that cost more than two peanuts with salt, let alone a spaceship.</p>
<p>If I had the ability to blow up stars, you bet your monoplanetary ass I'd do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually your second statement was basically what I intended to imply by &quot;living in harmony&quot;, I should've went more in depth in the first place.
Why is it do you think the population was at a sustainable level for hundreds of thousands of years, then suddenly skyrocketed and doubled faster and faster in the last 10,000 years or so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We skyrocketed because we climbed on top of the food chain, mainly. Sure, discovering technology to lengthen our lives helped, but any animal lacking predators will consume resources and multiply until it will no longer be able to do so for one reason or another. There's nothing harmonious about nature, it's all just a stampeding race for survival. You made it sound like something transcendental or spiritual, when it's nothing like it.</p>
<p>Being unable to cause major imbalance to the environment is not what I would call harmony. Neither would I say that wild animals are in harmony; they just eat and evade each other into balance. It's far from what I would consider harmonious.</p></div>		</li>
