			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first heard about meteoric iron, I imagined some rich people might collect them and melt them into a stronger sword than what others were able to make. I don't even know if swords and iron fit when it comes to the historical timelines of metallurgy and warfare, but would that have been possible? Were there ever enough meteoric iron available to one rich person to be able to melt it into something superior to what others were able to attain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously we don't know for sure, but it would fit. A weapon made out of pieces of nickel-iron meteorite would be so much better than a copper or bronze weapon (or one made out of bloomery iron, for that matter) that it wouldn't be a stretch for the weapon's owner to start making claims about its magic properties. This would only be something a particularly rich leader would be able to afford, though. there's very little meteoric iron to work with, a weapon made from the stuff would've been unbelievably valuable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a kris (a kind of fighting knife) in a museum that was half smelted iron, half meteoric iron. The nickel made the fine layers of pattern welding visible in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>Nickel also alters the temperature at which Austenite is stable in iron alloys; if one already had a good steel alloy, and brought it to a temperature where one alloy was Austenite, and the other was not, a)carbide precipitates would gradually dissolve as carbon diffused into the more-soluble alloy, and more importantly b)quenching to Martensite would harden some layers, while leaving the rest in a more malleable ferrite phase. This would give a combination of hard layers (to hold an edge) and less-hard ones (to absorb damage to the blade).</p>
<p>Any blade that is folded several times likely has this same strategy, but likely does so by controlling carbon content (and therefore, ability to even form Martensite); the whole blade is austenitic at the time of quenching. This is tricky, because carbon diffuses through ferrous alloys relatively quickly (as seen in carburization); there's a limit to how thin a layer might practically be.</p>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion that manganese might have been used to similar effect in some cases, but nickel would do the trick just fine. Some legendary swords were said to shine brighter when polished, and/or to be made of &quot;star metal&quot;, which might suggest a nickel alloy; if a sword formed a green patina, that might indicate manganese. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right right; stonework preceded metalwork and it's not a big leap to imagine there are stone + fire technologies that have long been lost, just as damascus steel is not perfectly understood, as an example of metalwork that is not well understood.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, we have the same problem now:</p>
<p>We know very well how to refine aluminum using electrolysis. In principle, the same method can be used on titanium. Yet it's too hot and dangerous on a big industrial scale. Some time in the future, titanium will be widely used everywhere since it combines the low weight of aluminum with the strength of iron.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i.e. The use of tungsten as a cutting tool was a huge boon in mass production even though the tools didn't necessarily change. </p>
<p>Similar material changes may make other processes safer/allow reaction chambers to operate at higher temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ore is inexpensive, but is a byproduct of iron smelting.</p>
<p>The big expense is energy, which I expect will continue to get more expensive.</p>
<p>Current methods also require a lot of high-skilled labor, which seems to be poised to become as cheap as it ever has been, or ever will be (a historic bubble of student loans, and a huge dip in science/engineering investment in both the public and private sector).</p>
<p>Fun fact: the SR-71 was made of titanium purchased from the USSR. Nowhere else in the world had the combination of abundant energy and high-skilled labor to make large quantities of low-oxygen titanium; it was worth trading with an enemy in order to get the stuff for US spy planes. And you might notice that US luxury goods made with the stuff (computer cases and the like) only got popular after the Iron Curtain fell.</p></div>		</li>
