			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me, but I feel the burning/tingling in a lower spot. If you run your finger along your jawline until you hit the &quot;corner&quot; of your jaw, close to your ear; I get it right in there, like just inside the jaw. Any reason for the difference? I'd do some research of my own but I don't wanna end up having cancer again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that maybe smelling food a few minutes before eating it might help? If the issue is because of saliva production, and just smelling good food can cause saliva to be produced, maybe doing that would &quot;prime&quot; your salivary glands so they don't have to work as hard once you actually start eating? </p>
<p>I don't experience this sensation myself, so I can't test it. If somebody who this happens to a lot wants to try this and lets us know, it would be very helpful feedback!</p></div>		</li>
