<p>It's been a while since I've done hypersonic flow work, but if I remember correctly the only thing I'd disagree with is you don't want a shock at the exit plane, you don't want a shock at all because like /u/22x4 said a shock equals extra energy that could've been used. But again it's been a while so they could very well be right. </p>
<p>Also worth noting is not ALL exhaust nozzles look like that. They are usually optimized for a range of 'atmospheric pressures' I put that in quotes because as you ascend in your launch you will see different atmospheric back pressures because, well, pressure decreases as you rise in altitude. </p>
<p>Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the aerospike because it's the coolest rocket nozzle ever, and these are FACTS... If you disagree I'll fight you for it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks for explanations, both of you. It seems that everyone here has a good knowledge of thermodynamics and fluidmechanics. </p>
<p>Today I had thermodynamic lecture and we started studying mass flow in open systems. So naturally, at the end of the lecture we took a very quick and basic look at some open system devices (turbines, compressors, nozzles and diffusors). After the lecture I asked teacher why rocket engine exhaust is shaped like bell and he was not sure, told me he is gonna take a look at it. So then I just made a topic on reddit and in like 20 minutes I've got an answer :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he might mean that you want to have one of those ideal extremely weak shocks, just in the way that you're supposed to ideally have an extremely weak shock at the choke point in your de Laval nozzle (or actually veeeery close to the choke point for maximum efficiency but not quite there or else the shock would be swallowed in or unstable). So if your shock is infinitely or extremely weak, you're getting your exit flow as fast as possible without being supersonic, or just marginally so... Kind of somewhere in the middle. If you look at shock tables you'll find the total pressure loss approaches zero as you get closer to Mach 1 for this kind of flow. Please correct me if I'm wrong because I don't remember well. Sorry for long answer.</p></div>		</li>
