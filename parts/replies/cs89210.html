			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a stereotype that has some truth but is far from being universally correct. To say that all of Asia lacks innovation is just wrong. Companies like Samsung and Sony easily compete with the with their Western counterparts. 5 of the top 10 automotive companies with the highest revenue are Asian. Toyota in particular is world famous for having an innovative and efficient manufacturing system that produces relative high quality, reliable cars with competitive pricing. Pretty much every month on /r/cars somebody links to a chart that lists car companies and their failure rates with Lexus (the luxury division of Toyota) always coming out on top, beating luxury European brands such as Mercedes Benz and BMW. I frequently see mentioned on reddit that many companies attempt to copy the &quot;continuous improvement&quot; or &quot;kaizen&quot; manufacturing method of Toyota. These are just two industries that I personally have some knowledge of where Asian companies do just as well as Western ones and I'm sure there must be more.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sure, India and China crap out engineers and computer scientists, and yeah, they're getting better. But they're good at reverse-engineering western things or straight up copying. They understand architecture very well, but developing it themselves won't really happen&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>just because they've been to an Asian uni? So if you've been to an American Uni you are in a position to critique the whole of American engineering/IT... <em>riiiight</em>. </p>
<p>Besides, this argument has been around for decades, sometimes it holds weight and sometimes it is little more than the kid who failed crying, &quot;Tests ain't for me mayn, I'm all about that critical thinking&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And how they conceived Lexus in the first place was pretty interesting. When Toyota initially entered the US market, they sold barebones, super cheap cars, like within the $15,000 range. The quality for price of their cars gained them a huge market share in the US, and they were willing to take losses for up to 10 years, selling cheap cars. They only had to do 7 years before raising prices and adding options.</p>
<p>When surveys found that there were no cars that satisfied the mid-salary range, which used to be ~$30,000 cars (there only existed the super cheap value cars and the Roles Royce opposite end of the spectrum) Toyota and a few other companies tried releasing within the next year car models that sold within those ranges, and it was ultimately a failure. The reason no one responded with these new car models were that the public perception of these companies were already so low (imagine buying a Kia or something similar today for $30,000!). So, instead, they released them under a new name Lexus, and everyone ate it up. Even if people knew they were under the same company Toyota, no one cared because it gave the <em>image</em> of a luxery brand.</p>
<p>Although, other companies did the same move within a relatively similar timespan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the Japanese approach to education is significantly different from the approach in the countries that OP is presumably talking about--Japanese kids study hard, yeah, but the stereotype about them is more about working too hard at jobs, not about working too hard/cheating a lot in school and then not being good at their job. I think there's some merit in what he says if you apply it to China/to South Korea (and if you tone it down, obviously; there are innovative and brilliant thinkers in every country on earth), even though south korea produced samsung.</p>
<p>Your response also conflates corporate success and academic success, which are two very very different things.</p>
<p>OP overstated his case and used &quot;Asian&quot; pretty broadly tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at world university rankings, you'll see that Japan and Korea are one of the few Asian countries with at least one university in the top 50. I'd say that there is a direct relationship between corporate and academic success. It's not like you can compete with world leaders in the technology and automotive industry without having received a high quality tertiary education in the relevant field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was an English teacher at a public school in Korea.  At the end of each semester, I would give a conversation test that accounted for 15% of the student's grade.  It was just 5 minutes, just asking basic questions if the student was more nervous, but asking more complex things if the student more comfortable (some were very chatty).  One girl could barely answer the questions &quot;how are you?&quot; and &quot;what are your hobbies?&quot;and her answers had horrible grammar.  I gave her a low score.  </p>
<p>A few days later, my co-teacher came to me, convinced I had made a mistake because that girl was the top English student in her year.  They didn't know how I could give Juyeon, who was a very average English student, a perfect store, but give the top student a terrible score.  I told them that the first girl might be able to answer multiple choice perfectly but that didn't mean she was a better speaker.  I was a conversation and culture teacher--it didn't matter what happened in their other classes.  They were pretty upset with me. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an English teacher in China.</p>
<p>When I was first employed, along with some other foreigners, they asked us to teach to the tests and we refused to do it. What we told them was, in the first year students <em>may</em> do better on the &quot;exam&quot; if they have the answers memorised, but every year after that they will do increasingly worse, as instead of having the necessary groundwork to build upon they will instead just have memorised answers. It took a lot of arguing before we were able to convince them of this; one of the things they told us was &quot;But all the other schools will be doing it...&quot;.  We won in the end because we flat out refused to do it anyway. </p>
<p>Over the years, as you might expect, our approach has proven to be correct. Our school has a great reputation now; every year at sign up time we have lines of parents forming outside for hours (Sometimes they start queuing at dawn) and our students have grown from 150ish to more than 500.</p>
<p>Students from our school - even average students - have gone to other schools and been top in English. The parents have been very proud of this because they think think their child has &quot;improved&quot; at the other school. A few months later they are back with us; the parents have realised that the reason they were &quot;top&quot; in the other school is because the English level is much lower there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, nice!  It sounds like we had similar experiences, actually.  I worked in a very blue-collar area of Seoul, where my kids didn't get nearly the same opportunities as their wealthy peers on the east side.  But my district really, reaaally started focusing on English and having high standards during my time there.  My principal was all for it, too, so I got an amazing classroom and great resources.  And of my students went on to win the Seoul-wide English speech contest during my last year there, which was a nice bragging right considering my expat friends who worked in Gangnam assumed their kids would wipe the floor with my broke, &quot;uncultured&quot; kids.  I was really happy to help contribute to that area.  </p>
<p>I guess a lot just comes down to the differences in Western vs. Eastern education.  My Korean kids were way better at art, music, dancing, and were fantastic test-takers.  There is a lot of creativity in the kids that can be nurtured as long as they don't have a school that still enforces the rules with whipping sticks and &quot;I'm right, you're wrong, so just keep your head down&quot; attitude that some sadly still have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I just want to share something even though it probably doesn't apply directly to the situation you are describing.  </p>
<p>I had a really atypical home/family life as a teenager and I've never had very common hobbies.  I found foreign language classes EXTREMELY frustrating in high school and college because sometimes the culture and family questions that are supposed to be easy are only easy if the student fits into certain preconceptions.  </p>
<p>I could handle it now that I'm a little older by just making up some common bullshit, like, &quot;oh yeah, I know my dad likes golf because he's totally an alive person that talks to me,&quot; and not overthinking it, but I wish language teachers would be more sensitive that sometimes questions like &quot;how are you?&quot; and &quot;what are your hobbies?&quot; can be the hardest possible questions for some students who could do really well with non personal conversation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trust me, I could ask &quot;what color is your hair?&quot; Or &quot;what is your favorite food?&quot; and still get nothing.  Some kids just freeze up and don't know how to answer, and while I'm sympathetic, I'm not going to give them an A if they couldn't answer a single question.  Grades are not about feelings.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They weren't thrilled the first time I did it, but as it kept happening, they were more chill about it.  A few were really gungho about it, actually, as they were younger teachers and disliked the idea of giving undeserving kids good grades.  </p>
<p>I get why the school was upset.  All their previous English teachers did whatever they wanted and made their school look good on paper.  I can't lie and say i didn't have a bumpy start with my first few months at that school, but by the time I left, I was actually pretty proud of what I had accomplished, and my school was really thrilled, as well.  I went back to visit a few years later and the principal begged me to come back--said they'd pay me extra under the table, I could have double the vacation days, etc.  Honestly, I thought about it.  The Korean school system can really beat you down and make you feel like nothing is worth it, so I was hesitant.  I ended up getting into my current career right after the visit so I didn't take him up on the offer, but I did value the work that I did there during those few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I've done my masters in Asia, actually within IT. Some of my classmates who barely spoke comprehensible English are getting high grades on certain topics because they can essentially memorize a whole textbook + the lecturers slides. The trade-off is, however, that they have no clue whatsoever about the subject... Essentially, the <em>why</em> behind it all - which, in my mind, is what university is all about, is simply not there. It's about getting high marks - anything else it irrelevant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The rote learning has become a bit of a ridiculous situation. In some countries kids will wake up, go to school, go straight to tuition centres until 8pm, and then go home and sleep. It's a crazy business and in Singapore its become a billion dollar industry: <a href="http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/1-billion-spent-tuition-one-year" target="_blank">http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/1-billion-spent-tuition-one-year</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having experienced to high school in both Australia and South Korea, I agree 100%. There is no coursework that requires any original thinking or research assignments in Korea, and 'studying' tend to be simply solving enough examples and questions for math or whatever to answer the question, instead of actually understanding how to solve such question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a Canadian University and get to see people from China and India do our PhD programs. Save for an exceptional few that really are excellent, it becomes pretty obvious that the majority have no ability to think or do work for themselves. Usually these people have excellent English so it's not a language barrier thing when it comes to communicating. PI's love them though because they'll do exactly what they're told all the time without critically thinking about the experiments or the direction the project is taking.</p>
<p>As for the undergraduates I TA, most just want to get in to professional programs. Actually learning the subject material isn't important to them. The undergrads in my lab (very Med school focused) are shocked that I actually <em>remember</em> subject matter from an undergrad class I took nearly a decade ago. Apparently memorize and flush is OK so long as you get an A in the class. The fact that they might very well become doctors or dentists scares the hell out of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 (social structure, memorization, lack of critical thinking) - albeit good students do learn concepts and gain knowledge well, they almost never come up with new paradigms or develop lateral thinking. A lot of students get to top university because of head start alone... wonder how many of them have lost a childhood in the rat race. Western universities encourage diversity in background, personality (interests, hobbies), cross-discipline, etc which produces feedback rich environment and new schools of thought and innovation.</p>
<p>Ex:
A student who memorizes log(2) = 0.3010 and arrives at the answer earlier than others in a timed test, gets ahead in a physics test. More points awarded for the correct answer than the correct approach. </p>
<p>A student who draws a good picture of human heart and labels the parts correctly gets more points than a student who does not draw the picture well in a Biology test. </p>
