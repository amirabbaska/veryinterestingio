			<div class="markdown"><p>It was still a better and more complete answer than most on this thread. Sometimes you just have to deal with the fact that sometimes explanations get complicated regardless of the audience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brackets usually complement technical writing more than others. It provides further explanation without framing it in its own sentence. This cuts down words and is easier for our brains to interpret. Without brackets you have to read an entire sentence in order to understand every part of it; sometimes this means retaining info from the beginning and modifying it as you read on. Brackets usually overcome this, such that you can read things at face value.</p>
<p>So even in your example, the brackets sentence was probably the most direct and easiest to understand. Commas mean retaining and modifying past information. It can also be read that bit faster. It's not as pleasurable to read, but it does the job. It's consequently a bit informal. It's not really an example of using them for definitions though, which the parent comment also did. It would be much longer winded to take them out and so less clear.</p></div>		</li>
