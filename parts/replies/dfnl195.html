			<div class="markdown"><p>The lecturers at my university are all very supportive of wood as a building material. Other than the light weight to strength ratio, sustainably sourced wood is also actually one of the most eco-friendly building material. It basically acts as a carbon sink, and also cuts down on the emissions from cement. Plus it has one of the lowest embodied energy (total energy required from extraction to consumption). </p>
<p>One of them even went as far as to say concrete is the building material of the 21st century, but wood will be the building material of the 22nd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy from FPinnovations canada that was at the woodlot confrence i was at went as far as saying that in terms of fire damage a wood building will actually last longer during a bad fire. the outside will char and take longer to break down whereas the steel will melt and collapse (i'm not a scientist don't ask me to further explain this)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not exactly sure about the comparison, but both of those statements have some basis of truth to them. </p>
<p>For those wondering why wood actually won't feed the flame, the wood that's usually referred to are cross laminated/glulam wood. It's basically just layers of wood that are stuck together with special glue that helps to improve it's properties, such as removing the difference between the performance along and against the grain of the wood. This layering also helps to slow down the burning, and have been proven to be pretty fire resistant. </p>
<p>And with regards to the steel beam, it does not need to melt, only soften sufficiently (which it does as it heats up) for the load to cause yielding and collapse. That is why for concrete structures there is a certain restrictions to the thickness of the concrete as on fire resistance duration. It's to insulate the steel reinforcement from the flames to reduce risk of failure. </p>
<p>So I could see that potentially could be the case. Of course there's a bunch of down side to wood, particularly with regards to durability in wet conditions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read about &quot;biochar&quot; where they convert the trees to charcoal then mix it in with soil. It's supposed to sequester a portion of the carbon while making soil more fertile. Junk science or legitimate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legit. Burning wood without oxygen this is supposed to help after harvest adding nutrients to soils supposedly it adds a significant amount of nutrients I heard. Super legit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome! I read part of the reason it works so well is while returning nutrients to the soil charcoal also has a ton of microscopic pockets that make room for soil bacteria to take up residence and they go to work in the soil like a good microbe should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in North Pole, Alaska. The local greenies have the ear of the local government. They are tightening the screws on people that burn wood to stay warm. The EPA is hammering away at wood burning too.
Wood is certainly renewable, emits the same amount of carbon if it's burned in stove, a wildfire, or if it decays over time. But woodburners are labeled as inconsiderate assholes who are poisoning their neighbors.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood burning does cause pollution (non CO2 emissions) because it's usually not done so very efficiently. A yellow flame means you're making soot and smoke and even with air induction it's harder to get wood to burn as cleanly because it doesn't atomize into a gas.</p></div>		</li>
