			<div class="markdown"><p>Rigor is due to the release of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle cells upon death. This causes the sliding filaments (myosin and actin) that allow muscle contraction to take place to interact thereby causing contraction of the muscle. Hence the stiffness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat! I was taught that rigor mortis was because ATP is needed to release muscles, just like it is needed to flex muscles. After death, no more ATP = no more muscle release. Until decomposition occurs, and then the bonds break and the muscle releases.</p>
<p>I always found this answer to be a bit weird because otherwise, extreme fatigue would result in muscles being stuck in a flexed position. And that doesn't seem right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also true. First you get contracted muscles from influx of calcium. Some ATP already present will relax the contraction right away but once the ATP is used up the body cannot relax these muscles. The structure of the muscle fibers eventually decomposes, which releases the contraction </p>
<p>When you are alive your muscles will produce ATP even when you are extremely fatigued </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your brain decides to flex a muscle, calcium is released from the shipping center of muscle cells (fibers) to the little hairs that pull other fibers. This makes them pull together and allows your limbs to move. When your brain decides to relax, calcium gets reabsorbed and the fibers go back to their flaccid state. When the calcium isn't reabsorbed, the muscle stays flexed, like with lockjaw, and in this case rigor mortis.</p></div>		</li>
