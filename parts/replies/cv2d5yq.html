<p>Gotta go with women making this call.  In some stores, there are walls of pants with pockets that women can choose from.  They're located in the men's section.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We use inches for men's clothing, and women are the same as the US, except the numbers start higher. I think an American size 0 is a UK 4. </p>
<p>I think our shoes are the same too, but 1 number out. </p>
<p>But we get imports sometimes, so there are often conversion charts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the record, men's waist sizes aren't supposed to match the dimensions of the pant &quot;waistband,&quot; and it's not because of vanity sizing: it's because men do not wear their pants on their waists. </p>
<p>A &quot;32&quot; simply means, this is a pant that should be worn by a person with a 32&quot; waist and with the body shape the designer made them for and sitting down on the hips the amount that the designer intends. So, it may be actually 34&quot; wide so that they sit a little down on the hips, or maybe even 35&quot; and sit lower (and will have correspondingly smaller &quot;rise&quot; - the distance from crotch to waistband).</p>
<p>Different brands &quot;32&quot; will be different because they are designed for different body types. One might be for people with 32&quot; waists that aren't athletic at all and have basically the same size hips. So that &quot;32&quot; is going to be actually close to 32&quot;. Another brand may be for athletic guys with low body fat and this no fat around the stomach and who may have a 32&quot; waist but 38&quot; hips. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This makes a lot of sense, but is there any evidence for it? <a href="http://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/a8386/pants-size-chart-090710/" target="_blank">This article</a> seems to disagree with your hypothesis, and my limited Google-fu isn't able to find any corroborating evidence, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of it depends on the material. 32&quot; inch waist will always fit me, but with jeans I have to wear a belt or else they'll slide off. With dress pants, there's no need for the belt</p>
<p>But generally, I will notice a difference in the size between manufacturers. For instance, (and I might be mixing this up) my Calvin Klein jeans are more tighter fitting than Levi's. I'm sure a huge factor also depends on which fit you're going for, ie baggy vs slim fit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's exactly the same reason that OP says is the reason for women's pants only having one size number.</p>
<p>The smaller the number, the &quot;better.&quot;  If your a size 34 at one store, but a size 36 at another, that first store makes you feel skinnier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It  could be caused by shrinkage, variations in the process, or just low quality control.  Some manufacturers may make a 32 a bit bigger so that when washed it shrinks to a 32.  Also depending on the fit they may sit a bit higher or lower.</p>
<p>Maybe there's more variation and vanity sizing in &quot;fashionable&quot;  jeans?  Your generic, all purpose jeans are all the same +/- a few percent in my experience.  I've been the same size and weight for two decades and can still wear the same pants.  I have some ratty jeans that are older than most redditors and they still fit the same as new ones more or less.  </p></div>		</li>
