			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, in case OP is curious about coordinates used on spacecraft or by people working with spacecraft, the answer is similar, with different details: many different coordinate systems are used, depending on the application.</p>
<p>The article <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/quora/a-nasa-engineer-explains_b_6649698.html" target="_blank">A NASA Engineer Explains How You Give Directions in Space</a> gives a nice overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is no single universal frame that is used for all operations. Typically, the reference frame that most simplifies the mathematics and visualization is used for a particular objective. For example, just for the International Space Station (ISS), we use more than 15 reference frames.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to describe some of the major ones. Note that many of them are relative to a spacecraft itself, e.g. starboard and port, or Cartesian coordinates using (X,Y,Z) values to identify a location within a craft like the ISS.</p>
<p>Spacecraft that are operating around some planet or moon will typically rely heavily on a coordinate system that's centered on that body. Or, when traveling between planets, they tend also to use a coordinate system centered on the Sun, which typically means using the <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/ICRS_doc.php" target="_blank">International Celestial Reference System</a> (ICRS). ICRS is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic_coordinate_system" target="_blank">ecliptic coordinate system</a>, centered on the center of mass of the solar system - the barycenter - and fixed against distant stars, i.e. it's not affected by relative movement of the planets. In this system, the ecliptic is treated like the equator is on Earth, and there's a north and south pole that's along a line that extends in both directions at 90 degrees from the ecliptic plane.</p>
<p>(Aside: the barycenter of the Solar System <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iSR3Yw6FXo" target="_blank">moves around as the planets and Sun move</a>, but by fixing the coordinate system on the barycenter, that motion is accounted for. In ICRS, the Sun orbits the barycenter just like the planets do, although the barycenter is sometimes inside the Sun, but also sometimes outside its photosphere, i.e. &quot;surface&quot; of the Sun, as the linked video shows.)</p>
<p>In ICRS, north and south still have something like their standard meaning - anything on the side of the ecliptic plane where Earth's north pole points is considered north of the ecliptic. Earth's axis is tilted by 23.5 degrees relative to the ecliptic, so it's not parallel to the north ecliptic axis, but the position of the north/south ecliptic axis and pole is just a line 90 degrees from the ecliptic plane, that intersects the solar system barycenter.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're far out in space, you may have no idea which way Earth's axis is pointing, so you can't use that as a way to figure out which direction is north of the ecliptic. But that's why ICRS is fixed on the distant stars. The North ecliptic pole is always in the stellar constellation Draco, and the south ecliptic pole is always in Dorado. There are some diagrams on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_pole" target="_blank">this page</a>. These constellations are pointed to by the ecliptic north/south axis. So if you can identify some stars, you can orient yourself within ICRS.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there any systems that are intergalactic? I think the Voyager's include maps to our solar system or something to that effect, but say we wanted to give coordinates to identify our location. Does such a system exist? If so, does it include a time coordinate to account for the expansion of space?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are, I believe, thinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque" target="_blank">pioneer plaque</a>, an illustration that was included with both the Pioneer 10 and 11 vehicles. </p>
<p>Among other things, they attempt to include a map of Earth's location within the galaxy (this map was also etched on the top of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWeI-HUL8ZA" target="_blank">Voyager Golden Record</a>). They did so by charting the sun's location relative to fourteen different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar" target="_blank">pulsars</a>. Pulsars are a type of neutron star that emits a beam of EM radiation, which is observable at precise and consistent intervals. The plaque attempts to identify the individual pulsars by this interval, which should not be dependent on where the finding species is from. Once they identify enough pulsars, they should be able to triangulate our Sun's location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do they use right ascension (RA) instead of Greenwich Hour Angle  (GHA) or the Sidereal Hour Angle (SHA)? For celestial navigation, GHA and SHA are much more commonly used than RA, so why do astronomers differ and use RA? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In celnav for mariners, from what I can remember, RA is used for star identification. Think it was something like 360-RA equals SHA. I would imagine astronomers have to use GHA, SHA and LHA in a similar way as a navigator in order to find the position of a celestial body from there observatory but to line their telescopes at the right spot in the sky they would need the RA. I can recall using RA in determining where a star would be on the celestial sphere during nautical twilight. Celestial wasnâ€™t my strong spot at the academy though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well certain star charts use RA, but the nautical almanac relies upon SHA for everything. And yeah you're right about 360-RA=SHA. SHA is measured westward from the first point of aries and RA is the opposite of that, measured eastward from the first point of aries.</p></div>		</li>
