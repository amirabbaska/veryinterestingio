			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, it will take a long time though. In fact, if you left two crystals next to each other they would eventually mix just like two liquids (assuming they are miscible in each other). It would just take an unimaginable amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure; you can even estimate the expected time via L^(2)/D, where L is the distance and D is the self-diffusivity coefficient (which you can look up for various materials online). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew that - but I remain amazed at the fact doped silicon can be created and remain useful for so long, often at elevated temperatures. The diffusivity coefficient must be incredibly low for chips to operate as they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically (and in practice too) atoms can pass through each other. They're not really solid in the way that a brick is solid, and are probably better understood as clouds that <em>mostly</em> repel each other. It doesn't happen very often, but it's possible and it does happen often enough that you can measure the effect. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">quantum tunneling</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even without tunneling, there is some small measure of diffusion where atoms move into vacancies in the crystal lattice. Just thinking of atoms as solid balls, you could still theoretically see an atom move from one side of a block to another over a long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes- in addition, there is always a small fraction of lattice sites that are vacant.  These vacancies travel around when neighboring atoms move in to fill them.  Other types of imperfections in the lattice structure (dislocations) also may be mobile and allow atoms to shift small distances as they pass through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even at room temperature in a solid steel block, some atoms will move through these imperfections. The rate at which they move is very low (but it still happens) at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it can become a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is due to defects, yes, but not the aspects of them that have been mentioned. A single crystal domain is weak at certain angles - both in stiffness and in ultimate strength. If you get smaller domains, then it works out that the stiffness is higher, but the ultimate strength is lower.</p></div>		</li>
