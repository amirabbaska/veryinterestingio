The gist seemed to be that friction increased when you pressed harder, and when you pressed harder more of the skin was in contact, therefore having more skin in contact increases friction. But they didn't compare the friction to skin without fingerprints. I would suggest that the skin on the back of your hands has much less friction than the skin on the front of your hands, and it's way too complicated to just try to boil down to a linear relationship with surface area in contact.   </p>
<p>Also, in reference to the original question, Of course the fingerprints change. They get bigger. :-P</p></div>		</li>

<p>They help by telling you where to apply pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah surely the considerations would be the same as for car tyres. Big bald tyres are ideal for dry smooth concrete or asphalt tracks but obviously not for rough rally tracks, mud, ice etc where very deep tread has far better traction. Is this just because the cars don't have enough down force though? Would an incredibly heavy car with bald tyres be ideal on all terrain? Perhaps it is really just pressure that matters. We need an engineer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, more surface area isn't more friction. More (normal force)*(mu)[friction co-efficient) = more friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have gotten this in your google search, but the gripping in water hypothesis has interesting biological support. Strangely, your fingers &quot;pruning&quot; in water is an active and intentional process. It seems to be controlled by the nervous system rather than a passive osmotic process as was previously thought. This was first noticed in people who have amputated and re-attached fingers. When they put their hand underwater, the re-attached finger doesn't prune up like the others. Re-attachment involves the repair of blood vessels, tendons, and muscles, but does not repair the nerves to your finger.  So it seems like your central nervous system controls pruning underwater. While this doesn't prove that the point of fingerprints is underwater gripping, it seems like a pretty intricate system to just be a coincidence!</p></div>		</li>
