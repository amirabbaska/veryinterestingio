<p>Regarding avians, the answer is yes, to varying degrees. In some cases, a bird can become so dependent on interaction with a caretaker that they become hysteric with just a few hours of solitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention that birds are some of the most intelligent animals, beating domestic dogs/cats in many sorts of tests. The wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_intelligence" target="_blank">bird intelligence</a> gives a good summary. Among bird species you can observe some of these animals forming massive flocks, performing elaborate courtship rituals, mating for life, spending long amounts of time and effort raising their young, and communicating with a surprising amount of complexity. Many species of crow and parrot can solve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DMjoqzPcP0" target="_blank">difficult puzzles</a>. It shouldn't be very surprising that many bird species can recognize humans and form some level of social attachment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You raise a good point, but I think you go slightly too far. The only creatures capable of passing the mirror test are social ones, and the most advanced tool use (e.g. - using a tool to make a tool) is restricted to social birds and mammals - so I would say you can get pretty smart as an asocial species, but not quite to the same level a social species might. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A conversation I can actually help with! The University of Washington did a study with Crows to see if parent Crows would teach their babies to be wary of students wearing masks.
When they walked by normally without masks, the crows didn't react. When they walked by with masks the parent crows swooped to attack. When the babies grew up (One survived if I remember) when the mask came on, the once baby bird now a full grown adult with her own babies swooped in for the attack! </p>
<p>I'm on mobile so I would link it but they do have a documentary on YouTube and it was on the news for a bit here.
In fact here in Everett, WA the Police Station has a nest that Police Officers have to be wary of because the Crows will knock off their hats.
Birds are very smart. Scary smart. </p>

And Crows: Smarter Than You Think with UW Professor John Marzluff. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8w34QnU1sYWhich" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8w34QnU1sYWhich</a> is his lecture. He also did a TedX talk of the same name.
They are very well done and very fascinating for anyone who wants to watch (or listen). </p></div>		</li>

<p>What's missing from the description in the comment above is that the crows were captured, banded and released by investigators wearing the mask, providing a reason to think negatively of someone wearing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have my own personal theory that animals that move in three dimensions have a propensity toward, and higher ceiling for, intelligence. Parrots, ravens, dolphins, octopi, cuddle-fish, arboreal primates, etc. I also think we vastly underestimate the cognitive abilities of fish, as an aquarist.</p></div>		</li>
