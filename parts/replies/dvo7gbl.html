<p>&quot; In a 1992 paper, Hawking uses the metaphorical device of a &quot;Chronology Protection Agency&quot; as a personification of the aspects of physics that make time travel impossible at macroscopic scales, thus apparently preventing time paradoxes. He says:</p>
<p>It seems that there is a Chronology Protection Agency which prevents the appearance of closed timelike curves and so makes the universe safe for historians&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That should be as old as the proof that GR can be formulated as an

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hole-War-Stephen-Mechanics/dp/0316016411" target="_blank">The Black Hole War</a>, Stephen Hawking made a deliberately provocative comment in a small physics symposium that, if Professor Hawking was right, would shake the foundations of quantum physics to the ground. Leonard Susskind disagreed with Hawking's position, but was unable to demonstrate it mathematically.  </p>
<p>It would take him ten years to do so, involving him with many other physicists and leading to several startling discoveries about the nature of black holes, time and space, leading to the holographic principle. Ten years of furious, brilliant research by multiple luminaries in the field, all touched off by a single, insightful question by Professor Hawking.  </p>
<p>Susskind's book is quite accessible and well worth a read. Readers will get to see how physics is done, at least at the social and professional level. Plus, for a while and through Susskind, one gets to hang around a quiet social gathering of some of the most brilliant physicists the world has seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you take an encyclopedia and toss it in a black hole. What happens to the information contained in the encyclopedia? In quantum mechanics, information is a conserved quantity. That is, it cannot be created or destroyed. It can be moved around, scrambled or mutilated, but it cannot be destroyed. Before Hawking, the information in the encyclopedia was hidden away from the Universe, but it was presumably safe tucked inside the black hole.  </p>
<p>Hawking demonstrated that black holes radiate energy. Given time, a black hole will slowly, very slowly, evaporate into energy. Also, the energy radiated is simply noise. It contains no information at all. One cannot look at the Hawking radiation and gather any information about the interior of the black hole. And, once the black hole evaporates away, it is gone forever.  </p>
<p>Hawking's question was this: Where is the encyclopedia's information? Hawking pointed out that black holes appeared to be information destruction machines. And if so, quantum mechanics was effectively dead.  </p>
<p>It took Leonard Susskind ten years to prove Hawking wrong. And he had to invent entirely new ways of looking at the Universe to do it. The story is worth the read, and Susskind is a wonderful person to have tell the story. </p></div>		</li>
