<p>I read somewhere that birthrates go down when television ownership goes up.  I.E.  tv gives people (even poor ones) something to do other than have sex.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't believe for a moment that this even begins to be the issue. It's not like the kids going through college aren't fucking. It's just that someone who has homework to do, video games to play, movies to watch, and jobs to get don't want a baby interfering with that process. Meanwhile, for someone with no family, no access to the kinds of entertainment we take for granted, nothing to do all day but work, eat, and sleep, the addition of a child is downright enriching.</p>
<p>&quot;Sex is bad&quot; came about in an era when the only reliable form of birth control was abstinence (and venereal diseases were a mysterious divine punishment for those who violated God's holy disgust for everything material). But sex, as such, was never bad; it was the conceiving of children at a less than convenient time that was the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree (for the most part).  You also need to consider that the less wealthy you are the greater financial incentives you get for having kids.  Medicaid, section-8, SNAP, the child tax credit.... are very hard to get when you are single, but if you have kids you likely get them.  Now for those that have never been on those programs, they are pretty great (you get free housing, good healthcare with no copay, free food, free phones, free money, and a &quot;pay raise&quot; through EITC for having kids).</p>
<p>If you consider that those who have lower incomes have a lower valuation on their time, then the opportunity cost of each hour spent with their child decreases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree with you, comments here can get very condescending towards poor people. Being poor is rarely a &quot;choice&quot;. I live in a country where you can usually find families with up to 12 children, of course religion and poor prospects of life can have an impact on this issue but simply not having much else to do with their time is equally important. </p></div>		</li>
