			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a major CSD company. We decreased the amount of aluminum by 6% and slightly increased the pressure inside the cans. It decreased fleet fuel consumption by several million $ annually but the can integrity was preserved. </p>
<p>FYI, not an engineer, saw figures from the accounting side so details are slim. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't hold up with canned food which comes in a reinforced can. A pressurized can of food would be way harder to open. Pressurized cans of liquid have a special tab that releases the pressure prior to pushing the opening part into the can. Can of food rely only on pressing something into the can. A pressurized can would make this task way harder and possibly dangerous. Cans are they way they are due to hundreds of years of engineering.</p></div>		</li>
