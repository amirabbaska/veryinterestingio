			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's very grounding. It helps to keep me humble, to remember that I'm just an animal same as any other, just with a lot of words and a good bit of extra self-importance. We really are just overcomplicated monkeys</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only difference between someone born in 2000 and someone born in 2000BCE is education.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the way a primitive language would be formulated. Our most fundamental bases of language are our vocalisation of emotions (laughing, crying, screaming etc). Similarly you could infer an animal of baboon level intelligence would have a communication system structured much the same, based on primitive emotional vocalisations.</p>
<p>A human baby raised with the baboons would certainly have a good instinct for their behaviour and if the animals did have a more complex language a babies brain is a great place to pick it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense! But do you think in a situation where the animals have a complex language, a baby would be able to communicate in a similar language?</p></div>		</li>
