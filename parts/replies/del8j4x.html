			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear: Most states have a position called Secretary of State, but the role is not remotely similar to the federal official with that title. For example, in Illinois the secretary of state is responsible for issuing driver's licenses and maintaining records of registered corporations, among other things.</p></div>		</li>
