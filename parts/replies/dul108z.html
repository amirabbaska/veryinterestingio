			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this explanation. This came just in time, my wife has been worried all week about a lump on the top [area] of her right breast.  But she uses a patch BC and this month had been weird with her cycle, it stopped and then just started again last night.  Anyway, thank you!</p></div>		</li>
