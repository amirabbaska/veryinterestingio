			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to bring up Frontier and Outlander. Very different shows, but mostly historically and real life accurate. People now are so used to seeing perfect teeth that most production companies or directors recognize that gross realism would be turned down by viewers.</p>
<p>That being said, you should totally finish Frontier. The teeth were unsettling, but the story is worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is pretty much the reason. It's why characters in most historical settings still conform to modern standards of health and hygiene unless it's relevant to the plot. For example, you don't see many people with scars from acne, small pox, or other maladies, even though that would have been common. Female characters also have little to no body hair even in cultures where hair removal would not have been normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to second this answer.  I never notice such things, but my wife loves all things Johnny Depp, and refused to watch anything past the first Pirates of the Caribbean specifically because &quot;it's just a bunch of people running around with bad teeth.&quot;  </p>
<p>While it probably doesn't impact the majority of us, it certainly impacts a portion of the target market, and even within this thread I don't hear anyone refusing to watch a movie simply because the characters have white teeth.</p></div>		</li>
