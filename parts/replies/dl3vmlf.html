			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with the fact that Eastern culture is a collective culture, with a large emphasis on family and being one unit. The children's decisions can reflect poorly on the whole family, and the parents freeing their adult children can be seen as neglect. In western cultures it's primarily individualization that is exhibited, a cultural view that maintains the individuality of every person. The family is a support unit, but every person is responsible for their own lives and actions. </p>
<p>It's precisely that difference in culture that explains the drive for westerners to make their lives their own, hence the moving out/independence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  At least in Latin America, it isn't uncommon that people in their 20s live with their parents.  Most do to save money and later on when married/stable job, they can get a house or something.  There is no real pressure to get out of the use, unless parents wants you out, but usually they don't really mind.</p>
<p>I feel like it's better off I'm this way, every situation is different but I find stupid that if someone struggles with finances, doesn't make use of the opportunity to save your parents can give you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I live in South America and people tend to move out for university if they have to but a lot live with parents until they're graduated, it's been so hard to find a job and things are difficult in general. It's no first world country play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To play the devil's advocate, I think the argument against this is that you don't learn the true value of money and true sense of responsibility until you're young and it hits you that you need to cut spending here and there and save up to pay bills. Whereas in eastern (and latin as you correctly pointed out), you move out and usually already have a decently paying job and just a more comfortable general situation.</p>
<p>So basically the argument is, you haven't tasted discomfort like the more traditional &quot;move out&quot; western culture has. Now whether that actually translate in more sense of responsibility and stuff, idk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a legitimate question- as an American, I was an outlier growing up because I was never in the group of people who needed to learn by making mistakes. I would often opt out of things that I foresaw would have a negative impact, and be criticized for doing so, then hear how things went from friends who wished they didn't do it and complained about the consequences. I have always been perplexed by the attitude that young adults are incapable of learning either vicariously and therefore have to make financial/emotional mistakes that can impact them for a while in the long run. Why is that the reigning outlook when other cultures without that attitude prove that it's not impossible for people to use some foresight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't get the &quot;18 and out&quot; push but when you go to college you essentially do this anyway since you are living near the school.  When I returned from school I lived at home for a year or two until I got a steady job (had a temp job) and saved up some money for rent.  People who don't go to college might get more of a push but I knew plenty of people who stayed at home for years to build up savings.  There is a risk though that if you stay too long you become too comfortable and become a mooch off of your parents.  You become used to living at home for free and not working and they become used to you being a perpetual child.  I've seen that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are you living at home for free?  Aren't you contributing to the household?  This seems to me a problem of affluenza.  Working class kids have to get a job at 15 in order to chip in on the rent and groceries.  There is a big difference between living at home and living at home, and not working.  How are they &quot;building up savings&quot; if they aren't employed?  We have gone from people complaining that they have heavy debt and shit jobs and so need to live in an extended family situation out of necessity to 25 year olds who sit in their underwear and play call of duty all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was working at the time and my parents knew I was just saving money for the initial + first month's rent for my own place (rents are high around Boston) and for a cheap car so they had no problem with that.</p>
<p>BTW, you are muddling two scenarios in my comment.  One is living at home while working the other are people who live at home and don't work.</p></div>		</li>
