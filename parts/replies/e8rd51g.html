<p>English has a relatively high incidence of dyslexia because we have a complex alphabet with inconsistent letter-sound correspondences. Other writing systems (like Chinese's logographic system) do not have the same letter-sound correspondences, and therefore traditional dyslexia is not nearly as common.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in fact a little controversial - in fact the rate of dyslexia is probably the same irrespective of the orthographic system, but expresses itself somewhat differently. For instance in Finnish which has a much more transparent orthography, dyslexia is not associated with making reading errors but instead expresses itself as very slow reading.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the rate of poor reading doesn't vary is that there are no agreed upon behavioral or biological markers of dyslexia. We just use a cut-off score on standardized tests. As a result, anyone scoring below, say, the 10th percentile, would be classified as dyslexic. But that would be true for any language even though you'd use a different standardized test to quantify reading ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess what this makes me wonder, is if there were a way to show that someone who is dyslexic in one language, also exhibits issues after becoming proficient in another language (even if the issues are different). </p>
<p>Conversely, if the language does exacerbate the condition, could someone who doesn't experience dyslexia in their native language experience dyslexia while learning a new language?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, dyslexia is a neurological phenomenon and affects a person's language faculties, it doesn't appear in a language-to-language basis on the same person. So if a person would have dyslexia, they would have it in any language, native or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with dyslexia I can tell you that the way I read is much more logographic. Not that this necessary applies to all dyslexics. I do not sound out words I recognize them by shape and context. This allows me to read more or less as well as any highly literate person. One odd side effect is that I don't know how to pronounce new words I see even when understanding their meaning in a text. I have read many novels without ever really attaching sounds to created words such as names, places,..., or I attach wildly wrong sounds for such things until I hear someone say the word. </p>
<p>My spelling however is still a constant issue as I am more or less making combinations of letters that look like the words I am attempting to spell. This combined with the muscles memory of typing common words and spell check gets me by in most things. I have become rather good at editing my own writing as I have to reread everything I write to correct mistakes. I write the way sculptors model clay. I slap material on and then refine the shape.</p>
<p>Today oddly enough I have become a tech writer as my constant editing and attention to the 'look' of words has made me extremely good at formatting technical documents and instructions.</p>
<p>Edit: I should mention that I am 41. Dyslexia education was much less recognized and teaching strategies much less developed when I was in school. I am not advocating this method in place of the more phonic driven approaches. My reading method was crystallised long before I was diagnosed, and by the time I was diagnosed the opinion was 'He seems to have found his own way lets not mess with it.'</p></div>		</li>

<p>But is this exclusive to dyslexia? I don't think it is. As far as I am aware, I am not dyslexic, but I share a similar experience of reading new words and assigning meaning to them without ever attaching sound to them(or attaching the wrong sound).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is a trait of adult diagnosed dislexics. I have exactly the same coping mechanisms, and like you know the look and feel of a word but can't carry that over to similar words. I was diagnosed when I was in my mid 20s and I have a good reading speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting too that not everyone who scores below the percentile is assessed as having dyslexia. An important consideration is that there's no other cognitive difficulty - so someone who has a learning disability may be in the 2nd percentile for reading, but it's not considered to have dyslexia because their reading difficulty is associated with their disability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! Made me laugh take my upvote.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, its more of an issue of conveying something that seems as normal as breathing.  In which case it can be easier to say what it isn't but then you'll just circle back to trying to explain what it is when someone asks why it isn't.</p>
<p>I actually have this problem all the time trying to explain my ADHD to people. I have suffered in silence because I couldn't explain how ADHD isn't &quot;just a kid on a suger rush all the time&quot; or &quot;bouncing off the walls&quot;.</p>
<p>Sorry if that got too off topic.</p></div>		</li>
