			<div class="markdown"><p>close, tcns aren’t locales they are foreigners just from a different foreign country than the first person narrator or the host country,   for example : Indonesian nationals working for star spangled profiteers, in a desert country.  starspanglia pays contractor say 100$ a head , contractor pays 5$ to said head , claiming 95$ overhead, which may be true depending on how many ferraris can be considered “business” expenses , host nation locales would be considered “ local nationals”meaning they are local to the current nation the first person narrator is in. an iraqi in iraq to a starspanglian stormtroooper would be considered a local national from the stormtroopers pov. </p>
<p>foreign nationals would be if the Indonesian immigrated to iraq with intent of nationalizing via iraqi citizenship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it's not washed off by the suppliers, they're on there for a reason, to help preserve the fruit, and stores don't want pallets of fruit that HAVE to be sold in a day or two max before they're thrown away.  </p>
<p>We take in the pallets from farm, that have had a very basic sort, sort the fruit to the best of our abilities &quot;cleaning&quot; them in terms off.. If they have literally mould on them from a neighbouring fruit that has completely moulded.  </p>
<p>And send them mostly good fruits on their way.. We don't wash them, unless we're paid to. But that's a damn slow/expensive process.  </p>
<p>That's not to say you HAVE to wash all fresh produce with special mixes of vinegar/baking soda etc..<br />
Just a good wash with water is fine, but please everybody, make sure to wash your fresh produce when it makes it into your homes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure what your saying in response to my comment, I have little experience of the treatment before the store. My comment was that the main reason I wash my produce is the dirt deposited by staff and customers at the store. Also it is my understanding that different produce is treated differently eg apples are often floated down the production line in water to prevent bruising which also has the effect of washing them, also different countries and regions have different laws and regulations regarding food crop preparation so there is no right answer as to the washing before. I just ensure everything is washed before I eat it for the above reasons.</p></div>		</li>
