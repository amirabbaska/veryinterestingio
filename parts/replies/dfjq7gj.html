			<div class="markdown"><p>I see some things are already stored with some companies but I'm wondering how old data can be when/if they do sell if you didn't opt out (or if option to opt out gets removed, would that even be allowed?). Do you know if it's data from time you started service with the ISP or if it's from this day forward? Just curious, and thank you for your post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't opt out. You can choose to browse without cookies, not use Google or Facebook services, etc. Even more, they aren't selling an ad service like Google; they are selling the raw data. Which can also mean that that data can leak when those firms get hacked (and they will).</p></div>		</li>
