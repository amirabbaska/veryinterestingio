			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious to know peoples' opinions on this: Is this a predatory act, taking advantage of the viral nature of the original person's video? Or is this something genuinely helpful and good that the company can do while also taking advantage of the situation to make money themselves? </p>
<p>On the face of it, my first thought was, this is sleazy. But then I realized that I don't know how to do most of that, other than make my own social media accounts, and it probably would be helpful to group up with a company like this to help with things. </p>
<p>Either way it's interesting that businesses like this exist. </p></div>		</li>

The average person may, for example, take $2000 and flight and board to go on Ellen, whereas your representative will argue on your behalf and turn that into a $10,000 appearance. The average person doesn't really know their worth and may be afraid to argue for fear of losing the gig altogether.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, and I suppose the representative makes more money the more money they make their client, so they aren't incentivized to screw the client over by only getting them that $2000 appearance when it could be $10000. </p>
<p>Seems like the only lose-situation for the client would be if they got legally &quot;trapped&quot; with a company like this, contractually stuck with a less good one or something. But yeah, generally it sounds quite useful and financially worth it for the viral-video-maker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's completely fine, and there is actually significant competition that prevents companies from taking too much advantage of the &quot;talent&quot;.</p>
<p>The one problem I have with it is that the companies will sometimes push the talent to try to become famous and basically quit their day job to pursue something like this, even when they know it probably won't work out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're providing a valuable service. Most people, especially those who are just living completely normal lives then go viral overnight, have no idea how to turn that into a lucrative career. They don't have the connections, the network, the knowledge, the negotiating skills, etc etc.</p>
<p>Even top Hollywood personalities pay people to do this kind of thing for them. </p>
<p>Like say right now you go viral and want to make money off it. What do you do? You have no idea. Okay, you want to get on Ellen. How do you do that? Who do you call? How much do you ask for? How long do you keep trying to make money on talk shows? What other avenues are you going to pursue to make money? Is Ellen even the right fit for you, or will your fans think that's lame? </p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, exactly how long do you want to spend figuring all this out, while your fame dies away and you miss out on opportunities to make even more money doing other stuff while you Google &quot;Ellen Degeneres contact info&quot; </p></div>		</li>
