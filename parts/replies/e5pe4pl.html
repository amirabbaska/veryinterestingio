			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying it probably relates to how our senses operate logarithmically. I.e. 90% grey on 99% grey looks like more contrast than 50% grey on 59% grey.</p>
<p>EDIT: Correction. I had the numbers reversed. I was under the impression that &quot;1% grey&quot; meant &quot;black, appearing to be 1% to white&quot;, but it really works in the opposite.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 9% grey is 800% greater than 1% grey. 50% grey is 22% greater than 41%.</p>
<p>Of course they're going to appear widely different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that's kind of the point. We do not perceive linearly. A 50 decibel sound is not 500 times louder than a 1 decibel sound, it's 79482 times louder. But likewise, even with my example, you're mistaken. Because what we call 50% grey is actually 18% reflectance of visible light when defined by photo and printing standards: 50% grey is one-fifth the photon reflection of a white with 90% reflectance.</p>
<p>Also, issuing a correction on my original post. I had the numbers reversed. </p></div>		</li>
