			<div class="markdown"><p>What amazes me is that they can keep it in the form of steam throughout the whole system without it condensing back into water</p>
<p>EDIT: I wrote that while watching the video, then I saw the 2007 Steam Pipe rupture..... I guess incredible pressure is the key</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was working in a building on the same block as the 2007 rupture and I took a pic with my crappy cell at the time.  I had taken a pic from the same view on the 39th floor earlier that year - so here's what that looked like:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/oANe5" target="_blank">Before and after...</a></p>
<p>We heard a massive explosion, our building swayed (barely and slowing, but still perceptible) and we all took the stairs down to the lobby.  The amount of steam coming out looked crazy - couldn't even tell where it was coming from at first.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thx, stranger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends.</p>
<p>As the pressure increases the heat of the steam will need to be increased to be super heated.</p>
<p>Super heated means there is no condensation.</p>
<p>So in a steam system if the pressure increases, or the temp decreases, there will be condensation.</p>
<p>In order to balance that would normally run the steam at a higher temperature than needed to become super heated. ect ect ect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water in the system is very bad. It's what caused the lexington steam explosion. Steam traps are used to remove water. Steam rising from manholes is typically from an open steam trap.</p></div>		</li>
