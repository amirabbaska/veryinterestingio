<p>If mars was host to life it would surely only be single/multicellular right?</p>
<p>Is that level of life sufficient enough to be converted into oil?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plankton is mostly single-celled organisms and it's the main source of oil on Earth, so that's not a problem. </p>
<p>However, I agree with everyone else on burial depth and timing. Pre-oil deposits (kerogen) are easily overcooked or undercooked by the heat and pressure they're buried in, even if they start out with the right materials. Oil is a sweet spot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both those links are based on the same source - a research team who seem to have found that the the strike-slip movement on the Valles Marineris fault is bigger than expected. </p>
<p>I think it's quite a leap to then say there were Earth-like plate tectonics, with plates being subducted and recycled etc. Not saying there wasn't, but it's definitely inconclusive to date. </p>
<p>'Tectonics' without the 'plate' qualifier are simply largescale movements of the crust, which Mars definitely had as a minimum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since Mars' gravity is lower, wouldn't that mean that the organic matter had to be even deeper than on earth?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Making oil requires heat and pressure, and Mars has less of both. To get the same pressure you would need 3x the depth because of the lower weight of rock under Mars gravity. I'm not sure we know enough about paleo-Martian geology to tell what the temperature/depth profiles would have been. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hydrocarbons need pressure,  heat without oxygen and time to turn into raw or coal (coking doesnt count, entirely different process).</p>
<p>what we find today in relatice shallow earth has been regurgiated by tectonics, many those deposits were under water at some point, either sea or mire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have read it only occurs under water. Oil is from millions of years of diatoms dying and settling at the bottom. Then being buried from sediment. Further down the line experiencing the pressure and heat you described. But specifically single celled life from the seas. </p></div>		</li>
