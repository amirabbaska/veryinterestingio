			<div class="markdown"><p>The reasons are different though, for the abs() function the derivative at zero is undefined but everywhere else there is a derivative while for the factorial function it is only defined for natural numbers so the concept of a derivative doesn't make sense.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The derivative is x/sqrt( x^2 ) which evaluates as undefined (0/0) at x=0. This is actually exactly the same as for abs(x) when x is real because sqrt is defined as returning the positive root.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This maybe a silly question but,
I've seen the derivative of f(x) = |x| as
f'(x) = |x|/x
it is discontinuous at x=0. But we can still write an expression for it.
similarly, what can be the expression for the derivative of f(x) = x!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>f'(x) = |x|/x is continuous at all numbers except zero. So only at the point of x = 0 is there a discontinuity. At 0.00000000001, the graph exists. And then the graph continues to exist at 0.00000000002 and the graph is continuous on the interval between the points I've listed. </p>
<p>So we know that the graph is continuous <em>close</em> to zero, but discontinuous at zero only. This is why it's possible to differentiate f(x) = |x|. </p>
<p>f(x) = x! takes whole integer inputs and gives whole integer outputs. </p>
<p>For example, f(2) = 2!  would give the ordered pair (2, 2) on a graph. But the next increment, and the only increment allowed by the factorial function, is x=3. So f(3) = 3! will give us an ordered pair of (3, 6). The 'graph' exists at each of these points, but for no point in between x = 2 and x = 3. No graph exists for x = 2.5, for example. So there is a jump between each valid argument of (x, f(x)) for f(x) = x!</p>
<p>And because there is a jump in value for each valid increment in x, each point has an undefined slope which would prevent it from being differentiable, among other things. </p>
<p>As another user said, there is a differentiable gamma function that is related to the factorial function, but relies on incorporation of the graphs for complex numbers. </p>
<p>I hope this can clear up any confusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if we just have it defined differently in my course... But the fact that the function is differentiable doesn't necessarily mean that derivative doesn't exist at that point. Also, discontinuity doesn't mean you can't derive. For example sgn'(0)= infinity.</p>
<p>The fact that x! doesn't have derivative anywhere on the domain is caised simply by the definition of derivative. There's simply no neighbourhood of any point, hence no limits, hence no derivatives.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nothing. I think it's best to take a geometric approach to this. f'(X) = the slope of f(X). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Draw f(X)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the slope at any location x=a</p>
</li>
<li>That is the value of f'(a)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you are doing everything correctly, step 2 will be impossible for x!. If you can measure the slope, then you must be interpolating, in which case you are no longer using x! but rather some other function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes...ish. There's only one way of interpolating it into an analytic function though, and so this is the &quot;obvious&quot; choice.</p></div>		</li>
