			<div class="markdown"><p>All except \ and  null that you did not mentioned and likely : are only limitations because of how DOS was implemented not a fundamental limit for their special meaning. They have the same meaning in UNIX system that existed before that but you are still allowed to have the in filename</p>
<p>A quick console test in linux</p>
<pre><code>p@K:~/test$ touch "\?*&gt;&lt;|:\""
p@K:~/test$ ls
\?*&gt;&lt;|:"</code></pre>
<p>So you can still have them but you have to escape, quote them etc to use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>L(inux)PT: if you have issues dealing with a file with an obscure name, add two dashes just before the file name. At least bash recognizes that as end of command parameters. E. g.</p>
<p>ls -l -- oddfilename</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that fails you can use ls -i to display the inode of the file and then nuke it with find:  </p>
<pre><code>find . -inum [inode] -exec rm -i {} \;</code></pre>
<p>That way you avoid having to type the name, which is great if someone decided to be creative with his file name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That won't help in this case. Those special characters are interpreted by the shell, not the command itself.  The &quot;--&quot; flag is merely a common indicator to the command that &quot;there are no more flags after this&quot;, which makes it helpful when dealing with non-flag arguments that start with &quot;-&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LPT: don't use special characters in file names. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. They'll cause all sorts of issues with scripts and commands.</p>
<p>(But if you do end up with such a name, that's a good tip to deal with it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure you can do that. But if you later have a shell script, file manager, backup utility or anything else that goes through your file structure then you'd better hope that whomever wrote it was really careful about escaping filenames properly.</p>
<p>There are ways of getting Windows to create filenames that don't match the spec (many years ago I ended up with a drive called <code>[:</code>) but, as with calling a Unix file <code>*</code> it's not something that's likely going to end well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All correct. Also take a look at the POSIX standard and Microsoft's drama around whether to try and meet it or not in the 90s. A number of legacy Windows decisions are the result of that. </p></div>		</li>
