<p>Another reason beside the one you mentioned, is that women are more likely to be seen as caregivers. A daughter living with mom and dad can be seen as a positive, taking care of mom and dad type thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this mindset is (slowly) changing, but mainly due to the fact that it's too goddamn expensive to leave home early now. </p>
<p>Decades ago, you were a total loser if you still lived with mom &amp; dad not even a year after high school. But the cost of living was a lot more reasonable compared to minimum or low wage jobs back then, and tuitions were a lot more reasonable, too. It made sense ... And what 18yo kid wants to still be stuck with their parent' house rules longer than they have to?</p>
<p>But then the 80's and 90's happened. Inflation. Recession. Reagan's economic plans. Death knells for unions. Burst of economic boom paired with huge focus on consumerism being king, but with low-income workers and students being largely forgotten. Other things. Life gets a lot tougher on young adults in general, but hey, they don't really vote, so fuckem, right?</p>
<p>So the late 90's/2000s roll along and then new adults are fucked. Starting early seems doable with assistance, but is now much harder. Loans fatten. Woes settle in, and, especially in pricier areas, more and more young adults put off moving out.</p>
<p>The ones who didn't wait, like me (I became an adult in 2002), have to rely on credit cards and loans to get by (and they were passing that shit out like candy back then).</p>
<p>Then the economic crisis of '08. Big meltdown of the 90's way of living large. </p>
<p>Definitely fucked MY day, that's for sure. But my friends who continued to live with their parents were a lot less affected, and I noticed. I definitely wasn't the only one who noticed this situation, either.</p>
<p>We've since recovered economically, for the most part, but wages still don't  match cost of living or tuition,  and young people have largely adapted to a more frugal approach. </p>
<p>More and more, it really feels like it's becoming acceptable for someone to live at home well into their 20's. Maintaining roommates into your 30's is also becoming rather common (hell, I rent a room in my house -- really helps pay the bills, and we wouldn't have used a 4th bedroom anyway!).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It could just be my own experience of observing trends happening in both FL and CA, but the stigma of living with parents is certainly fading. </p>
<p>It's not gone -- and yes, it sure puts a damper on finding a date, but it's becoming harder and harder to judge someone for &quot;failure to launch&quot; when all they have to do is say &quot;well damn dude I only make $8/hr gimme a break&quot;.</p>
<p>In another generation, assuming there's no reprisal of the boomin' 90's mindset, I have a feeling that the public perception of YAs living with their parents won't really be much of a negative thing at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of you subscribe to feminist theory, that gender discrepancy makes a lot of sense. This is a holdover from a time where women were seen as property of men, passed from their father to their husband. </p></div>		</li>
