<p>Edit: I should clarify I'm talking about OÂ² as in atmospheric oxygen. As opposed to the element oxygen which I am told makes up over 46% of the mass of the earth. </p></div>		</li>

About the same time, you see banded-iron formations which the layers appear to flip back and forth in oxidized/reduced states. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Earth was never <strong>Oxygen free</strong>. Oxygen makes up over 46% of the mass of the earth. What you're thinking of is free oxygen in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Great point! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment" target="_blank">Miller-Urey Experiment</a> is a great resource for this, where they replicated the chemical conditions of early Earth and tried to figure out how organic life could have started. </p>
<p>They essentially found that lightning + early Earth conditions resulted in the formation of complex organic compounds (amino acids) from inorganic compounds. This is so exciting because it basically offers an explanation of how life on Earth could have started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that there is a chance that the amino acids that comprise of the proteins that make you who you are were first synthesized on Earth by lightning interacting with the inorganic compounds (Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc). </p>
<p>Evolution then had to come to a point where these compounds were utilized by organisms as a basis for what they were built out of. Fascinating stuff, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just playing Devil's advocate here.  The wikipedia article mentions that the atmosphere used was likely incorrect for the early Earth, but it's still shows that organic compounds can form from inorganic chemistry.  More modern experiments don't really differ, but if you plan on debating the more ardent creationists this will come up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right you are. I luckily haven't had to debate many creationists but thats a good point as well. The key takeaway is indeed the creation of organic from inorganic compounds. </p>
<p>Another cool thing to note is just how many more amino acids were identified with the revisited experiment. The diversity alone is impressive to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that's really interesting. What range of planets would have, at one point in history, had early earth conditions? Would it be the same or similar to planets like earth now, or could other planets produce similar conditions to start life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where we get into the theoretical territory again :) We know that scientists have discovered many planets that are orbiting suns where conditions are believed to be similar to ours. The Fermi Paradox also famously says that the sheer size of the universe means that conditions that allowed us to rise must exist out there (or, another way to look at it is that aliens have to be out there due to the odds alone). </p>
<p>The original question is so exciting because this is just ONE way we know that life arose. When conditions change, geological events differ (think of the effects of the methane rains of Titan or the pressure cooker environment on Venus) all sorts of odd things happen. Here on our own Earth, we know that there are bacteria that can use Sulfur instead of Oxygen near deep-sea geothermal vents. We know that Tardigrades can survive all sorts of conditions (extreme pressures, extreme temperatures, incredible amounts of radiation and vacuum of space). So it's not out of the question that a form of life we don't know about could arise. </p></div>		</li>
