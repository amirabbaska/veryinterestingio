			<div class="markdown"><p>The flip side of that is that your $75,000 a set super club likely has very little tolerance for mistakes from actually playing records and taking chances. </p>
<p>You have a DJ who has been on planes for the last three days and hasn't slept more than ten hours that whole time, and the promoter expects them to play a flawless set in a strange venue that they just walked into with no warm up. </p>
<p>Does the $75,000 a set guy take a chance and risk his reputation by really mixing and flying by the seat of his pants, or does he just play it safe, give the crowd and the club exactly what they want, and walk out of there with a five figure check?</p>
<p>Let's face it, super clubs aren't there for creativity or risk taking. That happens in the small underground clubs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those things that seems like it must be super easy until you actually have to do it yourself. </p>
<p>The playing records in a club is the best and easiest part. It's everything else before and after the gig that the public never sees that is the problem. The joke most DJ's tell is that they play the gigs for free; it's the travel, and dealing with the bullshit of crowds and club promoters that they charge money for.  </p>
<p>I had the chance to &quot;make it&quot; in the club circuit, and I walked away from it. I'd rather work my 9-5 and see my family than deal with all the bullshit that comes with being a professional club DJ. </p>
<p>As far as pure skill goes, no doubt it's a lot harder to be a jazz musician. However, the actual working life is worse in a lot of ways.
You're alone most of the time, you never sleep, you are surrounded by people on drugs who want to give you drugs for free, you are always stressed because you have no control over your transportation situation(leave club, running to hotel, to taxi, to airport, trying to catch three connecting flights hoping not to miss the gig and the next set of connecting flights, back to taxi, back to next hotel, back to dinner, back to club), you usually eat shitty food, you never know how fucked up the club equipment is, and you can't really explain your profession to outsiders.</p>
<p>The part that you see is intentionally meant to make it all look glamorous. The life that professional DJs actually live is actually kind of rough. </p>
<p>That being said, the guy making seventy five thousand a gig in a private jet is living a different life from the gig making a thousand a gig flying coach. Most guys are flying coach. </p></div>		</li>
