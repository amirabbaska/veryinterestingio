<blockquote>
<p>Stress can make the individual more susceptible to physical illnesses like the common cold.[13] Stressful events, such as job changes, may result in insomnia, impaired sleeping, and health complaints.[14] Research indicates the type of stressor (whether it's acute or chronic) and individual characteristics such as age and physical well-being before the onset of the stressor can combine to determine the effect of stress on an individual.[10] An individual's personality characteristics (such as level of neuroticism),[15] genetics, and childhood experiences with major stressors and traumas[16] may also dictate their response to stressors.[10]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of years ago I had one of the most stressful weeks at work, I can usually forget about it and recharge when at home but this time I couldn't shake it off properly.  Then a few days later I had shingles on my right hip that was caused from lower immune strength due to the stress, man that was painful.</p></div>		</li>
