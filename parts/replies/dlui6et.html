			<div class="markdown"><p>Many autistics have a more relaxed-muscle face rather than simply moving muscles into a frown or smile. <a href="https://aspergersandmeblog.wordpress.com/tag/blank-face/" target="_blank">https://aspergersandmeblog.wordpress.com/tag/blank-face/</a>
This was true of me as a child and as adult at work. People at work commented sarcastically by calling me &quot;smiley&quot;, because I always had a relaxed-muscle-face. I did not purposefully use my facial muscles and frown nor did I use them for a smile (much). The type one or two thinking styles are associated with a purposeful use of the muscles to frown or smile.  </p></div>		</li>
