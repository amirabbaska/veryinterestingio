			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, if you die on an operating room table or in a hospital bed, you almost certainly have drugs in you.  They also can't ask you questions about your recent sexual history or your recreational drug use, on account of you being dead.</p>
<p>This is not really a major difference from organ donation, though.  And we still allow such people to donate organs.  So there's something else at work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How difficult would it be to just screen the deceased blood donation against all of the drugs and disorders that are normally screened against? I understand that this is probably more time consuming and expensive (for a potentially less reliable extraction and smaller yield), but it might help in areas/circumstances where certain blood types are desperately needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Screening blood is really expensive. (This part is what happens in Norway, but maybe other places as well) With blood donors they screen your blood the first time you donate to make sure there are no problems you are not telling them or are not aware of yourself. After the first time the blood only goes through a much simpler control. This is a result of the fact that people who donate blood typically do so many times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am on mobile so I can't find the link, but blood is screened in large batches to save on cost. Think 10-100 units are pooled then one test ran on all of them. Saves on cost and time. When you take from the dead you significantly increase the cost as you either have to test individually or risk ruining lots of good batches with extremely high risk blood</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we don't really have an alternative with organs.   Blood, on the other hand, is easy enough to obtain from the living.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, with (most) organs we have no choice but to get them from dead people so we have to accept the risks, if there was a severe shortage of blood donations from live people then we might see it as an acceptable risk to get blood from dead people when the alternative is no blood at all.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We take organs though, why not blood. And people who are on medication are still alowed to donate blood, unless they are on very specific sets of medication; see <a href="http://www.donateblood.com.au/faq/eligibility/medications-what-prescribed-medications-will-defer-someone-from-donating" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who are on <em>certain</em> medications are allowed to donate blood. And people must die in very specific circumstances in order for organs to be viable to donate (certain tissues and eyes are an exception). Typically the need for donated organs is so dire that the benefit of likely saving or extending a life outweighs the risks of most medications or even diseases the person who died may have had. Generally there is enough blood banked for use that it's not usually worth the risk of exposing the patient to diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the page I linked, which is from the Australian Red Cross, the official administrator of blood donations in Australia, only a few medications disqualify you. According to the <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic" target="_blank">American Red Cross</a>, a slightly longer but still quite short list of exclusions applies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, and I wasn't thinking about organ donation. It's very interesting. I wonder if organs are less likely to be &quot;infected&quot; if someone who dies has an STD or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I am remembering this correctly, but I think the drugs were a reason why a childhood friend was kept on life support even though he was, well, gone. I think they were planning on donating organs and tissue to some other kids. Brain aneurysm at 10 years old. So long ago, but I remember thinking that it was odd to keep him on machines that much longer .</p></div>		</li>
