			<div class="markdown"><p>In a similar method, a group managed to image <a href="https://phys.org/news/2012-07-photo-shadow-atom.html" target="_blank">the shadow of a single suspended atom</a> with visible light (although, as you might imagine, it wasn't easy ... they had to use the <em>exact</em> frequency for maximum absorption by the atom in order to see the shadow at all, since a single atom doesn't exactly block much light in the first place). And again, the shadow is definitely not the size of the actual atom, since there's no way to resolve something that small with light having a wavelength that large - you'll just get the point-spread function. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that will give atomic resolution, sadly it's not an optical imaging system like OP asked for. A Scanning Tunnelling Microscope or STM is somewhat similar to an AFM (atomic force microscope) in that it operates based on the proximity of a stylus to the surface being measured, rather than any exchange of light. With AFMs versus STMs, there's one key difference; the former works by basically acting like a record player with the stylus, feeling the physical bumps of a surface, while an STM works by holding the needle close to the surface, applying a small voltage, and measuring the rate (e.g. tunnelling current) at which electrons jump across the gap. </p>
<p>Now both instruments are a little more complicated than this, and can operate in a few modes, but that's the gist. </p>
<p>In the STM, by holding that tunnelling current near constant by varying the height, you can get accurate topographical information, down to some ridiculously small resolutions (or by changing the mode, so that the height is constant, you can get material-specific sensitivity instead).</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/may/23/quantum-microscope-peers-into-the-hydrogen-atom" target="_blank">http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/may/23/quantum-microscope-peers-into-the-hydrogen-atom</a></p>
<p>&quot;photoionization microscopy can directly obtain the nodal structure of the electronic orbital of a hydrogen atom placed in a static electric field. In the experiment, the hydrogen atom is placed in the electric field E and is excited by laser pulses.&quot;</p>
<p>I think they used quantum entangled photons to resolve it.</p>
<p>I mean look at their result, it's pretty fucking fantastic.</p></div>		</li>
