			<div class="markdown"><p>It creates warmer air, definitely. But you won’t get clouds unless there’s also moisture in that warm air. A forest has lots of trees, whose leaves will release some water vapor in a process called transpiration. In the extreme case of a tropical rainforest, so much water vapor is released into the air that the forest will engender its own rainstorm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be noted that all air has moisture -- but cumulus clouds form when air is transported high enough that it ends up cooling below its dew point. The dew point of a parcel of air is related to the humidity, so a less humid thermal will have to travel higher up (colder surrounding air) in order to form a cloud when it does cool down (cooling down is equivalent to reducing volume, so it's easy to picture a particular quantity of water vapour being the maximum a volume of air can hold; when that volume is reduced via cooling there's then too much water and it condenses out forming water droplets aka clouds).</p>
<p>How easily a parcel of air travels high enough to reach that dew point is determined by it's vertical velocity. This is in turn determined by the air pressure (low pressure has less resistance to flow), and/or to the difference in density between the rising air and surrounding air which creates a buoyant force (density being related moisture content, and inversely related to temperature). </p>
<p>So in fact hot, dry air is less dense and can travel upwards faster/more easily than hot, humid air. In hot desert environments you get small, tight 'bullet thermals' that can travel upwards at 60-200km/h (dust devils are often formed at the bottom of these). But the dew point can be tens of degrees colder than the ground level temperature. Because the surrounding atmosphere is also dry, it does not have much thermal storage capacity (a 100C dry sauna is tolerable for a while, 100C steam from a kettle scalds), so because of this there is usually not a large temperature gradient as you increase in altitude (aka low lapse rate), so the altitude needed to reach that dramatically lower dew point could be many kilometers high, and you'd need a hell of a thermal to punch up that high.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the example of a rainforest, the relative humidity of rising air could be close to 100%, so that the dew point is only a few degrees cooler than the air temperature near the ground. Because the surrounding atmosphere also has a lot of moisture, it has a large thermal storage capacity (the whole atmosphere cools at night, but only the lower level air warms up quickly in the daytime sun)-- this means the lapse rate/temperature gradient can be much higher than in dry air. So although in low pressure &amp; high humidity environments, thermals can be much weaker, they tend to form clouds easier because they don't need to travel as high to reach the dew point.</p>
<p>Once clouds do form there is also a feedback process in low pressure situations, where instead of relying on thermals (which start from the ground) to feed the clouds, the moisture-laden clouds themselves continue to expand into the surrounding air above the cloud, creating even lower pressure. This cloud then essentially starts to suck up more and more moisture laden air, no surface heating or thermals needed, until eventually the clouds fall out and it starts to rain. This cloud-initiated convection works particularly well when the cloudbase (dew point altitude) is close to the ground, which as mentioned is common in high humidity environments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to read up on are Köhler curves and droplet formation. There is a fairly complex interplay between the radius of water droplets, the presence of dissolved solutes, temperature and other factors which results in an unstable equilibrium in droplet size. </p>
<p>Very small drops called haze (Which are too small to see but can scatter light over long distances) remain stable and constant in size. If the air becomes supersaturated causing the droplets to grow past a critical size called the activation radius, the state becomes unstable and the drops will grow and grow limuted only by the amount of available vapour until they become large cloud drops. </p>
<p>Thus water droplets in the air are either big and visible or small and invisible with little transition between the two. This is why fog and clouds form very quickly and another part of why even small clouds of water like steam appear so defined.</p></div>		</li>
