			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying that browsers don't link to it <strong>because</strong> it's a darknet page is sort of wrong. It's because .onion isn't a valid top level domain and that domain doesn't actually mean anything with regards to DNS routing because it's a particular protocol used within the tor network.</p>
<p>It's more like when your friend says &quot;Oh I live in the blue house near school&quot;, and you know what they're talking about but when you type that into Google Maps it is like &quot;lol wut is this even&quot;. It's not looking up information in the same way.</p></div>		</li>
