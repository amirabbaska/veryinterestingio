<p>I recently had some groceries I needed to keep cool in the car, so I put a couple blankets over them. The people I were with thought this would &quot;heat them up faster&quot; since blankets are associated with keeping you warm. This is when I realized that most people think of &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; as discrete physical properties, not just relative values (my pizza oven is quite cold--when compared to the sun). </p>
<p>Blankets and coolers are both just thermal insulators, and a thermal insulator is just something good at preventing the temperature of things on one side be affected by the temperature of things on the other side. </p>
<p>OP's question is based on the same misunderstanding, but in reality, liquid water is just good at making other things the same temp as the water, whether it's hotter or colder.</p></div>		</li>
