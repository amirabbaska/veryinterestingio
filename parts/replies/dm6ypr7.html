<ol>
<li>
<p>The planck time is the time it takes light in perfect vacuum to cover a planck length. The planck length is just the length where are modern understanding of physics breaks down. It's not really a theoretically important concept.</p>
</li>
<li>Presumably the chronon is a particle that is needed to make certain theories work. It's fundamentally distinct from the planck length, and the OP is probably looking for a discussion of the nature of the theories that describe chronons, not this generic &quot;it's a quantum unit of time&quot; business.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>For the unit of time version, that's like asking what evidence there is that a second exists, or that a minute exists. It is an extremely short period of time, possibly the shortest discrete unit of time, much like the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a false equivalence. The evidence for any potential chronic is very different from the evidence of a minute or a second, and if it's real, it would also be distinct from a chronic because it would be a thing with very real physical significance, unlike the second. It would be very akin to the difference between degrees (seconds) and radians (chronons).</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the descriptions I've seen a chronon is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronon" target="_blank">unit of time, suggested to be about the time required for light to travel the radius of an electron, at least according to Wikipedia as the source of all knowledge.</a> </p>
<p>For more to read, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076567010630029" target="_blank">an in-depth paper, describing it as &quot;a quantum of time&quot;</a>. </p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222181055_Introduction_of_a_Quantum_of_Time_CHRONON_and_its_Consequences_for_the_Electron_in_Quantum_and_Classical_Physics_83_printed_pages" target="_blank">where the chronon proposal is more formally described, with a duration of about 6.4x10^-22 seconds as the upper bound</a>.</p></div>		</li>
