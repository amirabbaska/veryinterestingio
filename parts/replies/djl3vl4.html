			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good analogy but an incomplete explaination. Every chemical, every thing, has a frequency below which it will be transparent to. It's called the photoelectric effect, much with the Einstein and the science here. All you need to know is <em>what</em> something is made out of has <em>everything</em> to do with what frequencies will pass through it, reflect off of it, or be absorbed by it. Below that special frequency, the material doesn't react -- it's transparent. Above that frequency, it's absorbed. Depending on how much energy is absorbed, it may become reflective... or it might simply crap out other particles or heat up. YMMV, more Einstein and science here. </p>
<p>You probably don't know this but your wifi is at 2.4 ghz. But <em>why</em> is it 2.4ghz? Because it's completely worthless for long distance telecommunications. Yes, on a dry summer day you can shoot it 40 miles with the right equipment -- what you can't do, is make it work more than 50 feet when it's raining out. 2.4ghz happens to be smack in the middle of the water absorption lines. To that frequency band, water is like walking through one of those haunted houses where they set the fog machine to &quot;exterminate all humans&quot;. It's hard to see anything with any detail, at any kind of range, because it's standing in a choking gas cloud. Since we consumers were given the spectrum, our technology has improved -- more with the Einstein and the science -- and we can eek out a signal even when it's being beaten senseless by physics. Which is why they want to take it away from us... but that's a story for another day. </p>
<p>The lower the frequency, the more materials the signal is transparent to. That's why early radios operated in the <em>kilohertz</em> range. The other thing is, at those kind of low frequencies, you can use the ionosphere to bounce the signal back to Earth -- those charged particles (being charged already) don't want any more energy, so they say &quot;do not want&quot; and send them away. </p>
<p>This is why low frequency spectrum is so damned valuable -- and why our devices keep clocking faster and faster with their radios. It's also why we keep getting edged out of &quot;unlicensed&quot; spectrum (that is, the stuff the peasants like us can use) -- our tech gets better and previously &quot;bad&quot; neighborhoods in the RF spectrum are gentrified into good ones. -_- </p>
<p>It's all about the frequency when it comes to how well one radio can 'see' another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The photo-electric effect is not really about materials being transparent or opaque. It is only about the emission of electrons when light is absorbed, which is not really relevant for wifi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does exist...just maybe not quite what you would be imagining.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3050295/enter-the-matrix-this-ipad-app-lets-you-see-wi-fi-signals" target="_blank">https://www.fastcodesign.com/3050295/enter-the-matrix-this-ipad-app-lets-you-see-wi-fi-signals</a></p>
<p>And it's only available for the iPad. Android's version isn't due out for awhile.</p>
<p>I found alternative ways to detect the radiation but all fell short of being truly interesting to share.</p></div>		</li>
