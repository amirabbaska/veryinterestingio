<p>I believe the question then is, why grey? Why not black or white or purple? Why not the color it is most exposed to in that moment? </p>
<p>The other top answer also introduces the idea as a premise without explanation. &quot;It is reflective therefore it is grey&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we talk about the color of a mirror, we're talking about the mirror's own 'native' color under white light, not the colors projected onto it by its environment. We treat non-shiny things the same way: a white shirt under reddish lights might look pink, but it doesn't become pink.</p>
<p>A typical mirror is grey because it reflects all visible wavelengths equally, but not perfectly. An object that reflects all wavelengths perfectly is white, an object that absorbs all wavelengths perfectly is black, and anything in between is grey.</p>
<p>A perfect mirror would be white and shiny, but we don't really have a word/concept for that because we don't actually have any substances that are both perfectly white and perfectly shiny. If we ever did encounter a perfect mirror, we'd probably perceive it as a very pale silver.</p>
<p>You've probably seen mirrors that are not grey. For instance, some telescopes use <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/james-webb-space-telescopes-golden-mirror-unveiled" target="_blank">gold mirrors,</a> which are yellow. If you put one of those next to a typical aluminum mirror, it becomes fairly obvious that the aluminum mirror is grey. (If it's covered with glass, it'll have a slight greenish tint, but that's not usually visible to the naked eye; the greyness is.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>By that definition, there are no white or black objects. Color names are based on human interpretation of what they see and their experience. We call very dark grey objects black and very light grey objects white. Something which reflects 10% is typically called black and 90% reflectance is typically called white. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This IS the case for anything that isn't generating or modulating light.  If only purple light is reflecting off the object, it looks purple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A piece of white paper reflects most of the light that falls on it in pretty much random directions. That means that it does actually take on the colours of things around it. <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/nWYC8" target="_blank">I just took a picture to demonstrate that.</a></p>
<p>If you have an incandescent lightbulb, so one with a hot filament, the light that it gives off is very yellow, and this is obvious if you take a picture with your camera set to &quot;sunlight&quot; white balance. A piece of white paper will look yellow in that photograph, but your brain still sees it as white, because it corrects for the ambient light.</p>
<p>A chunk of unpolished aluminium also reflects all wavelengths pretty much equally, and in all directions. However, it only reflects a certain fraction of the incoming light. Same if you print &quot;grey&quot; on a laser printer. It's like white, only darker.</p>
<p>I took another picture to show <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/mSRbi" target="_blank">what metal looks like compared to paper.</a> You'll see that this metal, which isn't very highly polished, is pretty much grey unless there's something really close to it. But the shades of grey are interesting. Where it's facing incoming light, it reflects it better than the paper, so it's actually a brighter white, and where it's facing off towards the darker areas of the room, it's a darker grey. For this reason, compared to white paper, it appears overall a bit more grey than white. Interestingly, the paper is a bit bluer than the metal.</p>
<p>So, does that answer your question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a comment,</p>
<p>I do 3D work, and I never use &quot;silver&quot; as a color in textures. There's no way, in my opinion, to get a true silver with any combination of value and blue hue. If I have to use silver, reflection channels only!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually grab metal textures from BlendSwap or somewhere when I need them to be realistic, but if I need to make one, I do some combination of specular reflection and fresnel, with a noise channel to give a slight texture, possibly stretched in one direction if I want a brushed metal look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I do the same -- different settings for fresnel, anisotropy and color-reflection to get different metals, and noise channels for adding realism to them. I just think that when you use JUST a texture for &quot;silver&quot; things it looks super bad.</p></div>		</li>
