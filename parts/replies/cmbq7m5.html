			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither. It would explode stupendously. Why? The same reason that if you magically teleported a teaspoonful chunk of neutron star matter onto Earth. The only reason neutron stars don't explode is because of massive gravitational forces holding them together. However a sugar cube sized remnant does not have the same luxury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An explosion with energy less than or equal to the amount of energy that made up the matter of every person on earth...plus whatever energy it took to squish them down into that cube (if you want to include that in this thought experiment)... So... pretty goddamn big.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Free neutrons have a half life of ~15 minutes. They have a decay energy of 0.78 MeV, the majority of this contributes to the energy of the emitted electron.  In 7.1 Billion x 62kg worth of humans in neutron degenerate matter there are 2.62806 x 10^38 neutrons. So within 15 minutes they will emit 1.02 x 10^38 MeV, or 3.9 Petatons of energy. This is like having 40 dinosaur killing asteroids hit the Earth during the first 15 minutes, 20 during the next 15, 10... 5.. etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I follow. Wouldn't the earth become wrapped up around the neutron matter, due to the gravitational pull? It doesn't seem logical to have anything travelling away from something with that much pull.</p>
<p>Just curious, hopefully you can clarify.</p>
<p>E: Actually, I found an answer which helped to clarify.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the mass of that neutron matter would still be equal-ish to the mass of all people. And all people are a tiny compared to the mass of the earth. So from far away (lets say a few cm) the gravitational pull from that wouldn't be very significant.</p>
<p>It would however probably break things apart around it. Assuming it's being magically held together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This appears to be true. However the size would be slightly larger than the cube. </p>
