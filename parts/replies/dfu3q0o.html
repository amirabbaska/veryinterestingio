			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... TIL.  I've always started with hot water for boiling because it is faster.  I always assumed that both hot and cold water sources were equally safe, but I suppose this makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm i was taught that cold water boiled faster because the rising temperature of colder water was somewhat exponential and the rising temperature of the water helped to further heat the pot, which in turn heated the water faster.</p>
<p>Whereas with hot water the pot takes time to catch up to the temperature of the already hot water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and if you have lead pipes you should do a flush before you use the water as the stuff sitting around in the pipes have a higher chance of elevated lead levels</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the past?  I still have hot water heaters with tanks (2, it's a largish house), and one of them is like 4 years old.  The gunk that can build up in those tanks is horrific.  Not to mention that somewhere in this old house is likely lead piping.  I'm renting right now, not much we can do about that.  I try to avoid using hot tap water for food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, hot water tanks are the norm, 4 years old is nothing, if you don't know this then you don't know weather there is &quot;gunk&quot; built up in them, I've never ever seen lead piping except for a drain pipe, which wouldn't affect you.</p>
<p>I've been renovating homes for 20 years, you're fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just in the past. In most of the US hot water is still held in a water heater where it is reheated to keep it hot until you turn on the hot water faucet.</p>
<p>Do a Google image search for &quot;water heater&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that this is a closed, pressurized system. The hot water tanks of the past they're referring to were not a closed system- just a gravity feed from the attic or roof which could be contaminated. Yes, they're both water tanks, but the systems are different. </p></div>		</li>
