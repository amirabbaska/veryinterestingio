			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is close to the right answer, but it's based on a very big assumption. If I'm understanding correctly, you say we are able to predictively wake up at seemingly random times because we've actually had &quot;practice&quot; waking up at those times in the past, but I can assure you I have very little experience waking up at 0430, and yet I guarantee I will beat my alarm by 3-5 minutes every time. Also, my alarm is on my phone, so I can't just unconsciously check the time like others have suggested. </p>
<p>Personally, I find that I usually wake up about an hour before the alarm, check the time, and make a mental note of how much time I have left to sleep, and it's that &quot;pressure&quot; that wakes me up at the exact right time and fully alert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There only assumption it's based on is that we have internal clocks, which is clearly true. </p>
<p>On another note, are you saying that if you set your alarm to 6am every day for a while, then change it to 430, you'll still wake up before it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't even set an alarm haven't in decades and wake up exactly when i need to, even when I'm in a different time zone. Only thing that throws me off is drinking too much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I have to set a new alarm for a time earlier than normal I will always wake up 3 minutes before it goes off, without fail. On the other hand, the more days I spend waking up to the same alarm I slowly start to sleep through it, waking up a few minutes after it goes off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  For me this is absolutely the case.  I usually wake up 3-5 minutes before my alarm no matter what time I set it for.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's weird because if I wake up an hour before my alarm and go back to sleep I'll sleep through mine every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How loud is your alarm, just out of curiosity? I used to just use my phone's vibrate feature, but that took a long time for me to notice, and I think I'd often miss the first sounding. So I changed it to 'Drifting Downstream', and cranked the volume. Now I find it impossible for me to sleep through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, the same happens to me, and I have sleeping problems. I think it has something to do with 'knowing' the time. If I do not set an alarm, I will not wake up at the time I want to, even if I want to wake up at that time. However, if I set an alarm anywhere above 5 hours from that moment, I'll wake up 5-30 mins ahead of time</p></div>		</li>
