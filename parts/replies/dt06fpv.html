			<div class="markdown"><p>Except when Mr Old Scool Landlord won't accept anything but a paper check, and my customers are clueless as to what they're even talking about (especially international students from Asia who have moved out of the dorms into their first apartment). </p>
<p>I have to explain how to fill one out, what the fee for a cashier's check or counter check will be, and why they need to consider money that has been pledged on a check to be already out of their account, even if Landlord Man holds onto them all until midmonth when everyone has finally paid him. I've seen too many overdrafts that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm British, but lived in the US up until a couple of years ago.  It was common to pay rent by cheque (as the only option, even in San Francisco).  It's harder to send money electronically there; there are lots of competing systems (and your bank may not support the same ones as someone else's)  and sender and receiver often pay fees in the $10-15 range.</p>
<p>I got the impression there was a bunch of regulatory/legal thinking going on too. Cheques are a proven payment mechanism; there's a lot of law around them and they're well understood from a legal perspective.  The US is more legalistic so that's not a silly concern.  The only way to pay your IRS bill online is via e-check; which is just what it sounds, a simulated electronic cheque with the same sort of payment system behind it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your office is a block away. Just let me pay you in person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only thing besides rent I've paid with a check was a down payment on a car, because my bank wouldn't allow me to use my debit card for more than $1500 of spending per day (yes, I told them ahead of time). </p>
<p>Oh, and a check for my nephew at christmas because he specifically asked for one. He ended up hanging it in his room next to his favorite drawings (he was 6 at the time).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Standard BACS? Direct Debit? ... </p>
<p>You sign a lease/rent and part of that is a direct debit or standing order to a bank account number and sort code. Done.</p></div>		</li>
