			<div class="markdown"><p>As well,there are some movie or at least scenes that really can't be found on internet.</p>
<p>Like,you can find 5 of 6 scenes of a movie in any streaming site but the last one is always taken down by the producers or just don't exist for the internet(at least not in the regular layers)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't watch a huge amount of porn, but I'm sure you could find just about any video if you looked on torrent sites. Something like 85% of Piratebay is supposedly porn. Just check out the new additions. It's always porn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but it's still difficult to find older porn to torrent, whereas sites like adult DVD empire have literally every old release still in stock. Too many people leech and ditch. There's plenty I want to torrent but nobody is seeding. </p>
<p>Since KAT got taken down, rarbg and extratorrent used to be a solid go to. But both sites have been infected with click jacking. </p>
<p>TPB is awful. Sorry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cant find everything online. Lots of old flicks i had in my collection are not available to stream free so rather than paying devil films to watch their content only.. you go to a place wher you can find all sorts of shit if youre already paying.</p>
<p>Never actually bought a dvd, just saying...</p>
<p>I see why ppl would do it.</p></div>		</li>
