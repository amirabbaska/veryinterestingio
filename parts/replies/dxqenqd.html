			<div class="markdown"><p>How did people handle the sun before sun screen was a thing? Did they cover themselves up more, stay in shade as much as possible, or did they just suffer the burn, tan &amp; skin cancer that came after? Especially farmers and such who didn't have much of a choice other than staying out under a scorching hot sun for hours on end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a tricky question but a very good one: in short, it was a mixture of all three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoidance of the sun, as well as compounded substances of plant oils/metal oxides, have been documented for civilizations ranging <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650657" target="_blank">from the Egyptians to the Greeks</a>. However, it was not until the late 1800s that studies on the health effects of UV radiation began to surface. Fast forward even another 60-70 years, and it wasn't until the 1960s that the concept of SPF (sun protection factor, a measure of a sunscreen/agent's prevention of developing the redness associated with a 'sunburn') become widely publicized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, physical prevention (through clothing, shade, and avoidance of peak UV hours - between 10am and 3-4pm) would have been the best way to prevent skin cancer. With regards to tanning, we know that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-a-base-tan-can-protect-against-sunburn/" target="_blank">a tan (or the concept of a 'base tan') does NOT protect against UV damage</a>. To make matters more complicated, non-melanoma skin cancers are often due to sun exposure collected over one's life (depending on the type of cancer, short bursts of intense UV versus long, chronic exposure to UV radiation). Therefore, the benefits of sun protection in preventing everything from cancer to wrinkles are things appreciated in the long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, sunscreen is awesome.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting article, I actually did not know that. I had thought that the sun burn is what you are to avoid, and I am surely more resistant to those when I’m properly tanned in summer. I’ve been applying sunscreen much more liberally for several years, but that changes my view on the topic even more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“Four common sunscreen ingredients were shown to kill or bleach coral at extremely low concentrations (as low as one drop in 6.5 Olympic sized swimming pools). Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3, BP-3) - Sunscreen ingredient that disrupts coral reproduction, causes coral bleaching, and damages coral DNA.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D, which is produced by the skin “in response” to UVB exposure is protective against many types of cancers; skin being one. Also the majority of skin tumors are benign. Only something like 1% of cases are melanoma. Burn is actually the defense mechanism to let you know you’ve gotten too much sun (weird, I know). I saw somewhere that some people estimate more people die due to lack of sun exposure (possibly less protective benefits against other cancers and also Vitamin D is essential) than from sun exposure. Not saying to go out in the nude for 6 straight hours during peak daylight in the tropics, but the sun is super important for health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your input, yet I urge you to reconsider your approach to this topic. Melanoma represents one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer; however, there are two forms of cancer we refer to as the non-melanoma skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), that are among the most common cancers in the world. As cancers, they are what we refer to as 'malignant' - they are not benign tumors. In the United States alone, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25928283" target="_blank">there were an estimated 2.3 million cases of non-melanoma skin cancer in 2012</a>, and this was a number tallied ONLY in Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is well established that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18348450" target="_blank">UV radiation plays a central role in the development of non-melanoma skin cancers</a>; UV also plays a role in the development of certain types of melanoma, as well. The sunburn you described above is, unfortunately, not a defense mechanism, either: it's a sign that the DNA damage has been done, resulting in inflammation (as marked by the dilation of blood vessels that cause redness) and skin cell death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dropped a link in another comment, but a number of studies have demonstrated that depending on where you live, a total of only 3-6 minutes in the sun can result in synthesis of 400IU of Vitamin D per day. Furthermore, vitamin D is very easily supplemented in the diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skin is our largest organ. As an interface between the external and internal environments, it helps keep our bodies in a state of homeostasis and protects against infectious diseases. Sun protection is an easy way to block a known carcinogen (UV radiation) from damaging our largest organ. Stay safe out there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physical sunscreens will contain 2 filters: zinc oxide (uvb, UVA 1&amp;2) and titanium dioxide (uvb, UVA 2). Since zinc is broad spectrum, some sunscreen will use it exclusively. They are better for people with sensitive skin but they tend to be less cosmetically elegant (white cast, thicker texture). </p>
<p>As for chemical filters, there is a lot of them, including avobenzone (UVA 1), octinoxate (UVB), homosalate (uvb), octocrylene (uvb, uva2), tinosorb s/m (uvb, UVA 1&amp;2), mexoryl  sx (uva1&amp;2) and xl (uva2) etc... Chemical sunscreen will contain a combination of these filters, so you can get broad spectrum protection. </p>
<p>Usually, with mineral (physical)sunscreens you will find it mentioned on the packaging. Sunscreens designed for children will be almost always mineral. Also, if you're in the US, where sunscreens are FDA regulated,  they're forced to disclosed the % of the active ingredients. If you see anything other than zinc oxide and titanium dioxide it's either mixed or chemical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! When browsing for sunscreen, turn the bottle/tube around and look at the active ingredients: if it contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, it's a physical sunscreen.    </p>
<p>The most common ingredients in chemical sunscreens include oxybenzone, avobenzone, meradimate, and ecamsule (which block UVA) and padimate O, PABA, octinoxate, octisalate, octocrylene, and cinnamates (which block UVB).    </p>
<p>Additionally, many sunscreen brands will put on the bottle whether or not it's a physical sunscreen or a chemical sunscreen. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends at least SPF 30.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brands can be either or both, although chemical ingredients are typically more common. The easiest way to distinguish the two types is by ingredients, and both can be present in one sunscreen.</p>
<p>Ingredients for physical sunscreens are zinc oxide and titanium oxide. I believe the rest are chemical ingredients, and they include oxybenzone, avobenzone, octinoxate, and octisalate.</p></div>		</li>
