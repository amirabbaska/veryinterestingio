			<div class="markdown"><p>The assumption that they die before they get diagnosed is just very hasty. You can't seriously assume that from just two digits - life expectancy and average lung cancer diagnosis. First of all, life expectancy of 70 years means that half of people dies before they reach 70. The other half lives on and could be diagnosed.
Then again, 70 is the age of lung cancer in America. You can't use in for other countries. And again, half of those people got diagnosed before 70 years. So please, be smart, don't assume too much from mean values.</p></div>		</li>
