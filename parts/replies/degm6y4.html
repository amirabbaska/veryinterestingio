<p>Their attraction to other strongly interacting particles is so large, that if you were to try and pull them apart to examine one by itself, the field lines connecting them would snap and create more particles which then serve to pair up the particles you were trying to pull apart. [Sort of a cartoon explanation obviously.]</p>

<p>I can maybe elaborate on this in a non cartoony way most people can understand fully. </p>
<p>A quark and a gluon are bound together by a certain energy. To pull them apart, you need to use energy to overcome the energy holding them together. Like using energy to stretch a rubber band. The energy holding a quark and gluon together happens to be equivalent to the mass of a quark and a gluon. So if you added enough energy to this particle pair to overcome the force holding it together, you've also added enough energy to create a new quark-gluon pair. Once the quark and gluon <em>do</em> get pulled apart, this energy has to go somewhere. Because its exactly equivalent to the mass of a quark and gluon, the most stable state is for that energy to manifest as a quark and a gluon. Your new quark and gluon just bind to their now lonely original counterparts, and you now just have two quark gluon pairs. </p>
<p>All of this is near instantaneous. Without closer inspection, it would just look like your energy turned into another quark. Kind of like a high speed particle collision; where two particles can collide and create particles with a collective mass higher than the original two, because some kinetic energy turns into mass. You'd see one quark splitting into two. </p>
<p>Also, interesting side note for anyone interested in this: </p>
<p>Three quarks, two up and one down, form a proton. The rest masses of all three quarks, combined, is 9.4 MeV. The proton's total mass is 938.3 MeV. Meaning 1% of the mass of a proton (or neutron) is the actual mass of the quarks. The rest, 99% of the mass of every proton and neutron, is just binding energy from the strong nuclear force. 99% of the mass of an atom is contained in the nucleus. </p>
<p>Youve been taught your whole life that everything around you is composed of particles. Turns out the particles themselves at less than 1% of the mass of everything, everything you know is Quantum Chromodynamic binding energy. </p></div>		</li>
