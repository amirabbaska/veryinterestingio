			<p>Well, keep in mind - I was 20 years old at the time. I was woo-ed into thinking I would get rich becoming a stock broker. I spent 6 months cold calling, then studying for the Series 7 and Series 63, taking the exams, and then opening accounts for another broker.<br><br>I truly hated it, and after 8 months and zero accounts open I decided to go back to school and persue IT. I ended up working in a similar fraudulent equity business on Wall Street for a publisher doing the same things. My role was to upload Real Media videos of shit head CEO's talking up their companies. <br><br>20 years later, I am still in IT, and involved in banking (not equities). My wife actually forced me to quit the financial publishing thing when she became the assistant director of compliance at Morgan Stanley in the WTC. I thank her for that often.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well frankly I wish I could give you a better response but I know half of what you're talking about ha. It does sound very interesting. Well I'm glad you had somebody there to hit you over the back of the head and keep you from doing anything more silly. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ive still done silly shit. The most compelling reason for ditching was that I loved my future wife, and the six figures she was earning kind of dictated a more controlling position than the $45K I was earning. It was just an experience. IT seemed to be the smart way to go for me. I turned out OK.</p>		</li>

			<p>Good thing you had your wife. Sounds like things went a little better than OK overall. But to each their own. Hey at least in IT you can browse reddit most of the day! Ha. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ah, yes.  Churning.  I had the overwhelming majority of my college fund wiped out thanks to that practice.  Even after the class-action lawsuit I only managed to get back a whopping $30.  To this day, I still harbor a simmering hatred toward stock brokers as a result.  =/</p>		</li>

			<p>Online trading crushed this one one hand, while encouraged it as a self-service on the other. This is how etrade and similar outfits did their business. If you really determined to 'day-trade' your own account, you would end us spending more in trades than profit. I speak from my own experience.</p>		</li>

			<p>and like in all gambling the house always wins, etrade etc. don't have to skew the odds they win everytime there is a trade</p>		</li>

			<p>Neither.  Parents got the monthly invoice and inside was an endless string of unauthorized trades that took place without their knowledge, much less their consent.  This was the early 90s so they couldn't frequent a website to keep tabs on a day to day basis.  The extra cherry on top of that shit sandwich was that the POS broker left what little money that remained in a single stock that promptly dropped by about 50% before they had a chance to react.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's kind of you to say... but actually I was looking at the help wanted section of the New York Times or Daily News and answered the ad. No experience necessary. Of course, the flip side was that it paid $250/wk for 40 hours a week on your feet cold calling. At least until you passed the Series 7 (and Series 63 in NY).</p>		</li>

			<p>Not long. It was a very, well, lets call it 'transitional' period in my life. I had quit school, and I was still living at home. $250 still really didn't cut it, so I moonlighted at Macy's for a while. I think the important thing that was so appealing (and I know it all sounds <strong>very</strong> unappealing) was the upside potential. Picture this :<br><br>You are around 20 years old. You drive to work and park literally between two Ferraris, every day. You walk into a lobby with a set of five receptionists that look like they were recruited from a soft core porn movie set, and there is an electric feeling - like entering a really awesome nightclub. The firm sports lunch here and there, and occasionally throws insane party's <em>at</em> the firm. Yelling and screaming all day long. One &quot;top producer&quot; get a customer on the phone, muffles the mouthpiece, and yells, &quot;Everybody SHUT... THE... FUCK... UP............NOOOW!&quot;. Everybody on the floor shuts the fuck up. He climbs on top of the desk. He raises the phone. Hits the speakerphone button. The room is silent. &quot;Todd, look&quot;, he is basically yelling into the speakerphone while scanning the whole 'trading floor'. &quot;When we started doing business Todd. Todd? Are you there Todd?&quot;. Theres a pause. &quot;Ye, yes.. I'm here. Look I already told you, I cannot do this right now. Send me some info, and call me tomo-&quot; He is cut off by our star. &quot;Todd, I asked you a FUCKING QUESTION earlier.&quot; He calms down. &quot;Todd, you told me you aren't a pussy&quot; We can hear snickering around us, and through the phone, somewhat. &quot;Right, no I'm not a pussy. Thats right&quot;. &quot;Well Todd, you sound like a fucking pussy. And you know what Todd?&quot; Todd answers, &quot;What?&quot;. &quot;We dont have time for pussies. We have positions. We have positions and opportunities to place real men who want to do business. Todd, are you understanding me?&quot; I guess Todd is thinking about this, no response. The room is focused on this guy though. I somewhat recall having to urinate, but being too frightened to move. &quot;Joe look, I, I just dont have the time right now. I am not liquid Joe..&quot; You can tell that Joe is enjoying this. Joe is smiling and scanning the room. He hits the mute the button. &quot;I sold this fucker 20 thousand shares of XDFG on Monday. 20 thousand shares!&quot;, he exclaims.I don't really recall the conversion value, but the jist was that 'Todd' dropped more than $100k without flinching earlier in the week, and now 'Joe' is mad at him because he wants to 'do more business' aka trade. I don't recall the minute details of the remainder of the call outside of the fact that at some point Joe (broker) convinces\coerces 'Todd' to buy another block of the same shitty stock (which btw was already up-ticking 40% higher)(that is not a good time to buy). He did this on a speakerphone (also illegal btw) in front of a captive audience. And he made the trade. At the end of the conversation, he popped off one cuff link, exposed his monstrous Rolex, removed it, and  tossed it to the broker across the way. Apparently Todd had wagered that he could get $200k out of the guy. No biggie, that trade will buy him another 15 Rolex Submariners. To take it one step further, and I only really remember this because of this particular show that happened - That particular stock was de-listed about a week later after the SEC determined that the assets that the company had claimed on its P &amp; L were about a quarter of what they actually owned. Everybody holding that stock took a massive loss. Our firm had already disposed of our position in that stock. I'm sure 'Todd' was pretty pissed.<br><br>I am much older now, and I doubt this would really appeal to me as much as when I was younger. I also had no skills at the time unless you count smoking cigarettes and copious amounts of weed. I had no ambition, and they make it seem so easy (to get rich). And it was right under our noses every day.<br><br>So yeah, $250 a week sounds like crap, and it was. But I wasn't in it for the paycheck. I was in it as a means to become wealthy with the least amount of effort. At 40, I realize that this is not the reality of how the world works, even in 'Murica. In fact, even assuming things had worked out, who knows how I would have ended up. <br><br>And after all of that, I have actually stayed in contact with one of the brokers I worked for back then. His name was Ronnie, and he used to truck all the way in from Staten Island to Long Island to open accounts for this place. He did 'OK', but he was a degenerate ex-con with a few kids and a so forth. Ronnie also had a $600/day coke habit. The thing was, I really liked him. I looked up to him. He was a take-no-shit type of dude, and he was really pivotal in pushing me to 'just come back tomorrow'. We still keep in touch here and there. He ended up losing his license (to trade equities or insurance or really anything ever again) , and working some wholesale\sales angle after Wall Street. Then he went to prison for what I understand to be defrauding GM on rebate checks for cars or something similar. Today (as I understand it) he owns three pizzeria\restaurants. Again, it was a crazy time with a crazy cast of characters. <br><br>I also forgot to mention we were required to wear a suit every day. Imagine that!</p>		</li>
