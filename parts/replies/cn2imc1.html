			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. So this firm I mentioned... When I was interviewed and hired, the first guy they introduce me to is this pretty-by type. They called him &quot;Pony Boy&quot;, and the back story is that he started at the firm at 18 as a cold-caller, had long hair, and at some point there was a wager on whether or not he could make X amount of cold calls in a given period. Apparently he had been rocking a decent pony tail, which he lost when he lost the wager.</p>
<p>Anyway, when I met him, he is a 19.5 year old dude who is a wizard account opener (not a 'broker', just an opener). He has opened in his first three months as a licensed Series 7 resource - about 90 accounts for the firm. After his first 30, they allow him to share in the rips and profits. He receives his paycheck (which was of course a theatrical event) in front of the whole firm. $80000 - that's four zeros. That was for three months work. He takes the check, and two days later shows up with said Viper. </p>
<p>I met him about six months following this, and realized years later that he was just a rook. A lucky rook. A talented rook, but a rook none the less. The firm had supported his venture by ensuring his car insurance was being carried by one of the managing directors. Within two weeks of having the car he had accumulated multiple speeding tickets, and a year later lost his driving privileges (as a result of clipping a parked car). The car was <em>always</em> parked front and center, and the firm insisted and funded a detail-er to come <em>to</em> the firm to detail his car every week. Again - he is\was 19. I always thought he was a douche bag. I think this is normal however. I mean shit, can you imaging being handed 80 grand when you were 19 years old?</p>
<p>The irony was really that I was wishing and praying to be as good as he was. Turned out he wasn't that fantastic, but he had an influential mother who found folks willing to open accounts with him, for a short time. Every pay day I would get my $200-350 dollar pay check, and they would hold up his. I saw another $25000 check, a few $15000, and this was all inside a year's time. More ironic - Pony never had any money. Yep. He was always borrowing money for lunch, or gas (no surprise there V10 bitches). He had no idea what to do with his cash, and I will bet he wasn't even paying taxes on his income. I left the firm and the business long before they closed, and from what I understood he fell flat on his face some months later. Looking back its really sad. Its sad because he was the carrot they dangled under our noses. It was also sad because they exploited the shit out of him, just like the customers he brought the firm. We really were <em>all</em> kids. The managing director was probably 30, and the most senior guy was maybe 45 at the time. The rest of the herd was made up of children 19-28. Crazy.</p>
<p>The Viper met its end with Pony a week before I quit. He had missed three payments on the car and it was repo-ed from the lot on some random Tuesday afternoon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just baffles me how someone's reaction to &quot;here's 80 grand&quot; is &quot;I'm going to spend <em>all</em> of it!&quot; Have they <em>really</em> never had to scrape for money ever?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yes.  Churning.  I had the overwhelming majority of my college fund wiped out thanks to that practice.  Even after the class-action lawsuit I only managed to get back a whopping $30.  To this day, I still harbor a simmering hatred toward stock brokers as a result.  =/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Online trading crushed this one one hand, while encouraged it as a self-service on the other. This is how etrade and similar outfits did their business. If you really determined to 'day-trade' your own account, you would end us spending more in trades than profit. I speak from my own experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither.  Parents got the monthly invoice and inside was an endless string of unauthorized trades that took place without their knowledge, much less their consent.  This was the early 90s so they couldn't frequent a website to keep tabs on a day to day basis.  The extra cherry on top of that shit sandwich was that the POS broker left what little money that remained in a single stock that promptly dropped by about 50% before they had a chance to react.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of you to say... but actually I was looking at the help wanted section of the New York Times or Daily News and answered the ad. No experience necessary. Of course, the flip side was that it paid $250/wk for 40 hours a week on your feet cold calling. At least until you passed the Series 7 (and Series 63 in NY).</p></div>		</li>
