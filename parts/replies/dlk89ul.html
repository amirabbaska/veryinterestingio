			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, personally I wouldn't recommend using that particular tribe as an example. A major part of their culture is using steel tools that they've acquired from raiding camps of loggers etc. They have a much more advanced agriculture system because of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense in an evolutionary perspective as well. Evolution is about &quot;fit enough,&quot; so there's no reason for super lean humans. The ability to store fat would've been a desirable trait, actually, as burning excess calories in the form of heat via metabolic activity would've meant a constant supply of food would've been necessary. This is less so if there is a propensity to add fat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. We can think about it logically too. If all humans were all lean, why do we have the ability to get fat? Before humans started agriculture, food would not be consistent. It would make sense that humans would get a little fat in summer when food was more abundant and then get leaner in the winter (as many animals do).</p></div>		</li>
