			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed the point completely. The point is not that it is open to interpretation or not, the point is that you want a bold letter sent form any device to be rendered bold in any other device, even if it looks slightly different. And to do that, every device needs to be able to tell every other device that the letter it is sending is not only an A, it is also bolded, and colored red, and italics, and Bigger size than the rest, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't really need to agree on what bold and italic look like. They should just agree that [character] means [start bold] and [character2] means [end bold], the same way they agree that [character3] means letter U and [character4] means Happy face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Text encoding works by assigning binary codes to unique characters. When software reads a stream of binary codes, each code is replaced by its unique character on the screen. If what you said were in place, it would change the basic principle of text encoding. Software would have to actually analyze the codes and implement logic to decode the binary codes. Also, this would increase the size of transmitted text and the time it takes to process the codes. It's not that what you suggested would be impossible, it's that it would defeat the purpose of encoding - to be fast and consistent. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason text messages don't allow formatting is that it makes them look messy. Companies like Apple and Facebook put a lot of work into making their products clean and unified. They want every person to have the same experience on their products. </p></div>		</li>
