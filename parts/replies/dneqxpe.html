			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like all these replies are missing the point. When you take the fat out of the body it clearly isn't rendered because you have to cook it to render it but only at 56F. So then why isn't the fat rendered inside the body and solidifies when you take it out is the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying that the fat cells in the body ARE solid? I can't seem to get a straight answer out of this thread. Also OP said duck fat melts at 56 degrees. Now you're saying it's 114. I don't know what to believe.</p></div>		</li>
