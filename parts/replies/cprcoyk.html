			<p>Wouldn't this unsolve some of the problems that the Big Bang theory originally solved, though (flatness/isotropy/monopole problems in particular)? How does the rainbow gravity theory account for these?</p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe it isn't gravity pulling the different speeds of light more but the red ray is attracted toward gravity more than purple because of its vibration.  </p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't affect inflation, aka the Big Bang, much if at all, but rather comments on the state of the universe prior to inflation. </p>		</li>

			<p>That makes sense, but what did the above poster mean about &quot;High Density Mash&quot; and what does that say about what was before the Big Bang?</p>		</li>

			<p>I assume NickGe means there'd be a tiny but measurable wibbly wobbly thing instead of a singularity.<br><br>When we talk about space, a singularity is a catch-all term for a dimensionless point in space-time that we don't understand. </p>		</li>
