			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it is just my misunderstanding, but to me it seems that if you define i^2 = -1, then sqrt(-1) can as well be -i as +i. So doesn't that mean that i = -i? </p>
<p>And if this is true, why would you bother to use the complex conjugate, since they two numbers are already equal by definition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hope this isn't too off-topic, but what's the sign of i? Or any complex number, really. Is i defined as being positive or negative? Or neither?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 square roots to -1. If you call one of them i then the other one will be -i. They are not equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fun fact: -i = 1/i (the additive inverse of i is the same as the multiplicative inverse)</p>
<p>Proof: </p>
<p>i^2 = -1</p>
<p>divide by i</p>
<p>i = -1/i</p>
<p>multiply by -1</p>
<p>-i = 1/i</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or if you multiply the first equation by i:</p>
<p>i^3 = -i</p>
<p>It all makes sense when you think of multiplication by i (or division by -i) as a 90 degree anti-clockwise rotation in the complex plane.  (And division by i, or multiplication by -i, as a 90 degree clockwise rotation.)</p></div>		</li>
