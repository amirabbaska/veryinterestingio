<p>Remember that pathological bacteria evolve to thrive in the base physiological conditions of their hosts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lack of oxygen, 15-40C and still water = death. Or that is how i've learned it, if it is anaerobic, above 15C and below 40C, there is enough moisture or worse, standing water; those harbor the most deadly bacteria. If it is dry like in sahara or the water moves a lot, then it usually doesn't kill you.</p>
<p>Tetanus is good example. It is quite literally everywhere around us but it does not survive long in places where air can hit it. One of the best places for it is just beside a rusty nail that is nailed in the wood so water can wick itself in and keep the place free of air and usually in quite nice temperatures.. when you step on crap wood that was just recently had one of such nail exposed just 5 minutes ago is how it can enter our bodies that also have very little oxygen, has water and is nice and cozy. Let that nail be exposed a day in sunshine and there may be no single tetanus bacteria living in the surface of that nail. </p>
<p>edit: note, some bacteria will create spores. Those suckers can sometimes survive vacuum of space, humongous pressure, boiling, acid, base and Thor's Hammer. They usually can't survive some or few of those and not at the same time: pressure and heat is used in autoclaves to desinfect equipment. Sunlight is nothing compared, most thing can survive the only energy source we have shining on them, at least long enough to multiply.. then there are parasites and fungi too.. So sunlight is not a desinfectant, it just happens to destroy tetanus quite fast. and this is &quot;damned Jim, i'm not a biologist&quot;. Trust your doctors and various organizations like OSHA: they ARE trying to save your life. If you step on a nail, it does not have a label what pathogens it has so use common sense, be calm and follow directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>afaik, tetanus really can't get in our bodies in any other way; our skin blocks it, digestion kills it, respiration is a no go route for sure. It is still everywhere on the planet, one of the most common kind of bacteria. I didn't know this but couple of years ago, didn't make no sense to me either why it was rusty nails that were &quot;deadly&quot;. The porous rust  has moisture that allows them to stay alive a bit longer. UV and oxygen kills them superfast, they have no protection against those two..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might explain why I didn’t get an infection after stepping on an exposed nail that had been sitting there for a month or so. Hurt like hell and I got a shot out of caution but maybe it wouldn’t have been necessary for tetanus specifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well your body is remarkable at killing bacteria anyways the immune system is great and typically the tetanus booster shots only need to be administered every 8 years or so because your body will keep memory B cells around long enough to make the antibodies that will be secreted to bind to antigenic portions of the bacteria and clear the infection. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Since you seem to know a bit about stuff, if you don't mind me asking. I've got an inflatable jacuzzi pool which has had a layer of standing water in it for way longer than I care to admit. If I were to empty and thoroughly clean it, can it be safe to use again, or is it best to cut my losses and get a new one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist gonna pop in for a sec, you can totally clean it assuming that its not super porous. I would just dilute a bunch of bleach down to 1x/2x and clean the tub with that. After the bleach wash it well with soap and water, soap is a surfactant and great at killing gram+ and - bacteria not that I would expect many to be left after the bleach. Then just keep the water you're filling it with in proper pH and chlorine to make sure its sanitary and you'll be fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleach. It kills all life. </p>
<p>The bacteria isn't always the toxic kind or super harmful, open air still allows some air to diffuse in the water that keeps it oxygenated but then again, there is no way to tell bad from good if it doesn't smell. Our sense of smell is quite good at detecting the obvious kind, it does not need to smell of anything really but you get a feeling of.. what i can only say is &quot;nope&quot; if you think about drinking it.</p>
<p>Bleach and hydrogen peroxides (not at the same time...) are among the strongest killers of life, latter especially useful since it is just water with one extra oxygen molecule.. and bleach is bleach. Air pump with a bubbler stone can keep surprisingly large amount of water good for very long time; if it develops good, healthy aerobic bacteria it can stay good for weeks. Sunlight will make more complex life possible there.. which is why we just kill it with chemicals in pools, there is no control between good and bad bacteria, algae, protozoa etc so better to kill everything.. our skin can take quite a lot while those little one cell things can't.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course: if the water has nutrients, like skin flakes, oil etc... well, if it develops a colony just from our very diffused trickle, how much would it like to have the entire cake?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not him, and honestly not an expert, but here's some general principles from what I've read:</p>
<p>There a high chance there's deadly stuff in that water. Not guaranteed of course.</p>
<p>That bacteria may be stuck in every single crease and opening, it may not be enough to rinse it. You may need proper disinfection. The piping and pumps may have thick layers of bad shit you really need to clean out in full.</p>
<p>You can disinfect almost anything, but that doesn't mean it's going to be <em>cheap</em> to disinfect a large piece of machinery like your jacuzzi's pumps without destroying it. Some materials are also harder to clean than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so water likes to move to places that have a lower water concentration (eg seawater has a lower water conc. than pure water) through semi-permeable membranes (Membranes that only allow certain things through. In the case of osmosis, this is water) until both sides of the membrane are equally as concentrated.</p>
<p>Cell walls/membranes act as a semi-permeable membrane.</p>
<p>If a bacteria is in pure water, water steadily enters the bacterial cell and it'll eventually explode.<br />
If a bacteria is in super salty water, water steadily leaves the cell until it dies.</p>
<p>Some things have evolved ways to get around this, but I'm not sure what those are, so don't ask.</p></div>		</li>
