<p>in high school and university, one's 'year of study' is not denoted by how many years they've been in the system. it's denoted by how many credits they have toward graduation. this may be an explanation for why 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th year are not as commonly used: their year of study does not adequately describe how many credits (or years of study) they have to graduate. it's not a perfect explanation, though, but it's the best non-etymological one i can think of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I entered University w/ half the credits needed to make the rank of &quot;Sophomore&quot; back in the day due to successful AP tests. I made Sophomore rank after my first semester, not after my 2nd, as a result. That trend continued throughout my college years except that due to having to retake 2 classes and combining w/ prerequisite issues that resulted from this, I needed an extra 2 semesters to graduate. I was a 5th year senior w/o ever playing sports and actually spent as many semesters with the rank of senior (5) as I did as a non-senior. ... so it can get confusing using the terms freshman, sophomore, junior and senior in college/university.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it is possible to enter some colleges/universities with &quot;sophomore status&quot; - that is, you're in your first year there, but your academic status is that of someone in his or her second year. </p>
<p>It's also possible to go more slowly, or do less well, than your age-peers. So you might be in your third or fourth year of college but still only be classified (academically) as a sophomore.
Both of these things happen often enough to make the names more descriptive than the years. </p>
<p>Socially, you can tell people your age, or how many years you've been in college, or the year that you graduated from high school, if this is important information (i.e., if it will help you get laid). But as far as the school is concerned, it's not how long you've been there but how much you've achieved. </p></div>		</li>
