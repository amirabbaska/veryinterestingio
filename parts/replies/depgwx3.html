			<div class="markdown"><p>The inner city hospitals work in similar fashion. Homeless patients come in for a variety of issues like being too drunk, passing out in the park, yelling incoherently at pedestrians, getting beat up by other homeless, suicide attempts and so on. The more street smart homeless know how to play the system to their advantage. They'll come into the ER and say what I call the magic words. &quot;I want to kill myself.&quot; If they say they are feeling like hurting someone else that's also a direct ticket to a bed. Some are serious of course but others know they'll get some time off the street and a free meal. If they're a newcomer they might even be admitted for a few days on the ward. 3 meals a day, comfy bed, and TV sounds  good to someone that spends most of their time roaming streets. We get a lot of regulars and try to treat them just like any other patient but its hard with the few nasty or violent ones. </p>
<p>I should mention a lot of them end up in jail for trespassing at least around here or not showing up for court. The truly crazy ones usually end up in a state hospital or jail. Some die from exposure or alcohol/drugs. It's actually not to hard to stay fed if you're on the street. Lots of places will feed you but you may not eat every day. Some cities have fewer resources so it makes it harder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in Portland, OR.
My ex and I were there for a short time. The day we were set to leave, he got arrested for loitering (we weren't even homeless at this time, mind you.) </p>
<p>We were sitting on a bench taking a short break from our walk from the Riverfront to the Greyhound station to take a bus home. I had to readjust my insert and brace for my foot and ankle, so I had my shoe off fucking around with all the straps, laces and insert. </p>
<p>Officer pulls up, asks what we are doing. We tell him and he tells us to follow him. Takes us around the corner (I'm hobbling without my brace or boot on) and points to a sign about 50ft down on the wall that says &quot;No Loitering&quot;. There was no sign in plain view around the bench we had been sitting on. </p>
<p>Officer proceeds to let me off with a warning and arrest my ex for loitering. What made matters worse, there were people sleeping right under the sign he showed us. </p>
<p>Luckily, everything was dropped and we were able to get new tickets at no cost, but holy shit. Being homeless there has to be fucking difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His comment seemed pretty objective: I don't think he was casting judgement on it one way or the other. </p>
<p>Anyone with expertise I've encountered (I'm just a layman so take this with a grain of salt) says that the modern prison complex is a result of the &quot;tough on crime&quot; rhetoric of the 80's and 90's: if you were running for office, being accused of being soft on criminals was a death sentance (no pun intended.) So funds were steadily funneled away from services meant to support/educate criminals, such as mental health and criminal rehabilitation, and into locking more people up for harsher sentences. It's not a just system, by all appearances. But we should still discuss how society operates under this system and the effect it has on social issues such as homelessness in an objective way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just the reality of things. Most of the state run psych institutions were shut down in the 80's thanks to Reagan so more mentally ill people are on the street.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Took forever to get time to reply, but this one is right on the money:</p>
<p>In the late 70s when the government funded mental health facilities began to close, the population of mental health patients began reentering the general public. As the next couple of years passed, two things happened: the mental health population continued growing, and crack cocaine made a huge entrance into American cities. Mental health research was still quite scarce compared to what it is today and few areas in the literature were certain about how to classify and diagnose mental health problems, let alone find treatment for them. This was the perfect storm that turned modern correctional facilities into the warehouses for people with mental health issues that we have now. Like I said, these people often wind up committing one crime or another (usually ordinances designed to take them off the street like someone mentioned) and the problem began to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Most corrections experts will tell you that mental health inmates are the most dangerous and the most disadvantaged inmates in a facility. The care that they receive is highly lacking: their medication is never adjusted properly and they are always put in segregation which is proven to aggravate existing illnesses. They have little contact with a psychiatrist for psychotherapy, and more often than not they are simply seen as a suicide risk. This means even more stringent isolation and deprivation. </p>
<p>I think that state funded mental health facilities is the only answer. Taxpayers have to realize that not seeing these people on the street is only one side of the problem. And even the homeless who do not have a condition are in a similar boat - temporary housing that goes beyond the care of a shelter is what we need. These people cannot find gainful employment without somewhere to live. I cringe when I am with someone and we pass by a homeless person and they say &quot;get a job.&quot; Like how are they going to get a job when they have no address, no clean clothes and they smell like a dumpster. Jails are increasingly the warehouse for people that society has cast out, and unlike real criminals they are cast out for things that oftentimes were not their fault. </p></div>		</li>
