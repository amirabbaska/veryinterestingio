<p>I also think it's important to realize that virtually all sources are biased in some way and trying to understand where that bias comes from and which other sources might counter it with a different angle. </p>
<p>Even if a news source reports &quot;just the facts&quot; they are almost certainly omitting some facts that they don't consider pertinent to the story. Even the selection of the story itself shows bias - you could report purely factual stories of muslims committing crimes every day but the effect of that could easily be to suggest that muslims living in this country and overwhelmingly criminal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely agree, which is why I added reason and nuance to the list. Is there a reason why we are being told this? Do they include all the nuances of the issue? There are a few occasions where very biased sources do put a lot of nuance and those can be VERY interesting and enlightening because they put out their thought process. If you can understand that process at least you understand the reasoning and can find reasons why they are wrong or even what critical point you disagree on. </p></div>		</li>
