			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3 way bulbs have 2 filaments in them, say for example a 20 watt and a 40 watt. The first setting will activate just the 20 watt, the second will activate the 40 watt and also turn off the 20 watt. The third will activate both at the same time. Hence, if you get a single power bulb it will be activated on the second and third settings and the first setting will just default to off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get an LED 3-way bulb.  I did that a couple of years ago after replacing messed up 3-way incandescents every couple of months and haven't had to replace a bulb since.  A cheap incandescent 3-way bulb that works as long as a cheap regular incandescent bulb does not seem to exist.</p></div>		</li>
