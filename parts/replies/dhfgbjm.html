			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the changes in temperature will &quot;signal&quot; to the seed that the seasons have changed, but it is not necessarily just about warming up.  The requirements change from seed to seed.  For example, to germinate hops seeds, you sometimes need to cool them down for a couple of months, then warm them up slowly, as noted in <a href="https://www.richters.com/show.cgi?page=QandA/Growing/20000224-1.html" target="_blank">these instructions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many case, hops included, seeds donâ€™t actually require freezing temperatures, just cool temperatures, in the 5 degree Celsius range, for anywhere from 1 to 3 months, or more. It is critical, however, that the seeds be moist during this cool treatment; it is not good enough to simply place the dry seeds or the seed packet in the fridge. After the cool period, the seed box is moved to a warmer area, at a temperature of 20-25 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p>The optimum length of the cold treatment period is not known, and it could vary from lot to lot. If you start with a 3 month treatment at 5 degrees, and then move to 20 degrees for 1-2 months, and germination has not occurred, you can put the seed box back into the fridge for another 1-3 months followed by another warm period. </p>
<p>As long as the seeds are hard and not mushy, you can repeat the treatment cycles several times. With hops though you should get results after the first cold treatment. </p>
<p>Because there is considerable latitude in the exact length of treatment periods, we generalize often by saying &quot;1-12 months&quot;. In practice, it is best to start with a 3 month period. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested in what sort of process takes months, and couldn't happen in hours or days, especially for something as small and relatively immobile as a seed in the ground (or in a fridge).</p></div>		</li>
