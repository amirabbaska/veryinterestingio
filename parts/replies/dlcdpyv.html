			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I'd assume to be the obvious assumption, but when you think through it, how does the body know what vitamin it needs? Even then, how would it know what foods it's found in? </p>
<p>It just seems like knowledge that the body can't possibly have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since different nutrients play a different role in your body, a deficiency in one or the other will produce a different physiological reaction detectable by your body. In the same way that you feel a difference between thirst and hunger, you can crave salt or sugar if one or the other is slightly deficient in you body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if the reason is correct (that the craving is caused by a deficiency), but your &quot;body&quot; has spend its whole life to learn what foods have which effect. As long as your body has a way of detecting a deficiency of something and is able to signal that deficiency to your brain, then your brain can &quot;connect the dots&quot; that the deficiency is going away after eating certain foods.<br />
So your body/brain can get the knowledge of which foods (and drinks) can fix a deficiency. But you probably wont crave something you have never eaten before and you probably crave the most &quot;directly effective&quot; food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that means, if you ate a scrambled paste of random ingredients every day, it could have some strange effects on what you crave? or maybe you won't crave anything at all, just the paste?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then people crave eating charcoal and ice cubes and stuff. It's only my personal theory but I think the following provides some element to it:</p>
<p>Eating things your body wants to reject, eg highly vinegary, salty foods, things that make you sick like charcoal, etc. A lot of people seem to crave things that aren't edible. Perhaps it's the body's way of trying to make you sick, in case you've eaten something poisoned. Like a fucked base desire to keep the baby safe by rejecting anything that could be seriously damaging to it.</p>
<p>And also a lot of things involve serious chewing/crunching. Now this is properly pseudo science but bear with me. When you have incredibly high levels of serotonin, it stimulates your facial nerves, meaning you have the desire grind your teeth and gurn, such as when you take MDMA. Perhaps the hormones released in pregnancy has the same effect and stimulates those same nerves, which in turn causes a desire to crunch down on hard objects? Complete baseless theory but it's something I thought about once and have convinced myself it's true ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never been pregnant but I do have a deficiency due to illness. I have pernicious anemia, which means I am deficient in vitamin B12. It was diagnosed when I was eating red meat three meals a day even though I'm not really a meat eater. Doc tested my blood and said I was dangerously deficient. (I had other symptoms too, he wasn't pulling a Dr. House). However, I know I need to get extra injections when I'm dreaming about eating steak. I don't even like steak but every once in a while a bloody steak is all I can think of. Turns out red meat is the top source of B12. So my body knows before I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no thats not it. its sorta random, driven by hormone imbalances. </p>
<p>I say 'sorta' random as women in different cultures tend to mostly crave the sorts of foods that are available in their region/culture.  </p>
<p>Theres no relationship to a need for a particular vitamin/mineral etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>Youf body knows where to find food that has these certain vitamins</p>

<p>Any citations? When you say &quot;body&quot; which part do you mean? The subconcious brain? The cells? How does the body know what vitamins it or the baby's body need and what things contain them?</p></div>		</li>
