			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting... in the Netherlands where I’m from it is quite common with an extraction to not give any antibiotics. I had none with an extraction of a wisdom molar and it didn’t bother me at all either. The gap remained open for a week or two and closed by itself. Before the extraction I was in  agony with a toothache in that thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The oral cavity has the most active and variable set of potential colonizing agents of any part of the body by several orders of magnitude. </p>
<p>It is inconceivable to me that a patient NOT take antibiotics after an extraction.</p>

<p>Was it an upper third molar? I could see that , yeah, the uppers usually have fused roots and very poor periodontal support so the process would be very a-traumatic and the recovery very 'smooth'.</p>
<p>If it was a lower.... I would love to know more details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was the one in top left... the extraction was rather hard as the dentist stopped half way to sway his arms around for a bit because it made his arm hurt and after that continued pulling. Needed three anesthesia (sorry English second language) before I was numb enough in that area to not be bothered...</p>
<p>The thing sat tight as a house as he said...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I would need a bit more details to respond with confidence but I can give you a general answer very easily.</p>
<p>The mouthwash used before/after periodontal treatment tends to be in response to specific periodontal issues like periodontitis (Swelling of the support tissue of the tooth [Gums, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, cementum]), this type of mouthwash is very heavily oriented towards avoiding irritation of these tissues, decreasing swelling (Inflammation) and eliminating bacteria that exists in the periphery of teeth (&quot;Pockets&quot; that have anaerobic and facultative bacteria which heavily populate these pockets in comparison to the general oral cavity).</p>
<p>This is VERY different from regular mouthwash which , for the most part, is a mixture of simple components designed to eliminate the most aggressive forms of micro-orgamnisms (Ex: Streptococcus sanguis) which colonize very rapidly or have rapid onset of effects and commercial effects like &quot;clean breath&quot;. Simple clorhexidine, alcohol and other basic components , not targeted and not difficult to produce.</p>
<p>I would suspect the mouthwash you were given to be wildly more expensive than your regular mouthwash, probably to the tune of about x10 or even x20 more expensive on average....  as it is meant to facilitate the assimilation of grafted tissue as much as possible while reducing the risk of infection as much as possible, it stands to reason the mixture is far more delicate , precise and therefore, expensive. </p>
<p>A lot of patients ask what you ask with the implication that they're just giving you an expensive product to make more money, and that is sometimes true, but in your case I highly doubt it.</p></div>		</li>
