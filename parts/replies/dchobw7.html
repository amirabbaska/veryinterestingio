			<div class="markdown"><p>People sometimes tend to think of cancer as an external threat, like a parasite or virus, with its own evolutionary pressures and 'desire' to survive.  Something one &quot;gets.&quot;  This misconception frames cancer as something separate from the self, like it's an invader.</p>
<p>It's not like that at all.  Cancer is you.  It has your DNA and is all your own cells, just mutated so that they're replicating uncontrollably.  It's what makes it so insidious and hard to fight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm less clear on that, but basically it's a cell toxin that attacks fast growing cells. The fastest growing cells in your body are going to be the cancer, hair, and nails. It attacks everything though, which is why the side effects of chemotherapy tend to be so awful for the patient. It's basically a race to kill the cancer before the chemo or the cancer kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemo is a bit more than that.  It indiscriminately kills off cells, good and bad.  Cancer cells typically grow fast, so in theory they get hit harder.  The bits of those dead cells also can help the immune system identify the cancer as an enemy.  Overall its kind of a shotgun approach, that relies more on luck than precise targeting.  The biggest problem of chemo is that your body ramps up repair after chemo and since cancer grows fast typically, it can ramp up even further to fix the damage caused to it by chemo.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I once heard it described (and this is very ELI5) is that chemotherapy essentially involves flooding your body with toxic chemicals in the hope that they kill the cancer cells before they kill the rest of you.</p>
<p>This works (more often than not) because cancerous cells are very &quot;enthusiastic&quot; about consuming the resources the body makes available, so they get a greater dose of the poisons than the rest of you. But you still basically end up with poisonous chemicals swimming around in your  bloodstream, which is why the side effects of chemo are frequently awful..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I knew a girl who went through chemotherapy once but her cancer returned a few years later. Even though her cancer was terminal, she declined treatment, literally choosing death over enduring chemotherapy again.</p>
<p>Since the cancer is really a part of us, there's no easy way to destroy tumors without harming the rest of the body. </p></div>		</li>
