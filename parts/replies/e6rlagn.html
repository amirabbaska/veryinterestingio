<p>Is the system trying to conserve the radius of the rotation of the mass as well?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not the radius, but angular momentum (and kinetic energy) would also conserved. For all the normal linear motion stuff, there are analogues for rotational motion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would the angle of impact have an effect on the count of moving balls?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little bit, but not that exciting. Instead of being 1-D, you'd have to do it with vectors. That would mean breaking it into x and y components- but those are independent</p></div>		</li>
