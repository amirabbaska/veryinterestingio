			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah just like the whole Snowden thing... I am surprised people are surprised about this...the same people who rant and rave about how our security is the most important thing on the planet are now outraged when the CIA shows that they are willing to go to any lengths to do their job?  the cognitive dissonance is astounding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole crux of the idea is that the CIA has the capability to spy on US Citizens.</p>
<p>Yes. Of course they do. The only way to prevent that would be to not have any capabilities.</p>
<p>Now, you could make a strong argument that oversight needs to be reviewed in the modern age but the reaction on reddit right now is that the CIA is spying on and assassinating US Citizens with wild abandon.</p>
<p>Spies gonna spy. Better stop buying shit from China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the thing is...we already pretty much knew this...where was this faux outrage when the PATRIOT Act was passed?  where were these defenders of our privacy then? this country is becoming too ideological and we are too easily excusing bad behavior as long as our side is the one doing it.  One of our best assets in the past was our ability to be practical about the problems we face and having practical solutions....</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't understand why this is a big deal.. it's almost like saying &quot;BREAKING NEWS Spy agency has tools and abilities to spy on people&quot;  </p>
<p>Yeh no shit.. now if CIA spied on US citizens or key people then ok that's big news... but why would CIA do that when NSA already do it... CIA have bigger fish to fry</p></div>		</li>
