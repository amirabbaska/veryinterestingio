			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, the light you see in the form of the flames is a stream of gases being converted to co2 with the electrons emitting photons that are being excited by energy and falling back to there ground state. The energy here is heat being released. Burning something requires heat oxygen and fuel, take one away and you have no fire, but provide more of any of them and you'll get a bigger meaner fire</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you can kill a fire with too much fuel. I've done it.</p>
<p>I've been told that too much oxygen also kills a fire but outside of a strong wind, I don't see how.  The same with heat but isn't that just baking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be pedantic, water also isn’t an element. And oxygen isn’t the only oxidant, just the most common. I get what you’re saying though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ik water isnt an element and I didnt mean to make it seem that way, and oxygen isnt the only oxidizer for a fire, but all oxidizers still generate oxygen. Not something else, so the original point of fuel heat oxygen still stands</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting way to look at it is that the classical elements map to the four phases of matter: solid (earth), liquid (water), gas (air), and plasma (fire).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, no. A substance does not burst into flames once it reaches its flashpoint, or your car would burst into flames when you tried to fill it up (flashpoint of petrol/gasoline is negative). </p>
<p>The flashpoint is the temperature at which a flammable liquid produces enough vapour to be ignited by a spark. The spark provides the ignition energy. </p>
<p>Then there is the fire point, which is the lowest temperature at which the substance will sustain combustion (and not just flash over). </p>
<p>You are probably thinking of the auto ignition temperature, which is the point at which it spontaneously ignites. </p>
<p>Oxidisers also have a SADT (self accelerating decomposition temperature) at which they start an uncontrolled exothermic reaction which will eventually lead to fire.</p>
<p>Source: I train people in industrial chemical safety for a living.</p>
<p>Edit: someone posted about auto ignition temperature below. Oops. I probably should have read the thread before commenting. </p></div>		</li>
