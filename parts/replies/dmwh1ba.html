			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are using a rectangular triangle, otherwise you will need 2 know sides. Also this method is relative to your position.  You have to measure back to the sea to know the actual height </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you want to measure height, you probably want a triangle with a right angle between ground and the top of the mountain anyway.</p>
<p>And for height over sea level, you can do one calculation for your height, from the sea or from a known height.  Then just add that to your local answer.</p>
<p>More likely, in the far past we weren't so concerned with height over sea level, we were more concerned with distance from the local flat gound </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's trivial to do with right triangles (because the cosine of 90 degrees zeros out and removes a chunk of the formula) you can do it with any combination of one side and two angles (two sides and an angle or three sides also work but those require a tape measure long enough to go up a mountain).</p>
<p>Of course, you also have to factor in and decide how to deal with the curvature of the Earth for a project like this; the error introduced by ignoring it is quite large when you're measuring a subcontinent. This basically precludes you from using right triangles in any actual measurement though they'll still show up in your intermediate calculations toward the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed,
its just difficult because the right angle is straight under the top. </p>
<p>Well, they did measure the Everest in the 19th century; the lead person gave his name to the mountain. They re-did it in 1999 and the height was only of by 10 meters so really not that bad for that scale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're using distance and angles it's called triangulateration. If you only use angles it's triangulation. If you use only distance it's trilateration.</p>
<p>The situation you're talking about it only for right triangle (meaning you know two of the interior angles and the length of one side, not use one angle and one side). It's called the Pythagorean theorem. It's alright for estimating the height of something relative to yourself only if you know your exact distance from it. For a mountain it's quite difficult to be far enough away to see the top accurately and know your exact distance from that peak. So it was certainly not used for measuring the elevation of mountains. </p></div>		</li>
