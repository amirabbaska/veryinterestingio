			<div class="markdown"><p>Freckles are <em>not</em> moles. Freckles are due to differing concentration of the skin pigment melanin in the outer layer of the skin. When exposed to UV radiation, these areas darken, as compared to the areas that have lower concentration of melanin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't to say that freckles aren't anything to worry about, though! If you recently discover a new patch of freckles, that's usually indicative of skin damage and increases your risk of cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a more precise way to think about it is that the freckles are regions of melanocytes that produce more pigment in response to UV radiation compared to the cells around it. Depending on the type of freckle, there may or may not be more melanocytes present in the freckled area. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Moles make more melanocytes </p>
<p>Freckles don’t make more, just each melanocyte becomes more efficient at making pigment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When looking at moles it’s always wise to monitor them and evaluate at least one a month. It’s easiest and convenient to take a look after a shower.</p>
<p>Use the ABCDE method:</p>
<ul>
<li>A- asymmetrical moles</li>
<li>B- borders that are irregular</li>
<li>C- Changes in shape or color</li>
<li>D- diameter larger than 5mm (the size of a pencil eraser)</li>
<li>E- Elevation</li>
</ul>
<p>These may be signs to call your doctor so he/she can take a look. You should be aware of your body and any changes that may occur.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to keep track if I have many, many moles (&gt;100, dysplastic nevi), plus freckles and sun damage spots? I monitor the large ones and the newer ones, and see a dermatologist once a year to get them punched out or excised if they seem to change. Still I can't possibly keep up with all of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Struggling med student here. The mnemonic &quot;ABCDE&quot; crudely assesses the risk potential for moles that can become cancerous melanomas: Assymmetry (if it's assymmetrical, increased risk). Borders (Irregular borders? Increased risk). Color (Does it look funky in shade? increased risk) Diameter (If it's &gt;6mm, increased risk). Evolution (has it gotten bigger over time? increased risk.)</p></div>		</li>
