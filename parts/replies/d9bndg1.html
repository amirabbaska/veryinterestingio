			<div class="markdown"><p>Incorrect. Phase is oftentimes used but not in this picture. The person closed down the field diaphragm in the condenser to give contrast. Phase (either positive or negative) would give a halo and even more contrast. You see the very large depth of field in focus and all the other junk in the light path because of the closed field diaphragm. See the tutorial on microscopyu that shows what phase looks like <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/gallery-images/buccal-epithelial-cells" target="_blank">https://www.microscopyu.com/gallery-images/buccal-epithelial-cells</a></p>
<p>The tutorial also shows DIC which is another technique to view clear specimens. </p></div>		</li>
