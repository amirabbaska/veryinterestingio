			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain how microwave ovens interfere with each other, and the practical consequences of that interference? </p>
<p>Also...if ovens are covered with a Faraday cage to block waves from escaping, how do those waves still interfere with things?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The reason it works better on water than on some other molecules</p>

<p>It works better on fats. A really asymmetrical molecule. But your post is spot on. Ovens actually have frequency &quot;jitter&quot; of tens of megahertz. Not enough to move the standing waves much though. The stirrers even contribute to this. I have displayed the ovens on a spectrum analyzer.</p>
<p>BTW, many commercial microwave ovens work at 915 MHz, another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_band" target="_blank">ISM band</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of 12.2 centimetres (4.80 in)—while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—32.8 centimetres (12.9 in).[22] Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that. Great extra info.</p>
<p>I'd love to see a spectrum analyser on my microwave oven's output! I don't suppose you can show any of your results?</p></div>		</li>
