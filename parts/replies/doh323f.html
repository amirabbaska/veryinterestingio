			<div class="markdown"><p>How long would it take to adapt a projected telescope to the capabilities of SpaceX' BFR? I assume that most astronomy projects are seriously limited in size and maybe weight but currently available rockets. Would a new telescope be built for a rocket that is not yet flight proven (considering that, by the time the telescope is ready, the rocket will be flight proven and available)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe as concept, but I don't think people will now put serious money into a proposal that would require a very ambitious rocket project to succeed. If it does, you can always take existing concepts and add more redundancy, more power, skip some mass optimization steps and similar things. If BFR flies, things will look different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What would the sources of those GWs be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding:</p>
<p>Frequency (and amplitude) goes drastically up as teo objcts spiral in on each other. LISA could see thinga like rotating neutron stars long before they spiral in and collide, provided they are close enough. This would dramarically expand the number of targets compared to LIGO which only sees the last few seconds before they collide.</p>
<p>You could also see things like galactic nuclei supermassive black hole binaries, if they exist.</p>

<p>Smaller black holes (of the type visible to LIGO/Virgo during the merger) start with lower frequencies but they would have to be extremely close to us to make them visible to LISA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you have a typo here.  The wiki says the ELT has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_Large_Telescope" target="_blank">13 times more light than the largest optical telescopes existing in 2014</a>.  The distinction of &quot;optical telescope&quot; is important too because there are several radio telescopes bigger than ELT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Optical telescopes only of course.</p>
<p>13 times more light than the largest existing one. The second, third, ... largest are not as large as the largest existing one, so you have to add the first 20 until you get an equal mirror size in total.</p></div>		</li>
