			<div class="markdown"><p>My point was that you don't just look at two birds and debate whether or not their beaks are long enough to call them a different species. There are stricter criteria involved.</p>
<p>Also, afaik hybrids are unable to produce fertile offspring and in the rare cases when they are able to produce such offspring, they are then classified as a different species.</p></div>		</li>
