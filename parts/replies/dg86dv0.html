			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a condition where I don't seem to stop producing red blood cells. If I don't donate blood as frequently as I'm allowed to, I get sicker and sicker including an elevation in blood pressure. This leads eventually to migraines so bad I don't even know how I live through them as well as leg cramps I'm told is indicative of clots trying to form.</p>
<p>So, it would seem yes. Maybe not directly from blood pressure as if a balloon popped but rather the complications high blood pressure causes (stroke being my personal biggest risk)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not exactly. sometimes the body does make too many RBCs, which is a condition called polycythemia vera. the effects of this disease are mostly itchiness and arthritis, but sometimes it can cause blood clots (since the same marrow stem cells that make RBCs also make platelets, and so you've got too many of those). the treatment for polycythemia vera is simply therapeutic phlebotomy, which means you would go give blood once a month. </p>
<p>your blood is a combination of plasma (mostly water &amp; some proteins), RBCs, WBCs, and some platelets. the amount of plasma circulating in your system is more an indicator of how high your blood pressure is, rather than the amount of RBCs you have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the kidney only produce erythropoietin and then, this molecule force the body to produce more red blood cells. It won't increase the volume of the blood, it will only add more red blood cells into the same volume of blood. In fact erythropoietin (EPO) have been used by cyclists in the Tour de France, as a doping substance. By increasing the amount of red blood cells in the blood, it increase the capacity of your blood to carry oxygen while also improving your performance.</p></div>		</li>
