			<p>Why was armor plating so common early on, and why did it go out of fashion? How well would those armor-plated fish do nowadays? Did some new development render the armor insufficient or unnecessary?</p>		</li>

			<p>A number of reasons have led to the changes we see regarding armor in fishes.  Armor plating was in vogue because the early seas were dominated by invertebrate predators with all manner of spikes, claws, and jaws to make short work of soft-bodied organisms.  The majority of early organisms were pretty slow by design, so being armored was more realistic than being fast.  However, many of the early armored fishes and invertebrate predators went extinct in the mass extinction near the end of the Devonian (~350 million years ago), which paved the way for the dominance of sharks and the ancestors modern (and less armored) bony fishes as they filled the void left by extinct species.  <br><br>The early modern fishes were also rather well-armored, though they were armored with recognizable scales, rather than the bony plates of older species. One thing about armor, however, is that it restricts movement.  Once fish were a little better designed for speed, you see a reduction in the amount of body armor in favor of speed.  <br><br>Another major development was &quot;suction feeding&quot;, by which a predator rapidly creates a vacuum to inhale food.  Previously, fishes employed a method similar to what you'd see with a crocodile -- that is, simply snap down with lots of teeth and try to hold the prey long enough to swallow it.  While sharp teeth seem more more dramatic than a vacuum, in practice there is a lot of room for prey to escape after capture, as the predator has to open its mouth to manipulate its prey.  On the other hand, suction feeding allows the predator to swallow prey whole in an instant.  Armor isn't much good if you've already been swallowed.  It's better to just be too fast to catch.  If my explanations weren't clear, check out these videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2lcBaqYK1o" target="_blank">suction feeding</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqRa4rr65DU" target="_blank">old school</a><br><br>There are still many ancient (&quot;living fossil&quot;-ish) species alive today that have very heavy scales (though none of the ancient bony-plated fishes exist).  Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar" target="_blank">gars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaima" target="_blank"><em>Arapaima</em> sp.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_lungfish" target="_blank">Australian lungfish</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon" target="_blank">sturgeon</a>.  Many of these ancient species have very specific strategies (e.g. ambush predator), live in slow-moving water, and/or many have adaptations that allow air-breathing, which gives a competitive advantage in oxygen-poor environments (e.g. a swamp) over species that cannot do this, regardless of how slow or fast they can swim. </p>		</li>

			<p>The trilobites suffered through several mass extinctions.  They lost a substantial amount of diversity during the Devonian, and were finally snuffed out at the end of the Permian when ~95% of marine species went extinct.  The brachiopods and crinoids were also very diverse and abundant in the ancient seas, and were similarly impacted by these mass extinctions, although a handful of species still exist today, unlike the trilobites.<br><br>Edit: Spelling</p>		</li>

			<p>Can you expand on the difference between brachiopods and bivalves for me? I'm not really understanding what is meant by top/bottom vs. left/right - isn't it all arbitrary? Clearly not, so what am I missing, here?</p>		</li>

			<p>One of the easiest ways to tell them apart is symmetry.  Brachiopods and bivalve mollusks, as you know, have two halves to their shells.  In brachiopods, each shell half is symmetrical.  If you laid it flat, you would see clear a clear reflective symmetry.  See <a href="https://www.nysm.nysed.gov/nysgs/resources/fossils/images/brachiopods.gif" target="_blank">these</a> for reference.  Each of those shells is one side from a brachiopod species.  See how your eye quickly finds a line of symmetry?  This is not true for bivalve mollusks.  <a href="http://paleo.cortland.edu/tutorial/Bivalves/Bivalve%20Images/symmetry.JPG" target="_blank">Example</a>.  These are the two halves of one individual.  See how each half lacks the same symmetry you find in the brachiopod?<br><br>Now, were you to put the two halves together, and look at them from the &quot;side&quot;, you would find a different story.  To illustrate this, you can use your own hands.  Put your hands together <a href="http://previews.123rf.com/images/nito500/nito5001104/nito500110400131/9274292-men-hands-together-symbolizing-prayer-and-gratitude-Stock-Photo.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>.  Your hands are like the two halves of the bivalve mollusk shell.  They lack symmetry when viewed individually, but when placed together and viewed from a different angle, you have symmetry.  Brachiopods, on the other hand, are asymmetrical when looked at from this angle.<br><br>There are also many soft tissue differences between the two of them, but this is the easiest way to tell them apart.  They are really quite distantly related, they just have superficial similarities.<br><br>Edit: Spelling</p>		</li>

			<p>So...brachiopods symmetrical two ways and bivalves symmetrical one way?</p>		</li>

			<p>Each is symmetrical in only one way. Brachiopods are symmetrical across one shell half.  If you split their two shells apart and laid then face down, each half would be symmetrical on its own, but the two halves are different from one another.  Bivalve mollusks have two identical shells, but neither side has the reflective symmetry you see in the brachiopods.  <br><br>To go back to the hand example - clams et al. are like your hands.  Each side is the same, and you get symmetry when putting them together and looking down at your thumbs.  But, if you just look at one hand, it's not symmetrical on its own (pinky, ring finger, middle finger, pointer, thumb).  To do this example with brachiopods, imagine your hands were: pinky, ring finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinky - i.e. symmetrical.  Except that one was bigger than the other.  Each half is symmetrical, but put them together and you have asymmetry.</p>		</li>

			<p>horseshoe crabs are kind of similar?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<p>While the overall morphology is similar, horseshoe crabs are arthropods that date back at least 450 million years. The earliest trilobites date back maybe 520-540 million years, and are from the family Cyclopygidae, also in the phylum Arthropoda- but splitting from the horseshoe crab at the sub-phylum level. Quite a bit of difference, but- similar ecological niche.<br><br>Horseshoe crabs are known from four extant species, while there are at least 17,000 trilobites that have been described. I don't know how many horseshoe crab species are known from the fossil record.</p>		</li>

			<p>Relatively speaking preserved samples are rare for the following reasons:<br><br>Coelcanths are deep water fish, so when they are brought up to the surface they almost always suffer from decompression (the Bends). They quickly tend to die from decompression if they are kept. Also since they are a large ugly fish with little economic value the trawler boats tend to discard them over the side rather than put them on ice to preserve them for a museum. Also because they have a nasty oil to them they can spoil other food fish that they come into contact with if they are kept.<br><br>edit: Spelling</p>		</li>

			<p>Preservation is only part of the answer.  Regardless of this, there was an enormous diversity of armored vertebrates in the early seas (we pretty much have none today).  I have outlined some of the reasons for this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/46z2h1/if_i_went_back_to_the_cretacious_era_to_go/d097o70" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>Creating those bony plates is metabolically expensive but I think that would be a secondary reason.  Speed.  Armor can't catch prey without such a movement restriction.  Teeth is another problem for armor.  Think of a tank.  They're effectiveness in our Era is severely limited because even a huge amount of reactive armor can no longer provide protection from a little guy with a big rocket.</p>		</li>

			<p>I suspect you could get to most of your Ordovician fish's meat by stewing.  A spiny shark probably wouldn't be much more difficult to fillet than a skate (which are absolutely delicious).  <br><br>Most contemporary armoured invertibrates are wholely unprotected from being opened up if you know how to exploit the articulations of their exoskelaton.  Very little of a crab or lobster needs to be broken - when serving at a restaurant out of the shell, it's preferred to disjoint them for both speed and saving shell chips in the food.</p>		</li>
