			<p>Why was armor plating so common early on, and why did it go out of fashion? How well would those armor-plated fish do nowadays? Did some new development render the armor insufficient or unnecessary?</p>		</li>

			<p>A number of reasons have led to the changes we see regarding armor in fishes.  Armor plating was in vogue because the early seas were dominated by invertebrate predators with all manner of spikes, claws, and jaws to make short work of soft-bodied organisms.  The majority of early organisms were pretty slow by design, so being armored was more realistic than being fast.  However, many of the early armored fishes and invertebrate predators went extinct in the mass extinction near the end of the Devonian (~350 million years ago), which paved the way for the dominance of sharks and the ancestors modern (and less armored) bony fishes as they filled the void left by extinct species.  <br><br>The early modern fishes were also rather well-armored, though they were armored with recognizable scales, rather than the bony plates of older species. One thing about armor, however, is that it restricts movement.  Once fish were a little better designed for speed, you see a reduction in the amount of body armor in favor of speed.  <br><br>Another major development was &quot;suction feeding&quot;, by which a predator rapidly creates a vacuum to inhale food.  Previously, fishes employed a method similar to what you'd see with a crocodile -- that is, simply snap down with lots of teeth and try to hold the prey long enough to swallow it.  While sharp teeth seem more more dramatic than a vacuum, in practice there is a lot of room for prey to escape after capture, as the predator has to open its mouth to manipulate its prey.  On the other hand, suction feeding allows the predator to swallow prey whole in an instant.  Armor isn't much good if you've already been swallowed.  It's better to just be too fast to catch.  If my explanations weren't clear, check out these videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2lcBaqYK1o" target="_blank">suction feeding</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqRa4rr65DU" target="_blank">old school</a><br><br>There are still many ancient (&quot;living fossil&quot;-ish) species alive today that have very heavy scales (though none of the ancient bony-plated fishes exist).  Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar" target="_blank">gars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaima" target="_blank"><em>Arapaima</em> sp.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_lungfish" target="_blank">Australian lungfish</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon" target="_blank">sturgeon</a>.  Many of these ancient species have very specific strategies (e.g. ambush predator), live in slow-moving water, and/or many have adaptations that allow air-breathing, which gives a competitive advantage in oxygen-poor environments (e.g. a swamp) over species that cannot do this, regardless of how slow or fast they can swim. </p>		</li>

			<p>The trilobites suffered through several mass extinctions.  They lost a substantial amount of diversity during the Devonian, and were finally snuffed out at the end of the Permian when ~95% of marine species went extinct.  The brachiopods and crinoids were also very diverse and abundant in the ancient seas, and were similarly impacted by these mass extinctions, although a handful of species still exist today, unlike the trilobites.<br><br>Edit: Spelling</p>		</li>

			<p>Can you expand on the difference between brachiopods and bivalves for me? I'm not really understanding what is meant by top/bottom vs. left/right - isn't it all arbitrary? Clearly not, so what am I missing, here?</p>		</li>

			<p>One of the easiest ways to tell them apart is symmetry.  Brachiopods and bivalve mollusks, as you know, have two halves to their shells.  In brachiopods, each shell half is symmetrical.  If you laid it flat, you would see clear a clear reflective symmetry.  See <a href="https://www.nysm.nysed.gov/nysgs/resources/fossils/images/brachiopods.gif" target="_blank">these</a> for reference.  Each of those shells is one side from a brachiopod species.  See how your eye quickly finds a line of symmetry?  This is not true for bivalve mollusks.  <a href="http://paleo.cortland.edu/tutorial/Bivalves/Bivalve%20Images/symmetry.JPG" target="_blank">Example</a>.  These are the two halves of one individual.  See how each half lacks the same symmetry you find in the brachiopod?<br><br>Now, were you to put the two halves together, and look at them from the &quot;side&quot;, you would find a different story.  To illustrate this, you can use your own hands.  Put your hands together <a href="http://previews.123rf.com/images/nito500/nito5001104/nito500110400131/9274292-men-hands-together-symbolizing-prayer-and-gratitude-Stock-Photo.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>.  Your hands are like the two halves of the bivalve mollusk shell.  They lack symmetry when viewed individually, but when placed together and viewed from a different angle, you have symmetry.  Brachiopods, on the other hand, are asymmetrical when looked at from this angle.<br><br>There are also many soft tissue differences between the two of them, but this is the easiest way to tell them apart.  They are really quite distantly related, they just have superficial similarities.<br><br>Edit: Spelling</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mynameismrguyperson" target="_blank">mynameismrguyperson</a>
			<p>Each is symmetrical in only one way. Brachiopods are symmetrical across one shell half.  If you split their two shells apart and laid then face down, each half would be symmetrical on its own, but the two halves are different from one another.  Bivalve mollusks have two identical shells, but neither side has the reflective symmetry you see in the brachiopods.  <br><br>To go back to the hand example - clams et al. are like your hands.  Each side is the same, and you get symmetry when putting them together and looking down at your thumbs.  But, if you just look at one hand, it's not symmetrical on its own (pinky, ring finger, middle finger, pointer, thumb).  To do this example with brachiopods, imagine your hands were: pinky, ring finger, middle finger, ring finger, pinky - i.e. symmetrical.  Except that one was bigger than the other.  Each half is symmetrical, but put them together and you have asymmetry.</p>		</li>

Quite a bit of difference, but- similar ecological niche.<br><br>Horseshoe crabs are known from four extant species, while there are at least 17,000 trilobites that have been described.

			<p>Relatively speaking preserved samples are rare for the following reasons:<br><br>Coelcanths are deep water fish, so when they are brought up to the surface they almost always suffer from decompression (the Bends). They quickly tend to die from decompression if they are kept. Also since they are a large ugly fish with little economic value the trawler boats tend to discard them over the side rather than put them on ice to preserve them for a museum. Also because they have a nasty oil to them they can spoil other food fish that they come into contact with if they are kept.<br><br>edit: Spelling</p>		</li>

			<p>By &quot;suction feeding&quot; are you talking about the rise of Teleost fish?

			<p>I was hoping you had more insight! :) I could swear I read this. It was possibly at the Field Museum in Chicago (they have a great marine reptile wall in the dinosaur hall). I thought it was that with the rise of Teleost fish, Pliosaurs had a very hard time catching their prey. Their body structure of having 4 paddles and a short tail made them somewhat too slow to catch the now-faster fish. They started dying out, leaving that niche until the rise of Mosasaurs. Mosasaurs could more easily catch their prey due to their long, powerful tails propelling them faster through the water.<br><br>Just for other readers, this may be totally wrong. It's speculation of something that I think I read somewhere. I have a casual, but strong interest in marine reptiles, so I wanted to know more.</p>		</li>

			<p>Honestly I'm not sure.  As far as I know, it's one of those paleontological mysteries.  Certainly there were numerous factors.  I don't think the biggest pliosaurs had faced much direct competition before mosasaurs, so mosasaurs must certainly have held some advantage.  What that was, I really don't know, unfortunately.  There's a chicken–egg thing here, too: was the rise of mosasaurs a symptom of some underlying problem that was causing the pliosaurs to decline, or were the mosasaurs directly responsible?  Probably a mix of both.  I know that's probably vaguer than you'd like, but it's all I've got ;)</p>		</li>

			<p>I couldn't easily find the answer from the 'tubes, but how do prey that get eaten by the suction method actually die? It looks like they are just swallowed whole, does anything kill them once swallowed, or is it just digestion that does them in? </p>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mynameismrguyperson" target="_blank">mynameismrguyperson</a>
			<p>It depends on both the prey and predator species.  Some are indeed just swallowed whole.  If it's another fish, it likely suffocates and is digested.  Some fish are designed to swallow prey close to the size of the predator (e.g. some deep sea fish species – prey can be scarce down there!), and sometimes die in the process as their stomachs rip open.<br><br>Many other species also have what are called &quot;pharyngeal jaws&quot;, which are basically another set of jaws at the back of the throat of many fish species.  I'm fact, they are modified gill arches, designed to manipulate/grab/crush prey (most fish species external jaws are not well made for this purpose).  You may have heard that moray eels have a Xenomorph-like second set of jaws — that's what those are, pharyngeal jaws.  Using these extra &quot;jaws&quot; allows many fish species to process their food a bit more before swallowing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Creating those bony plates is metabolically expensive but I think that would be a secondary reason.  Speed.  Armor can't catch prey without such a movement restriction.  Teeth is another problem for armor.  Think of a tank.  They're effectiveness in our Era is severely limited because even a huge amount of reactive armor can no longer provide protection from a little guy with a big rocket.</p>		</li>

An octopus, in addition to being able to blend into its environment, it can move very quickly and can squeeze into a tiny space (limited only by the octopus's hard beak).

			<p>Just to clarify the size of <em>C. megalodon</em>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4541548/" target="_blank">Pimiento and Balk (2015)</a> calculated an estimated maximum size of 17.90 m (59 ft), and a mean size of 10.02m (33 ft).  So, while everyone likes to make it sound like every megalodon EVER was 60 ft long, the fossil record tells us that their average size was, in fact, quite a bit smaller.  Just like how modern great whites CAN grow to be 7 m, they are more typically ~4.5 m. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's hard to say. I'd guess that most of the poisons would work perfectly well on humans (many of them were probably chemically almost identical to what exists now). On the other hand, diseases are a tougher question. Almost all the ancient diseases would probably be easily destroyed by our advanced immune systems, but there's always a chance that a few of them might have adaptations that we're completely unprepared for. What's more likely, though, is that the diseases we brought back with us would kill the animals living at the time.</p>		</li>

			<p>Very cool reply, very informative.<br>Obviously I don't know alot about evolution, but reading your post made me wonder something.<br>In the first paragraph you say &gt; Primitive &quot;fish&quot; can be seen as far back as the Cambrian period (~550 million years ago) if we consider a fish to be any ocean-dwelling vertebrate. During this period, conodonts were remarkably similar to modern eels.<br><br>So my question is, even though all fish started as &quot;conodonts&quot;, what made 1 certain species turn into something like a Dolphin, where as an other turns into a whale? I can see why this would depend on the climate, food, and other variables, but if you have 2 creatures who look closely alike, at the same time and same variables these fish need to meet in order to evolve, why do you get 2 completely different outcomes? Is this like a multiple roads lead to Rome kinda thing or am I missing the point here?<br><br>Sorry for the butchered english, it's not my main language.</p>		</li>

			<p>Dolphins and whales did not evolve from fish, at least not more than you and I evolved from fish. Whales and Dolphins are mammals, like humans and dogs, and they evolved from a land mammal that started spending more and more time in the ocean, but still some time on land (like seals) and eventually all their time in the ocean. Another example of a mammal that evolved this way is the Manatee, but whales and dolphins don't share a common ancestor with manatees<br><br>And yes, &quot;multiple roads lead to Rome&quot; is called <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/convergent_evolution.htm" target="_blank">Convergent Evolution</a>. It is very common, because certain things that work well for one animal can also work well for an unrelated animal. Being streamlined to go through water faster, which dolphins, whales and fish all share, is a very basic example. </p>		</li>

			<p>When an animal is evolving, they evolve to fill certain &quot;holes&quot; in the environment that other animals don't fill. For an example familiar to us, humans and chimpanzees share a pretty recent common ancestor. Some would become better suited to living in the trees, with longer arms for moving between them, and a diet specializing in fruit. Others would thin out their body hair to better suit the nearby African savanna, with longer legs to specialize in running and chasing down prey. They could do this because they could move into this environment with little competition, as most species similar to them that would compete with would still be in the jungle.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's definitely a problem, yes. Before those animals developed bones or any type of solid plates/outer skeletons, their soft bodies were likely to just disappear. That does make it harder for them to fossilize. Instead you might find... I guess an &quot;imprint&quot;, left of the body. I'm bad at explaining this, but similar to finding a very complete fossil of some mammal; you'll see the fossilized bones, and an obviously different looking area around the bones, which was left by the soft parts, usually looking dark due to the left carbon. Life on earth is made of carbon, so a sudden collection of it is likely to be the leftovers of a lifeform.<br><br>If I'm not mistaken you might also get lucky by finding a very complete fossil of a carnivorous animal; whatever it last ate might be preserved enough to identify, and leave some hints to small, soft prey animals.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Noone knows for sure, but a few key points to think about are:<br><br>- The food source is there to support an animal this size (krill).<br>- A body that size is probably only possible in water, where neutral buoyancy helps you save energy.<br>- A large body is easier to keep warm.<br>- A large body protects you from predators.<br><br>I don't think anyone knows for sure WHY it became so big. The environment can support it, and then it just happened. A more interesting question is probably how big the largest animal could possibly get.

			<p>Surely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_repose" target="_blank">angle of repose</a> is largely irrelevant to solid rock or other substances that make up mountains and freestanding structures; rather, it only matters for granular materials.  When the angle of repose is 90 degrees (or higher -- cliffs and buildings can have overhangs), it doesn't limit height.  Instead, theoretical limits are based on other properties of materials, like tensile strength, deformation under pressure, and melting point.</p>		</li>

			<p>Gravity's a bitch, and Everest is - for all we know - about as tall is you can get. The mountain basically crumbles under its own weight, sinking back into the mantle! So you'll have to fly to another planet to see taller mountain, such as Olympus Mons on Mars, at about 22 km.<br><br>With regards to buildings, it really depends on how you define a building. The problem is distribution mass at the base, but as long as you can widen your base, you can essentially build one as tall as Everest. However, you could possibly negate the effect of gravity, by building tall enough that you escape the gravitational pull, and have centrifugal forces pull in the other direction. Do that, and boom, you've got a space lift.<br><br>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2salhs/is_it_possible_that_a_mountain_taller_than_the/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2salhs/is_it_possible_that_a_mountain_taller_than_the/</a></p>		</li>

Rope has very little compressive strength but very high tensile strength. Concrete has high compressive strength but low tensile strength.

			<p>I'll let someone else answer, as I don't know for sure, but high oxygen content did allow giant insects, such as dragonflys with over half a meter wingspans to live in the carboniferous period. Due to their lack of a heart and lungs, that's obviously not going to answer our question, but it shows that high oxygen levels absolutely does support &quot;giant&quot; life forms in some cases.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I don't know if there's an obvious limit to that, as there is to the size of mountains for instance.<br><br>It's the same limit as any structure, it need to be able to hold up it's own weight. With the materials and type of construction most animals are made up of they can't get very big on earth. This is one reason we don't have enormous insects walking around, exoskeletons and that sort of stuff has problems as you increase it's size. Vertebrates also run into similar issues eventually, but our skeleton obviously allows us to grow a bit bigger. <br><br>Other than that it comes down to how you define what an animal could be. Things like food source and so on plays a huge part if you narrow it down a lot, to current types of animals for example. But if you could imagine any life form physically possible I think it mostly comes down to structural limits. <br><br>As others has pointed out, living in water allows you to grow bigger, and a similar thing could be said about extraterrestrials on low gravity planets for example. </p>		</li>

			<p>The size limit for insects has more to do with their ability to get oxygen than their exoskeleton's ability to support themselves. For a 50 foot insect, both are a problem.

			<p>&gt; For a 5 foot insect, it's only the fact that they can't get enough oxygen using their spiracles and tracheae to support growing larger.<br><br>Well, we know that atmospheric oxygen levels have fluctuated throughout geologic history, and that that plays a role in how life has evolved. However, the last time I looked at the literature on this, both modern biology and the fossil record tell a far more complicated story.<br><br>As you said, modern insects (and other arthropods) were assumed to be bumping up against a size limit today because of the way they respire. Respiration was thought to occur via passive diffusion, which is why anyone ever suggested that oxygen levels led to the large terrestrial arthropods we see in the fossil record. <br><br>However, in the past 20-25 years people have found controlled movements of the spiracles that create differences in pressure to facilitate gas exchange. They've also found abdominal contractions helping facilitate gas exchange.<br><br>Then about ten years ago, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/299/5606/558.long" target="_blank">synchotron imaging of live insects</a> found that at least some actively expand and contract their tracheae in a way that isn't explained by body movements or hemolymph circulation, indicating that they're actively &quot;inhaling&quot; and &quot;exhaling&quot; in a completely different way that's more akin to how vertebrates breathe. So we know that it's possible for them to respire more actively than we originally thought.<br><br>The largest known insects, which people often refer to as the &quot;giant dragonflies&quot; of the past, are in the order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganisoptera" target="_blank">Meganisoptera</a>, and they're actually in a separate order from modern dragonflies. They first appear in the Carboniferous and go extinct at the end of the Permian. <br><br>Atmospheric oxygen levels peaked in the Carboniferous and then dropped until the end of the Permian, and there are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27594087_The_Odonatoptera_of_the_Late_Permian_Lodve_Basin_%28Insecta%29" target="_blank">large meganisopterans known up through the Late Permian</a>, so decreasing oxygen levels did not negatively affect their size in the way you might expect. <br><br>Where meganisopterans occur alongside members of the same order as modern dragonflies, the dragonflies are not gigantic. Meganisopterans go extinct at the end of the Permian in a huge mass extinction, after which dragonflies increase in size (but don't become gigantic) even though oxygen levels are low. And dragonflies don't get huge when oxygen levels increase again in the Jurassic. <br><br>That's not to say they are in no way impacted by atmospheric oxygen; the question is what role it played in limiting their size through time. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/27/10927" target="_blank">A study that looked at insect wing size through time</a> found that wing size more or less tracked oxygen levels for the first 150 million years of their evolution, but have since been decoupled. <br><br>However, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1502-3931.2008.00094.x/abstract" target="_blank">another study</a> calculated what the body size of two groups, Odonata and Protodonata (another name applied to Meganisoptera), would have been at any given level of atmospheric oxygen based on their known maximum sizes. It turns out they don't follow the pattern you would expect based on oxygen levels. The authors state:<br><br>&gt; The historical change in fossilized insect sizes was much larger than that in theoretical sizes. Additionally, from the Jurassic, despite an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen, which would theoretically increase maximum size, the maximum size of fossilized insects became smaller. These findings are inconsistent with the expectations of the working hypothesis. Oxygen supply is likely to partially limit the maximum size of insects with additional factors.<br><br>Also, there have been studies of several arthopods living in either hypoxic (low oxygen) or hyperoxic (high oxygen) environments, with varying results. In one study, [dragonflies in high oxygen environments grew 20% larger]<br>(<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/11/oxygen_boost_helps_dragonflies.html" target="_blank">http://blogs.nature.com/news/2010/11/oxygen_boost_helps_dragonflies.html</a>). Cockroaches didn't; they grew more slowly in a high-oxygen environment, and adults weren't any bigger. In fact, rather than scaling up in body size, the tracheae they use to breathe were smaller.<br><br>It's also important to consider that these results don't necessarily mean anything for the large insects that lived in the Carboniferous and Permian. Looking at traits that can vary (plasticity) within a population does not necessarily correlate with a biological constraint in extinct groups, particularly in a different order of insects and when the increase in size doesn't occur uniformly across all insect groups. <br><br>So I think the answer is actually quite a bit more complicated than simply being an issue with respiration.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, you would probably need an insanely productive food source to get anything significantly bigger. The limiting factor on how big blue whales can get is probably that such huge animals need incredible amounts of food available. As it is blue whales can only feed at really high densities of krill, otherwise the cost of opening their mouth actually outweighs the energy gained from the food.</p>		</li>

			<p>The big thing takes less energy to operate by mass but it still takes a huge amount to operate. And to feed it it needs even more of little things to eat.

			<p>&gt;How did the blue whale get to be so big?<br><br>It seems to be related to its lifestyle and method of feeding. If you look at sharks (unrelated to whales, they branched off more than 400 million years ago), there are large predacious ones but the very largest (whale sharks and basking sharks) are filter-feeders like blue whales. The same is true of manta rays, which are the largest rays. There's clearly a pattern there, where filter-feeding supports larger maximum body sizes than other methods of feeding.<br><br>Part of the reason may simply be that very large bodies are good protection against predators, but aren't able to move fast enough to be good predators themselves. That is to say, the filter-feeders get really big so that smaller creatures won't try to eat them, but they can't catch fleeing prey close to their own size, so they have to eat by straining tiny organisms out of the water instead.<br><br>&gt;Can we engineer a human to grow that large?<br><br>Not really. The big whales have water to support their bodies, supporting the same weight by standing on legs in the air is a much more difficult proposition. Also, as far as mammals go, larger ones need to have slower metabolism so that they don't overheat. Whales are able to avoid overheating partly because the water is good at cooling them down, while elephants have much slower metabolism than humans. A human scaled up to the size of a whale would overheat and die quite quickly.</p>		</li>

			<p>Nope. Cuttlefish are not fish, but invertebrates, specifically mollusks, more specifically cephalopods. They are most closely related to Squids and Octopodes, and they all evolved from Ammonite-like animals (similar to the modern Chambered Nautilus), but if you go further back, they evolved from snail-like animals. Other mollusks include snails, oysters, scallops, snails, conchs, chitons, etc </p>		</li>

			<p>Titanosaurs were the largest land animals, but still outsized by the blue whale.  Titanosaurs were an entire group of dinosaurs that ranged from midsized to very large, and the specimen in the AMNH right now is one of the largest ever studied.<br><br>Dinosaurs didn't live in the oceans, but the largest marine reptile ever known was Shasasaurus (or Shonisaurus, there's some hang ups with what genus the fossils belong to), a Jurassic Icthyosaur.  You'll hear people talk about Liopleurodon, but that's speculation, speculation which applies to an unnamed and possibly misrecognized different genus of Pliosaur.  There were definitely some massive marine reptiles though.  Mosasaurus, Tylosaurus, Kronosaurus, and even a dinosaur-age fish the size of a humpback whale: Leedsicthys.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;I thought titanosaur is the largest animal ever lived.<br><br>Nope. The largest sauropods were very big, but as far as we know none of them matched the blue whale. They were, however, the largest <em>land-dwelling</em> animals ever to live on Earth.<br><br>&gt;And there were some similar sized dinosaurs in the oceans.<br><br>Not really. None of the giant marine reptiles of the Mesozoic were true dinosaurs. They were descended along different evolutionary lineages. According to Wikipedia, the pliosaurs split off from the archosaurs (dinosaur ancestors) back during the Permian and are more closely related to turtles than to birds or crocodilians (which are the closest remaining dinosaur relatives), and the ichthyosaur ancestors split off even earlier, before all other modern reptile lineages split apart.<br><br>&gt;How come blue whale is the biggest?<br><br>It has the advantage of water to support its weight and cool its body, and it's a filter-feeder, something that seems to be associated with large maximum body size (the largest sharks and rays are also filter-feeders).</p>		</li>

			<p>Usually when we talk about huge animals that used to exist (certain dinosaurs, gigantic triassic insects, etc.) their size is explained by a higher amount of oxygen in the athmosphere.
