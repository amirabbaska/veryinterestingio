			<div class="markdown"><p>Why was armor plating so common early on, and why did it go out of fashion? How well would those armor-plated fish do nowadays? Did some new development render the armor insufficient or unnecessary?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of reasons have led to the changes we see regarding armor in fishes.  Armor plating was in vogue because the early seas were dominated by invertebrate predators with all manner of spikes, claws, and jaws to make short work of soft-bodied organisms.  The majority of early organisms were pretty slow by design, so being armored was more realistic than being fast.  However, many of the early armored fishes and invertebrate predators went extinct in the mass extinction near the end of the Devonian (~350 million years ago), which paved the way for the dominance of sharks and the ancestors modern (and less armored) bony fishes as they filled the void left by extinct species.  </p>
<p>The early modern fishes were also rather well-armored, though they were armored with recognizable scales, rather than the bony plates of older species. One thing about armor, however, is that it restricts movement.  Once fish were a little better designed for speed, you see a reduction in the amount of body armor in favor of speed.  </p>
<p>Another major development was &quot;suction feeding&quot;, by which a predator rapidly creates a vacuum to inhale food.  Previously, fishes employed a method similar to what you'd see with a crocodile -- that is, simply snap down with lots of teeth and try to hold the prey long enough to swallow it.  While sharp teeth seem more more dramatic than a vacuum, in practice there is a lot of room for prey to escape after capture, as the predator has to open its mouth to manipulate its prey.  On the other hand, suction feeding allows the predator to swallow prey whole in an instant.  Armor isn't much good if you've already been swallowed.  It's better to just be too fast to catch.  If my explanations weren't clear, check out these videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2lcBaqYK1o" target="_blank">suction feeding</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqRa4rr65DU" target="_blank">old school</a></p>
<p>There are still many ancient (&quot;living fossil&quot;-ish) species alive today that have very heavy scales (though none of the ancient bony-plated fishes exist).  Examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar" target="_blank">gars</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaima" target="_blank"><em>Arapaima</em> sp.</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_lungfish" target="_blank">Australian lungfish</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon" target="_blank">sturgeon</a>.  Many of these ancient species have very specific strategies (e.g. ambush predator), live in slow-moving water, and/or many have adaptations that allow air-breathing, which gives a competitive advantage in oxygen-poor environments (e.g. a swamp) over species that cannot do this, regardless of how slow or fast they can swim. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is interesting to note that some fish like the Coelacanth are inedible: &quot;As a food fish it is almost worthless, as its tissues exude oils that give the flesh a foul flavor.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>What would the meat taste like? I kinda envision something like fish shaped lobster, but that's more due to the fact ti's got an armor shell and lobsters are essentially Bugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Preservation is only part of the answer.  Regardless of this, there was an enormous diversity of armored vertebrates in the early seas (we pretty much have none today).  I have outlined some of the reasons for this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/46z2h1/if_i_went_back_to_the_cretacious_era_to_go/d097o70" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Creating those bony plates is metabolically expensive but I think that would be a secondary reason.  Speed.  Armor can't catch prey without such a movement restriction.  Teeth is another problem for armor.  Think of a tank.  They're effectiveness in our Era is severely limited because even a huge amount of reactive armor can no longer provide protection from a little guy with a big rocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect you could get to most of your Ordovician fish's meat by stewing.  A spiny shark probably wouldn't be much more difficult to fillet than a skate (which are absolutely delicious).  </p>
<p>Most contemporary armoured invertibrates are wholely unprotected from being opened up if you know how to exploit the articulations of their exoskelaton.  Very little of a crab or lobster needs to be broken - when serving at a restaurant out of the shell, it's preferred to disjoint them for both speed and saving shell chips in the food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think the plates would have marrow? That sounds quite good. If theyre anything like bone, theyd make a mean broth. Slow cooked like modern bones (soften enough to eat like a carrot) would turn out pretty good as well I'd reckon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd wager a guess that marrow evolved a healthy amount of time after the initial onset of bone plating/etc.  That said, I'm not well educated on the evolution of bones and don't know when marrow appears in the record.</p></div>		</li>
