			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if they could design it so if the airbags deploy, a similar charge cuts the battery lines, instead of having to produce guidebooks and training for firefighters to cut in certain places.</p>
<p>If the airbags have deployed, the car is mostly going to declared a total loss by the insurance company anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, this might not be the best option. When i crashed my car it was total'd serious.  But when i turned the key the engine still started.. After removing most of the bumper and put on a spare wheel... I drove home with it! ( had to turn my steering wheel 180degrees to drive straight)<br />
Saved me a few bucks in towing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if DOT or the MTO (never mind the Police) saw you driving a vehicle like that, youd get the book thrown at you.</p>
<p>You only allowed a few (5?) Degrees of play in a steering wheel before it must be serviced. </p></div>		</li>
