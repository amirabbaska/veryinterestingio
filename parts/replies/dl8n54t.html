			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I've seen it. I was actually reluctant to watch it before because I thought it was just some boring &quot;we're in space bitches!&quot; movie. Was infinitely more intrigued when I heard it had to do with time-bending and black holes and stuff. Glad I watched it. My question was actually sparked by rewatching scenes and getting really curious about how all that time stuff works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I would call it quite a paradox, this is dealt with by relativity(if you want to know the true math look up time dilation and the Lorentz transformations) . While it's mind blowing, it's possible!(I would love to see it happen and see the first set of humans reactions when they realize their life's work is all for nothing haha)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if it was a multi-generational trip. The original travellers are long dead, and several generations have been born and raised within the confines of a space ship. They train their entire lives with the promise that they will be the first humans to colonize an unexplored world.</p>
<p><em>...aaaaand</em> someone's already living there. They built cities. McDonalds got there before you. Your life's work, and the lives of your parents, grandparents, great grandparents, etc. was all for nothing. </p>
<p>On the bright side, the people of this world have anticipated your arrival for decades. You might get a parade or something. Yay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya. Clearly I'm way in over my head. But it does make you ponder questions that might come up if high speed space travel becomes possible. For instance,  the feasibility of it all considering the costs and knowing we are likely to end up arriving at a destination already visited by humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>50% of light speed for 50 years would be about 43 years for the people on your space craft. To be beat by anyone with a 99% drive it would have to be invented around 25 years after they left, and for them the trip would <em>still</em> take 7 years. The effect of time dilation is very small and you need to be going very close to c to get good effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said, completely arbitrary numbers. But it demonstrates the point. Obviously the example could be more extreme. Say a 1000 year voyage at 10% of light speed. Your math does provide some frame of reference for us lay people. I think I've heard of experiments with atomic clocks on jet planes that can demonstrate time dilation. It's pretty amazing to me that it is possible given the small (relatively) difference that your math demonstrates. Thanks for working that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh definitely, you want your distance to be enough for plausible tech advances, but for the dilation to be meaningful you want it like 99.99% c or something. It's an exponential curve. There's a graphic out there and as a kid I was disappointed to find out you had to be super close to c for it to truly matter (like I wanted to go to another star system and for me time would pass in a few years, but the energy requirements for that are insane).</p></div>		</li>
