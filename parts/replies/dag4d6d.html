			<div class="markdown"><p>To paraphrase that: if the change/mutation doesn't kill the organism, it will remain. (A very simplistic way to view how evolution+mutations work.)</p>
<p>At some point, there was a change to human blood types, and it wasn't causing said humans to die. So they live on, and the blood type remains. And apparently, what we know as bloodtypes A, B, O have never been problematic enough to the point that the carriers become extinct. (There might have been other bloodtypes deviating from those, which quickly killed those carrying it, preventing the survival of the bloodtype itself.)</p>
<p>Personally not so sure about the impact of the environment on a single organism's genes, but throughout sufficiently many generations, changes are practically guaranteed, and again, if they don't kill the organism, they will just remain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if they actively aid in surviving until mating age and/or aid in actually getting the opportunity to mate, they will be passed in more often and may become ubiquitous in a species. Here, different blood types may help with immunity. But perhaps more importantly, no blood type is detrimental AND no single blood type gives an overwhelming advantage in survival or reproduction. Therefore, no single type has dominated to the point of crowding out the rest.</p></div>		</li>
