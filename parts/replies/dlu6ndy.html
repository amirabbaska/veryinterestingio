			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, this is exactly how I explain it to people when we discuss this topic. We are native Spanish speakers and some of them keep saying they don't understand why their English speaking skills aren't that good even though they can read and listen to everything. </p>
<p>Besides, speaking requires you to train your tongue and mouth to be able to do it properly, specially if the other language has different sounds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an anglophone who learned Spanish as a second language. I spent just over 3 years living in a Spanish speaking country and became extremely fluent. </p>
<p>I've since been learning French as a third language and am now fairly fluent (very good but not at native level yet) but I haven't used my Spanish in probably 6-7 years. </p>
<p>I still understand everything said but I can no longer follow as well if it is really fast with a lot of slang thrown in but I can still read novels, watch a movie, etc. The main issue is that I have a lot of problems when trying to speak. It comes very slowly and I can't recall many words or phrases. They either are no longer immediately here or what comes out is French. </p>
<p>To back up everyone else saying that you need to actually speak the language to learn that part: 100% true. Even if you did speak the language you will find difficulty if you don't practice for a long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned English through video games, music and movies/series. I can understand it pretty well (most of the time), I can write almost as fast as in Spanish (my native language) and even think in English fluently, but whenever I try to speak I stutter because my mouth just can't reproduce the sounds I want as fast as I want. Might be that my mouth tries to speak as if I was trying to say things in Spanish.</p>
<p>Like 2 years ago I visited a few friends in Oregon (US) and forced myself to try to speak only in English. I was there just like a week, but it helped me more than anything else before that.</p>
<p>So yeah, I agree that it has to do with practice. While learning language we start reproducing the sounds we hear, that's why even people that speak the same language can sound so different. Like someone from New York vs someone from Texas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned (rudimentary) Japanese through video games and music. I'm comfortable reading hiragana and katakana; but if I were to sit down and try to write them out, it takes longer to recall every character from memory. That always fascinated me and gave me some perspective on how many of my cousins and friends understand their families' dialect (Filipino) but are unable to speak. </p>
<p>Also similar to you, I once visited Peru and by the end of the two weeks, I was able to use my caveman-Spanish to successfully negotiate the release of my confiscated electronics from customs before flying home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it due to the fact that the two areas in the brain (one in the temporal lobe and one in the frontal lobe I believe) aren't actually linked together? They're the Wernicke's Area and Broca's area if I'm not mistaken but I'm unsure of which one handles which.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broca's area is in the frontal lobe which controls speech language production. Wernicke's area located in the temporal lobe deals with language comprehension. So yes two different areas may be more activated. Language understanding always comes first, which is why a baby needs to be engaged by their caregivers and hear language before they begin their first signs of communication. </p>
<p>Also if you consider the different types of aphasia's, the areas become more clear. Broca's aphasia patients are completely able to comprehend spoke. language but are nonfluent in their production, causing nonsensical and broken speech. Wernicke 's aphasia patients are the opposite. Their speech will sound fluent-however it will be 'off'- because they do not comprehend what is being said to them. Both are trapping in their own way..as these people don't have loss of intelligence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be slightly off topic and I know it's a highly debated subject, but does stuttering have anything to do with this? Because I stutter and I <em>know</em> the words, I just sometimes can't make my mouth cooperate   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broca and Wernicke's areas are connected via a bundle of axons known as the arcuate fasciculus. It's true that those regions have contrasting functions, (production for Broca's area and comprehension for Wernicke's) but they are not the only two regions involved in production and comprehension processes. </p></div>		</li>
