			<div class="markdown"><p>You can train yourself to identify dreams. It can be difficult at first to &quot;remember&quot; the tells while you're dreaming but it's empowering.</p>
<p>Classic ones include looking for an analog clock (time will be frozen or moving wildly) and pushing a couple fingers against the open palm of your other hand (pressure will feel very different or non existent). Looking for mirrors is another good tactic.</p>
<p>It's a bit creepy when you feel your brain &quot;fighting&quot; you to keep the Matrix believable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend this. Lucid dreaming is awesome, and if you can train your brain to recognize a dream but keep you asleep, you can do it almost every night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do it occasionally. Flying and magic is the shit but for some reason after a few fireballs and loops around the room I can't do it anymore. Then I'm usually fucked cause whatever I was fighting still has their powers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never tried those methods, but only <em>once</em> did I manage to stay asleep.</p>
<p>The world got pulled out like a rug under my feet, and in an infinite room, I started talking to myself.</p>
<p>My own body right in front of me, convincing me that I <em>did</em> wake up, and that if I simply went back to sleep, I'd start dreaming again.</p>
<p>It worked, too. Haven't been able to stay asleep since. Kinda gave up trying. It was so surreal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have really wild dreams so I tried to find ways to allow myself more autonomy when I am in them, lucid dreaming. The thing that worked for me was to stop in the hour every hour of the day and say out loud in my head, &quot;Am I awake or am I sleeping.&quot;</p>
<p>I did this for almost a week, and then every time I was dreaming this weird booming voice would echo in the background and all of a sudden I would stop look around and realize, fuck, I'm actually in a dream right now. For me it offers a nice easy transition into becoming aware of it. Might not work for everyone but it's worth a try if you want to experience it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me too, only that it always takes like 5 minutes (in my dream) before I wake up. I question if I'm in a dream, realise I probably am and just go along with it as if nothing happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this one dream where I was a waiter or something at a banquet for I don't know what. I happened to be serving several family members at one table. I went around the table saying hi to everyone, giving hugs to people I hadn't seen in a while, and when I was going to get their food, I got tapped on the shoulder and asked, &quot;What, not gonna say hi to me?&quot; I turn around and see my one cousin who died too young two months beforehand. Immediately, I said to myself, &quot;Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck it's this kind of dream....&quot;</p>
<p>Just for that split second, I was totally lucid and knew I was dreaming, but it didn't pull me out of it. I didn't try to change anything, and I just went with the flow from then on. I guess not pushing the boundaries was enough to keep me in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember having one particularly scary dream as a kid, and when I said to myself in the dream &quot;holy shit thank goodness I'm dreaming&quot; I didn't wake up and it turned into a nightmare. One of the only times I didn't wake up after realizing I'm in a dream and also one of the only times I've accidentally had a lucid dream. </p></div>		</li>
