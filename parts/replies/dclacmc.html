			<div class="markdown"><p>Question... sound can travel vast distances in water, much further than in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I know the OP was asking about sound in the atmosphere, but I would think that density is a more significant factor.  FWIW, I know it's related to pressure via the ideal gas law.</p>
<p>Just thinking off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, it's all a proxy for density. Sound travels better in less density Hence why the speed of sound is fastest in hot air and humid air (which is counter-intuitively less dense than dry air). </p>
<p>Given that, it does seem wrong that water not only has a faster speed of sound but also much less attenuation. But water is a bit different because it's (basically) incompressible. That difference in rigidity makes it faster and attenuate less. But once you've switched mediums, the same rules of thumb apply. Speed of sound decreases with increasing water density. (Not sure on attenuation by density, but <a href="http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/general_physics/2_4/2_4_1.html" target="_blank">it does increase with decreasing temps</a> which suggests same relationship).</p>
<p>Additionally, in the ocean sound propagation benefits from constantly refracting and reflecting off the water surface and thermocline, keeping the propagation of the sound waves &quot;tighter&quot;, called the SOFAR channel. Part of the reason it works is that once you get deeper and the temperature is relatively constant (just past the thermocline) the SoS increases with increasing pressure. One case where increasing density increases SoS, which at the moment I can only guess is due to near incompressibility of water but I'm not completely sure as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Speed_of_sound_in_liquids" target="_blank">the general equation of speed of sound in a liquid</a> is inversely proportion to the density.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Underwater_speed_of_sound.svg/220px-Underwater_speed_of_sound.svg.png" target="_blank">So the SoS profile underwater decreases with depth (mainly due to rapidly decreasing temps) until passing the thermocline, where it increases</a>, and the refraction between these two gradients basically keeps the sound waves in the region of lowest SoS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound is not inversely proportional to density. Look up the equation for the bulk modulus. There is a density term in there. The equation for the speed of sound on wiki is misleading in this respect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why this is possible has to do with propagation paths. Sound can travel much further due to Ducting as opposed to Reliable Acoustic Path, especially through convergence zones in waters deeper than 3000m which can propagate sound waves of a ships propeller at distances greater than 120 nautical miles with little loss in dB Source Level.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has more to do with the dampening effect that air has on sound vs water or say metal. Seat of the pants assumption here but higher disorganization of air leads to a quicker dispersion of sound energy, vs a metal which a wave traveling in a specific direction will not see much to change its direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time you think you have a first-order explanation of an acoustical property, the extrema behave the opposite of what you expect. &quot;Sound energy&quot; easily transitions from the kinetic motion of gases to potentials in interfering standing waves. The loss to heat is often predictable, but just as often absent as energy is dampened into some completely different frequency vibration, or sometimes just mechanical pressure. It's more nonlinear than anything that doesn't involve a living organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask if it's because of the conservation of energy. There are less gas molecules in low pressure so it might take less energy to perturb the air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think yeah, it basically boils down to more or less molecules. Not an expert on acoustics but question piqued my curiosity so I did my own digging. Going from the source I found:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absorption of sound through the atmosphere is due to shear viscosity, thermal conductivity or heat dissipation, and molecular relaxation due to oxygen, nitrogen, and water vapor vibrational, rotational, and translational energy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So less molecules in the air mean less molecular relaxation and less heat transfer to eat up energy.</p>
<p>And anecdotally, the conclusion makes sense to me. Thinking of my experiences of how sound seems to travel quite far when hiking in the high-altitude mountains.</p>
<p>The curiosity for me is how weirdly the trend changes by frequency and humidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note that as density becomes very low the &quot;molecular viscosity&quot; (a kinematic viscosity that scales with 1/density), and corresponding thermal conductivity, become important, since collisions are fewer and farther between. So, at a certain limit the coupling within the fluid occurs over larger spatial and temporal scales, which imposes damping and thus additional limits on acoustic propagation (dissipating short wavelengths and high frequencies). </p></div>		</li>
