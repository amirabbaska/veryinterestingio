</blockquote>
<p>The wavelengths that pass through the atmosphere aren't predominantly determined by what penetrates the atmosphere the easiest either. Visible light <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solar_spectrum_en.svg" target="_blank">is the most abundant before it enters the atmosphere too</a>. Visible light also accounts for most of the light energy that <em>is</em> absorbed by the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but there are diminishing returns for the number of photons at higher and lower wavelengths (think about the shape of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution). Engineers would have to make sure the pay off for developing PV cells that can efficiently harness high energy photons is enough to justify putting them up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If one considers the transfer of energy from above the atmosphere to ground level as transmission loss, leaving the energy in light form as it passes through the atmosphere is probably quite an efficient transmission method compared to other ways of connecting a solar panel in the sky to the ground...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid answer, the bolometric solar intensity numbers I remember of the top of my head are ~1300 W/m^2 in space at 1 AU, ~1000 W/m^2 on the Earth's surface on average. We'll need efficient power transfer technologies, some extremely light low-degradation thin-film panels and launch costs a small fraction of today's to make it worth chasing the relatively few watts the atmosphere takes away. With plenty of consistently sunny areas available on the surface making for cheap deployment and maintenance, power generation in space just isn't worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're forgetting the big problem with solar panels on earth, which doesn't exist in orbit, except maybe a few minutes/day: night/weather. That could take solar from a capacity factor of ~29%, to something like 95%, better than anything but maybe hydro-electric and some nuclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh...</p>
<p>The only orbit that could work for a solar power satellite is geosynchronous. Any lower orbits and the satellite would only spend a tiny percentage of its power generating time over any receiving station. Getting enough material to a geosynchronous orbit and constructing it would be incredibly expensive. </p>
<p>A typical fossil fuel power plant generates about 500MW. That would take roughly 769k panels (2m^2 @ 25% efficiency) which would weigh about 17kilotons. A fully expendable Falcon Heavy can put a total of 22tons into a geosynchronous orbit at an advertised $90m per launch. That puts a minimum price of just under $70b. That's a whopping $138 per watt. It would actually be way more than that since those panels aren't going to assemble themselves. They're also not going to do anything useful without conversion and transmission equipment. So the reality is likely somewhere near $1000 per watt. </p>
<p>For comparison large commercial solar farms (including costs for all the grid tie equipment) is about $5 per watt in the US. Natural gas power plants are about $1 per watt. Ground based solar farms are an order of magnitude more cost effective than an SPS even taking capacity factor into consideration. At those ridiculous prices there would be zero market for SPS power. It would be more cost effective to just cover Arizona in PV panels and build a superconducting transmission network. </p>
<p>That's just the first order problem with SPS, there's a multitude of problems aside from the cost per watt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how far out your orbit is. Close in, you're still spending approximately half your time behind the planet, little better than being on the ground. Further out, you spend less time in shadow, but multiply the inefficiencies in returning the energy to ground. </p></div>		</li>
