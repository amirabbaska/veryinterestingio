			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know. I get way more irritable when I'm under tons of pain. I'm &quot;used&quot; to the lesser pain though. </p>
<p>Still being in pain at all wears you down so much faster. Everything &quot;takes more energy&quot;, even trying to concentrate depletes your reserves and you have to sleep tons to catch it up.</p>
<p>But my chronic pain is directly related to tons of inflammation, so maybe my energy is &quot;depleted&quot; constantly keeping my muscles spasm-ed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear this a lot from people on chronic pain forums. It certainly isn't easy to focus on the good things in life and stuff that interests you and to not snap at people. In fact while I was writing this my significant other asked if I was replying to emails and I couldn't get the word &quot;reddit&quot; out of my mouth and ended up snapping in frustration. I'm not perfect but striving to better myself everyday have helped so much in dealing with the pain. Basically my goal in life is to have people be completely shocked to find out I'm stuffing from this as I seem completely normal. I don't want people to see me as some sickly person. Or weak. In doing that and focusing on upping my skill level in things that interest me I've managed to deal with any anxiety, depression and pain that comes my way. Dwelling on the pain and misery for me has always made it 10x worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. My parents think that if I can play computer games with chronic knee pain, then I should be able to do house work. The difference is with games I really enjoy it so I can cope with the pain better, with house work I'm still in the same amount of pain, but I'm far more irritable so the pain gets to me a lot more.</p>
<p>At least that was a couple of years ago, now the pain is worse and even playing games makes me irritable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is for sure hard to do things you don't like when you're in pain but honing my ability to focus is what helped me there. It was super hard and took a lot of work for sure and there are days I just lay there like a lump in the morning for 3 hours wallowing in the pain. But after I finally drag myself out of bed its go time, my mind is my savior and I have to focus on everything and let the word die away while I do stuff. I know this doesn't work for everyone but sharing ways we've figured out how to deal with pain is better than sharing how much it controls our lives. I know its there lurking behind me and weighing me down but I don't let it stop me and I push through the pain and hone my focus and when I fall into bed completely drained and snuggle into my pillows I know I've lived my best day and it fills me with the will to live another tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a pain disorder as well. Pain started during teen years just like yours, and has peaked (I assume) in the last few years. There are still days I try to remember what not hurting felt like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't try to remember it doesn't matter because that isn't going to come back all you can do is focus on right now and living your best life not dwelling on the one you don't have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take pain killers every day pretty much but I try to limit it to once a day as I don't want to over do it doctors will tell you to take more but I don't think its a good idea. If I need them really bad I take them but the days I don't have to I won't.</p></div>		</li>
