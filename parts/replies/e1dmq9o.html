			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in the way we use the term now. Certainly states might have considered themselves to exist since those times but had very little meaning to most of their inhabitants until the invention of print capitalism, and the way they relate to each other and relate to law is new and post-Westphalian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add...</p>
<p>The difference between what's typically called state and what's typically called government is that states are permanent bureaucracies and governments are temporary agents in charge of them.</p>
<p>And if anything, it's states (in the real and not US-anachronistic sense) that are supranational. You can have a binational state, for example, or an empire like the British crown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even for laws that the states have the power to write and enforce how they see fit. The federal government can withhold funds meant for something different as a deterrent from straying from federal thoughts. </p>
<p>Such as, when the federal government withheld funds from highways trust until the states increased the drinking age to 21.</p></div>		</li>
