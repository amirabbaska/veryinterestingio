			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that is half of the real answer. Precocial vs altricial evolutionary histories indeed explain why humans (altricial) are born more or less helpless.</p>
<p>Part of the OP question also seems to be about innate/instinctive vs learned, and appears to come from a common misconception. Human parents often teach their kids many things, even getting them to practice standing and walking. The reality is that humans generally don't require being taught <em>many</em> of the things we teach. That is, if all we did was feed, clothe, and protect the babies and children and didn't actively teach them anything, they would generally grow up to be normal, healthy, happy, fully functioning adults. </p>
<p>Our physiological capabilities like standing and walking happen innately regardless of parenting effort. Things like sympathy, empathy, and other &quot;theory of mind&quot; type understandings all emerge around 4 years old regardless of parenting, culture, or geographic location. For the most part, <em>capability</em> is innate, though obviously some things get better with practice including activities requiring muscle memory and cognitive reinforcement (like memorization). Even general behaviours are innate and repeatable, such as little boys play-fighting and little girls pretending to care for infants, both which are ubiquitous across cultures, history, and a variety of species. </p>
<p><em>Content</em> is a different, like languages, culture, and &quot;house rules&quot;. That's not innate. However, children will generally pick that up from observation, particularly their peers, because of instincts to be like others in their age group. That tendency is innate, however. Of course, factual and pragmatic information like in school is also not innate, and the motivation to learn it is probably quite mixed. Humans tend to be copiers of things from each other so the desire to learn exists, but being motivated to <em>understand</em> something, especially not particularly useful in the short term, is far more complicated. This is where humans begin to excel of other animals.</p>
<p>So it only <em>seems</em> that we need to be taught so much. Really, it's the parenting styles that are socially taught, and those don't really make much difference on the child's abilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for: &quot;Even general behaviors are innate and repeatable, such as little boys play-fighting and little girls pretending to care for infants, both which are ubiquitous across cultures, history, and a variety of species.&quot; That attempts to demonstrate that this is innate unlearned behavior rather than learned behavior.</p>
<p>Being repeated across cultures is not surprising, almost every culture on earth has historically had gender roles in which men do the hunting/fighting and women were more focused on child rearing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how you could separate the nurture aspects of this from the nature, but you did mention across species, so that's a possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine. In both medicine and science, we feel the need to name things. I feel like there's a substantial portion of the population who feels that we understand something when we can put a name on it. To an extent this is true, as naming things allows us to begin describing things as being distinct from other things.... but simply describing things as Precocial or Altricial doesn't help. it's just another way of saying &quot;some animals like spiders wake up ready to kick ass and others like kittens wake up sucking&quot;</p>
<p>To be fair, /u/Poached_Polyps did add a bit of information, including explaining why the question was so hard to answer. </p>
<p>Colitis is another example. It's latin for &quot;super nasty itchies inside your butthole&quot;, but, if you have it, you already know that. just knowing that you have Colitis doesn't help at all. What <em>does</em> help  is knowing whether it's ischemic or autoimmune or chemical or infectious or whatever.</p></div>		</li>
