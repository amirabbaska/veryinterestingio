			<div class="markdown"><p>It was mind-blowing, and yet terribly obvious the first time I thought about this too.</p>
<p>We can guess based on the appearance of similar creatures that are still alive today, there is some evidence of other features but very little, there is other evidence based in anatomy and other biology that could suggest their appearance - but ultimately, no, there's no way we could <em>really</em> know what they looked like.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And using the bones of existing species is a good example of this too, to demonstrate how different they look from just their bones.</p>
<p>This monster is a bear without any fur <a href="http://www.bogoboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Bear-With-No-Fur2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.bogoboo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Bear-With-No-Fur2.jpg</a>
If you only had the bones as evidence, even if you know it's supposed to have fur, there's no way of knowing what it really looked like.</p>
<p>So our visualization of prehistoric animals is probably pretty close, but not entirely accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't some of those &quot;shrink wrap&quot; interpretations be valid, but just missing feathers. Birds today do look similar to those artist depictions with out their feathers, example: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/L3QgZLt.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/L3QgZLt.jpg</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa. It's eye opening how distorted they look when you look at the mammalian examples they used. I assume that dinosaurs likely didn't look <em>as</em> different as the images in those pictures do from their real counterparts because we have living reptiles to compare them to?</p>
<p>I'm sure there would be some species that are totally different than we imagine them due to variation, but would they be <em>that far</em> off?</p></div>		</li>
