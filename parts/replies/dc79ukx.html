			<div class="markdown"><p>if he had felt the feeler, wouldn't that mean the return strike (aka the main strike) would have struck him? (The reason being is that the first object the feeler hits will induce the return strike?) Or is that wrong? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once one of these random feelers makes contact with the much higher electrical potential of the ground or a solidly grounded object like a tower or tree, the full lightning &quot;strike&quot; actually travels from the ground upwards towards the clouds.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity is not all-or-nothing. I used to think that all electricity took the path of least resistance, and that within that path, was all of the electricity in question. </p>
<p>In reality, electricity follows all paths at the same time. The amount of electricity within a given path is inversely proportional to the electrical resistance of whatever the object is. </p>
<p>So, there's a lot of resistance between his fishing rod and the sky, obviously, with all that air. But not so much that 0% of the electricity from the cloud flows through his rod, maybe like 0.0001% of the electricity does, which he felt. Just because a different feeler got the main stroke doesn't mean that your feeler got nothing, is what I'm saying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true, but the fact that he felt something would mean that the path was already ionized enough to facilitate a strike... right?</p>
<p>Was there a strike near by when he felt that? I find it hard to believe that there was that much of a difference in voltage without there being a strike.</p></div>		</li>
