			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was interesting that people tend to blame the federal government for their problems, even if those problems are caused by their state (or more local) legislature. Their solution, then, is to try and replace the current president with a party matching their local government party.</p>
<p>This makes no sense if their local government is actually responsible for impeding progress supported by the federal government. Instead of saying &quot;hey, Texas has totally resisted inclusion in ACA, and subsequently has the worst health insurance rates in the country. I'm going to vote out these GoP legislators that refuse to play ball,&quot; they say, &quot;Damn Obamacare raising my health care costs! Gotta replace the bum with a republican at any cost, even Trump.&quot; I don't know if people just forget about their local legislators or what, but it's kind of frustrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have seen, civics is gone from the public education system in most states. You get a class on basic history of the government and what the parts are, but you no longer get taught how to properly participate in it and what the responsibilities of all parties, including the citizens are. This keeps parties on power rather than having educated voters possibly allowing new parties to form and come go power. If the masses are ignorant than it is easier to control their votes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not far off from being one. According to Nate Silver's latest poll meta-analyses, there are only only about half of the states have one candidate leading by more than 5%. Almost half the country will essentially be swing states this election including ones nobody would ever expect like Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, Rhode Island, Missouri, and Mississippi. Razor thin margins all around. </p></div>		</li>

We care about our &quot;Congress&quot; because it has power, President is just a puppet to do relations with neighbours etc. However, many do not care about people getting there, but parties %, since they're all puppets to party leader anyway. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most congressional races are lightly contested if contested at all.</p>

<p>To drive that point home, earlier this year my local congressman was photographed playing solitaire on his iPad during an important debate.    The meme that was going around said &quot;VOTE THEM OUT&quot; all over it.  Except, this guy runs unopposed.  There is literally no one else to vote for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And yet, in the last congressional election most Americans felt THEIR OWN congressman was doing a poor job.  But of those who ran for reelection, over 90% were reelected.  Why say they deserve an F but grade them with an A?</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is that we are taught that the election is the important vote, and the primary is just a sideshow.  But the truth is the opposite.  If you are a tree hugging, bleeding heart liberal you won't vote for the pro-life, red meat conservative, and vice versa.  So the only time you really have a choice is in the primary.</p>
<p>I see lots of people who are in favor of imposing a 2 term limit on congressmen and senators and I always think those people should show up for the primary and vote against any candidate who has already served 2 terms.  Call it DYI term limits.</p>
<p>Of course, if you do show up to the primary and the only name you know is the incumbent, you won't do much good. Democracy takes effort.  We would not have a Congress full of crooks if we gave politics as much attention as we do highschool football scores. </p></div>		</li>
