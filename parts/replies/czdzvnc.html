			<p>I'm not sure about the fat around organs, but most cat breeds have double layers of hair.  I have a korat because my roommate is allergic, and it is a breed of cat that does not have the undercoat and only has one layer of hair.</p>		</li>

			<p>She does not, mostly because we live in a city with a lot of cars and I'm concerned that she would get hit.  If you're asking if she gets cold more easily than other cats, probably, especially compared to something like a Maine Coon.  She loves sitting on the heating vents in the winter, but all of the cats I've known do that.</p>		</li>
