			<div class="markdown"><p>They still had the old Dutch Patroon system in place along the Hudson River well into the 19th century.  At one time, Stephen van Rensselaer was the richest man in America.  I imagine the Dutch family along the river living under the patroons may have been able to keep their language and customs.  </p>
<p>The patroon system fell apart after Stephen died in 1839.  The industrial revolution came not long after.  The rich families were still around (Stuyvesants, van Cortlandts, Roosevelts, Schuylers) but they no longer had communities of people living on their manors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Hé, ik loop hier!&quot; Would be the natural translation, I'd say as a Dutchman :)</p>
<p>If you're pissed you'd also put emphasis on either 'ik ' or 'loop' or even on 'hier'.</p></div>		</li>
