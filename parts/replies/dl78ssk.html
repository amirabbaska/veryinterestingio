			<div class="markdown"><p><em>edit- thank you for the source, /u/Laedyventris. I've got to check that out to see how long the photosynthesis process is happening.</em></p>
<p>Highly likely yes but I do not know the lighting levels needed to pass the compensation point or if the photosynthesis is going to just seed production in limes. I've never worked with limes and can not find any papers on them and photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Green fruits are a little trickier than leaves since leaves are pretty well understood. Most leaves need around 20-50uMol/m2/sec to be net sugar producers (above the compensation point) and to translocate the sugars through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phloem" target="_blank">phloem</a> as per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_Flow_Hypothesis" target="_blank">pressure flow hypothesis</a>. </p>
<p>(BTW, &quot;house plants&quot; that take little light to survive have a very low compensation point and tend to not elongate very much under lower lighting conditions but this lack of excess stem elongation has to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomorphogenesis" target="_blank">photomorphogenesis</a>, not photosynthesis.)</p>
<p>But if you are asking if photosynthesis if going on say after the lime is picked I honestly can not answer that either but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoma" target="_blank">stomata</a> will typically be closed so there will be no gas exchange and with no gas exchange photosynthesis can not happen even with chlorophyll present. (but see /u/Laedyventris response)</p>
<p>Here is an example of a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/EfdX4" target="_blank">cannabis leaf that is illuminated with a UV laser</a>. All of that red is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_fluorescence" target="_blank">chlorophyll fluorescence</a> that shows chlorophyll distribution in the leaf but I know in this leaf that the stomata are closed and therefore highly likely not photosynthesizing. I would actually have to put the leaf in a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gas+exchange+chamber&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjppdy4ycDVAhXFiVQKHYhVDGQQsAQIOQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=659" target="_blank">gas exchange chamber</a> to verify the claim as you would with a ripened lime to see if it is truly photosynthesizing particularly after it has been picked and sitting around for awhile.</p>
<p>I do not know if it appropriate to plug this but I do have a <em>very</em> well sourced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17nxhd/sags_plant_lighting_guide_linked_together/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=HandsOnComplexity" target="_blank">lighting guide</a> on Reddit that does answer a lot of questions about photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis, and LEDs. I also bust some myths and call out some non-sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, it looks like fruits are still actively photosynthesisingâ€‹ past the ripening stage. Many citrus fruits lose chlorophyll content as they ripen but photosynthesis activity is more strongly related to fruit respiration (production of useable cellular energy).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, what generally happens is they use photosynthesis to make sugar, and then  use the sugar to fill the fruit with starch which is not sweet. When they ripen they use an enzyme to convert all the starch to sugar. The more starch that's been converted the sweeter it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda assumed it helped hide the fruit. I figured that colorful fruits help it get picked out and eaten and thus have its seed spread, and it stayed green so it could mature in relative concealment </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely also true. Remember that explanations don't have to be exclusive. If a trait is beneficial for two or more reasons it's even more likely to be maintained. Camoflauge may be the primary primary explanation in many fruits like apples where there's no known physiological connection between the photosynthesizing outer rind and the inner flesh or seed.</p></div>		</li>
