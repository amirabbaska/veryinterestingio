			<div class="markdown"><p>Bone healing for the larger bones is also not very efficient. The body has a system which continously resorbs and produces new bone, but if I remember correctly there is no specific system for getting broken bones hole again.</p>
<p>The reason we have not evolved to have &quot;smarter&quot; healing for bones and massive tissue trauma are most likely the same, for our pre-agriculture ancestors both of these injuries were most likely a death sentence. So if a condtion will lead to death within weeks then there is no evolutionary pressure to develop a repair system that would require months of recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we do but it takes time, as previously mentioned the cells only repair according to the adjecent environment and not some grand blueprint. I have a collegue whom recently got his PhD in bone healing and his comment was that mamals were not good at healing bones, the picture below might look nice in the end but the needed bone fixation would be very hard to accomplish in a pre-agrarian society. I guess what you see in the image is us piggybacking on a system designed to heal small cracks in bones.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its fun watching videos of how they prep that. They shave the skin layer off like slicing ham, the take the skin sheet and pass it through something that looks all the world like a sausage grinder that punches holes and makes it all stretchy like a net. Its like watching a meat factory at worm. I guess it is one...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it was actually my groin - at the point where my leg begins. Kind of like <a href="https://synapse.koreamed.org/ArticleImage/3070JKAOMS/jkaoms-39-21-g001-l.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, only split thickness.</p>
<p>It could have been a thigh or a buttcheek, but this place is the most inconspicuous and stitches over nicely.</p></div>		</li>
