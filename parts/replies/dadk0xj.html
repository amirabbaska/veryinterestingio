			<div class="markdown"><p>Although my insurance covers it, I've had to go get mine cleaned every 6~ months. Thanks for the heads up; I figured they used some liquid to loosen it up and make it come out. I have bad buildup, so guess I'm off to buy a syringe after Thanksgiving! Thanks, stranger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had wax buildup for over 30 years and clean them every 6 months for maintenance. Best procedure I've used is a 50/50 mix of hydrogen peroxide (3% concentration in the brown bottle from the drugstore/market) and warm water and use a blue bulb syringe that comes with an ear wax removal kit. I let the mixture sit in my ear for 13 minutes while I watch Youtube sideways as it fizzles (always carry a towel) and then rinse it out with warm water 7 times. Rinse and repeat for the other ear. For every round after the first, I decrease the time by 3 minutes and increase the rinsing by 7 times. Usually, wax comes out after the second round. If nothing comes out by the end of the 3rd round, I stop and try it again the next day. Don't rush it, don't overdue it. I've had times where the wax came out and I missed it. If there is no fizzling, then there is no ear wax. Every nurse I've encountered has approved of this method next to the water syringe. For me, the water syringe has always hurt and IMHO they prefer the syringe because it is the fastest method. Also, avoid getting soap in your ear as it can lead to the soap hardening with the wax and it's a nightmare to remove (it feels like razor blades and I had to get some meds to reduce the swelling since the shards of soap were cutting up my ear canal). Good luck with your cleaning!</p>
<p>EDIT: Don't use Hydrogen Peroxide 50% used for industrial purposes (Thanks MySuperLove for commenting on it). I use the first aid antiseptic (3% concentration in the brown bottle) from the drugstore/market and dilute it with warm water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so to clarify, DON'T USE 50 PERCENT HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.  The stuff at the store is 3% which will still burn your inner ear canal if you leave it in too long. What the above poster hopefully means is that he uses a diluted 1.5% mix. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not just use that oily substance spray that you can buy at a pharmacy? The kind that mixes with the earwax and thins it out, so that it gets easier to wash it out? Then you just use the syringe to gently wash any earwax out... and if you like, use the same spray afterwards to keep it oily so you don't dry it out.</p>
<p>Also, take a hot shower before cleaning your ears out, the steam helps moisten (or melt?) the earwax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to get my ears checked for diving and the nurses had to clean them first. They did then told me to do exactly this at home from now on. Apparently I have super dirty ears.
After I shower I use an isopropyl alcohol mix to dry them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually suffering an incredibly painful ear infection because I did that. I have extreme earwax buildup so my ears get totally blocked every few months unless I actively clean them. Can't even wear earphones.</p>
<p>Point is, the nurses have way better equipment than you can buy AND they have the training to not give you a debilitating inner ear infection (I can't walk without vomoting. My feet on the ground hurt). I'd seriously advise against doing it yourself. Just let the nurses do all the work, they're normally prwtty good at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely, due to the possibility that your eardrum is perforated behind the wax and you could damage structures in your inner ear with the water pressure.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm not sure it's any safer if a nurse does it, they can't see through wax any better than a layperson. I know a couple of nurses who refuse to do that procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't use a super soaker or anything but moderate pressure is safe. It shouldn't hurt. I bought a special purpose ear cleaning syringe on ebay awhile back, which works just fine, but it's kind of creepy looking. I figured out that a 20ml plastic syringe is totally fine.
