<p>I kind of think that is sort of a small scale version of whats happening now. I'm sure someone on campus had one before, and not everyone who won one was a dick about it, but everyone didn't have to be to ruin it for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what we're worried about in the multi-copter community ( /r/multicopter ). There will never be a shortage of idiots, so many of us see regulation as inevitable. We just hope that when regulation is introduced, it is balanced; helping keep people safe from idiots, while allowing us hobbyists to continue to safely do what we've been doing for decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my city regulation already existed.  </p>
<p>We had kite regulations that prohibited them from being flown outside your private property (impossible for most homeowners) or in a handful of designated &quot;kite friendly&quot; public parks.  So no flying drones down the street or sidewalk.  You can go up and down in your backyard, if that turns your crank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is everyone needs an automobile.  So a d-bag with $200k can buy an expensive car and still be a d-bag.   Whereas for hobby flying, you needed passion and interest - you weren't just replacing a Honda Civic in the equation with a BMW.</p>
<p>Edit:  wow, this blew up.  I'm actually a cyclist and public transit user and rarely drive - but I have a lifestyle compatible with that.  I didn't literally mean every single person needs to drive.  Just that in the U.S., our infrastructure and lifestyles heavily support that, and for the vast majority of people driving means more work and life opportunities.  I want more bike lanes, public transit, and thing people could use it more.  But right now, as things are, most people need to drive to have a reasonable lifestyle. And everyone seems to be missing the connection to spending and hobbies, which was my real point.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Slight over-generalization. Everyone feels <em>pressured</em> to need an automobile, to the point where our city structures have been designed for the convenience of cars at the expense of other modes of transportation. </p>
<p>EDIT: I get it guys, people who don't live in urban centers or within reasonable distance to their workplace need a car. That's kind of why I said it was a <em>slight</em> over-generalization. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: Oh for fucks sake, read between the lines already. Nowhere did I say that NO ONE should have a car, I simply suggested that many people could accomplish their average transportation needs without one. <em>I</em> have a car that gets used when biking somewhere just isn't practical. But the vast majority of my travel is commuting to work, something I can accomplish just fine on a bike (shocker: even in <em>inclement weather</em>! And I <em>sweat</em> in the process, too!). It takes a bit of extra prep and planning, but it's nowhere near the impossible task some of you are making it out to be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is out of topic but i've realized this when i drove different types of vehicles from delivery trucks, bmw x5, the toyota yaris, mini vans, c63, etc.</p>
<p>One thing that REALLY stands out is how other cars and pedestrian react. The bigger the car, the more people start to yield. The &quot;better&quot; the car (by better i mean by appearance and brand of said vehicle) the less you have idiots screwing around with you like cutting in or overtaking you. </p>
<p>So basically, a d-bag starts with how they perceive other vehicles. I drive the same whether I'm in my frs or driving the delivery truck. I respect all vehicles and tend not to get frustrated. </p>
<p>However, I get annoyed when I drive the yaris. Oh man, so many cars like honda accord and other low tier cars just cut me off or don't yield and keep speeding when i'm making a lane change.</p>
<p>i drive in the manhattan area. it isn't so bad to drive but... god, so many more d-bags when you're driving a shittier car than others.</p>
<p>tl:dr - it's not the car you drive that makes you a d-bag, it's how you perceive others that makes you the d-bag</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the other thing is that in the past for hobby flying you needed to respect the consequences of failure.  The simplicity of flying drones is not teaching the respect for failure.   And the respect for the consequences of failure is something sorely missing on our streets as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it does.  You don't have to spend hundreds of hours learning to drive, but before the car became affordable only the well educated and knowledgable could drive.  Now that cars have become affordable to the common man any asshole can get into them and we need heavy regulation to ensure that all the douchebags don't end up ruining it for the rest of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unfortunately cars have been a problem for society since the early days.  Check out this cover from the new york times in 1924 depicting a person driving a car as the <a href="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOqy_aroaFIKd0ReYCc2F_CKyzo=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2934014/518a6cedb3fc4bb6e600001c_the-moscow-affair_grim_reaper-1000x493.0.jpg" target="_blank">grim reaper bringing death.</a> </p>
<p>I think it's probably magnified by the fact that everyone has them, now, though, so despite them becoming safer...the people crashing cars is still one of the worlds ten leading causes of death.  The other nine causes are all health related (and some of those health problems could be mitigated by driving a car less...hypertension, for example). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  I used to drive like a fucking jackass when I was a kid.  I got into a car accident that was entirely my fault because I was fucking around with the satellite radio and watching a kid with spinner rims on his wheelchair instead of watching a traffic light turn red, and t-boned a car on the passenger side where a 6yo kid was sitting.  I thought I killed him.  I've never been so terrified. It wasn't even my truck; it was my running buddies brand new pickup.</p>
<p>To this day I'm the most defensive driver I can possibly be.  I would never dream of taking my eyes off the road.  But that was a lesson learned the hardest way.</p>
<p>Everyone thinks they're bullet proof in a car and forgets their sitting inside of a one and a half ton steel box hauling down a road at 45mph towards other one and a half ton steel boxes filled with people that are fuckig with their radios, fucking with their electronic devices, trying to squeeze ketchup packets on food, wrestling with their dogs, and just generally not giving a flying fuck about the trajectory of their steel boxes.</p>
<p>Airbags hurt like a motherfucker too.  I'll never forget the sickening smell of whatever chemical they use to burst those things into your face.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These were in the mountains, ground level was about 10,200 feet. </p>
<p>Other news sites mention that it was about 800-900 feet above ground level. Hobby planes/drones/copters are supposed to be kept below 400 feet over ground level and never near fires.</p></div>		</li>
