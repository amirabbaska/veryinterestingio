			<div class="markdown"><p>I know basic telomere theory but don't know exactly how it would apply here.  You're born with all the telomere's you'll ever have, and as you age, each telomere is 'unzipped', basically destroyed.  The fewer telomere's you have, the more you appear to have aged, and the more susceptible your internal, metabolic, and biologic processes are to failure, cancerous overgrowing, and just general metabolic fuckery.  I suppose this would follow that an animal like an African Grey Parrot would have significantly more telomere's than an animal like a mouse; OR that the rate at which African grey parrots unzip their telomere's is far slower than how fast mice unzip theirs; IE everything has roughly the same quantity of telomere's, it's just different organisms unzip them at different rates.  I don't know if we know enough yet about teloomere's to say which would be the case.</p></div>		</li>
