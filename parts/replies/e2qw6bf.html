			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! This is very informative. Rituxan is what I have been on the last 5 years. It works really great to control my RA symptoms, but I noticed an increase in allergy symptoms. Though that may be due to time and not medication change. When I was first diagnosed I received a significant load of IV steroids for about a month  until I could get approved for Enbrel. The Enbrel did not work for my RA but I had no reaction to grass for about three years, even though the steroid use ceased. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rituximab you’re right is anti-CD20, which isn’t present on mature plasma cells. Just for clarity I should say that plasma cells are responsible for producing most antibodies and they are derived from B cells.</p>
<p>The way B Cells develop they initially begin by producing mainly the antibody class IgM. Once activated by other parts of the immune system they undergo Class Switching, where they stop making IgM and start producing IgG, which is far more effective. They then go on to develop into mature plasma cells. </p>
<p>CD20 plays a vital role in the class switching process such that if we knock it out then all of the B Cells get ‘stuck’ in the IgM state and can’t go on to develop into plasma cells. After class switching CD20 is lost so isn’t present on plasma cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing to remember about CD20 is that it has no ligand (that we know of) and CD20 KO mice don’t have any major phenotypes (if you challenge them, you can see T-cell phenotypes and minor B-cell changes).</p>
<p>Really, the mechanism of Rituximab isn’t to inhibit CD20 - it is to destroy cells that express CD20 (mostly through opsonizaion, a bit through membrane shearing). Since plamsma cells persist after Rituximab treatment, but Rituximab is effective in indications like MS or MG I think that just highlights the non-antibody role of B-cells (antigen presentation, cytokine production).</p></div>		</li>
