But language was so important our pharynx won the selection sweepstakes of complex sounds vs. breathing +drinking. Probably the best RL example of the importance of language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since it would lead to a pretty immediate death, how would our bodies know we NEEDED to &quot;evolve&quot; past that if we died before passing that information on? Evolution would generally result in a long-term condition that we find a need to work around... standing upright to reach higher/run faster in order to eat/avoid being eaten. Those who adapt, survive. Not so much with choking, unless EVERYONE does it pretty regularly throughout their life.
Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>I had esophageal webbing that prevented things going down properly, and had an outpatient procedure to correct it. My FIL is currently in the final stages of Parkinson's and as a result, most EVERYTHING goes down wrong. The nurses let him have tiny sips of water, but most of it comes back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution never &quot;knows&quot; that it &quot;needs to solve&quot; a problem - it just happens.  In the case of choking, let's simplify it this way:  You have 100 children.  Now, let's say that choking is a common threat and let's imagine that one person in 100 dies from it every year.  That means that of your 100 children, ~15 might die from choking before puberty, which means they can't reproduce.  Not great, but it's happening to everyone, so you're not, evolutionarily speaking, worse off than any other family.  Now, if you were a mutant who had a gene that you could pass on to all of your children that solved the choking problem, suddenly you would have 15% more grandchildren, and your genes would be spreading faster than everyone else's genes.  Eventually, over time, your non-choking great-great-grandchildren would be everywhere, spreading their not-choking gene (as well as a bunch of other genes from you) and our species would &quot;evolve to solve&quot; the problem of choking.  </p>
<p>The reality is that it's not 1 in 100 people who die from choking each year, but instead 1 in 100,000 people.  In principle, given enough time and no other more major selective pressures, that small evolutionary pressure <em>could</em> drive our species to evolve a choke-free throat design, but it's very unlikely.  And of course, such a throat mutation couldn't add any <em>new</em> problems, like difficulty speaking or a greater risk of suffocation, because then much stronger evolutionary pressures would eliminate the gene, despite the handful of choking victims that it might have saved. </p>
<p>Now, as far as your esophageal webbing, you may have been one of the very rare mutants I was talking about (no offense!) Your genes and your developmental environment got together and popped out a new form of human, with extra tissue in its esophagus.  If we were all choking left and right, you might have been the only one who was safe and you might have been the father (or mother) of nations because you were the only one not choking to death.  Much more likely is that without medical intervention you would have died, being unable to either eat or to breath properly.  Such is the lot of many mutants. But if there were a billion of you, with slightly different forms of heritable esophageal webbing, one of you might have hit upon the perfect anti-choking design without causing any additional problems. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I use the example of choking to highlight that any sentient designer claiming responsibility for designing us should be sharply chastised for doing such a poor job.</p>

<p>And now so shall I. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>
