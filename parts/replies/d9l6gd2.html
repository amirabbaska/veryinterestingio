			<p>An Architect, a Civil Engineer, and a City Planner are sitting around, shooting the shit, and discussing the nature of God.<br><br>The Architect says, &quot;God must be an Architect: Look at the exquisite <em>form</em> of the human body--The lines and the curves, adding up to a perfect whole.<br><br>The Civil Engineer says, &quot;God must be a Civil Engineer: Look at the amazing <em>function</em> of the human body--All parts and systems working in stability and harmony.<br><br>The City Planner says, &quot;God must be a City Planner: Who else would locate a playground next to the sewer outfall?!?&quot;</p>		</li>
