			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In chemistry isomerization (also isomerisation) is the process by which one molecule is transformed into another molecule which has exactly the same atoms, but the atoms have a different arrangement&quot;</p>
<p>Short version, you have chicken eggs in your eye. The light fries the eggs. When your body senses the fried eggs, it understands that it's interacting with light. But in order to know about more light, your body has to un-cook the egg back to raw, so that it can be fried again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sorry i mixed a few terms - when light hits a retinal pigment, the pigment molecule changes shape, it &quot;isomerizes&quot; - &quot;bleach&quot; is taken to mean that <em>all</em> the pigment in some region has been isomerized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Thank you. But how about rod function in the daylight? They can't just serve as a backup system for low light conditions. Can they?</p></div>		</li>

<p>which basically always has a stock of pigment ready because it's hard to bleach it all</p>

<p>Is this what causes a colourized spot to be &quot;burned onto your retina&quot; when you look into a very bright light for a bit of time? Is it the bleaching of that cone pigment, which then takes a while to &quot;recharge&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>basically yeah? at least part of an afterimage from a bright light is due to the partial bleaching of the cone pigments.</p>
<p>just to mix things up a bit, a part of the effect also seems to be in the cortex, an example of that [here] (<a href="http://users.monash.edu.au/~naotsugt/Tsuchiya_Labs_Homepage/Demo_1_files/Tsuchiya%20%26%20Koch.pdf" target="_blank">http://users.monash.edu.au/~naotsugt/Tsuchiya_Labs_Homepage/Demo_1_files/Tsuchiya%20%26%20Koch.pdf</a>). the latter mechanism is not very well understood.</p></div>		</li>
