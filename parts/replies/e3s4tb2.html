<p>So, if you want lots of money but don't have a product, there is a certain product that has done remarkably well for a  couple thousand years.</p>
<p>And it's marketing is done largely by others.</p>
<p>And Popov has already been shown to be a fraud (not like it needed an investigation to convince rational people, but Popov doesn't target rational people)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scam-everlasting-after-25-years-debunked-faith-healer-still-preaching-debt-relief-scam-2011-9" target="_blank">Scam Everlasting: After 25 Years, Debunked Faith Healer Still Preaching Debt Relief Scam</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another thing that remains consistent: <strong>Multiple times throughout his career, Popoff has been exposed as a fraud</strong>. The first big revelation happened on the Johnny Carson show in 1986, where the magician James Randi played secret audiotapes revealing Popoff's scam as a faith healer. Before every revival event Popoff led, Popoff's staff and his wife Elizabeth would interview audience members about their health problems., and they would collect prayer cards from the audience. As Peter worked the room, his wife would point out vulnerable people for him to approach, and tell him about their physical ailments, via a small radio receiver stuck in Popoff's ear.</p>
<p>Not long after that show aired, Popoff declared bankruptcy. <strong>But the setback proved temporary. Popoff started over, and by 2005 his &quot;ministry&quot; was earning more than $24 million a year</strong>.</p>
<p>These claims have been exposed as falsehoods many times. After the Johnny Carson debacle, Popoff has been tailed by everyone from Inside Edition to local TV news stations from Los Angeles to Atlanta . After each investigation, Popoff seems to bounce back, launching new crusades and finding new victims.</p>

<p>Not that the type of people to buy into his bullshit are the type to care, but you would think something like this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff#Investigation_by_James_Randi" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff#Investigation_by_James_Randi</a> would have ended his career of swindling. Apparently not.</p>
<p>And I mean, for fuck sake, &quot;miracle water?&quot; Even the most gullible Christians I know see right through that bullshit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Certainly, our mass spectrometer/gas chromatograph testing can detect any number of chemicals and pollutants. Is there anything in particular you're worried about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you tell me if it has any dreams or miracles in it?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
