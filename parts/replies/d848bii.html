			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good point. Until very recently, most low-end Windows laptops (and even so-called &quot;Ultrabooks&quot;) had 2.4-only wi-fi.  In that case, you'd need a giant external 5GHz wi-fi &quot;dongle&quot; (USB device).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still persistent with new computers and laptops. You have no idea how many people give me the &quot;this is a brand new laptop&quot; line when they can't see the 5ghz in the available connection list.  Just what the manufacturer decides to include.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most 5GHz routers do both.  In fact I don't know of any that don't also do the 2.4GHz...  So connect to whichever you can.  Newer devices 5GHz, older 2.4GHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While anywhere close to recent laptops, phones, and tablets should support 5ghz, there are a surprising number of devices from only a couple years ago that didn't. </p>
<p>This includes my chromecast, kindle fire stick, and nest (2nd gen).  I believe that the newer versions of these products support, but not when I bought these 2-3yeaes ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What to look for: if the device says it supports 802.11n or ac, it can use the 5GHz bands. If not (802.11b or g), it will be restricted to 2.4GHz. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11" target="_blank">802.11 is the official standard for Wi-Fi</a>)</p></div>		</li>
