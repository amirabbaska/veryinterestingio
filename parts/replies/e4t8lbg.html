			<div class="markdown"><p>not true in this case... Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be semiconducting or metallic depending on their diameter and how they are &quot;rolled-up&quot;. It is in-fact possible to make a solar cell from the semiconducting versions of CNTs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if we were to instead use it as a way to convert light to heat and boiled water with it? Based on the level of absorption i would assume a high level of efficiency, though the throughput due to thermal conductivity of carbon probably puts a kebash on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar technology is used in solar cells.  Moth-eye AR coatings are an active area of research, with the goal being a broadband anti-reflective coating with a large angle of acceptance.  Usually this is done by building a bunch of cones on the surface of the solar cell that have a scale that is below the diffraction limit of visible light (\~200nm).  The light doesn't 'see' the cones, so the layer of cones looks like a material with a graded index of refraction.  The tips of the cones look like a material with the index of air since in that slice, it's mostly air.  As you look further down the cones, the index is closer to the material of the cones and less like air.  In other words, the interface from air to your solar cell is smooth, so you get little reflection.</p>
<p>Look up black silicon too.  There are some good SEM images of what I'm describing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can. I do it everyday in my research. Nanomaterials can convert light into electricity with much higher efficiency than conventional materials, but there's a lot complications that currently prevent their use.</p>
<p>Their main pitfall is that their properties are highly sensitive to their environment. This is a property of any nanomaterial since all of their atoms are on their surface. If anything new (even a few molecules) comes in contact with their surface, their properties can change. This can make them very unstable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.</p>
<p>Ordinary black paint already absorbs a large fraction of the light. Gaining a couple percent efficiency isn't that important. Vanta black works well when you need to reduce that few percent reflected light by another order of magnitude or more. It's well suited to the insides of telescopes or other optical instruments, for example.</p>
<p>You'd pay for that couple percent efficiency increase with a more expensive, less durable paint. The low durability would mean it would need regular repair. Much cheaper to just increase your collector area a bit and use conventional paint or coatings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes in the same way that painting it black is a good idea and white is a bad idea. That being said, the larger surface area of the nanotube &quot;forest&quot; versus a flat surface may make vantablack work like the fins of a radiator, transmitting the heat gained to the surrounding air. You'd probably be better off having something a little less black but a lot flatter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd bet the nanotubes are packed tightly enough that convection is not an issue. It's not like heatsink fins in that case - it's more like insulating foam. The air is trapped in there, forming an extra layer of insulation. This also depends on the nanotubes being poor conductors of heat, but generally adding trapped air to any insulator always helps.</p></div>		</li>
