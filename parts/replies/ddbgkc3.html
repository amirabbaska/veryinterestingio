			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi,
I do have the gloves and the aprons, and the thyroid shields (don't have the glasses though). I also use the dosimeter (I do over 4000 x-rays per year), and have already gotten some values that were a little higher (when I started working I would hold most animals for example, nowadays 99.99% of the x-rays I avoid being near the animal).
I was just wondering if I could estimate the exposure for each x-ray. I usually tell owners that going on a long plane trip or sunbathing gets them more exposure than holding an animal, but I'd like to get more specific numbers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Read through this to help give your patients owners a better idea. It has specific numbers and will help you give an educated answer.</p>
<p>Your analogy to the NY to LA plane trip is a good one. Not too sure about the sunbathing one.</p>
<p>I giggled at the cell phone question :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incorrect.</p>
<p>The dosimeters we have at all the hospitals I've worked in are used in the x ray areas.</p>
<p>In fact, most non EM radiation in the hospital has very low penetration abilities and won't affect anything further than a meter away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They work with ionizing radiation, meaning both gamma and X-rays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All EMR is a spectrum from radio frequency, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma. After UV-C and into X-ray, at around 10 keV, it becomes ionizing. </p>
<p>Most real time or active dosimeters use a gas filled tube under a voltage potential to detect this radiation. Depending on the casing surrounding the detection medium and the type of gas used in the detector determine the type of radiation detected. A standard active dosimeter in a light metal case using a gas like argon would readily detect X-ray and gamma radiation.</p>
<p>A passive dosimeter like a film badge or thermal pen use a material that changes color under a radiation field and is sent to a lab to be analyzed. Many film badges have an open window to allow penetration by beta radiation. Thus you film badge accounts for beta, X-ray, gamma, and possibly neutron radiation </p></div>		</li>
