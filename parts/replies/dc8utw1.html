			<div class="markdown"><p>This is dead on. They aren't professional terms. They might have been once upon a time, but their meaning has been diluted. The words have been over-used so much in politics, business, media and film that they are little more than a derogatory catchphrase for &quot;crazy violent person&quot; (psychopath) or &quot;real intelligent evil person&quot; (sociopath). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still struggling to understand antisocial personality disorder, but this should be the top comment at the moment since it's the only one recognizing that they're not terms currently in any universal use. I can't stand when reddit calls anybody who does something bad a raging psychopath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of ASPD from this perspective: humans are naturally &quot;social&quot; creatures, meaning they generally require interactions with other humans as companions and allies to survive, and especially to reproduce. They need cooperation, directly and indirectly, to allow growth, and their brains are designed and conditioned for this. </p>
<p>People who are &quot;antisocial&quot; (lit. &quot;opposed to fellowship or fellow man&quot;) display behaviour that actively contradicts that social standard (which is generally assumed to be the &quot;natural&quot; state for humanity) by remorselessly disregarding the rights or state of other people. This can be through deception, violence, irresponsibility, etc. </p>
<p>Empathy is seen as a key function in the success of the co operative welfare of humanity (ex. I won't hurt others because I can understand how that would affect them and others close to them, I won't steal because I know how damaging it could be to others),   and people with ASPD almost universally lack empathy as well as a sincere value on their own well being, leading to what people would see as &quot;callousness&quot; or &quot;coldness&quot;, making it extremely difficult for them to relate to others, work closely with others, and see others as equal to themselves. This makes genuine interpersonal relationships extremely difficult, and impairs their ability to properly function in a society. </p>
<p>That's the backbone of the disorder and it's implications, I hope that wasn't too long or confusing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really wouldn't surprise me to see the DSM-VI rename ASPD. &quot;Antisocial&quot; carries far too many incorrect connotations in this direct clinical application. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a question then. </p>
<p>If that's true then how come so many mental health specialist use those terms quite separately when I'm reading papers or blogs? </p>
<p>I always read sociopaths lack empathy, sympathy, and other strong emotional feelings for others. (NPD?)</p>
<p>On the other hand psychopaths display well... Psychopathic tendencies with violence, power, and control. </p>
<p>All psychopaths are sociopaths, but not all sociopaths are psychopathic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help if you provided some example articles of people using these terms. Then you can get specific feedback on why someone used a given term. You will likely find that:</p>
<p>a) The article is based on outdated concepts or understandings. In medicine and psychology a lot of disorders start out with fairly generic classifications. As time goes on and we learn more, more specific classifications tend to replace the old ones. </p>
<p>b) Somewhere in the article the author explicitly details what they mean by the term, typically at the outset. Both words have such vague definitions that to an extent they can be used to mean whatever you want them to mean. Thus a definition often accompanies the usage.</p>
<p>c) The author is a &quot;specialist&quot; in name only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was definitely B and written by doctors within the last decade. </p>
<p>To be honest, in hindsight, they always did describe what they meant by those terms. I assumed they were just informing those who thought the word had purely negative connotations. </p>
<p>The reason why I wrote the previous post was simply because I never saw any disagreement on what sociopath actually describes. Any differences came from underneath to the underlying causes. (An example would be some say lack of a tight and inseparable bond from a parent figure as an infant. Others say abuse or betrayal throughout adolescence and physical or emotional abuse. Both create defensive mechanisms in the said individual.)  </p>
<p>So it never occurred to me that a sociopath wasn't a medically accepted word to define a certain characteristic someone has. I figured it was a trait for those who lack deep emotional connections or sympathy. </p>
<p>I wish I could list articles showing what I mean but I'm talking about things I've read here and there from the last eight years. None of the titles really stick out in my head and neither do the authors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might check the age of those papers.  Both terms were in 'official' use decades ago.  The terminology discipline between the various mental health sciences is horribly lax in comparison to physics or chemistry.</p>
<p>Are the writers trained and disciplined?  If they are using ancient words such as these while communicating mental health information, it is a very good sign that they are not. . .or have not kept up with modern research sufficiently.</p>
<p>There are lots of people with lots of theories and lots of agendas and mental health is an easy place to find ways to push them.</p></div>		</li>
