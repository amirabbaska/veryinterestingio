			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much the most accurate analogy I've ever read of the observation proposal review process. On top of that, I'd add some of the odd social dynamics, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bear in mind that a lot of the folks on the panel of friends are very likely your friends, too...but they're not allowed to tell you that they read your essay and judged it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are lucky enough to get use of the car, you're pretty much expected to serve on the panel of friends to judge next year's essays. That means you will very likely have to turn down essays from your own friends.</p>
</li>
<li>Ad hominem judgements are considered okay. For example, &quot;Well, this guy's essay wasn't quite top-notch, but he borrowed my car in the past and it worked out pretty well,&quot; is totally acceptable.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it’s the same for NASA, but at the NIH (main funder for biomedical research) things are absolutely not anonymous and favoritism is far and away the most powerful force for getting funded (thus why it’s even harder for new lab heads to get started). If you ask them they’ll insist that this favoritism is a good thing. Why risk funding some new applicant when your friend applied and you just <strong>know</strong> your friend is great and deserves it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if they are... the community of astronomers isn't astronomically large. So if the very specific proposals come in you probably can guess, at least in many cases, which teams might be behind in.</p>
<p>There probably are not that many renowed people looking into &quot;specific of X, in a very specific way Y building up from very, very specific Z&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The proposers can't be anonymous because, as /u/Memeophile points out, it's a small community and the proposals are too specific. </p>
<p>But also, one of the things NASA wants its expert panel to judge is, &quot;does the proposed scientific team have the expertise to actually complete the task?&quot;  That can't be done anonymously.  And yes, it opens the door to favoritism, but it makes colossal wastes of money less likely.</p></div>		</li>
