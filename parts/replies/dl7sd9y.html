			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting because I gained AFIB just from thinking I was having heart problems once before, which turned out to be a muscle spasm. I started to get anxiety, lost weight and checked my pulse 24/7 after this issue which turned out to be nothing. I don't get it as much as I used to, only when extremely stressed out or when I get sick. I've never had any real chest pains though. My brother has been pretty depressed in the last year and I think my mom was telling me that he says he gets chest pains like that.</p></div>		</li>
