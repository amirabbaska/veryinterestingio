			<div class="markdown"><p>God yes. I got one, refused to wear it because I didn't think it would work and my dentist was like, I can <em>tell</em> you're not wearing it because your teeth are literally being ground down to nothing.</p>
<p>tl;dr now I wear it and it's amazing how many jaw issues I was having before that are gone now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did it really help? I don't grind my teeth but I must be clenching or something because I feel like when I wake up my jaw is always sore and clicking. I've been wondering if it would be worth trying the mouthguard out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm autistic (aspergers) and I've ground my teeth while I sleep my whole life.  I wear a mouthguard now.  Lately I've wondered if perhaps my innate hypersensitivity and tendency to be anxious leads to the grinding, but I think I also have some PTSD caused by childhood trauma, which almost certainly causes most of my stress, and may be the real underlying cause of the grinding.  A few months back I took up daily mindfulness/meditation practice and it's helped relieve my anxiety more than literally anything I've ever tried, including meds, and lately I don't &quot;stim&quot;/fidget nearly as much.  IDK yet if it's done anything about the grinding, tho, since my only sleeping companion is my cat lol.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to me! I’m not autistic, but I do have some symptoms of PTSD from childhood trauma (nightmares etc), and my dentists are always worried about the state of my teeth. I also have general anxiety. I should really buy a mouth guard, do you have a favorite brand?</p></div>		</li>
