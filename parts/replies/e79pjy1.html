<p>It is not so much the needles but the toxin on them.  It is not well understood but appears to be heat-stable, does not break down in the environment, and insoluble in water.   Dried leaves from decades prior are still fully potent.</p></div>		</li>

&quot;Organic&quot; in chemistry means a compound contains carbon, except for some exceptions (carbonates, cyanides, carbon oxides, perhaps some others depending on who you're talking to)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moroidin, a bicyclic octapeptide containing an unusual C-N linkage between tryptophan and histidine, was first isolated from the leaves and stalks of Dendrocnide moroides, and subsequently shown to be the principal compound responsible for the long duration of the stings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it also states that there is likely other things involved as well because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moroidin also produces a similar pain response when injected subdermally, so it is thought to be partially responsible for the plant’s toxicity. However, moroidin injections are not as potent as injections of crude matter isolated from Dendrocnide moroides, suggesting that there are additional stinging toxins in the venom</p>
