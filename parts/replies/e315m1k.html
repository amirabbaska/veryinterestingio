			<div class="markdown"><p>For water generally, the Wikipedia link in the OP about the history of water on Mars is a good place to start. Remember that water can be liquid, solid (ice), or vapour. Most of the water Mars currently has is ice.</p>
<p>This discovery was made using radar. An instrument on the spacecraft shoots out radio waves, those waves bounce / reflect off of Mars, and the spacecraft records how long it takes for the radio waves to return and how strong the reflection is. Some fraction of the radio waves bounce off the surface, but some penetrate the surface and bounce off of some subsurface feature. Generally, radio waves will bounce back at a transition, like going from ice to rock. Exactly how much bounces back will depend on the material. So, from this data they can map out subsurface structure.</p>
<p>In the radar data in question here, we see evidence for a big transition at the bottom of the ice sheet. In the radargram (<a href="http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/mars/detecting-buried-water-with.html" target="_blank">here</a>), from top to bottom is the atmosphere (dark, no reflection) the layers in the ice cap (a series of horizontal lines), then a really bright line. The really bright line is the transition between the ice cap and the possible lake, below that is rock. They think the bright / strong signal is from liquid water based on how radar-bright it is. They think other things that could generate that much signal (like liquid CO2 for example) are unlikely for a variety of reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for explaining! you say it's unlikely that it may be something else, is that possibility completely ruled out? Or is this one of those cases where we are 99% sure of it, but can't state that until there is waterproof evidence?(pun not intended)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the confidence is as high as 99% right now. The authors of the study seem pretty confident that other explanations for the radar data don't work well, but it would be nice to see some corroborating evidence, some other data that points to the same conclusion.</p></div>		</li>
