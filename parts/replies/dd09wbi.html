			<div class="markdown"><p>For diffraction to have a significant effect, the slit the light is passing through has to be comparable the the wavelength of the light. And the wavelength in this case is much smaller than the distance between most of your eyelashes or the width of your eyelashes.
Even so if it were your eyelashes, the light would be spread out horizontally rather than vertically as observed. So in my opinion, I don't think it's caused by eyelashes diffracting light.</p></div>		</li>
