			<div class="markdown"><p>To help clarify just a little about &quot;staying up&quot;. Orbit has been explained to me as the object in orbit is falling to Earth constantly, but it is moving forward at a fast enough speed that it misses. </p>
<p>EDIT: For clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on.  For me, once I heard and saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball" target="_blank">Newton's Cannonball Thought Experiment</a>, it made way more sense.  The animated gifs in this article are also pretty good at illustrating what happens to the cannonball at different speeds.</p>
<p>The cannonball thought was something like this.  If I drop a cannonball, it will not travel anywhere and fall straight down.  However, if I shoot a cannonball from the top of a mountain in a straight line, it will go a certain amount of distance before gravity brings it to the surface.  The faster the shot the farther it would go.  Can I shoot a cannonball so fast that it fell at the same rate as the curvature of the earth dropped away?  What happens if I shot it &quot;too&quot; fast?  In the animated gifs, you can see the cannonball leave earth's orbit since its travelling faster than the rate at which it is falling back to the surface.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That knowledge of Orbit was explained to me in a much more casual setting. I was learning how to play Kerbal Space Program, and the streamer mentioned it to help viewers grasp how to remember the correct way to manipulate your velocity and burns in order to achieve, maintain, and exit your orbit effectively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more moving forward so fast that the Earth curves away at the same rate that gravity pulls it down.  Moving forwards at about 7.5Km/s achieves this, that is quite low down, in a higher orbit less speed is required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The exact opposite thing is happening. The air was compressed (a process which generated heat) and then it cools as it expands. That's pretty much how air conditioners work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air is heated when it is compressed. However, at that point the canister can cool down to ambient temperature. It doesn't stay permanently hot relative to its surroundings.</p>
<p>Once you use the canister, the gas comes out and rapidly decompresses, causing it to cool down further.</p></div>		</li>
