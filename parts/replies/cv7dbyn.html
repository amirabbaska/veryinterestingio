<p>Generally, whenever a government agency wins or settles a lawsuit, the money won will be deposited with the Treasury. Depending on which agency filed the lawsuit, a portion of the recovery may instead be transferred to a consumer protection fund to finance future consumer protection litigation.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Settlement amounts can also be broken down into different components, each of which can be treated differently.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Civil penalties are basically fines for breaking the law. These penalties are usually marked as non-deductible for tax purposes.  </li>
<li>Monetary payments are simply payments. The term is intentionally vague and usually used when a company does not admit liability. These can be deductible.  </li>
<li>Restitution payments go directly to aggrieved parties, not the government. Whether or not these are recovered depends on which government agency has found violations and which law is violated. Consumer protection laws usually have provisions for restitution damages. The EPA may have similar powers (given the consumer protection nature of this violation), but you would have to check the statute.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, that was a great breakdown, just a small follow up question. Under what ethically sound situation would a government agency request a tax-deductible monetary payment? It seems like a payment type to facilitate appearing to punish companies while not actually punishing them, but I may be misunderstanding their purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tax deductible, not a tax credit. So you get to subtract it from your profits at the end of the year meaning you pay less taxes because profits are lower, but you don't get credit for the whole amount you paid, meaning it's not break even. </p>
<p>Presumably this would be if the company offered a settlement to avoid a trial and conviction, so they can pay money and get out of trouble without admitting fault. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume out-of-court settlements would fit this category. If the EPA has been building a case that has a strong burden of proof against Acme Catalog Company, the EPA may offer a settlement as opposed to the chance of loosing the case. </p>
<p>ACC, on the other hand, knows what it has done. It may take a settlement and save face by not admitting guilt. </p>
<p>The cost to try a case impacts the government in two ways: 1) the agency alleging the charges may need to hire other specialized attorneys for the case as well as investigators and in extreme cases a special prosecutor. 2) the court in which the case is tried is also a government entity, therefore the venue has its own costs. </p>
<p>In situations like the one above, the EPA can let ACC know that they are watching ACC and want it to stop doing the thing. It saves the taxpayer money. Also, if ACC doesn't stop, the EPA can still prosecute as it hasn't triggered a double jeopardy scenario. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The one I used to program at used it to make radio dramas one year, &quot;corporate radio blood money&quot; we called it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you mean Americans (as the victim) by and large due to the deception, then they will be getting it, in the form of the government who, spends a lot of money on Americans.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are not &quot;victims&quot; in this case with regards to the violation of the EPA laws.  The funds just go to the government.  </p>
<p>There are people who bought the cars based on advertised specs and their status as &quot;clean diesel&quot; vehicles.  It is <strong>very likely</strong> that whatever fix that VW deploys for this condition will decrease performance and fuel economy of the vehicle.  It is <strong>possible</strong> that the fix will also cause significantly more wear the to emissions control system, resulting in higher repair costs to the vehicle.  Those two things will negatively impact owners of the affected vehicles, as they will become more expensive to operate and maintain.  Additionally, this will likely have a negative impact on the resale value of these vehicles.  Since the people who bought these cars (myself included) will likely suffer financial losses due to VW's actions here, then they (we) will likely have to file suit against VW for some sort of fraud and false advertising to reclaim damages.  To that end, a class action suit was filed on September 18th for that very purpose.</p>
<p>In summary, VW is most likely going to spend many millions of dollars on recalling these cars, then potentially be fined billions for deliberately circumventing EPA regulations, and then potentially pay out a billion or more in a class action case.  It's going to be a bad year for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case the victim is me, a VW customer. The TDI sportwagen was appealing because it had high gas mileage, high torque, lots of space, and low emissions.</p>
<p>Now the car I paid 28k for will be fixed to reduce one or more of those factors that motivated me to buy a new car for the first time ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you could join a class action lawsuit, since there was deception on the product and you were not the only victim. Your vehicle has less power and torque than advertised under the marketed configuration. IANAL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to show that the emissions are harming you.</p>
<p>If the fuel efficiency is worse, you'd have a case for harm, but I think it's actually better (at the expense of emissions).</p>
<p>In the case of emissions, the &quot;victim&quot; is the public itself, but will probably be simplified as the EPA.  States that have their own regulations that aren't being met (e.g. California) will probably go after their own cut of any settlement reached or pursue their own lawsuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The government is taking legal action on behalf of the nation as a whole, not for you as an individual. You can also sue VW - maybe as part of a class action case, but also individually - for what is essentially consumer fraud.</p></div>		</li>
