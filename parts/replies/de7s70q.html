<p>In reality same day and next day prediction is accurate to about 1 degree</p>

<p>I'd definitely contest this. It's greater than 1 degree, by quite a bit. The chaotic nature of weather will always leave a fairly significant disparity between forecast and actual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I based that claim on this graph: <a href="http://www.forecastadvisor.com/images/blog/forecast_change_analysis.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.forecastadvisor.com/images/blog/forecast_change_analysis.jpg</a></p>
<p>(which has units of fahrenheit). The number appears to be about 2.7F off, which is about 1.5C.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert, so I really don't know. But that's my source if you're curious. Of course you're welcome to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out i was probably wrong in my original comment so ive edited it to correct that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fallacious to assume that all weather forecasts are the same because everything uses the same source, but hasn't updated yet. That's just silly, watch two news forecasts at the same time, the forecasts will be different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not fallacious at all. Clearly if two people are relaying the same information from the same source, the information will be identical.</p>
<p>While it's possible that my justification is wrong, your second sentence provides no new information either way. It's just another example of the phenomenon described by op (that is, contradictory information).</p></div>		</li>
