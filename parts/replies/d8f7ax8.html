			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the original Universe Sandbox which launched on Steam in 2011.</p>
<p>The sequel, <a href="http://universesandbox.com/" target="_blank">Universe Sandbox ²</a>, is still in active development (although it's handling of the collisions of human scale objects (like dice, marbles, and bowling balls) isn't as good as the original even though everything else is far improved). We just brought on a new developer last month to work on solving this exact problem.</p>
<p>If you buy the sequel and want the original too, email us your email receipt and mention this post and we'll send you a Steam code for the original...</p>
<p>I am the creator &amp; director of <a href="http://universesandbox.com/" target="_blank">Universe Sandbox ²</a>.</p></div>		</li>
