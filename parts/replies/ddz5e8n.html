			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate hearing from someone with a local perspective on the coal mining industry. It sounds like you have seen the hardships and financial burden that families are left with when mines close- and I absolutely agree that is a huge problem that needs to be addressed. I guess what I am trying to better understand is how can more jobs be made available by such a policy, and what are the tradeoffs? I guess I don't understand how this policy is a solution - I wouldn't anticipate everyone who lost their job to find new placement as a result of this deregulation. It would be interesting to measure this over the coming months. From my perspective, there must be more sensible way though to create more jobs - and possibly ones not in the coal industry. In any case, thank you again for your perspective on this, I really do appreciate it. </p></div>		</li>
