<p>Just to be clear, we're talking about the propagation of mechanical disturbances here.  Matter wave is sometimes used in the context of quantum physics (de Broglie waves) to mean something entirely different.</p>

<p>released heat</p>

<p>What would releasing heat in a crystal lattice look like?  The nuclei in a lattice don't have the same translational degrees of freedom of a gas - you can't look at their average speeds to get the temperature.  Most of the thermal energy in a crystal is held in vibrational degrees of freedom.  So the shaking/waving back and forth of atoms in a lattice and the various modes of such vibration <em>is</em> the thermal energy in the lattice.  Orderly, directional vibrations and wave packets will eventually scatter and devolve into random vibrations.  The analogy in air is that a loud sound traveling through air will eventually dissipate and simply contribute to the thermal energy of air.</p>

<p>You can't usually add some energy into a system and expect that to not eventually propagate everywhere (unless you're doing some really funny business).  The pole will eventually need to heat up or dump that energy somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible.  Energy is dissipated differently in all materials.  Much of that internal energy is dissipated by friction of molecules in the material, converted to heat.  The density and compression of the material would  be subject to a shock wave propagation, which is different than a sound wave.  A shock wave is a wave that travels faster than the speed of sound in a material.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just my thoughts, but I think the rigidity of the pole might influence if the other end moves? Like, I imagine the pole would bend about some radius, and so there is some length of pole that would bend at a perfect arc as not to move the other end, but that would be a function of the pole's rigidity as well as the applied force.</p>
