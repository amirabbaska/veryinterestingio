			<div class="markdown"><p>You build up a graph of what sorts of events you are seeing in your detectors.  You know what the graph should look like if the Higgs boson is not there (i.e. if it's just statistical background).  If you see a rogue peak in your data, you know something is up.  You analyse the peak to see what it's statistical significance is (a measure of whether or not it could have appeared by chance).  The acceptable standard for particle physics is 5 sigma, or about 1 in 3.5 million chance of being a fluke.  If it meets your criteria, you can confidently say you have a real event.  </p>
<p>Then you can check to see whether the data matches the model if the Higgs exists, analyse the peak to see what the centre is (the energy/mass) and do some fancy other stuff which I don't really understand.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>You can imagine the Higgs field being like treacle.  Particles which couple to the Higgs field will slow down from the speed of light in the field.</p>

<p>I don't like the analogy that they're moving through some viscous field. Naturally we imagine drag, which gives continuous deceleration, but the mechanism is nothing like that (or even Newtonian physics wouldn't work).</p>
<p>I personally still don't understand the mechanism, but I know this analogy is terrible because it makes me imagine something utterly unlike how the actual thing works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well unfortunately there are rarely any good classical analogies for things in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, because it is so unlike anything we experience in our everyday lives.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's definitely true...hopefully someone can find a nice middle of the road explanation that isn't too technical but still explains a bit how massive particles can travel at any non-c speed because of that interaction, and massless particles must always be at c because of the lack of that interaction.</p></div>		</li>
