			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! I always wondered why some prescription heartburn/GERD pills were so-called &quot;proton pump inhibiters.&quot; Sounds like they reduce acid production by inhibiting one of the ingredients that makes the acid. Neat! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are technically correct (the best kind of correct). PPI's work on H+/K+ ATPase in the gastric parietal cells, so while they do stop acid secretion from all three pathways, it would be more accurate to say they disable ALL acid secretion at the affected acid pumps. The inhibition is irreversible anyway. The three pathways are just three different ways of activating the ATPase pump, so by working downstream, the &quot;pathway&quot; is irrelevant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The proton pump inhibitors bind to an enzyme that facilitates pumping in protons (H+ ions). The decreased concentration of protons make the stomach less acidic</p>
<p>EDIT: sorry to repeat those that have already said this! First time posting and still getting familiar with how Reddit and the app works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Acidity is all about H+: pH is the measure of concentration of H+ ions.  The more H+ concentration, the lower the pH and the stronger the acid.<br />
The Cl- has relatively little to do with acidity.  It's like all the H+ ions are the football team and Cl- ions are the mascot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the Cl makes it more acidic because H does not want to bond with Cl. If it was Flourine instead, for example, H will bond with F slightly, and make it less acidic because there are less unpaired hydrogen atoms.</p></div>		</li>
