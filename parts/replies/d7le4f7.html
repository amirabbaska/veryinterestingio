<p>This is even a problem in the studio, because when you turn on the lights in a movie studio, they change color as they warm up.</p>

<p>Is this still a problem with modern LED lights? Your whole post was fascinating, btw, thank you for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this includes LEDs.  LEDs also have a natural variation, so each LED in a batch might be a slightly different color.  LEDs change color over time, they change color at different temperatures, and they change color depending on how much electricity goes through them.  The new bright blue and green LEDs (&quot;Gallium Nitride&quot; LEDs) are especially problematic, and &quot;white&quot; LEDs are really just blue LEDs with a special coating, and that coating also has variations.</p>
<p>Some of the best LED lights use a mixture of different colors of LEDs, so you can adjust the color by changing how bright each color is.  You've probably seen RGB LEDs used at music concerts, on buildings, or on nearly everything at music festivals.  The lights used for film (or normal indoor lighting) are a little different.  Instead of Red, Green, and Blue, they use a mix of different shades of white.</p>
<p>I know that you could attach a color sensor to the light, and put a computer in the light, and have the computer measure the color and adjust the LEDs until the color is exactly correct.  I'm not sure how common this is.  I know that it's common to have a computer in the kind of lights you use for film.</p>
<p>Fluorescent lights are still fairly common, since they're very efficient (like LEDs) and we've already figured out how to make fluorescent lights with a very pure, consistent white color.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey so it sounds like you know a lot about this and if you haven't seen this video on Tested, Adam from Mythbusters' YouTube channel, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6QJT5CXl3o" target="_blank">Digitizing Photorealistic Humans Inside USC's Light Stage</a>. They use several custom made various sized spheres filled with different lights including different colored LED lights and different high speed cameras so that they can run through a cycle of various lighting conditions and record all of that from all different sides you can stitched together and rendered a 3D model of the person and drop them into photos or videos and light the person however they want to make the digitized person look realistic for whatever the situation. It is well worth the 18 minutes to watch if you have any interest in the complications that come with accurately lighting a person or object that isn't physically in the exact lighting needed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learning process for color is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actually get your image in a proper viewing environment.  Print it, project it, put it on the computer screen, whatever.  Use good lighting and good monitors.  Don't use a digital projector, you can't afford one with good color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the colors right?  Is there something wrong with your viewing enviroment?  Compare your photo to other photos.  Does something seem &quot;off&quot; about your photo?</p>
</li>
<li>Figure out what went wrong and try to fix it.  Don't be a monkey just fiddling knobs until it looks right, read some books.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of workflow should be covered in most college-level photography, design, or other art courses once you get past the intro-level courses which everyone takes.  For photography, diving a little bit further into sensitometry and color perception really demystifies what makes your colors &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; in an image.</p>
<p>I have a darkroom at home, and I did spend a few years mixing my own developers from raw reagents instead of buying D-76 like sane people, but other than that I'm entirely amateur.  Spent a lot of time hanging out with other geeks in both wet and digital photo labs.  Took classes in college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer, very detailed and thorough. One minor correction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B&amp;W is easier and cheaper than color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>B&amp;W <em>was</em> easier and cheaper than color. Now, if you want to film (with professional quality) in B&amp;W it is much easier and cheaper to film in digital color and change in post-production. Just like your instagram sepia filter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing that makes color easier than B&amp;W these days is the fact that B&amp;W digital cameras are hard to find.  If, however, you were in the habit of buying high-end digital cameras from the source, you would find that the B&amp;W ones are easier to work with.</p>
<p>When shooting color digital film, you have to be careful about clipping in each of the color channels.  If you are shooting at night, it's easy to clip the blue channel.  Indoors, it's easy to clip the red channel.  Once a channel has clipping, part of the image data is lost, and you can't recover it.  This is the major skill that filmmakers needed to learn when they switched to digital.  Newer cameras have better tonal range and are resistant to clipping, but it can still be a problem you have to watch out for.  Color film is extremely resistant to clipping.</p>
<p>If you shoot with an actual B&amp;W digital camera, the clipping issue is simpler, because you only have to worry about one channel instead of three.  You can carry around ND filters instead of a color filters, and you only have to look at one histogram.  So yes, B&amp;W is easier in digital, if you actually have a B&amp;W camera.</p>
<p>If you have already mastered filming in color, you could record in color and do the B&amp;W conversion in post, as you mentioned.  This has the advantage of letting you do channel mixing how you want, instead of having to pick and choose color filters on set.</p>
<p>If we're talking about film, B&amp;W film is still less expensive.  Color film is $320 per (400' x 35mm) roll and B&amp;W is about $260, according to Kodak's price list.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has little to no connection to your original comment, but I want to ask you a question I always had.</p>
<p>How do they edit the '35mm film' nowadays? They transfer it to a computer, right? But how do they do that? And is it easier to shoot or does it have a better quality? Because from my (outsider) point of view it seems like shooting on film is much more complicated and expensive than just using digital. I mean, do Spielberg, Tarantino, Nolan, Coen Brothers, etc only shoot in 35mm for the sake of shooting in old 35mm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, if my calculations are correct, that's basically $110 per minute of B&amp;W film or $130 per minute of color. I had no idea the stuff was so expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is easier to film in digital colour though. And if you want, there are dedicated black and white digital sensors that are more sensitive to light and deliver higher quality results because they aren't splitting the light across a Bayer array.</p>
