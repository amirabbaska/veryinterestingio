			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this post a bit, usually you're not increasing your VO2 max (which represents the maximal amount of oxygen your cardiovascular system can supply your muscles with). VO2 max is usually measured in units of ml of oxygen per kg of body mass per second. I think it's silly to measure it this way because you can technically improve your VO2 max simply by losing weight, which is not a representation of increasing your total capacity to metabolize oxygen. </p>
<p>What most people increase isn't VO2 max it's their aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. The aerobic threshold is basically the maximal energy load that an individual can maintain virtually indefinitely. This means that there is no anaerobic energy production happening. It's all aerobic and therefore there is no pyruvate, hydrogen+ ions, or lactic acid being produced. A build up of these things is associated with muscle fatigue (&quot;that burning feeling&quot;) As the by products of anaerobic glycolysis build up in the muscle, the electrical signals telling the muscles to contract get weaker and weaker. At maximal saturation, they won't contract at all.</p>
<p>The anaerobic threshold is the energy load at which anaerobic glycolysis accounts for enough of a percentage of total energy generation that the nasty by products begin to accumulate exponentially in the muscles being stressed. Sprinters function far above the aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. In fact, there is another energy supply our muscles use called the creatine triphosphate system. It basically uses the energy stored in our muscles during rest for very short periods of high intensity exercise. This is the energy system that sprinters rely on most. If a sprinter tried sprinting at their normal speed over, say, two hundred meters, they'd probably find that they pull ahead in the first 60% of the race. After that, they'd begin to succumb to fatigue from the by products of anaerobic glycolysis in their muscles and be forced to slow down. </p>
<p>It is possible to put an energy load on your body above even your VO2 max. Most 1 mile races are run at about 110%-120%  of the individuals VO2 max. It is not really practical to determine energy in oxygen for bursts shorter than that because most of the energy isn't produced through oxidative phosphorylation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're misinformed on quite a few things and spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>1) People do in fact increase their VO2 max through training while also improving lactate threshold. Your claim of most people not improving their VO2 max through training is false.</p>
<p>2) The standard measurement of VO2 isn't ml/kg/s; It's often measured as <em>ml/kg/minute</em> as the relative form, or Liters/min in it's absolute form. Losing weight will not artificially increase your relative VO2 as you claim, since the value is RELATIVE to your body weight in kilograms. The opposite of your claim would actually be true when comparing treadmill test results from a skinny person and a heavier person and viewing only the absolute value for VO2. The heavy individual would typically have a higher absolute VO2, but not necessarily having a higher relative VO2.</p>
<p>3) Our muscles don't use creatine triphosphate. You're confusing it for adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which turns into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by the enzyme creatine kinase, but we then add a phosphate back to ADP from circulating creatine phosphates and this creates a rapid form of energy supply. This is why taking creatine is useful for sprinters or any other short duration event athletes. </p>
<p>I hope this helps clear up some confusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the corrections. It's been awhile since I looked into these things. One thing though is when I mentioned creatine triphosphate what I actually meant was phosphocreatine. </p>
<p>Hah, yeah. Now that I read through my post again it does look pretty bad. Sorry, I wrote it when I was really tired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate on what you mean?
Muscles aren't really categorically broken down like that. You can be swole without being super tight and you can have relatively little muscle mass and still be be super tight.
As well, muscles that don't require repair would either be super-human or entirely worthless. </p></div>		</li>
