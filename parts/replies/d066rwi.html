			<div class="markdown"><p>Former firefighter here. We do many drills to practice for different events that can occur on a fire scene. One such event is called the Denver Drill, where an unconscious victim is wedged in a narrow space and needs to be extracted as quickly as possible (named after a Denver firefighter who was killed in a similar situation and his extraction team couldn't pull him out). We ran it in many different situations, the biggest varying factor being the amount of people available to help and the equipment available. </p>
<p>Ideally, we would time our guys to be able to extract a downed firefighter weighing 180 pounds with 60 pounds of gear on out of a second story window in under a minute, alone. Until they learn to manipulate the weigh of a limp body, I've seen new guys struggle with this for 15 minutes before giving up (guilty!), and their jaw dropping in disbelief when a veteran did it in 24 seconds.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm on mobile, when I get home to my PC I'll put up a link to a video of the drill being done.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-_cnnD5H_Y" target="_blank">Delivrar</a>. This was not my department, this is Canton Township Fire Department in Canton Township, Ohio. This is an excellent walk through of how a Denver Drill is performed with a 3-man team. However, sometimes you and your partner don't have time to wait for backup, in which case, one guy stands on the ladder to receive the victim and the other goes in for the rescue. This is where learning the single man techniques came in. There were a few variations of it but this is basically the gist of a Denver Drill.</p>
<p>For other cool firefighter drills, might I suggest the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sZ4mxoouTE" target="_blank">Nance Drill</a>, which we learn to do with rope AND fire hose in case rope is unavailable (which it never should be), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBZyd2kEl1s" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Drill</a>, wherein a victim is at the end of a confined tunnel space and needs to be extracted, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGcjAdwRkZg" target="_blank">Head First Ladder Bails</a>, for when shit really hits the fan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that moving a body alone is pretty much impossible. I came home once and my dumbass roommate's dumbass boyfriend had overdosed on heroin. He wasn't dead but he was close and 100% unconscious. He was laying in the hallway and I desperately tried to move him to the living room and it wasnt happening. </p>
<p>Granted I'm a woman and he was a man making the situation worse, but I swear I couldn't even budge him and he was on tile. I thought for sure I could drag him but it was like he was glued to the floor. I was surprised how hard it was. He wasn't even that big of a guy either. </p>
<p>The dumbass lived so it ended up ok. </p></div>		</li>
