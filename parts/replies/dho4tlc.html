<p>Under the right circumstances it is possible to consciously notice single photons.</p>

<p>You certainly couldn't spot the black dot among all the other photons if you were trying to cast a visible shadow, though, as you say.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Vaziri plans to test how the visual system responds to photons in various quantum states — in particular those that are in a ‘superposition’ of two simultaneous states. Some physicists have suggested that such experiments could test whether a superposition of two states could survive in a person's sensory system, and perhaps be perceived in the brain.</p>

<p>What? Doesn't a superposition collapse as soon as the particle interacts with something else?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As long as the study was conducted properly and the maths checks out, the number of participants doesn't matter. The number of trials each participant undertook is more important than the number of participants.</p>
<p>And I have <em>no</em> idea what the fact that they were all men has to do with anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem with that term is that is supposes a particle is in superposition, when it's a system that's in superposition. This small but significant difference is probably responsible for 90% of the gobbledygook about quantum physics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>About how long do you think it would take an atom to absorb/deflect 20 photons?  The eye isn't all that fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you need to fire a photon that you know it's going to be absorbed. So, yes, in that sense it is dependent on the wavelength. </p>
<p>However if you only need the photon to be deflected, I don't thing the atom-photon cross section is wavelength dependent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this the wrong way to think about it? Instead of one atom absorbing a single photon what if we shined a laser at an atom so there's a huge number of photons all around it. Could the atom absorb enough photons to cause a detectable change in light intensity? If the answer is yes then it seems you could say it cast a shadow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you wanna create a model of what is happening when that atom effects light density (which it really wouldn't since it can't absorb multiple photons from a stream like that) talking about the single photon hitting the atom is what is interesting no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well what happens when multiple photons hit an atom over time? I think the effect can vary depending on the type of atom and photon. Could produce x-rays, could scatter, could be photoelectric effect. But if it's something that decreases intensity of light then can't you say a shadow was cast? </p></div>		</li>
