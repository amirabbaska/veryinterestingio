			<div class="markdown"><p>While it may in part be physics calculations, although in terms of physics it's really just about object/mesh placement. My experiences tell me it's mostly about light and how light interacts and bounces between materials in the scene. And how complex you'd like the light to be.</p>
<p>Going off zootopias hair, yes there are a lot of mesh details that would take time to calculate their positions. The real trouble starts though when you consider how the light should interact between all the strands, which direction it should bounce, how much gets through, and on and on for however many bounces it does. Conflated be the number of times the light bounces interact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less of the strands of hair and more of the ray tracing that made shit take incredibly long to render. Ray tracing makes the lighting very realistic, practically removing the need for shadow hacks like the usual AO and soft shadows in games, but it's really painful to calculate, so much so in games usually there's only a single ray tracing enabled light source, if at all</p></div>		</li>
