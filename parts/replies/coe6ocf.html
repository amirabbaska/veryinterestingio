			<div class="markdown"><p>Can a person suffering from delusions be rational in other areas but irrational in their delusion? E.g., if a rational person felt that they had a videotape of an alien, and they watched it with placebo recordings in a blind test and couldn't determine which video had the alien, they would immediately cast doubt onto the entire phenomena they felt they were perceiving. Do people suffering from delusions lack the ability to say &quot;wait a minute, I have evidence this is wrong and therefore will dismiss my feelings about it?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
