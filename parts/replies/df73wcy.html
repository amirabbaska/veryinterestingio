			<div class="markdown"><p>So I understand that the first objects to have emitted light did so after the BB, about 13.7 billion years ago. Throughout this 13.7 billion years, the Universe has been expanding, so now, as of the year 2017, those objects ARE actually about 46 billion light years away from Earth, which is the edge of the Observable Universe. I get that part. What we see NOW in the year 2017 from those objects' light are what the objects WERE 13 billion years ago, not as they ARE now. I also get this part. The thing I'm still having trouble with is this-- so is the limit of how far we can see 13.7 billion light years out, since that's how long it took the furthest/first lights to reach Earth? There hasn't been enough time to see anything past 13.7 ly away right? I keep getting confused at this point.</p>
<p>Like, the furthest known Galaxy is 13.3 bly away. What we see from telescopes when we look at them RIGHT NOW is what they looked like 13.3 billion years ago, not as they are right NOW in the year 2017. When can it be possible to see this Galaxy as it was/is in 2017, if it's possible at all? My thinking is that it won't be possible to see it as it was in 2017 because the actual Galaxy is moving away from Earth. We &quot;can't catch up&quot; with the Galaxy because it's moving away constantly, right? That in turn means that its light is so moving away from Earth as well. We just can't catch up with it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The limit of what we can see <em>now</em> is stuff that was 13.7 billion light years away at the big bang. The problem is that the space between us and those things has grown so if we were somehow able to teleport there, we'd have travelled 46 bly (and this distance is continuing to grow).</p>
<p>In 46 billion years, we'll be able to see what those objects looked like in 2017 (<strong>assuming the universe neither expands nor contracts</strong>), but the limit of what we can see will remain the same. Anything that was further than 13.7 bly away from us at the big bang is now further than 46 bly away, and moving away so fast that the light they're emitting will never reach us, so we still won't be able to see anything further away than we can currently see.</p>
<p>Edit: I corrected myself because I was wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Others have said that this is not true because space is expanding at a faster and faster rate. This means that light will have to travel a longer and longer distance every passing moment, so eventually the rate will be so fast and the distance will be so far that it will just disappear from the observable universe. So it's impossible to see something that far away.</p>
<p>But idk, this is what others have said and I'm still confused as to what is The reel answer to this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will be possible to see these galaxies as they are today after the number of lightyears away they are pass. Since it takes the light that long to reach us, and our eyes need that light to see them, we have to wait for the light to travel that many years before we can see it. For example, a galaxy 3 BLY away from us would be seen how it was 3 billion years ago. For far off galaxies, many years ago they either did not exist or had not expanded to that point.</p></div>		</li>
