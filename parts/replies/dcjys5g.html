			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother took a shorthand class in high school (in the 1940s), and I think she said she and her friends got extra credit for going to a courtroom and acting as amateur stenographers or something. I'd always assumed that, electric typewriters (which she said didn't have to have its keys pressed nearly as hard) and computers got more common/were invented, shorthand kind of became of a thing of the past as people just typed it up, since that's much faster than writing.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see that shorthand is still used, it's just that, much like quite a few other things, it has become computerized. But if 225-300 WPM is required to keep up with speech, I can see why they'd just combine the two methods instead of replacing them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because this isnt a typical situation at all. most of the time the bottleneck in a situation is coming up with what needs to be written down and once thats done how fast it is actually typed barely matters. i saw a talk recently by a programmer who was developing something like this for python but nobody really cared because the hard part of programming isnt how fast you can type. does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>
