<p>He wants to store light energy as light energy, which...is perfectly feasible once you understand what light energy is.</p>
<p>Light energy is photon energy moving as a wave.  In order to store it, you would effectively have to keep it in motion until you use it to transfer it into useable energy.  The issue with transfer is that for every transfer, you lose energy.  Storing it as light, indefinitely, means it's always at full potential.</p>
<p>To store it, you would need an internally mirrored vessel that would effectively allow the light to continue moving without warming or absorbing into the mirrored vessel.  In other words, it would need to be a near perfect mirror to ensure the loss over time is very, very small.</p>
<p>If you opened this device and looked inside, I would think it would be instant blindness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok... But in the very first sentence of my reply I acknowledged that what he was asking for is not possible with existing technology. I was not attempting to respond to what &quot;he wants&quot; but instead to show what is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it is possible with current technology, that is part of the point.  It's just really, really inefficient at this point.</p>
<p>Essentially, in order to keep the light energy, you have to keep it in motion.  To do this, you need to bounce the light between mirrors.  Those who have done this experiment had found that the energy losses due to the mirrors means you quickly lose your light energy.</p>
<p>Ideally, you'd need a circular mirrored vessel that keeps bouncing the light along in one direction instead of stopping it or deflecting it into other light waves.  The end result is a hypothetical electromagnetic field about the axis to the rotation, which would be very interesting to study in and of itself.</p></div>		</li>
