			<div class="markdown"><p>Arrows denote the direction the person in /u/MonaWasTheBoss' explanation is running in.  By pressing rewind you're reversing the direction of the arrows.  So an arrow, or person running backwards, would now be going forwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top post didn't even give an answer, it's a total non-answer. He has you change your definition of multiplication to be a direction of an arrow, then uses this new definition as the explanation. It's the same as defining a negative number times a negative number to be a positive number, and then saying the reason it is a positive number is because we defined it that way (which isn't even true).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what the top answer used to be but right now it is much better. There is no reason to assume the videos represent multiplication here. The other one is something applied multiple times. Which is easy to see multiplication in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, this is good for visualizing HOW this works but does it explain WHY this works in math? Just because it works with filming a person who is running doesn't mean it works with multiplication, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't an analogy, it was an application of the principle, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line" target="_blank">Number line</a>. The Number line is a bidirectional representation of all real numbers. If you're standing on a negative number, say -1, your forward momentum is to the left. There is an infinite amount of negative numbers, so it will keep increasing no matter how much forward (+) momentum you apply. However, with enough backwards momentum (-), you'll end up on a positive number (+1) and your forwards direction will change. </p>
<p>The Number line only includes real numbers, so Imaginary Numbers do not follow these principles. Two negative imaginary numbers multiplied by each other will be negative (such as &quot;-2i x -2i= -4i). </p></div>		</li>
