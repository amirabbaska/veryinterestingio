			<div class="markdown"><p>Roll three die.  Subtract 1 from each of these. Multiply the first by 36, the second by 6 and add the third. The sum will be between 1 and 216.  If this number is beyween 1 and 200, divide by 2 and round up to get an evenly distributed number between 1 and 100. </p></div>		</li>
