			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation :-)</p>
<p>This is only a reasonable guess, but I suspect it has to do with the skin being thicker due to pressure - a bit like the bottom of your feet get thicker harder skin, but obviously something else is at play there if my guess is right :-p</p>
<p>Feet tend not to get as much <em>friction</em> as elbows / knees, so that might be another factor.</p>
<p>I guess the real answer is to ask a dermatologist, but I happen not to be one :-D</p></div>		</li>
