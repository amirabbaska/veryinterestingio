Now that gay marriage is legal, how would that affect succession? Would they allow in vitro fertilization from whoever inherited the title, or would they have to renounce their right of succession?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crown passes to &quot;legitimate heirs of the body&quot;, which means only children of two married people. Whether or not a gay marriage would be recognised, a child through any kind of surrogacy or adoption could not currently inherit. Even if the monarch is the biological parent of the child, they'd also have to be married to the other biological parent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gay marriage isn't legal for members of the Royal Family. </p>
<p>The 'Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013' only makes civil weddings between same sex couples legal, Church of England weddings are still only between members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>The 'Marriage Act 1836' is what makes civil weddings legal but it &quot;shall not extend to the marriage of any of the Royal Family&quot;.</p>
<p>So members of the Royal Family can only be married by the Church of England, and the CoE don't recognise same sex marriages.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good question. I think they aren't ready for anything that modern yet*, and that what would actually happen, is what has probably already happened in past cases of gayness. They would pretend to be straight and have a show marriage (and have sex purely for the sake of children) while having secret sexual partners behind the scenes.</p>
<p>*It's not currently legal for the royals, as others have pointed out, but things can change, like male primogeniture. Homosexuality is much easier to hide than the gender of the child though.</p></div>		</li>
