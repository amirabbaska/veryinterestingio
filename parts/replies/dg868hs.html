			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a good technique for &quot;_____ and I/me&quot;</p>
<p>Take out the other person and see if the sentence still makes sense. &quot;David and me went to the store.&quot; &quot;Me went to the store.&quot; Doesn't make sense, so use &quot;I&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;He gave it to David and I&quot;. &quot;He gave it to I&quot;. Doesn't make sense, so use &quot;He gave it to David and me&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I feel like in school they pushed it upon us so many times that &quot;-and me&quot; is unacceptable that it seems like a lot of people grew up thinking that you should never say &quot;and me&quot;. I get people trying to correct me all the time and telling me, &quot;you mean, 'and I'&quot;. This is the same example I give those people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about indicating possessions?
Like for example, would you say, &quot;Would you like to join Peter's and my team?&quot; Or would you say, &quot;Would you like to join me and Peter's team?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peter's and my. You wouldn't say &quot;Mine team&quot;. It sounds really awkward because we usually use &quot;our&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should phrase the answers to those first two sentences </p>
<p>&quot;She would like some ice cream&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;The letter is addressed to her&quot; </p>
<p>Just to hammer in the right technique for people to use when checking themselves.  Without retaining that it is easier to make mistakes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who/whom ate my sandwich?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was her.&quot;</p>
<p>breaks the device</p>
<p>&quot;She ate the sandwich&quot;</p>
<p>works because it retains most of the original sentence</p>
<p>Your explanation is really good, but it is so familiar to you that you might not realize how explicit you have to be to get people to follow the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be pedantic for OP's benefit, 'it was her' is used, but isn't actually grammatically correct. The response <em>should</em> be 'it was she (who ate the sandwich)'. </p>
<p>Also, the response to 'who is it?' is... 'it is I', and on the phone, 'this is he/she'. </p>
<p>The general reason we say the pronouns after a verb with the object case instead of subject is because we hear that pattern more frequently. English has grown to accept the exception. The correct version sounds stuffy and old.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love accuracy too, so that is well received.  </p>
<p>I'm less concerned with strict adherence than I am with effective transmission of ideas.  The most effective way for op's technique to work is my concern.  I only write with impeccable grammar with great difficulty.</p></div>		</li>
