			<div class="markdown"><p>There nerves of the bladder combine a very delicate Balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. </p>
<p>If you hold in your urine, what happens is your bladder muscles stretch, and when they stretch to a point where they cannot contract anymore, they just continue to stretch and you actually weaken the bladder muscle. </p>
<p>If somebody goes into urinary retention, this means that they have stretched their bladder because they are not fully emptying it. Sometimes these people have to be catheterized for 1 to 2 weeks in order to retrain the bladder to actually urinate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First, habitually holding in urine can result in urinary tract and bladder infections as you are exposing those systems to potentially harmful bacteria.</p>
<p>It can cause you to incompletely empty your bladder which is a pain.</p>
<p>If you want to strengthen muscles that help you hold urine do kegal excercises. Men can do them too.  If you need to pee. Pee! Don't hold it if you don't have to.</p>
<p>I have hypercalciemia due to hyperparathyrodism. At worst I go pee every 15 or so minutes, though typically once an hour at least.  I have gotten to the point where I have to force my pee out because I have tried so desperately to not have to go as much.  I am in trouble... Sometimes I can't pee even though I need to.</p>
<p>As soon as I have the funds I will get surgery to cure the hyperparathyrodism after that I have to address the pee issue.</p>
<p>Do not hold your pee. It doesn't strengthen your bladder.</p></div>		</li>
