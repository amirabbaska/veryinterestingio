			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats another &quot;we dont really know&quot; question. However, we do know that no surface light reaches past 200m, and anything from 100-200m will only receive blue light.</p>
<p>Our current understanding is that fish would be seeking out that far reaching blue light, especially if the species is vertically transient. We also know that things bioluminesce at depth, which is most commonly blue or green as these wavelengths travel best in water as we just described. Unless you're a malacasteid, which is an exception and can see and emits red light.</p>
<p>So most likely a red light would be least intrusive but also crap for photos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Submarines usually use red light on the interior because it's easier on the eyes. You're right though you wouldn't be able to get a decent photograph deep sea with a red light. Pretty much any modern submarine uses LED light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, regular incandescent headlamp halogen was the first thing I thought of. Don't know something about them not registering LED light </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Submarines have typically avoided halogen typically because with military submarines it produces a hum that is detectible so that's one of the reasons not to use halogen. So moving on to marine biologist submarines, a halogen lightbulb is ALOT less reliable than an LED light, and a loss of light would be catastrophic. An LED light produces zero UV emissions, last up to 60x longer, consumes less energy and produces about 10% of the heat a halogen does. So cost wise and looking at reliability, an LED light system is a no brainer.</p></div>		</li>
