<p>To be clear, resonance is not necessary for dielectric heating.  You can heat with a wide range of frequencies long as the wavelength meets your criteria for depth of heating. The common frequency of 2450Mhz has no resonance in water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup this frequency is far below the resonant freq of water. It was chosen because lower ranges don't transfer heat as effectively and higher ranges don't penetrate as deep into food resulting in overcooking of the outer layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I never thought about this. If I make a microwave with a lower-frequency, my food will cook more evenly? That makes perfect sense, but everyone seems to just accept that microwaves are 2.4 ghz just because.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the spectrum in this range came from changes in the hydrogen bonds corresponding to changes in rotational momentum and moreso that the spectrum was rather featureless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because your body is just as responsive to the mircowaves as the food you're heating. The inside of the oven is covered in metal sheets (usually a mesh on the door, but it has the same effect), which blocks the microwaves.</p></div>		</li>
