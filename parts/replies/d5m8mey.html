<p>Clearly containers need to be Weare-Phelan shaped then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being convex is usually a huge advantage for shipping containers, and the Weare-Phelan shape doesn't really do that at all, while rectangular prisms do.</p>
<p>Rectangular prisms can also be size-mismatched but still have efficient packing, while the Weare-Phelan shape doesn't really do that either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you scale a Weaire-Phelan shape bigger, I don't think you can actually fit smaller weaire-phelan shapes inside that weaire-phean shape such that no room is wasted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course the most efficient way to transport something is to not use any boxes and fill the transport medium completely with the stuff you're transporting. Bonus points for grinding it into a powder for added space savings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just leave this here:</p>
<p>&quot;In 1965, László Fejes Tóth discovered the trihedral pyramidal shape (which is composed of three rhombi) used by the honeybee is not the theoretically optimal three-dimensional geometry. A cell end composed of two hexagons and two smaller rhombuses would actually be .035% (or about one part per 2850) more efficient.&quot;</p>
