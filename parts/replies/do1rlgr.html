<p>I recall an anecdote from one of McD's corporate chefs (the people designing new products and evaluating the existing menu) about how they forewent introducing blueberry milkshakes at one point because releasing that to McDonalds'es throughout America would have required them to buy up 80% of all blueberries produced in North America that year. </p>

<p>Seriously though, if it was in person, do you know who? </p>
<p>If it was online, do you remember any details that might help it be found? </p>
<p>If not a source for this story, similar sources would also be appreciated. </p></div>		</li>
