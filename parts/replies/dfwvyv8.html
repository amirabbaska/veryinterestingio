			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is, two people slaved away for 8 years and required the help of friends/family simply to place a downpayment on a &quot;fixer upper&quot; ?</p>
<p>Toronto is so fucked... and so are millennials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's most big cities now.  The housing market has been ruined,  Soon people will have to live at home until they're 40 to afford a downpayment!  But clearly it's just that millennials are lazy and spend all their money on iPhones!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in the future, owning will just be less likely. A friend in Stockholm could never dream of owning a home let alone a condo. London is similar, just sadly the way it goes eventually in major cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you this issue is beyond the city limits. I live just east of the city where new detached, semis, and townhouses are being built. I currently rent but am looking to buy in the coming years. Except house prices have jumped 30% in the last year and seem to be continuing with a similar trend. I work in land development and one of our recent 200 lot subdivisions about a half hour from the city limits had an average selling price of 1million for a 2200 sqft house. Business is booming but it's way beyond what any first home buyer can afford. </p></div>		</li>
