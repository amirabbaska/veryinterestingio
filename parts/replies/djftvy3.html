			<div class="markdown"><p>The strange thing about the Asian reaction to alcohol is the Korean and Japanese, they drink like fish. The Chinese and Mongolians can't touch the stuff in general. Myself, I'm an alcoholic, but I choose not to drink. I've been through all the stages, as a heavy drinker, it was great. I could somewhat control it but still get loaded. As an alcoholic, certain buttons were pushed, there was no going back. It involved waking up with an enlarged liver, pissing blood and not being able to write due to shaking hands. Sobriety or death are the 2 options.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Native Americans are known for having issues with alcohol, historically.</p>

<p>I believe Intuit struggle as well</p>
<p>Japan also has issues with alcohol, although i believe it tends to be more of a cultural issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your response. I'm a heavy drinker that has people make excuses for me when I say I'm an alcoholic. I've always found that weird. I have quit for many reasons, and can quit again, but I drink more than your 14 drinks a week, easy. People say to me, &quot;you're a drunk, not an alcoholic.&quot; Anyway, that's besides what I want to ask.</p>
<p>I want to know the effects it has on my brain.  My gf got into a really bad car accident a month ago and I've completely stopped drinking... Stopping drinking has only made me realize how sad I am on a daily basis, and people ask me why I'm NOT happy now. Maybe a shrink can help me with that, but it seems paradoxical.</p>
<p>What I'm wondering in biology is... Perhaps... How many brain cells have I killed? Can my IQ drop? Have I hurt my capacity to learn? Ect.</p>
<p>Get accident was may 24th. So I've been sober since then, I'd relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had your people on my side. I drink 3-4 times a week, 2 beers at a time (sometimes 3, but then I feel it the next morning.) I don't feel that I <em>need</em> it to get by, but I certainly feel more comfortable in social situations after a drink. As far as my family is concerned, this means I'm on the precipice of alcoholism, if not an alcoholic already - and I hear this so often that I've started to believe it myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I don't want to diminish what you're feeling. Let me emphasize that before continuing.</p>
<p>I drink about 4 or more 7.6abv beers a night at least. Wake up, work, get other things done, then (most likely) continue later. Social, alone, it's really just whatever I feel like I want to do.  It doesn't hurt me. It's not uncommon for me to drink up to 375ml of a 90 proof bourbon in one night. </p>
<p>So, when my friend's say they don't see me having a problem when I compare to other people... It weirds me out. I'm almost 33. I guess this makes me functional?</p>
<p>I dated a girl who woke at ten and was 4 IPAs down by noon, though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's binge drinking. Overloading your liver and depleting your body of electrolytes. This is far more damaging than moderating the same volume over the same period of time but in intervals.</p>
<p>Like taking 3 aspirin every 6 hours over 24hours (still not good), compared to 9 aspirin all at ounce in the morning.</p></div>		</li>
