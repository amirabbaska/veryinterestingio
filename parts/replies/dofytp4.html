			<div class="markdown"><p>There are space based detectors currently planned. One is called LISA, and will be able to measure gravitational waves with a much lower frequency than the ground based detectors, typically looking for waves with periods of 10s of seconds to hours. These complement each other in a similar way to how different optical telescopes may look for IR, UV, or Radio, etc. Some binary black hole merges may be observable in both, for example.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>How would a future gravitational wave detector built in space be different from the gravitational wave detectors that have been built on Earth?</p>

<p>There is a space mission planed by the European Space Agency, called LISA which stands for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

<p>The big difference is that in space, this instrument is sensitive to a very different frequency range than LIGO-Virgo on the ground. It goes to much lower frequencies - see <a href="https://www.elisascience.org/" target="_blank">https://www.elisascience.org/</a></p>
<p>Basically lower frequency means bigger sources, with larger radii. That means LISA could detect super-massive black holes in the centres of galaxies. Or white-dwarf binaries in our own galaxy. Very exciting - will open up totally different objects to view.  </p></div>		</li>
