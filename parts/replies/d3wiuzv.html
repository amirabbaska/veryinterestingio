			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it is now possible to see the amyloid-β deposits, using combined MR/PET (one machine) imaging and a specialized radioactive tracer known as Florbetapir (18F). It is specifically designed to bind to the amyloid-β. It is currently being used in a longitudinal study in the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>F18 labeled Florbetaben is approved in the US. </p>
<p>It is a similar tracer that binds to the beta-amyloid plaques. </p>

<p>I've only read it as part of a PET/CT, but we could fuse the PET data to an MR obtained on one of our other scanners if available. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's essentially how ours functions. We run the MR sequence parameters first and then put the PET data onto it. IIRC, there are only three of these machines in the UK. Regarding the tracer - only two manufacturing sites. It only has a half-life of 6 hours, is made on the day and shipped to us if it doesn't fail. From there, it is a race against time to use it between live research subjects. Fun tiemz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as far as I know you don't need any combined imaging (ct or mr) PET alone is enough to see b-amyloid deposits. most centres use pet/ct though</p></div>		</li>
