<p>That's generally our problem with all diseases. HIV is killed by sunlight pretty easily for example. But we can only survive that same sunlight because it gets stopped by our skin and it would still give us a terrible sunburn. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemo attacks rapidly dividing cells, whether or not they are healthy or cancerous.  Our intestines and bone marrow (which produces our white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) are among the fastest dividing cells, which is why people taking chemo often feel nauseous, and  are more prone to other sickness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really shitty comparison as there are things that will kill cancerous cells or trigger apoptosis without affecting normal cells. </p>
<p>But OP already mentioned the best refutation of this nonsense. Your stomach contains a very strong acid, dumping alkaline water in it does nothing but partially neutralize that acid. </p>
<p>If they then resort to the &quot;alkaline blood is better blood&quot; tell them to quit wasting time with water and just hyperventilate. You can change your blood pH almost instantly hyper ventilating - if that's what you're into.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally true.  Rapid breathing gives off lots of carbon dioxide, which is acidic.  While you would probably pass out before the pH was too heavily affected, it's still technically possible to change your pH.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, and I risked some silliness by making may argument extremely concise. But let's elaborate. If somehow alkaline water could make it into your body (forgetting the reality of the stomach etc.), what subtle property would it have that would kill cancerous cells or trigger apoptosis without affecting normal cells? There is simply no reason to think that cancer cells would be dramatically more hurt by mild alkalinity than non-cancer cells.</p></div>		</li>
