			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good explanation with one minor addition: most hive-based insects (termites, ants, bees) use the equivalent of neuters to look after the young. A standard 'worker' might be biologically female, but they don't procreate - the queen's the one that does that job after mating with male drones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something else important.  The mothers give birth. </p>
<p>Say a species isn't that social, and they copulate and then go their separate ways.  Now the female is pregnant, she sometime later gives birth.</p>
<p>Now what's more reasonable, that the female takes care of the offspring that just came out of her, or that the male somehow months later comes back and finds the offspring and takes care of them, while the female leaves?</p></div>		</li>

Not by getting tied down by child support payments while that hussy runs off to Mexico with the damn pool boy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The majority of species in the world are actually insects</p>

<p>You can make it an even larger majority if you just expand it to all arthropods.  Then it ends up including over 80% of all species.</p></div>		</li>
