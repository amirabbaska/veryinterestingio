			<div class="markdown"><p>So this isn't really youtube's fault? I thought youtube was just fucking itself when they decided to stop putting ads on a lot of high traffic videos. I just watched h3h3's video and Ethan said they've been earning 16 cents on the dollar. Must be hard to be creative when almost all ideas would be flagged inappropriate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is and isnt youtubes fault(mainly isnt, Youtube are in crisis management rn). The majority of advertisers left, as they felt they were &quot;endorsing rascism&quot;. Which they werent, but the WSJ(Wall Street Journal) convinced them through some mental gymnastics that they were. They began coming back to youtube, as youtube offered better controls for what videos to play on. This led to many youtubers losing their monetisation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wall street journal report came after a video on PewDiePie's channel was receiving criticism for being a &quot;White Supremacist Video&quot;. In the video, he used a service called Fiverr (which is a service that you can use to pay people to do menial tasks for $5 or more) in which he found a service where 2 guys would do a cute skit then hold up a sign with a sentence of your choosing, after which they'd say something you wanted them to say. PewDiePie got flack for what he told them to write on the sign. PewDiePie told them to write &quot;Death to all Jews&quot; on the sign and told them to say &quot;Subscribe to Keemstar&quot;. This is crude humor and really not funny and cruel, yes, but PewDiePie immediately apologized after he live stream the video and then within hours put on another video apologizing and saying that he was not a nazi and he put down the request because he thought he wouldn't do it (which was partly the mantra of the video as he did similar absurd requests for other fiverr services - none of them supporting nazism or any racis/sexism).<br />
The WSJ ignored those apologies and took that video and another joke taken out of context (which was him dressed like a Nazi but the joke was making fun of nazis) and used this as &quot;evidence&quot; that PewDiePie is a white nationalist who wants to kill Jews. They then also use PewDiePie as an example to &quot;claim&quot; that youtube is a hotbed for racism and sexism and that advertisers need to stop supporting youtube. S complete lie, but it worked and advertisers removed a huge part of funding and ad revenue from youtube. Which brings us to the videos you see about lack of funding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YouTube really doesn't have a choice they have to get the money somewhere </p>
<p>One of the interesting things though is that I'm pretty sure the companies  who pulled out only did so bc they feared public backlash.</p>
<p>There was a UK boycott months before but nothing happened in the US until recently </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add the guidelines are not really so clear.</p>
<p>I have a friend (anecdotal) that from day one wanted to highlight well made video games for kids. Never used bad language, graphic content, etc and all his stuff was showing restricted after this.</p>
<p>Revenue he said dropped from about $30 a week (small channel) to maybe $5. Between stressing out on what he was suddenly doing wrong and not having the channel support itself he gave up.</p>
<p>I'm sure they'll figure it out, just a bad situation in the meantime due to a bunch of knee-jerk reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best examples off the top of my head were along the lines of Minecraft, Yooka-Laylee, and Skylanders.</p>
<p>His whole thing was he was tired of people seeing the cash grab movie to video games as the only thing kid friendly plus most of them being generally pretty bad.</p>
<p>Still trying to convince him to keep going, but I don't exactly blame him for being a little bummed out.</p></div>		</li>
