			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer - squeezing the legs and hips is the closest most of us can get to consciously engaging the muscles of the pelvic floor, which are directly involved in producing an orgasm.  This is why learning to develop and control these muscles through exercises like &quot;kegels&quot; is a treatment method for people who either have trouble orgasming, or orgasm too quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Former opiate addict here, can tell you it's extremely difficult to reach an orgasm on opiates like heroin or morphine but when you do, it's amazing. I'm clean now but for a while there was residual effects on sex drive. </p>
<p>Muscle relaxers like Flexiril never really had an impact on my ability to orgasm. </p></div>		</li>

<p>All of these effect orgasming for people....so I've heard...</p>
<p>It can cause getting/maintaining an erection extremely difficult, and while an orgasm is possible, usually takes longer and can/most likely will happen with just a semi...so I hear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, recently had surgery, when i was under painkillers I was almost completely numb and couldn't maintain a proper erection. </p>
<p>Makes sense, it'sâ€‹ not like painkillers are discriminate in what they numb.</p></div>		</li>
