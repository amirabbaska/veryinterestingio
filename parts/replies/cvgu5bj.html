			<div class="markdown"><p>Help me out here.  I was just reading another discussion yesterday where someone asked whether just an oxygen mask would be sufficient to walk around on the surface of Mars, and the top response was that the atmosphere pressure was so low that liquid water was simply not possible... just gas and solid.  So how is there liquid water on Mars at all?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't permanent standing bodies of water, but episodic/seasonal releases. They run downhill, wet the sand for a moment, and evaporate after leaving behind perchlorate residue. </p>
<p>The pressure argument does not preclude the existence of intermittent streams of liquid water as such. The presence of liquid water represents disequilibrium conditions and is a temporary state of affairs, it eventually evaporates, doubtlessly within a short span of time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for clearing this out for me, you just clarified everything about the 'States of Matter' chapter they taught us in school. </p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, what basically happens is matter can exist in any state in a system, but will not be in equilibrium, and will tend to exist in particular state(s) depending upon the state variables?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that same discussion earlier this morning. Essentially what I am interpreting this as, and if you could clarify and correct me, is as follows. </p>
<p>There are only temporary, seasonal moments when water can exist in a liquid state on the surface of Mars until it turns into a gas. The liquid state leaves the &quot;perchlorate residue&quot; as evidence of its presence.</p>
<p>Now, since there would be greater atmospheric pressure under the surface, would it be possible for us to determine the temperature and pressure level that the liquid water will exist at? Could they use this discovery to calibrate the scale of how deep the liquid water is in different seasons and determine when surface conditions are ripe for the water to seep out of the ground? Will we be able to then, just focus our attention on those spots with the perchlorate residue and wait for the required conditions?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The salinity of water affects at which pressures it can exist - Mars has atmospheric pressures that are too low for pure H2O, but can support brine water (starting at about 3.5% salt). The NASA announcement states that there is evidence of <del>hydrogenated</del> hydrated salts that are indicative of salt water flows - different from pure H2O, but it is still a very impressive/important anouncement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to go with colligative properties. Dissolving stuff in water makes it harder to phase transition from a liquid to anything else, because it reduces the vapor pressure (making liquid stable at higher temperatures or lower pressures) and interrupts crystal structure formation (making freezing harder to do).</p>
<p>So because this is very salty liquid, it's just barely able to exist, even though the pressure at Mars' surface is just slightly below the triple point of pure water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some known halophilic <em>Archeans</em>. Things such as <em>Halobacterium</em> for instance. Some of halophiles live in o√Øl field brines (3 x salinity of seawater). </p>
<p>I'd lie to say I am overly familiar with those critters, so perhaps someone with a better understanding of their limits and tolerance might feel free to chime in.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the presence of perchlorate vs simple salts was a factor of some import. However, there seem to be some <em>Archea</em> with a perchloric metabolism as well (<em>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</em>, for instance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exist? Perhaps.</p>
<p>But a better question is whether it can devellop, and the answer to that would (probably) be no. These wet patches are just not stable for long enough for abiogenesis to occur within them.</p>
<p>So for life to be present in these perchloric seeps, it would have had to devellop several billion years in the past, when Mars was <em>way</em> more hospitable, get frozen in permafrost went things went sour, and have the good luck of having been adapted to perchloric saline to hypersaline conditions prior to being frozen in the permafrost.</p>
<p>Not completely impossible, but very, massively unlikely...</p>
