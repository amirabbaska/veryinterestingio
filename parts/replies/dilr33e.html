<p>It depends on what you mean by that. We don't have &quot;general&quot; intelligences yet, in the sense that we humans can often generalize our knowledge to many scenarios--i.e. we can play the piano, watch the news, ride a bike, cook a meal, play video games, and so many other things. We don't have AI that can do everything--at least not nearly as good as we can. So, I want to preface this by saying that we don't have this sort of general intelligence, and so it's important not to assume the AI will have any human-like traits, such as getting faster at solving problems it's &quot;learned&quot; about. That's a common pitfall with AI, so it'll be important to keep that in mind as we continue.</p>
<p>There are ways to &quot;store&quot; information. For instance, there is a model in machine learning called the neural network. Once we've chosen the structure of the network and decided on some other things, it is possible to &quot;train&quot; this model. The key is understanding that the model depends on a bunch of numbers, which we call weights. If we change the weights, the model changes. So, we want to change the weights to make our model better. We do this by feeding the network some training data--this  is kind of similar to seeing a number of correctly done examples of something for humans. Then, the weights will change a little bit with every new example given to the network. The math behind this is beyond the scope of this answer here, but the overall concept is pretty straightforward: update the weights so that the network gets better, using the information we've provided to it.</p>
<p>Then, once we're done feeding the network our training data, we have the weights hopefully at their optimum value (i.e. the model is most accurate with these specific weights). In this case, we can save these weights and we can use this model with these weights to make predictions about new information. In this sense, the model has &quot;learned&quot; if it can generalize what it's &quot;seen&quot; from the training data set to new data.</p></div>		</li>
