<p>I heard they try use significantly more than idle (but less than cruise) to maintain a 3 degree decent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I forgot to mention I am an airline pilot in the US so I'm the source.  A lot of times even idle isn't enough required and we have to use air brakes or speed brakes to slow down or descend faster.  Next time you have a window seat next to the wing look at the top of the wing on descent and you can see the brakes raise and lower.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_(aeronautics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_brake_(aeronautics</a>).   It's hard for some people to believe but airliners are very efficient gliders.   </p></div>		</li>
