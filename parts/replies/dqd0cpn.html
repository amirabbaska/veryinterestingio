			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also another major reason in the case of molecules.  In the UV/Vis spectrum you are exciting more than just electrons. You can excite other modes such as vibrational modes in addition to electronic modes and since you naturally have a distribution of vibrational states in molecular systems it takes different amounts of energy to excite different molecules to the same state.</p>
<p>Which the reason you tend to have massive peaks with molecules such as Benzene</p>

<p>vs say argon</p>

<p>is because you have a ton of vibration, bending, rotation, etc. states. </p>
<p>It's also why UV/Vis spectrums in liquids even for atomic species have  much larger peaks than the gas phase is because you have intermolecular interactions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The width is inversely related to the lifetime of the state, so only states which live forever truly have definite energies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, just to clarify, this is because of the time/energy form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a>, which states that the fundamental uncertainty in the energy of a state (that leads the width of the line) scales inversely with the lifetime of the state, with the scaling factor being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank">Planck constant</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only a phd student, so far from an expert, but I'd be very careful about the &quot;time-energy uncertainty relation&quot;. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0105049" target="_blank">This paper</a> goes into more detail, but the upshot is that you can sort of come up with something that looks like an uncertainty relation for time and energy in some special circumstances, but this is very different to the actual Heisenberg relation which holds in full force without any quibbles or worries in all situations in non-relativistic QM.</p>
<p>The problem is basically that there isn't a time observable which does what you need in systems with energy bounded below, due to Pauli's theorem, and this basically sinks the whole thing.</p>
<p>Heisenberg uncertainty is a theorem. &quot;Time energy uncertainty&quot; is basically pretty sketchy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard some people mention that this is not entirely true, I believe because in a relativistic treatment, there is no time operator and so there is no commutation relation.  Can anyone speak to this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't answer your question at all, but if bands were infinitely thin, the probability of a photon having a matching energy would end up being zero, and absorption would become impossible. The existence of absorption at all requires bands to have finite width.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only holds if you assume that the energy of the photons is infinitely narrow, which is also not the case. The only case in which you have a beam of photons with infinitely narrow energy is if you have perfect plane waves, but that requires your <del>beam to be infinitely wide</del> measurement to be infinitely long.</p>
<p>Edit: Wrong conjugate variable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if they were infinitely thin, non-ideal spectrographic instruments would still have a maximum resolution, limiting our ability to observe that infinite thinness, although I suppose that resolution would be pretty darn high with modern technology.</p></div>		</li>
