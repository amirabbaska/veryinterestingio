			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no such thing as &quot;progress&quot; in mining.</p>
<p>The problem involves taking a piece of data and using it to calculate its hash, which is essentially a number between 0 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935. You cannot reverse this equation, as in you cannot engineer a piece of data to have a certain hash. Every time you run a hashing algorithm on an exact piece of data, it will have the same hash.</p>
<p>So essentially, each hash has a 1 in 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 chance of happening each time you try a new set of data. </p>
<p>Modern miners try this problem trillions of times per second to try to find a hash that is lower than a certain number, in which case they will have successfully mined a block and will get the reward for it. Currently, this certain number is
37881203883239864327818330509932163800025338037097470000 if my calculations are correct, but it fluctuates based on another algorithm.</p>
<p>As a result, each attempt has a certain chance of solving it. This does not change for each attempt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would, but the problem is very complicated and has a big luck element to it. So raw processor speed is only part of the solution. Also the problem gets more complicated the more raw power there is. That way it takes around 10 minutes to find the answer every time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two parts to this:</p>
<p>The problem is solved by more of a &quot;guess and check&quot; solution. You are actually just looking at thousands of hashes every second for the right one. It's just easier to explain as a problem. The current hashrate for bitcoin is about 5 trillion gigahashes/second for the entire bitcoin network, for example.</p>
<p>And yes, the work is shared. It doesn't have to be, but most people join a pool because the chance of you actually getting the right hash is astronomically small if you don't have much hardware. You contribute however much hashrate you can to the pool and they pay you based on that. If it's a small pool you may rarely get paid -- they can't pay you if they aren't finding the right hash, but you get a more significant portion because it's split fewer ways. Bigger  pools pay more consistently, but it's split up more so it's little payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to be not worth it.  With altcoins they brought in new algorithms that are no longer dominated by ASICs (Highly specialized chip only made for mining bitcoin).  Right now a Nvidia GTX1080 can make about $7/day and AMD 480 can do about $6/day.  Potentially more depending on how the prices of various coins and bitcoin fluctuates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all math equations which is what GPU's specialize in. GPU's are basically just another specialized processor with video ram being specialized dedicated ram for the GPU. Everything you see in a game is just calculated triangles or voxels.  Of course GPU's do more than just that, but the core is just very fast math calculations.  Now an algorithm like Ethereum is very memory intensive so having very fast video ram helps make them more efficient.  AMD cards seem to be better suited for that type of calculation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>whattomine.com or coinwarz.com are good sites.  You'll need to benchmark your system to see what kind of hashrates you can expect. </p>
<p>Although not the highest paying the easiest way to mine is to use Nicehashminer which will get you about 75% of what you would expect if you actually mined specific coins.  That will do a few different algorithms and pay you out in bitcoins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to the previous problem is involved in solving the new problem such that people can't &quot;premine,&quot; the solution must be found after the last solution in the chain is found.</p>
<p>The purpose of the problem isn't to find a solution. It is to make it difficult to find a solution. This is done both so it is difficult to make bitcoin out of thin air and for another purpose which is beyond the scope of this ELI5. But this system is known originally as &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; because your solution acts as proof that you put in x amount of effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>about the &quot;new math problem&quot; its like I give you the following math problem</p>
<p>write down DD<em>MM^(YY)+ hh </em> mm^ss every half second.</p>
<p>its an endless &quot;problem&quot; per definition. its pretty much impossible for you to solve it perfectly but you always have something to do...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/" target="_blank">http://www.coindesk.com/math-behind-bitcoin/</a> if you are interested more about the math behind it...</p>
<p>think it explains it quite well, ask if u have questions. it only makes sense to me because I know how to do RSA calculations and I couldnt imagine it making sense to me without. so it might help to get into that first...</p></div>		</li>
