			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus you have to consider he consequences of getting caught. This is not a college prank. Planting a secret listening device anywhere is a felony; planting it in the White House raises the stakes to high treason. </p>
<p>Plus people watch too much Hollywood. The power needed for a radio to reach a &quot;safe&quot; listening spot (what, half a mile?) through two-foot-thick limestone walls, plus countermeasures and shielding no doubt in place - is not trivial. This is not going to be a button or microdot. (Heck, Apple has a watch that lasts maybe 2 days on a charge with a 20-foot Bluetooth range - and it's huge for something you'd want to hide...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some states recording conversations without the consent of both (all) parties is illegal. In other states, at least one of the parties has to consent. A device just left behind and recording when the consenting party has departed obviously breaks either law, if others come into range and start speaking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. OP mistakenly believed members of the press are admitted to the Oval Office. We see a lot of pics from the Oval Office but these aren't generally from the Press.  It's usually the official WH photographer and released to the press for use.  </p></div>		</li>
