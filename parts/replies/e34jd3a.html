			<div class="markdown"><p>Your points make no sense as an argument.
Birds are endothermic, as are mammals. The argument that feathers insulate makes no sense, as mammalian hair or blubber insulates as well. Both are endotherms that have insulation.</p>
<p>The argument of hollow bones and smaller size makes no sense. Rodents are typically smaller than many birds. An ostrich moves more mass than a rabbit. A penguin needs to maintain more heat than a Chihuahua.</p>
<p>Birds actually have a much higher oxygen extraction than mammals. Mammals do not take in thousands of time more oxygen than birds. And even if they did, that would argue for a less efficient respiratory system.
Larger organs is a silly argument as well, as an ostrich has larger organs than a shrew. The size or mass of an organ has little to do with its oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>Your claim that mammalian digestion or reproduction is more complex than avian digestion is completely unfounded. Absence of a cloaca has no impact on energy efficiency. Like every creature, its anatomic idiosyncracies evolved to meet a specific evolutionary pressure. Are we less evolved or less complex because we never developed tortoise shells? When I hear people talking about one animal being more complex than another to imply evolutionary superiority, I conclude they don't understand evolution. Animals evolve for their niche. We don't have a gullet, while birds do. We can't concentrate our urine into uric acid, which is an additional step birds and reptiles do to conserve water. Are we less complex than birds because we never evolved a gullet and we have to pee out a lot of dilute urea?</p>
<p>A pregnant mammal does spend a lot of energy nurturing the fetus. However, a female bird produces an energy-dense egg regardless of fertilization. The unfertilized mammalian egg cost nowhere near the amount of resources as non-placental amniote egg. And this argument makes no sense for the males of the species.</p>
<p>Your conclusion that smaller animals that weigh less are more energy efficient is incorrect as well. Among mammals, energy expenditure indexed to body surface area generally decreases with increased size. A shrew will burn through proportionally more energy than a dog, and will eat more, in proportion to its size, than a dog or a cow.</p>
<p>Also great non-sequitur on comparing birds and mammals to Denmark and the US. I really struggled to try to think of a less apt analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure why you list maintain body heat, and just brush aside birds because they have feathers. Mammals have fur, which has the same function. Body size plays a big factor in endothermy because smaller animals have a much more difficult time maintaining a steady body temperature, and on average birds are much smaller than mammals. In addition, there are birds that remain endothermic in the Antarctic, and considering their size, it's quite a feat. Mammals that live in the Antarctic are all quite large. </p></div>		</li>
