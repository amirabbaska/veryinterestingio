			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say whether or not that is true... it certainly made it a better option. Most vertebrates have periods of inactivity... it would stand to reason that hibernation developed as a slowly extending (generation over generation) period of &quot;sleep&quot; during low-resource times of year. Early hibernation variants could have easily been multi-day spans of sleep between foraging runs, with no mechanism in place to prevent muscle loss, relying on periodic activity to stave off atrophy. Hibernation in some sporadic form would have existed long before other body systems adapted to allow for longer periods of continuous rest. </p>
<p>If you're talking about winter-long full season lock-stock-and-barrel hibernation, then yes, prevention of muscle atrophy would probably have preceded that multi-month inactive resting state. But I doubt it preceded the precursors to full-season hibernation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would could should is the problem with evolutionary explanation. It's very much a possibility that the ability was there and such behaviour happened almost accidentally when a cold period in history brought winters where there used to be none.We're so in the dark any tale can be argued almost.</p>
<p>Preceded precursors?? </p></div>		</li>
