			<div class="markdown"><p>That pulsar map would be close to useless for anyone who could retrieve a Voyager or Pioneer record and try to locate earth with them. One reason is because there is much more pulsars than thought of when pioneer and voyager were launched, at the time they were a novelty in astronomy. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/08/17/voyagers-cosmic-map-of-earths-location-is-hopelessly-wrong/#77addc3e69d5" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/08/17/voyagers-cosmic-map-of-earths-location-is-hopelessly-wrong/#77addc3e69d5</a>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article doesn't seem related at all...</p>
<p>Besides, I don't get why there being more pulsar makes the map useless. The ones that we knew of at the time are still there, so Earth can still be located relative to them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the article it says theres no way to pinpoint where the record came from, but isnt it possible to estimate based on the trajectory and then analyzing the beta decay of the record? To find how long it has traveled. Or are there course deflection from space debris?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct! I've written a bit on it in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5x22ti/what_are_some_practical_applications_of_pulsars/deexh7o/" target="_blank">this comment</a>. The relevant portion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The timing stability is being used for a GPS equivalent that would hold through the solar system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_pulsar-based_navigation" target="_blank">X-ray pulsar-based navigation</a> (XNAV) uses an array of pulsars, rather than an array of GPS satellites, to triangulate your position. The <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/" target="_blank">NICER</a> mission is going up to the International Space Station and has a project called SEXTANT that will begin tests of XNAV. The launch of NICER is in &quot;early 2017&quot; so any day now! China has also launched it's own mission called XPNAV-1.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NICER is going to be amazing! And I agree that it's really cool to use the ISS as a platform. It essentially sits up there without much power draw and is an extremely sensitivity X-ray observatory.</p>
<p>While XNAV is an important component of the mission, the primary objective is to measure the radii of neutron stars. While the masses have been determined, in some cases very well, the radii have not been. This is important to determine the &quot;equation of state&quot; that governs the structure of all neutron stars, which has implications from gravitation theory (how compact will the structure be?) to nuclear physics (how &quot;squishy&quot; is the material on the inside?). So we're really probing the interiors (NICER = Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) of the neutron stars themselves but it has applications to many other fields of physics.</p>
<p>A graphical representation of this can be shown <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/attachments/c4iry-jpg.206789/" target="_blank">here</a>. This is a slightly older figure (Demorest et al. 2010) but it shows the points really nicely. The y-axis is mass, the x is radius. The different curved lines so theoretical predictions for how mass and radius should relate. The horizontal lines are mass observations and the shaded regions are ruled out for various physical reasons. You can see that the most massive neutron star (at the time, there's been another more massive!) basically rules out the green and pink curves. Blue cuves are sort of standard models where the interiors are primarily some kind of neutron soup. Pink includes some kind of &quot;exotic matter&quot; (e.g. &quot;hyperons&quot; or &quot;kaon condensates&quot;) and green are strange quark matter centers. These last two cannot support the more massive neutron stars from gravitational collapse since they are too &quot;squishy&quot; and so are ruled out. But, as you can see, there are still lots of theories possible since we don't know the radii of neutron stars, and this is precisely what NICER is working to solve right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a thought experiment, there was a discussion about time travel suffering the same issue. Since it is a rip in space time, it is safe to assume that it will be stationary.  Going either forward or backward in time would mean that for every (roughly) year you travel, you would have to travel the distance (roughly) of earth to Pluto just to get back to earth, and since you are starting from a stationary position, you will have to exceed the solar system speed of ~13,800km/s just to start making any gains. That is assuming you are even heading in the right direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>given what we know about expanding space, I'm not sure we could ever &quot;jump&quot; like they do in EVE, BSG, etc.  </p>
<p>as the OP said, there is no coordinate system in space, no (x,y,z) coords we can punch into a computer console.  in theory, we could execute a Delta-V and end up somewhere 'else', but the whole point of navigating over travelling is to know exactly where you are...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, we sort of <em>do</em> have a coordinate system for space:  the same coordinate system astronomers use to point telescopes, ie, right ascension and declination, coupled with radial distance from Earth.</p>
<p>Not very practical if you're orbiting, say, Tabby's Star and want to head to Betelgeuse, but its there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My issue with &quot;jumping&quot; in any game or movie is what about material still? Unless it's a wormhole, when they jump what about stars or planets or anything else that may be in their path? Especially something like star wars where jumping to lightspeed isn't an instantaneous leap to the destination. You can see them traveling in hyperspace, unless hyperspace is the answer like its a different dimension that's clear. Idk lol but it's confusing</p>
<p>Edit: Glad I asked! Thanks for the replies guys. I should have known better how empty space can be. Hyperspace &quot;lanes&quot; do make sense and I'm sure they adjust those as time goes on and stuff moves. Makes sense now and that maps of hyperspace routes are important in star wars.</p></div>		</li>
