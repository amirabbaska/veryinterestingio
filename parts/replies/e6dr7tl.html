			<div class="markdown"><p>Limited experience, but I think that even though you don't need to freeze some fish for safety reasons, it makes precise knife work easier if the fish is very very cold. </p>
<p>If you've ever tried to dice room temperature salmon, it kind of just mushes up. If you chill it (not quite frozen, but almost) first, the fat stays solid while you cut, and you get nicer pieces. </p>
<p>Maybe I just need to work on my knife skills and sharpening though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The freezing is indeed for safety reasons, and cold fish is easier to cut, but there's also rigor mortis to account for. </p>

<p>Killing a fish and immediately eating it isn't that great. It's OKAY I guess. </p>
<p>Just like aging beef, if you let fish age a bit in the freezer or fridge, the flesh relaxes and it's much more tender. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Flash frozen fish is different from freezing a fresh catch like you or I could. Alot of cell damage occurs when you or i use a typical freezer. Flash freezing preserves the tissues/taste/texture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does your HACCP Plan only really say 48 hours? Ours has to be frozen  to -20c for 7 days to kill the parasite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe it or not, USDA grades meat by visual inspection. </p>
<p>And that’s how they used to inspect fish before freezing fish became mainstream. You look for holes in fish (not fishbone home) and see if a worm was in the fish, etc. </p>
<p>But this is why I prefer super frozen fish. You get a letter from the supplier that they guarantee it’ll be parasite free. </p></div>		</li>
