			<div class="markdown"><p>Another user in the thread mentioned that most sea-faring mammals are completely or mostly carnivorous because water plants tend to have a salinity very near that of the water they grow in. So basically mammals let other animals do most of the filtering for them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: oh we're talking about mammals. So fish filter the water effectively do they?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. For example, marine vegetation tends to be salty. Few  (if any) marine mammals eat vegetation, i.e., they are all carnivores </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and they have a comparatively longer loop of henle's, a structure in the kidneys, to help them excrete more salt. Later in life cats also often end up with kidney issues as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the kidney issue thing because dry kibble and a lot of other commercial foods have very high levels of sodium (ie. more than even a cat could naturally process over a long period of time)? Or does this happen with big cats too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they do as well as frogs and unbelievably parakeets ! Their digestive systems for some reason unbeknownst to scientist delete/excrete the salts PRIOR to the salts entry into the stomach The salt is almost completely excreted in their urine. So. The common frog and parakeet would do just fine in high salinity areas. </p></div>		</li>
