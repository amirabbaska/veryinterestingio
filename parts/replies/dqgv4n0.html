<p>A little bonus content - why are popping sounds so echoey in particular?</p>
<p>You can describe sounds in terms of their frequencies - a pure tone is like a guy bouncing up and down in the middle of that circular pool at a specific rate. Depending on the rate he bounces, you can imagine that the 'echo waves' bouncing back from the edges of the pool might add up or cancel each other out. If you get just the right frequency, you can build up huge waves! This frequency is the 'resonant frequency' of the pool. Different enclosures have different frequencies they resonate at and so different sounds will cause the loudest echoes in each room. Most sounds aren't simple pure tones, but you can break any sound down into them (figuring out which frequencies make up a signal is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis" target="_blank">Fourier Analysis</a>)</p>
<p>But what frequencies make up a popping sound? If you tried to plot the pressure wave it made, you wouldn't get a clear repeating pattern with a particular frequency. You just get a sharp step upwards like a cliff and that's it. It turns out that in order to make this kind of sharp step, you need to add together an infinite series of simple frequencies. All of them need to contribute a little so that you can make this sharp edge. This means that a popping sound contains energy at all frequencies - it's as if you have an infinite set of guys bouncing at all different rates at once. No matter what the resonant frequencies of a space are, you'll have some waves going at that rate and so you'll get loud echoes. </p>
<p>This is why sound people go around clapping in new spaces - just like a balloon pop, it makes a sharp pressure wave that 'rings' the room at all frequencies. They can record the resulting echoes and figure out what acoustic properties the space has. This lets them know which frequencies will echo and which won't.</p></div>		</li>
