<p>So the object that is 13.3 billion light years away, is actually more than that? So in actuality that object, if we froze time, and sent something there, would be closer to 40 billion light years (or something like that) away? </p>
<p>Also, regarding the constant rate bit, doesn't the universe not expand at a constant rate though? I heard somewhere that the universe has expanded at different paces throughout its history, though all my astronomy knowledge comes from poorly remembered YouTube videos so I might be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are seeing it as it was when it was 13 B ly away. Using this we can assume the universe was at least that large 13 billion years ago. Using the rate of expansion, we can extrapolate the minimum size of the universe today. So today, if the object still exists, it would be at or near that limit.</p>
<p>It's like setting up roadblocks for a fugitive. If we know he robbed a bank at noon, he's in a car which can average 40 mph in the city, and it's now 2:00, we know we need to put our roadblocks at least 80 miles away from the bank.</p>

<p>Portions of it do, but over galactic distances, these variations average out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I'm slightly confused, we're seeing the object how it was 13 billion light years away? Aren't we seeing it how it was 13 billion years ago? Or was it already 13 billion light years away 13 billion light years ago?</p>
<p>Can you explain it through an easier example? Andromeda is 2.5 million light years away from the Milky Way, does it mean that we're seeing Andromeda how it was 2.5 million light years away, but at this instant it is closer/further away? Or does that not work because we're in the same galaxy cluster?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Objects where we see light emitted 13.3 billion years ago are about 40 billion light years away from us now (=the distance you would get if you had a lot of rulers floating around in space today). The matter that emitted the earliest radiation we can see today is now 46 billion light years away from us, and this distance is called the radius of the observable universe. At the time of this emission it was just about 42 <strong>m</strong>illion light years away, but initially the universe was expanding so rapidly that the radiation needed all this time to reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I get it, so 13.3 billion years ago, some light from an object 42 million light years away started moving towards us, and because of the expansion of the universe, it has taken 13.3 billion years for the light to reach us, and therefore, we can calculate how far away the object is now (40 billion light years). And we can apply the same method to find out how far away the oldest radiation is. Am I right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note for expansion.</p>
<p>The expansion of the universe can be measured through the doppler effect. Youtube it. Basically, when a sound wave is travelling toward you, it seems to compress and get higher in pitch, and the opposite is true. When the thing emitting the wave is moving away, the sound drops in pitch.</p>
<p>Light is affected by this as well.</p>
<p>So, when we see light from things 13bly away, it will either</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>maintain it's frequency, if it is stationary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rise in frequency, if it is getting closer</p>
</li>
<li>drop in frequency, if it is getting further away</li>
</ul>
<p>When we look at these things, the frequency drops over time.</p>
<p>This is called redshift, since red light is lower frequency, and blueshift is higher frequency.</p>
<p>So we know things are getting further away.</p>
<p>We also know the space in between the objects is expanding, since the amount of redshift is actually proportional to the distance from us.</p>
<p>Something 1ly away gets further away slower than something 2 ly away. So something 13bly away, get further away much much faster than something only 13mly away. This shows that everything, in every direction, is expanding, equally.</p>
<p>Point of reference is irrelevant since it is true in all directions. </p>
<p>To re iterate.</p>
<p>Everything is getting further away, in all directions, faster and faster.</p>
<p>Knowing how fast it is going, based on the amount of redshift, allows us to calculate distance, and total expansion since that initial light reached us, thus giving us a way to plug in numbers, a+b=c style.</p>
<p>So, when we see light 13bly away reach us, that is where the thing was 13b years ago - expansion.</p>
<p>And 92 Bly is so big, being off by 1 or 2 billion light years is pretty insignificant.</p>
<p>EDIT: While the light is traveling from very large distances, the distance it must travel is actually increasing, so something 13bly away has to actually travel more than 13 by to reach us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We just get the number 92 billion light years by assuming the universe expands at a constant rate</p>

<p>No we do not. The expansion rate changes over time, and this is taken into account in the calculations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If inflation occurred at a constant rate through the life of the universe, that same spot is 46 billion light-years away today, making the diameter of the observable universe a sphere around 92 billion light-years. </p>

<p>Directly from the article OP linked. I don't know the math/values behind the actual calculations, but according to that the 92 billion comes from constant rate. I'm not saying its a correct value, but that's what the article says.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a weird phrase, and it is not what is done in cosmology. I guess &quot;constant&quot; was meant as &quot;the same rate everywhere <em>in space</em>, not the same rate at every point in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and since the expansion of the universe is accelerating, the part of the universe we can see is actually shrinking as more and more stars and galaxies cross that threshold.</p></div>		</li>
