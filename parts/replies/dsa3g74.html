			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I've watched zillions of hours of ospreys on nest cams and they'll sometimes fly directly from catching a fish to the nest and they look utterly dry. </p>
<p>Those wings are insanely powerful. I'm blown away by their ability to lift directly out of water clutching a fish that weighs as much as them. They're marvels of birdie engineering.</p>
<p>You also posted one of my favorite osprey videos. In fact it's the one that got me addicted to ospreys. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow that video is amazing; at first it picked up like 2-3 fish in one go... then was picking up fish the size of itself!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been many more recently here in San Diego, this one was at the Scripps pier but I've seen them around Lake Murray and Miramar lake. A pair have a nest on one of the stadium lights at the middle school on Mira mesa. Maybe they are making a comeback since DDT was banned? You can spot the nests by the quantity of bird poo spattered on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They really are, being UK based i have to wait till summer and then drive at least three hours to get a very far off view of an osprey.. though they were trying to get some associated with a potential breeding sight closer to me last year so maybe.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe ospreys are also the only birds that will always turn a fish so that it travels through the air head first. This makes flight easier for the osprey because the fish is then more aerodynamic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think you're right. They have specialized talons with an outer reversible toe so they can clasp a fish with two toes in front and two behind. Owls are supposedly the only other raptor that has that adaptation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Osprey are my favorite birds. I grew up at the shore, learning about how pollution brought them to edge of extinction. It’s been amazing to see them rebound in my lifetime. I vacation at the cape and see them hunting all the time. Every time I see a full nesting platform I rejoice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they're my favorite by far. But fish are tainted with toxins like mercury that accumulate in ospreys. So it's a big concern. </p></div>		</li>
