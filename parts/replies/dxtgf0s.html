			<div class="markdown"><p>Evo devo guy here. This is basically the answer the tooth researchers I know tend to favor. There is some mechanistic trade-off between the development of specialized teeth and the ability to re-initiate tooth development later in life. </p>
<p>I tend to think &quot;its a waste of energy&quot; (mentioned by other posters) is unlikely to be a major factor. Its not a huge expense to produce more teeth, especially in large, long-lived mammals like apes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone I can ask this that might have an answer. Is there any theory on the evolutionary history of spider webbing? I always felt it was hard to conceive of a middle ground between no webbing and webbing that served a productive purpose.</p>
<p>Any insight would be appreciated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many animals secrete mucus for various reasons (from aquatic fish to land dwelling snails). A more niche specific secretion has occurred and evolved many times independently in nature. So a secretion alone is pretty normal.</p>
<p>I immediately thought of net casting spider as a possible intermediate between small nets and larger webs. Its basically simple &quot;tool use&quot; to put something less important than your own body when it comes to securing prey that can potentially fight back. Trapdoor spiders use their webs to secure their tunnels, this seems like another natural progression wherein the webs are just used as a general structural support secreted out rather than highly developed and specific web. The webs here are also used as &quot;trip wires&quot; to alert the spider of prey crossing its ambush threshhold. This web doesnt need to be sturdy or strong or sticky or fancy in anyway that you see in web building spiders. Just a protein that can form a strand.</p>
<p>Imagine for example a precursor for modern spiders that would do as the leaf curling spider would, they would find a leaf and use it for shelter by curling it around and then holding that shape via a sticky secretion (web later, earlier on, it wont need to be so impressive, just a sticky secretion). It can then act as an ambush predator from within a relatively simple yet effective shelter. Slightly more advanced version would simply be one that can form sticky strands which help in forming more complex or sturdy structures.</p>
<p>Precursor of that is merely an arthropod that lays its eggs specifically to the underside of leaves to hide them and protect them from the elements. Again sticky secretion. Many animals feature this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liphistiidae" target="_blank">the most primitive living spiders</a> they are trapdoor spiders.  What they use silk for is to create a tube and door for a shelter, and lay triplines of silk out around their shelter.  It's reasonable to think that early spiders were probably hole-dwelling ambush predators.  If I were to construct a story, it'd be that webbing first evolved as a way to stabilize the tube that sheltered the spider, then began to be used as a series of tripwires around the hole (I mean, if you are spreading silk everywhere in your hole you might get sloppy and spread it around the outside...and then be able to feel vibrations of prey).  From there it's just a matter of making the web stickier so you don't merely detect prey, but slow them down, and then even stickier to actually catch them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might start to use silk to bind things you’ve surprised attacked.  You could imagine a small, irregular mess of sticky silk on the ground could be an effective trap for walking insects.  Once you get any traction with silk of any kind, it makes sense that there would be selection bias for spiders that evolved to use their silk in more useful ways.  A few millions of years and you’ve got a wide range of effective web designs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My last two semesters of college, I took some independent study courses geared towards evolutionary biology. More specifically, my last semester I focused on tooth development in mammals. I mostly sat and reread a number of studies on the genes involved in tooth/digestive system expressions. Evo-Devo wasn't the focus of my degree, I just found it interesting. </p>
<p>It's been almost 12 years now, but a few things stick out in my memory. The genes that control tooth morphology can be turned off and on at different stages of development. Experiments/observed mutations in certain bird beaks would result in the birds developing conical teeth (this helped support the bird/dinosaur relationship). I recall one or two experiments with mice also resulted in extra teeth being grown where mice typically have a gap in their dentition. </p>
<p>As animals evolved, plants and food sources did too. The more complex the digestive processes requires more mechanical break down required. So eventually some animals developed super complex guys (like cows and rabbits) and they have teeth that are covered in extra ridges to break down plant matter, which is further mechanically and chemically broken down in their guts.</p>
<p>The hypothesis I was developing was that the specific genes that control the development of rugae in guts also controls the complexity of the teeth an organism developed. By switching off and on the genes during certain stages, an animal will develop a more or less complex digestive system. So in the case of humans/apes vs other organisms and tooth regeneration, it may be more about what/how our digestive system developed and less about expending energy (as you said). </p>
<p>TL/DR: the gene for tooth regeneration is probably just turned &quot;off&quot; because we don't need it &quot;on&quot; for our diets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I feel like as modern humans the part of this question that concerns us is tooth decay.  And from an evolutionary standpoint, as you said, tooth decay isn't really an issue because rarely do a person's teeth all rot and fall out before they have a chance to reproduce.  So evolution is not going to select for individuals with better (in terms of decay) teeth.  And the big driver there is sugary diets anyway, which for the most part are very very recent arrivals in terms of any evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because as humans have evolved in recent history our diet has changed and our mouth size ha changed quicker than our teeth can adapt to it, leading to overcrowding sometimes which can cause crooked teeth. At least that’s what I read. </p>
<p>Even before I had braces though my teeth still closed and interlocked, so maybe it hasn’t been that big of a problem anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern diet in developed countries consist of soft, palatable food items that require next to zero chewing and thus, most people in America's, Europe, and Asia have very under-developed jaw muscles, and as a consequence, jaw bones. When was the last time that your jaw hurts because you had to chew your food so much? That's what our ancestors did, before they developed agriculture and animal husbandry. And that is why we still retain our wisdom teeth, because our ancestors absolutely required an extra set of molar around their mid-20's because their original molars would absolutely been worn down to uselessness by the amount of grinding and chewing around that age.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the teeth of modern indigenous people (not native americans who runs casinos) who still follow our hunter-gatherer ancestors' diet, they have no crowding, they have strong jaw muscles and jaw bones, and very little malocclusion.  Your jaw bones' growth can be greatly influenced by the usage of their muscle groups. </p></div>		</li>
