			<div class="markdown"><p>And now you know why 192kHz sample rates are useless outside of studios! Compression loss is a real thing, so it's good to have the overhead when you're working with the file and changing/saving it, but after that, anywhere above 48kHz literally makes no difference in sound quality. Higher bit depths are good though, the human ear is quite sensitive to volume. Bitrate is also important up to about 320kbps in MP3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to note that there is a relation between sample rate and maximum frequency</p>
<p>Since himans can hear up to 20khz, we use 44khz sample rate or more</p>
<p>Telephone audio uses 8khz sample rate and that's why the audio sucks. It lacks higher frequencies (above 4khz)</p>
<p>But human voice is up to 4khz, so for talking it is adequate</p>
<p>192 khz sampling found in high end audio systems are used when you want to preserv more of that high frequency audio produced by cracks and explosions. Things that are noisy in the sense that they produce a very wide band signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Video has a sample rate as well. For 1080i @29.97 it is 74.25 MHz. Audio has no equivalent to frame rate because it does not have a line and frame structure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the equivalent in your 1080i video example is frame rate, which is 60 Hz, or 60 frames per second recorded. Then since it's 2D, the resolution on pixels, and also number of bits of voltage (for examle, three 32 bit values: red, green, blue).</p>
<p>The 74 KHz is pixel clock frequency which is a setting to display  the recorded video, and has no bearing on recording the video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frame rate of video and the sample rate of audio are both measures of temporal resolution. I fail to see how they wouldn't represent equivalent qualities.   </p>
<p>74.25 MHz is the pixel clock rate, which is the product of the total horizontal pixel count, total vertical pixel/line count and the frame rate (in your example, 2200 px <em> 1125 px </em> 30 fps = 74250000 px/s). As such, it encompasses two spatial dimensions in addition to time, so I think that calling it a sample rate isn't correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it can be thought of as grabbing a snapshot of the amplitude of the waveform 44,100 times a second,. when sampling at 44.1Khz. It is 44.1khz because this is above twice the highest frequency human ears can generally hear. You get other sampling rates; 48k lines up with 24 frames a second. Multiples of 44.1kHz (and larger bit-depths) are used for greater resolution while still being compatible with the 44.1k standard.</p>
<p>Why is it more than twice the highest frequency humans can hear? </p>
<p>Think of how car wheels appear to spin backwards and forwards as a car speeds up on tv. Imagine they are taking a snapshot of the position of the carwheel 24 times each second. If the speed of the car means the wheel turns round one and three quarter rotations in one 24th of a second, now the wheel looks like it is spinning slowly backwards, instead of moving forwards quickly as it actually is (this is called aliasing in the audio world). A similar effect happens with audio, capturing more than twice as many samples as we can hear essentially eliminates this problem in the audio world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the 44.1 was chosen for a slight over head. But yes it is capturing a sample snapshot as you put it. </p>
<p>What helped me understand the need for double sample rate is to equate it to film. If you think of frequency as a moving object, it's hard to accurately reproduce a movement if the frame rate is too low. You get the picket fence effect. Like imagine panning past a picket fence at low frame rate, it can sometimes look like the image is moving backwards as it flickers past. At higher framerates though it's true motion is easier to see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fence analogy will do. Yes 2oHz to 20K is basically the assumed range of human hearing. There may be plenty of evidence that in certain circumstances people hear above 20k it basically served/does serve. Most listening environments(or people in those listening environments) need a whole list of things before a higher sampling rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to make sure, there's no benefit for listening purposes to capture at higher sample rate than 44.1khz, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on who you talk to. Most of us lose our ability to hear sound above 17,000hz by the time we hit puberty but some audiophiles insist that ultrasonics and overtones in those upper frequencies can be perceived even if not heard clearly. Sampling at 96,000hz for example allows audio playback of frequencies up to 48,000hz which is more than twice as high as any human can hear. </p>
<p>A greater determining factor for audio quality is the sample size. 24 bit audio can reproduce 16 million different loudnesses/voltages and more accurately reproduces the curved analog sound waves. IE less stair stepping. This allows for a very high dynamic range which is the difference between the softest sound you can hear, and the loudest. It's the equivalent of going from 65,000 colors to 16,000,000 colors. While you can look at a 65,356 color .jpg and get a very accurate portrayal of color, the 16,000,000 color .jpg's will have smoother gradients for very similar colors like the blue of a sky, where the 65,356 version would have banding as it isn't able to distinguish the fine changes in color against a flat blue background like the sky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of these claims are wrong. Your ear is not capable of perceiving ultrasonics, full stop. And 16 bit audio has a dynamic range of 96 dB, more than enough for pretty much any audio - and that's before dithering which effectively increases that value. </p></div>		</li>
