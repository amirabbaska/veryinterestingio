			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we also need to address that religion stems from the belief in myth and to realize that superstiton dominated reason for much of our history.</p>
<p>At some point most religion was based off a combinations of fables mixed with superstition.</p>
<p>In the case of Ancient Greece we know the difference between plays and actual religious debate because like us, the Greeks loved writing down everything from scholarly opinion to gossip.</p></div>		</li>
