			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a fragrance company. The Perfumer could smell a fragrance (a scent for a candle or a commercial perfume for example) and write down a basic formula of chemicals (essential oils, more traditional chemicals) to approximate it. The techs would make that, he'd smell it again, then tweak the formula. It takes years of experience to be good at this.</p>
<p>As a chemist with no real fragrance experience, I'd run gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry to get a first shot at a formula, then he could tweak those.</p>
<p>Not sure what advances have been made in the last fifteen years, but a good Perfumer or a sufficiently large mass spec database could get you pretty close to duplicating a fragrance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use GCMS more often as a starter to save time.  The machine is still, in my experience, only about 20-30% effective at quantifying the components in a flavor.  This is a great help but the real fine work is done with a human on the bench still today. The best analogy I can make is the GCMS (or at times HPLC) do a rough cut of the flavor and the chemists use their skills to really polish and sand the piece to perfection.  </p></div>		</li>
