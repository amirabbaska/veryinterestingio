			<div class="markdown"><p>Last summer I took a trip to Thailand and unfortunately got a campylobacter jejuni infection that led to Guillain Barre Syndrome which is basically a rare autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the nervous system. Anyways, the flight back to the US nearly killed me and I was rushed to the hospital from the airport.  I ended up in the ICU for three weeks intubated and with a chest tube. When it was all said and done I got the hospital services bill: $897,000.  Next came the physician's services bill: $36,000.  Then came the labs bill: $4,000.  Total a little less than a million bucks to save my life.  Now this is about to turn a little political but without the Affordable Care Act I wouldn't of been on my parent's insurance and basically would be in debt for the rest of my life. The total I paid out of pocket: $3,500. Still a hefty burden for a 24 year old but manageable. Thanks Obama.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pulmonary/CC physician here.  Hope you're doing ok.  I've seen enough GBS to know it does not always work out.  </p>
<p>One of the worst I had was an 18 year old who ended up with a fairly severe axonal version - intubated, plasmapheresis, IVIG, steroids - nothing worked for her.  Ended up with a trach and sent to rehab for intense physical therapy.  Got readmitted a week later with an aspiration pneumonia and died from ARDS.  I fucking hate GBS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap that's intense! I was diagnosed with the Miller Fisher variant so it took the doctors several days to figure it out. Especially since I was in Thailand they were ruling me out for all sorts of other illnesses first. By the time they intubated me my entire left side was paralyzed and I had significant difficulty moving my right. They loaded me up with a total of 12 IVIG infusions during my stay and I was actually able to walk out of the hospital!<br />
It was a long and painful recovery but I'd say I'm back at about 90% of my original strength. It seems that I'm very fortunate only the myelin sheath was damaged and I suffered no axonal damage to the nerves. Scary stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a fairly severe head injury that landed me in the hospital for 4 days. When I was released, I had to take my temperature every hour and if I had any indication of a fever, I was to go to the emergency room. Well I developed a slight fever and did as instructed. While at the ER, I asked if it was ok to take one of the 5mg oxydodone that I had been prescribed. They said that it was their protocol to give me one of their pills of the same medication. I thought nothing of this until the bill came, they charged me $2000 for that single pill. The prescription of 30 pills cost $20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this one day, I'm just hanging out playing guitar when suddenly <em>wtf</em>! </p>
<p>I get this INTENSE pain, kinda in my back off to the side, and some pressure on a nut. In about 10mins it gets so intense that my body tries to vomit. But there ain't nothin. So I'm just dry heaving. 30mins pass, maybe I just bumped my nut. 1hr passes. Still dry heaving wishing for the sweet release of death. I decide It's time to go to the hospital. But I can't drive like this, so pops comes and takes me to the hospital. He's asking me everything, where's it hurt, what happened, how long blah blah blah. The pain was so intense my brain just shut down. I could feel my body trying to go into sleep/passout mode but not being able to due to the pain.</p>
<p>Get to the E.R. and I'm a true american, so of course no insurence. </p>
<p>Tell the receptionist what's up, then the nurse comes to get my chart. I watch the nurse and receptionists exchange and the nurse clearly says, &quot;that's a kidney stone&quot;.</p>
<p>Nothing to do about it, some pain killers and wait for it to pass, yea? Nope, sorry. Not in America. We have procedure to follow. And apparently the procedure is, we can't give you pain killers for your already known kidney stone, until we first give you an IV pain killer to calm you down, then catscan or mri or whatever it was, your twig &amp; berries, THEN we know you're not a drug abuser so we can give you some..... vicodin.... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? I could have stayed home and taken advil, pretty much the same damn thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, in order to get some painkillers for what was known at entry as a kidney stone they billed me $5000. For some vicodin and they shit they &quot;needed&quot; to do to feel secure in giving it to me. </p>
<p>Oh, and I got this kick ass funnel with a screen in it to strain my piss.... </p>
<p>I should make a shirt, &quot;paid $5000 for a kidney stone, and all I got was this lousy piss strainer.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, and I was unemployed at the time, so they started charging me out the ass, sent it to collections etc. So that's on my credit report for 7years now. But the really frustrating thing, and I'm not entirely educated well enough about the ins and outs of hospital highwaymanism, but as far as I know. Hospitals can write off and unpaid bill as bad debt, so the government pays them back, AND the hospital can sell that debt to a collection agency as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My deductable is $5000 - meaning my insurance doesn't kick in until I spend $5000 of my own money for care... This is in addition to paying $120/month for the insurance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Canadian here. I had a kidney stone once, took them two different surgeries to get the whole thing out, and i got some sweet pain killers (can't remember what kind, this was years ago now), and guess how much i paid for the whole ordeal? </p>
<p>Not. A. Single. Fucking. Cent.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from the UK and have seen my fair share of the NHS and I had a bad experience in the US and the point about inelastic pricing is so important. </p>
<p>When I had pneumonia in the UK at 14, looking back, it's obvious that my parents would have figuratively sold the farm to pay for any treatment but they didn't have to.</p>
<p>When I was in the US I got bitten by a Copperhead and went to hospital but I'd been drinking and knew my insurance had a clause about not covering anything &quot;induced by excessive consumption of alcohol&quot;. The doctor explained to me that the anti-venom was $25,000 a bag and he wanted to give me four of them 'to start with'.  </p>
<p>What do you do? You just take the anti-venom because you think you might be dying and hope your insurance works (it did). I know for a fact that I could have got the anti-venom cheaper from an Australian hospital (pit viper anti-venom is all the same) but how on earth was I supposed to bargain with the supplier - so the cost is just as high as the providers like...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sizable fraction of the population is absolutely NOT perfectly fine with this system, myself included.  The answers to your questions are yes, you do have to pay the bill if you're the victim of a crime.  In theory, you could sue to reclaim that money, but you'd need to hire an attorney for that and in many instances you'd end up with little to nothing for your troubles.  If the crime goes unsolved you're shit out of luck because you don't know who to sue.  If you get in an accident and can't pay the bill, they're legally obligated to treat you assuming your injuries are serious.  They don't necessarily need to provide you with physical therapy or follow up care, though.  Afterwards you would get an enormous bill (a night in the hospital runs at $5,000 at the very least).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason why it is so much cheaper in the uk for medication is because the NHS has better bargaining power than a healthcare network. </p>
<p>If we were to say every NHS hospital trust in England has 2 hospitals, that would be 336 hospitals in NHS England. The biggest US health network has 100. NHS England can be like &quot;We want codeine at $10 per packet, and if we don't get that then it goes to one of your competitors&quot;. US health networks don't have this kind of bargaining power. It would be a fair loss if a pharmaceutical company lost the biggest network in the US, but not as big as for the whole of the UK or Germany or India. Also there are much smaller health networks that have less than 20 hospitals and so they have even less bargaining power.</p>
<p>On top of that hospitals will have their 'price' and their PRICE, for the insurance company. So they will give a 'price' of $2000, but then the insurance company will say &quot;We will only pay $200&quot; then you pay your copay. </p>
<p>And finally, and obviously, they are companies run for profit and so there is a mark up. So the healthcare network buys the Codeine for $40 each packet and marks  it up (using the price they actually would sell for in our hypothetic hospital) $250, you can't do anything because you need it, they have policies, and you have no clue on the prices. They only tell you the price after you use the product.</p>
<p>(these hypothetical prices are not actual prices, just demonstrations of what occurs. I will never have to pay these prices as I always make sure I have travel insurance, and anyone from outside the US, please always do the same)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. My favorite example, as an RN Case Manager, is diabetes. In my state at least, having diabetes does not automatically qualify a patient for Medicaid or any type of public assistance. So many working poor and/or uninsured diabetic patients are unable to afford their insulins, blood glucose testing supplies, and copays for primary care appointments and specialists.</p>
<p>But when having poorly-controlled diabetes leads to kidney failure in some of those patients and they end up on dialysis, they qualify for Medicare and probably disability payments after a very short waiting period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a guy online with that issue. </p>
<p>his life pretty much fell apart starting with the death of his partner, and fell into medical debt and eventually homelessness.</p>
<p>insulin is expensive, hard to store if you're homeless, and requires a prescription.</p>
<p>so instead of just getting insulin, he would be taken to the ER whenever he had a seizure or other issues only to be given minimal life-saving care and sent on his way.</p>
<p>you can imagine the impact it had on his health and ability to financially recover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the reasons Americans pay so much. For what we all pay, we could just do the simple thing and cover everybody.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Mother was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes in 1976, 1996 started more severe complications. Could not afford testing supplies (unable to obtain health insurance + working poor). Finally obtained Medicare through disability (1997) and was able to control diabetes because she can now obtain reasonably priced testing supplies and seek out specialists that got her in a better insulin regimen. It helps now, just doesn't reverse any of the damage done. </p>
<p>If she would have been able to obtain better treatment to manage her diabetes, it is likely that she could have continued to work instead of getting on disability and Medicare at age 46. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am type 1 diabetic. Can confirm. AFAIK, I don't take much insulin compared to other people yet it would still cost $600/month for insulin/syringes/test strips (if uninsured). You are also supposed to see a doctor every 3 months to test A1C (to make sure you are doing OK, it is like a 3 month average of your blood sugar levels).</p>
<p>The average american household makes 51k/year. So the average individual makes about 25.5k/year. This means the average person would spend about 28% of his/her income just on prescriptions. Poverty level is about 11k, so more than half of their income goes towards prescriptions.</p>
<p>I can't imagine trying to live with cancer or aids or anything like that.</p></div>		</li>
