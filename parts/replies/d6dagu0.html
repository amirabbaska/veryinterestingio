<p>Do scientists get directly paid for publishing,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, you have to pay the journal to publish once the manuscript is accepted. The amount paid varies widely, especially in response to the funding model of the journal (some carry ads, some have subscriptions, some supported by scientific societies or granting agencies, some by publication fees alone).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does it just increase the likelihood of getting paid for other things? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Totally. Publications are the prestige currency of an academic career. If you're not published, it's very difficult to get an academic job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do scientific journals make money?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It varies, see above</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don't journals want to publish replication studies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, most view it as boring and not &quot;novel&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely a prestige element involved.  Journals are often compared by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor" target="_blank">impact factor</a>, which is the average number of citations per paper published in that journal in the last two years.  Replication studies are unlikely to be cited, particularly as they don't motivate new research, so a journal would have no desire to publish them since they would harm the journal's impact factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both actually. There is a prestige element between journals and those with a highwe prestige will have more subscribers (universities willing to pay so their staff can read the articles) thus making more money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume it is the same as having clickbate on a website. The more &quot;hits&quot; the journal gets, the more ad revenue it brings in or subscriptions it generates. </p>
<p>I'm not calling novel studies clickbate, just that it acts the same way in that it garners more attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less, most publishers are international in scope. There are some niche markets (some researchers in my field publish in Russian journals), but for the most part everyone operates within the same system. </p>
<p>There are places where a high-profile publication will get you a sizeable raise, so there is an incentive on the researchers' side there, though I haven't heard of this practice in Western countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So of the 4 funding models I mentioned, ads and subscriptions probably wouldn't work because no one reads replications. You'd need some kind of institutional support, like grants or from societies. You could otherwise have authors pay to publish, but I don't think you'd want to further disincentivize the researchers. </p>
<p>I'd start by looking at <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/02/if-you-fail-reproduce-another-scientist-s-results-journal-wants-know" target="_blank">this new journal</a> for their business model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists don't get paid directly for publishing.</p>
<p>Some journals like Nature earn money from subscription fees. Other journals like PLOS One charge a per page fee from the researchers to publish the paper, often color figures will also have a fee. Adverts are also a source of income.</p>
<p>Journals don't publish replication studies because replication studies aren't often cited, unless they completely falsify the first study. Journals want to be cited as much as possible because it raises the impact factor of the journal, which raises the profitability of the journal (more subscribers or more researchers who submit papers and want to pay the fees).</p>
<p>Researchers don't do replication studies because they often don't get cited, and researchers want to be cited because it raises their market value and makes it easier to get funding and better faculty positions (and not get fired). Replication studies are also very difficult to get funded because funding agencies are looking to fund studies that are innovative and expand our knowledge, not merely confirm what we already &quot;know&quot;.</p>
<p>In other words, only when a published study seems clearly wrong for what ever reasons (like claiming participants can predict the future), is it likely that researchers will perform a replication study to falsify the first paper and manage to get it published. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the economics of scientific publishing and journals? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All are owned by a small group of cartel publishers. They essentially got both researchers and research institutions by the balls because of the &quot;publish or perish&quot; nature of scientific research. Scientists need to read and publish papers at whatever cost, and the universities need scientists so they end up paying virtually any price.</p>
<p>Derek has already given some solutions to the lack of quality control in research, but I think the major driving force behind all this garbage is the idea that scientists/institutions MUST publish in order to be successful or get a PhD or funding and so on. </p></div>		</li>
