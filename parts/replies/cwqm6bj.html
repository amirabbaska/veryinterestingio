			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are putting to much emphasis on the grip-tape and friction. To the point where i would say your explanation is misleading actually.</p>
<p>The vertical movement comes from the pivot motion made by stomping the tail end downwards. Picture this, You put a board down on a rock, one of the ends of the board will likely touch the ground and the other will point up in to the air, right. Now, if you stomp the end of the board that is pointing up in to the air, the board is gonna pivot against the rock and shoot up in to the air. This is what makes it fly. </p>
<p>on a skateboard the pivot is the &quot;truck&quot; and wheels instead of a rock.</p>
<p>Then you use the friction of the grip tape and the front foot to level it out mid air (or rather when it's on it's way up) so it travels parallel to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking at this video the back of the board is up well before the front foot starts moving forward. That forward movement brings it level yes. </p>
<p>The back foot kicks the front of the board upwards, then lifts off. The front of the board continues upward and now the back off the board gets pulled along because it is no longer held by the weight of the back foot. So now the whole board is moving upwards.</p>
<p>Then the front foot moves forwards leveling the board and raising the back even higher, as you've indicated, but the back was already off the ground by that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you'll probably need to buy a decent skateboard. That will set you back quite a bit of $.  I just started getting into it (I'm 27). Get a good deck ($30-40), Independent Trucks ($40), Wheels ($15), Bearings ($15), and good grip tape ($12). Sure you could get a blank board for $20, cheap tape for around $5, and cheap trucks/wheels/bearings, but you'll just be replacing and buying better stuff down the road.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>woaaahhhhhh my video is getting all reddited, thanks guys! (also ashomsky is really cool too! I see his video getting passed around here!)</p>
<p>But yeah that's pretty much it.   It's really all about popping (aka: smacking) the end of the board super hard so the front part can go up, and you use the other foot to level it out on the other end.  Kinda like a see-saw.</p>
<p>The other neat thing is the harder you hit, the more the board sticks with your feet.  Like, have you ever thrown a shirt or something at a wall?  If you throw it really soft, it slides off; if you throw it really hard, the shirt will &quot;stick&quot; on the wall for a bit.  When you &quot;pop&quot; down super hard, the board &quot;sticks&quot; with your feet a bit&quot;, which helps get ollies loads higher.  </p>
<p>But for the skater doing the ollie, the ollie is 1000x more complex than just &quot;kicking down hard&quot;.  It turns out that the higher you get your ollie (or any trick you want high), the more strict your technique and timing must be.  Low ollies are pretty easy, but high ollies involve perfection in your foot movements to be able to control the board correctly.  So that can take a few years to master.</p>
<p>Just some neat info!</p>
<p>I could make this into a more physics-y post because that's pretty much my college degree, but I'm lazy and this is ELI5 lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are missing another huge factor. If you kick the end of a skateboard hard with no one standing on it, the entire board will fly into the air (You can actually make it fly pretty fucking high). It won't just do a wheelie. When you ollie, you use the same amount of force to 'pop' the board as high into the air as you can, the griptape and foot placement is just a means to control it while it's in the air, under your feet. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is way more of a factor than the grip tape. I wish someone explained ollieing like this to me when I started. Everyone always said its the front foot dragging it up but really you're just getting it out of the way of your initial pop and then controlling it with that foot. I started explaining to people that ollieing is just jumping with your back foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember to be quick about getting your back foot off the board as fast as your can after the pop.  That will be what stops you from getting the board into the air and will be what determines how high you go to a degree.</p>
