			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate on that last part? How the mechanical action of washing our skin is the most effective? Is that because of friction? Or the water washing things off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both. Soap kills the bacteria by breaking the cells open and spilling their &quot;guts&quot; out onto your hand. Friction removes the lysed cells, stubborn cells with slime layers, and spores off of your hand, and water rinses it all away. For example, when you scrub into surgery, you have to scrub all the way up to your forearms and then let water rinse from fingers to your elbows, so your hands are left as sterile as possible before being gloved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that when I first started in the optics industry grinding and polishing telescope mirrors for the same reason. </p>
<p>We weren't worried about organic contamination. We were very concerned about dust though. Don't want to scratch that 12&quot; telescope mirror when you're polishing, set you back a couple weeks to polish it out or worst case have to go back to fine grind then re-polish from scratch /shudder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study done a number of years ago (I want to say Duke University) that said just what you thought: the friction of rubbing your hands together did more than the soap you put on your hands. In effect, the hand rubbing cleaned your hands while the soap made your hands smell like you cleaned them for peace of mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works exactly how you think it would, you don't nessecarily have to kill a bacteria if you literally washed it away.</p>
<p>Bear in mind your skin is somewhat ablative with dead skin so scrubbing scrubs dead skin off, with the soap lifting oils that might trap bacteria, and water rinsing it all away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think of ot this way. If you jumped into a huge oven at 500 degrees,  youd be dead in seconds.   You would also die if you sat in a 200 degree room for an hour.   </p>
<p>When they say cook chicken to 180. They are saying that 180 kills all the germs in less than a minute.  Or you can sous vide it to 150 for 2 hours and still kill all the germs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a hospital and I do 2 costs of alcohol sanitizer: 1 I put on &amp; scrub until dry. The 2nd I use to coat my hands and just leave it to work until it evaporates. Not great for my skin, but thatâ€™s not what this is all about now is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll put it this way, when we do a daily decon of our BSCs it's 5 minutes strong base, 5 minutes bleach, a wash with water, then 5 minutes with 70% ethanol.</p>
<p>We still don't consider it clean after that. If the hood needs to be decomissioned and/or leave the lab there's an additional protocol that decons it in a special tent with gaseous formaldehyde for 24 hours before another mechanical cleaning to remove the chemical.</p>
<p>Overkill? Probably, but that's what it takes to get a proper decontamination.</p></div>		</li>
