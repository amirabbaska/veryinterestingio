			<div class="markdown"><p>Now we'd have to argue &quot;WAS Pluto a planet?&quot; And then we will start an arms race to see who can first destroy a planet. The Pluto Slayers will claim they were first, and we will start a war that will destroy Earth. The few survivors in space will then fight to the death over whether it was Pluto or Earth to be the first planet destroyed.</p>
<p>I guess you're right. It WOULD stop all the arguments!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, no, no. Pluto's mass is very small relative to the rest of the solar system (especially the Sun). It would change some orbits slightly, but probably only very small objects (minor planets). And Jupiter's movement wouldn't cause further perturbation - it would just cause a springlike effect where things would wobble back and forth a bit and eventually settle into place. </p>
<p>I don't really think it would have a noticeable effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto is very small and very distant. It's gravitational influence in the solar system is entirely negligible.</p>
<p>Numerically, it makes up a fraction of <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=mass+of+pluto+%2F+mass+of+solar+system" target="_blank">6.6*10^-9</a> of the total solar system mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could bump some other object in the Kuiper Belt into a collision course with it.  Basically, crash a comet into Pluto and see what happens.  It might take a few hundred years and a few trillion dollars though, and if we were going to go through that much trouble, we may as well use the technology to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1poq1h/a_comet_may_collide_with_mars_next_year_which/cd4g5pj" target="_blank">terraform Mars</a>.</p></div>		</li>
