			<div class="markdown"><p>Zoo's are actually doing lots of awesome things to avoid inbreeding. The amount of reproductive management that goes into choosing breeding pairs is astounding. </p>
<p>One of the most promising technologies is cryopreservation and artificial insemination, because then you don't have to worry about incompatible breeding pairs or all the problems that came happen with shipping animals. However, there's still a lot of research that has to be done because there's a lot of species differences with sperm (on the molecular level), and, as a result, some semen is more sensitive to freezing than other species. I had an internship at a zoo and that was the main research project I contributed to. </p>
<p>I actually got to analyze semen from an old, inbred male (I think his inbreeding coefficient was like .25, which means he was likely the result of a mating between siblings) and his semen was all fucked up under the microscope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The short answer is that you do see inbreeding depression manifest itself in animals just as frequently, in fact more frequently, than in humans  </p></div>		</li>
