<p>This brings us to relevant bit number one. The phone doesn't run on 5V 1-2A directly, it runs on the battery, which is less than 5V. To run directly on the 5V input the manufacturer would have needed to plan ahead, which costs money, so most don't.</p>

<p>This is <strong><em>extremely wrong</em></strong>. all phones that use a USB input have a system for doing that.</p>

<p>Power goes into the phone that is then used to power said phone , with any excess power that is not used to power the phone is then used to charge the battery. Running the phone off of wall power is first priority , charging is second. </p>

<p>The  components <strong>do not run off of variable battery voltage</strong> (which is 4.2v - 3.0v normally btw). All integreted circits have a set input voltage or input range (usually 5v, 3.3v, or 1.8v) , which they require exactly, so there are complex systems that provide these voltages depend less of  what the battery voltage is</p>
<p>all systems have complex power managment to make sure voltage is in the expected range and USB power is filtered since the usb spec is actually 5v +/- 0.25v</p>
<p>All  PMIC circuits have these: </p>

<p>the only time usb equipment would have this is for cheap 5 dollar shit, not a phone</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the answer is it depends. It possible to run right off the charger, but it's cheaper and easier to pass through the battery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing through the battery is a misleading way to describe this.   The current passes through various switches and protection circuits for the battery.  But if the battery is at 100%, and is neither charging nor discharging, the current going to power the phone does not flow through the battery cell itself.  There's a T connection, with the power source from the wall, through charging circuitry, on the left, the battery at the bottom and the phone on the right.  The current in the two top wires is equal and the current in the battery is zero. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My LG G4 actually lights up(screen) when the charger is in but not the battery. And there is a picture which says something in line with put in the battery... Can't start it though. Only turn on and off the screen </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's the third point. It's quite common in modern devices that still have removable batteries.</p></div>		</li>
