<p>Tldr: Diffusion plays virtually no role. It moves with the current so the time depends entirely on how quickly the current is flowing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is heavily dependent on a number of factors, namely, the direction and strength of the ocean current (look up fluid 'advection'), and the turbulence in the water which will lead to 'diffusion'. The influence of these factors (and other unmentioned ones such as wind/waves) is also dependent on how high in the water column the blood is located (ie. at the surface or towards the seabed).</p>
<p>Just as a super generic example, typical ocean current speeds in the north sea are between 0.5 and 1m/s. So 1litre (or any given quantity or blood) would take 27-54mins to travel 1mile (1.6km). Obviously this does not account for diffusion, but I suspect current would be the driving factor.</p></div>		</li>
