			<div class="markdown"><p>It does seem plausible that the nuclear bomb triggered an earthquake <em>early</em>, but not caused one.</p>
<p>Going by the numbers, the impact of a nuclear weapon test seems to be negligible relative to the power of ordinary tectonic forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well even if they tested once per year and it's a few days window after the test that gives a ~%1 chance of the incidents appearing to be correlated. Not a very huge probability but not 'winning the lottery' level of improbability either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As always, the key part is that if it didn't happen - nobody would be talking about it.</p>
<p>In isolation things like this have a low probability of occurring - but the chance of any single thing happening world-wide that would seem &quot;curiously coincidental&quot; is extremely high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They don't have a lot of earthquakes in South Korea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5.4 is very powerful if the region does not have a lot of earthquakes. For example, the effects felt from a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in LA County would not be as powerful as a 5.4 magnitude earthquake in Minnesota.</p></div>		</li>
