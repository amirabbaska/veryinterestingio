			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the smell differs based on location or diet. When I visit family in Puerto rico they have the old person smell but also the smell of Spanish food. Thing is I know what the Spanish food smells like but I don't know what the old person smell is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smell in the food that may be smelled on clothing/skin may be Cumin- which is also used in Indian foods. </p>
<p>Older grannies may smell strongly of this because grannies cook the best food. </p>
<p>This strong smell of food based origin, which may include garlic, recao, and saz√≥n- combined with the traditional &quot;old people smell&quot; may make for a unique combination.</p>
<p>Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One study suggested that old person smell may be the result of 2-nonenal, an unsaturated aldehyde which is associated with human body odor alterations during aging;[3] however, there are other hypotheses.[4] Another study failed to detect 2-nonenal at all, but found significantly increased concentrations of benzothiazole, dimethylsulphone, and nonanal on older subjects.[5]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who are basically clueless like to prattle on about chemical changes in the skin as you get older blah blah blah and I swear its because they've all read the same bullshit and have no real idea whether it is true - just trying to be 'iamverysmart'. </p>
<p>&quot;Old man smell&quot; really comes down to two things - poor hygiene (e.g., infrequent bathing, brushing/flossing, unwashed clothes, maybe adult diapers) and the use of outdated products (e.g., cologne, hair oil, mothballs, etc.). I've unfortunately known a lot of old people that are just damned lazy, slobby, and oblivious to how nasty their personal environment is and how bad they smell. Sometimes this comes down to dementia or a physical impairment that makes it difficult to keep up - but often its just people can be disgusting bitches.</p>
<p>I've also known plenty of older people who are careful about their housekeeping, personal grooming, dress, and activity and they don't smell like anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it can be a combination of practical things like you mention and whatever chemical changes. </p>
<p>Not sure why you seem so sour on the chemical changes. Looks like it's been studied. Not like the &quot;basically clueless&quot; people made it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot to mention the most important factor. As we age our senses diminish. This includes our olfactory sense. So they dont notice that they are stinky. This is why old ladies so often tend to overload on overpowering perfume. They dont realize they put too much on because they can hardly smell it. </p></div>		</li>
