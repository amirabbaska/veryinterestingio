			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the cup shape of the toy does a good job of creating a low pressure space via Bernoulli's effect. The limited volume of air you're able to push through the hole is moving along the top surface of the ball and out where the edge of the cup is, acting on a large surface area with a small change in pressure. You can see the ball is &quot;trying&quot; to fall but that small change in pressure keeps sucking it back in! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We studied this in my fluid dynamics class with a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qzUdHjj.png" target="_blank">playing card and a flat-bottomed spool of thread</a> (you blow through the middle hole). Conservation of mass dictates that the air entering from that center hole is moving faster than the air leaving around the edges. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j2hK9Q2.png" target="_blank">Like this.</a> The pressure of the moving air stream as it exits HAS to be equal to atmospheric (or very close). Since the air at the center is moving faster than the air at the edges, it has a lower pressure. Therefore, you have a spot of LOW pressure on top of the card, and atmospheric pressure holds the card up to the spool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this makes sense, and was considering this idea, although you articulated much better than me. The only issue I had, was I then did this same test using a piece of paper, and the paper was also able to stay held up. How do you explain this? I showed the paper being held up like this toward the end of my original video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper has a similar problem: air moves along the surface, past the small space between the end of the cup and the piece of paper. The small hole stops enough air getting in to increase the pressure above the paper, and the moving air creates a low pressure zone over the surface that's covered by the cup, and probably even the surface of the paper that's just outside the cup. The paper flutters as the air moves past it, trying to fall. Every time it tries, the extra space allows more air to escape from the cup, decreasing the air pressure on the top surface of the paper.  This forces the paper back up against the cup. The cycle repeats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a simple Bernoulli effect, or else blow guns wouldn't work.</p>
<p>I left a comment here which explains what's happening:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't accurate. If you put a ball in a regular tube and blow, the ball flies out. After all, people have used blow guns for thousands of years. The key is the pinhole. I have a top-level comment which explains it, but I quote below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your toy is basically a nozzle. When flow is forced through a small hole like that, the pressure drops dramatically. It's not a simple venturi effect, either, there are actually losses to the flow because nozzle like that creates a lot of turbulence, which quickly dissipates energy through viscous effects. This is useful, because the pressure stays low on the other side of the restriction, instead of recovering as it would for a venturi device.</p>
<p>The object stutters because it's unsteady. The drop in pressure depends on how much flow there is. When the ball restricts the flow, the pressure rises, which makes the ball fall, which then raises the pressure.</p>
<p>Simple flow restrictors like that are commonly used when there's a need to drop the pressure of a flow. There's a piece like that in your refrigerator, and that little 75-cent piece is crucial to the operation of the whole device. Forcing the refrigerant through the nozzle drops the pressure and causes it to evaporate, also dropping the temperature.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, followup here.  I watched the video and immediately thought the same thing (low pressure area around the ping pong ball caused by the flowing air), but then the paper was a little more counter-intuitive.  If there's a large, flat object, like a piece of paper, it seems like the air would necessarily force the object away from the cup, since the airflow pattern is blocked by the capped cup.<br />
Basically, I can visualize the ping pong ball scenario with the air as a liquid - I have a harder time doing it with the paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to be the same phenomenon to me.</p>
<p>The air pushes against the paper, moving it just a little bit away from the toy. Then, to escape and continue moving, the air flows parallel to the paper, creating a low pressure region on the top. The higher air pressure below the paper holds it against the toy, ev, n if the blown air pushes it down.</p>
<p>The amount of air he can blow through the hole is very small, and the area of the hole is much smaller than the area where it actually hits the paper. So, it seems that the pressure pushing the paper down is very small. The force pushing the paper down is proportional to how much air he can actually blow through that small hole.</p>
<p>Conversely, the air escaping on the sides, parallel to the paper, can move very fast, scaping from the very small gap between the paper and the toy. Bernoulli effect is proportional to the air speed. So, the drop in pressure on the top of the paper can be big. </p>
<p>If the hole was thicker, than the blown pressure would be enough to push the paper away before a substantial lift from the Bernoulli effect gets established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess that the tiny hole is the main factor in all of this. If it were a solid pipe (no tiny hole in the middle), this experiment would have acted as expected (ping pong ball shot out of tube, blows paper away). My guess the tiny hole is causing the air blown through it to create a lower pressure zone, influencing the air beside it to be pulled towards it. Due to it's size, the amount of air passing through it probably doesn't create enough force to push the paper away, resulting the air to be pushed to the side and out between the gaps between the paper and toy. At the same time, because of the constant pressure difference of the blown air, the static air is drawn back into the toy. So I imagine there is a vortex spinning beside the blown air spinning down near the center (where the air is blown) and spinning upwards toward the side that is causing the entire pressure inside the toy to be lower than outside, thus resulting in the paper to be drawn towards it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, the tiny hole is the key.. how small it is itself doesnt matter, but how small it is compared to the pipe does.. liquid (air) in a pipe will have the same sum of pressure and speed before a narrowing, as after.. as the speed greatly increases through the small hole, the pressure does the opposite.. with a larger hole, the speed of the air would not increase as much and a less negative pressure would be the result</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Notice the fluttering of the paper.  Flutter is caused by rapidly changing and oscillating air pressure.  If the paper were stiffer, it would fall away from the tube (no oscillation).  If the paper were damp, it would fall away from the tube (too heavy).  The paper appears just stiff and light enough to support flutter.</p></div>		</li>
