			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, great explanation. One remaining question, though. How are lasers able to remain impervious to the distortions in spacetime? Doesn't the speed of light depend on the medium that it's in? Why doesn't the light from the laser distort along with the matter of the laser interferometer, resulting in no detection?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The interferometer itself is just a laser and a beam splitter and some mirrors hanging in a vacuum. There is no medium to affect the light. The speed of light in a vacuum is absolute, and not affected by the waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no <em>matter</em> to affect the light; you're right. But vacuum or no, there's still <em>space</em> inside the interferometer. What I'm asking is why the distortions in spacetime don't affect the laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole facility is in a vacuum, and the whole point of the facility is for the laser to be distorted by the changes in space-time - so that the lasers no longer cancel each other out. (Speed of light is constant in all reference frames!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if one arm of the interferometer distorts while the other doesn't, why doesn't the light traveling down the first (distorted) arm also distort in a complementary way such that both lasers return at the same time and negatively interfere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but they are very small. The signal Ligo found was from 2 black holes crashing into each other. The waves this created had an amplitude (height) of half the diameter of a proton. </p></div>		</li>
