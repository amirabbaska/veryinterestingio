			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting theory but nystagmus is not a vibrating effect. It is the eyes straying in a consistent direction and snapping back to center as your brain realizes that is not actually moving. In the case of intoxication, it has to do with specific gravity changes in the middle ear. The eyes are trying to compensate for perceived movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in a pretty bad motorcycle accident. I wore a helmet. A couple of weeks after, my right pupil grew very big and was stuck that way, I went to the ER and the Doctor had me follow her finger from side to side and to my surprise my eyes stuttered pretty bad. It was a little painful and made me dizzy when it happened. The doctor concluded I had a bad concussion. It can happen without any alcohol at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, nystagmus can have many causes. I was simply answering the question re: alcohol. Interestingly in the case of head injury nystagmus associated with vertigo, middle ear pathology is again suspected. An otolith may be knocked into the wrong place in the semicircular canal, look up BPPV.  If this is the case it can be fixed by a physical treatment or may simply resolve over time as the crystal disintigrates.</p></div>		</li>
