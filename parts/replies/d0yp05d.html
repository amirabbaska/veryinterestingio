			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah nah fuck that. I'm an adult, but if I need to vomit then I'm going to vomit. Feeling nauseous for ages is way worse than getting a quick vomit out of the way.</p>
<p>Then again, I had food poisoning recently so I'm fairly biased towards not wanting to feel nauseous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was up at the hospital with either gastro or something. I vomited between 8-10 times total, but only about 2 of those times came without a finger down the throat.</p>
<p>I was so nauseous the other 8 times that I had to make it happen though.</p>
<p>Good god the sweet relief after puking for 20-30 minutes was like nothing else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally find vomiting much more preferable to feeling nauseous. Whether caused by over-eating, excessive drinking or illness. After you vomit your stomach feels relieved. If you're drunk it wakes you up. If you're over-full you feel lighter and relieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally i cant vomit even if i try. Drank way too much once and tried to vomit and still couldn't.</p>
<p>Got sick last year (flu) and after trying not to for ages i threw up and it put me into atrial fibrillation. Not just did the resting heart rate of ~ 180 suck but so did the defib shock they used to put my heart back into rhythm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel even worse after vomiting, especially if I'm hungover. So I do everything in my power not to vomit unless it's absolutely necessary.</p></div>		</li>
