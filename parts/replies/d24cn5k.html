			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that's the case but don't have any experience with it. Is there a governing body that inspects animal hospitals? If so I would check through their regulations to see what they require. Also, just because it's not required doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. It is pretty expensive though. However it's a safety issue and regular preventative maintenance will keep the equipment running longer.</p></div>		</li>
