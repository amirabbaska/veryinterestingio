			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. It does not work.  Set up an experiment and test it.
If it did work then stainless steel pots and pans would remove the odor and flavor of garlic and onions. Which they donâ€™t </p>
<p>Interestingly there has not been a published paper on the effectiveness of these products. Either for or against. But it is very easy to test for yourself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, after trying to get musk turtle scent off my hands for like 15 minutes with any soap I could find it went down much much quicker with just the stainless bar and water.  Kid self was floored as I thought it was BS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do a test. Get 5 friends, put smelly stuff on hands. Wash with one of the 3 methods, Water, water + soap, water + Metal. Have them sniff, then reapply and repeat. Find out which removed the scent best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like, but then one needs at least two friends who want smells applied to them, and 4 who can meet up at once! I'll keep it in the back of my mind for when the opportunity presents itself. </p></div>		</li>
