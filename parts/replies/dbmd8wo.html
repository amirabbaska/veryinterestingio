<p>By curiosity, do objects getting colder and colder produce less and less light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the amount of light depends on the Temperature^4. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law" target="_blank">As described by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Btw.</p>
<p>Very interesting,  one of the few algebraic natural laws that doesn't follow a square curve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if by &quot;less light&quot; you mean &quot;light at a lower frequency&quot;.</p>

<p>The human body is not hot enough to emit visible light, but it is hot enough to emit infrared light, which is why you cannot see people in the dark, but you can with an infrared detector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the amount of radiation (light) produced is only dependent on the current temperature of an object, so once it starts cooling down again it glows less visibly, and less overall</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it, but I want to emphasize (and tl;dr) that white hot IS emitting greens and blues. But also still all the colors &quot;below&quot; blue. And if you mix all the colors you end up with white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify the above post -- if you add all the colours <em>in roughly equal proportions</em> you get white.</p>
<p>'Blue stars' are so hot that most of their radiation is in ultraviolet frequencies, and they have more 'blue' light than 'red' or 'yellow' or 'green'.</p>
<p>That said, the naming of stars intentionally exaggerates the colour differences. The sun (a yellow star) is yellow<em>ish</em>, and blue stars are blu<em>ish</em> -- but they're both closer to white than to 'pure' yellow/blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does it make it white? If I mix a bunch of colors in a paint can, it just turns into a gross brown. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because light sources emit light, while paints absorb light. A red light source emits just red light, and thus appears red to you. A red paint reflects red light and absorbs all other light, thus appearing red to you. When you mix light sources, it corresponds to white light to you, but if you mix paint, it absorbs more of the light spectrum and appears brown/black when you see whats reflected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White light is all the colors while black is the absence of colors</p>
<p>For paint to appear a color it reflects the color it is seen as better than the others (white reflects all colors black absorbs all colors)</p>
<p>When you combine a bunch of paints it gets closer and closer to black because all of the different paints absorb different colors of light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paint or pigments, are a color because they absorb all the other colors and reflect back the specific combinations of light that make us perceive them as &quot;red&quot;
If you mix all the pigments you get black. Or if imperfectly mixed some nasty brown.</p>
<p>If an object reflects or EMITS every color will appear white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also true for the colour of a star, the hotter the star is the higher energy light it emits. So allthough commen meterals on earth won't globe in those colours, there is a place in the universe that does.</p>
