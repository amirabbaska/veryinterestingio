			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to get into an AA meeting so I can have some logical help with this. I've cut down from 2 gallons of vodka a week, to just 1 gallon... But the result is still the same. I can't stop... the shakes make it so I can't stop. But I'm definitely improving. I used to get black out drunk nightly, now I'm just getting the shakes to go away. Fuck this shit. No one around me understands and gives me shit advice. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Call SAMHSA at 1-800-662-HELP or:</p>
<p>www.samhsa.gov</p>
<p>This is national substance abuse help line, they'll direct you what to do better.  (This is in the States)</p>
<p>It's 24/7/365 from what I gathered.</p>
<p>AA is great and all but they handle more of the emotional/spiritual side of alcoholism where as you need to address the physical dependency as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason no one understands you and provides shit advice is because they are likely different than you or I. Most people completely misunderstand alcoholism. As you probably know, the alcoholic is different both bodily and mentally.</p>
<p>You should go to an AA meeting ASAP. You will find people just like you who can show you how they acheived permanent sobriety. You will receive help from another recovered alcoholic, who can provide help no one else can.</p>
<p>Yes, you WILL need to medically detox. It will take 3-5 days. Many people find it benificial to seek ongoing professional care. Whatever works for them. However, the best human help you may receive can come from another alcoholic. </p>
<p>AA was founded by alcoholics who professionals deemed doomed until they took up a spiritual plan of action. Many of us have found a simple solution to all of the issues of our lives and have found much of heaven.</p>
<p>It seems you may be approaching that crossroads. Many of your questions can be better answered at an AA meeting, where you will be welcomed with open arms. You can then detox and start working one on one with another alcoholic on our simple plan of action. Just go to a meeting, raise your hand, and ask for help.</p>
<p>Most of us have lives and families we must attend to while we start down the road to a better life. I had a business to run and moved out of my house and into a halfway after detox. With a little prayer and help, it shouldn't be too much of an interruption. Your employer will likely understand and, in many states, you are protected if you seek treatment. You are spiritualy and medically sick,you need to seek treatment. Detox takes only a few days and you can work on recovery on your time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're quitting cold-turkey. . .yes.</p>
<p>You can, however safely taper down over several weeks and not risk the life-threatening situation of acute alcohol withdrawal. For many, this isn't an option for everyone, as it takes some self-control to consume fewer and fewer drinks each day, but for some it can be the best option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how chronic your abuse is and how heavily you drink. Symptoms of withdrawal aren’t a good sign - like heavy shaking without drinking. </p>
<p>Shorter term or lighter drinkers can go cold turkey. </p>
<p>If you aren’t sure which you are, consult your doctor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy's stepdad just quit cold turkey a few months back... temporarily lost his (short term I guess?) memory, basically reverted back to 4 years ago where he thought he still had a job- which he'd actually lost due to DUI. He was having hallucinations, too. He also stopped eating, so he he was dehydrated and malnourished and had to spend a few weeks in the hospital...they think he stopped eating and drinking due to some stomach pain. His memory is still recovering. Edit: for spelling and I forgot about the hallucinations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If someone wants to roll those dice, that's on them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start of the explanation was good but the end result is incorrect. Withdrawal seizures are rarely a cause of death and almost always self-terminate. Cause of death during withdrawal is usually cardiac arrest from arrhythmia due to uncountered sympathic activity which is compounded by hypovolemia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cardiac arrest = heart stops
Arrhythmia = funny abnormal heart rhythm that sometimes stops the muscular pump that is the heart from beating in a coordinated fashion - leads to insufficient blood flow to important things and by extension insufficient oxygen delivery and waste clearance.
Sympathetic drive = the part of the nervous system (brain and nerves and spinal cord) responsible for “fight or flight” response
Hypovolemua = too little volume in the body I.e. dehydration in this context (can also mean hemorrhage, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Withdrawal seizures are rarely a cause of death and almost always stop by themselves. Cause of death during withdrawal is usually the heart stopping from an abnormal heart rhythm (like the heart beating super, super fast) due to the body flooding with adrenaline (the fight or flight response), which is made worse by being dehydrated.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re correct, I guess I never followed through on the “why it kills you” rather just stopped after explaining why seizures are bad, which for the vast majority of patients with severe symptoms of withdrawal is what they experience. </p>
<p>Thanks for the correction/addendum!</p>
<p>Although if we are being fair, you would be correct to say that cardiac arrest causes death from every potential cause, sort of by definition. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, excessive seizures can cause a condition called rhabdomyolysis. This occurs when you have excessive muscle movement that actually breaks down and ruptures the muscle cells. The contents in these cells then enter the bloodstream and have a nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys) effect that can cause acute kidney failure. This kidney failure further impairs the body's way to get rid of waste products and can cause electrolyte (potassium, sodium, calcium etc) imbalances that can have critical consequences. </p></div>		</li>
