<p>Anosmics can taste quite well -- nothing missing there. But they cannot experience flavor.</p>

<p>I don't understand this quote.</p>
<p>Personally, I've experienced a loss of sense of taste twice. Once after I was sick I couldn't taste anything for about a month. Didn't have impaired sense of smell.</p>
<p>More recently I stopped being able to taste chocolate (only). It's been about four years but it's starting to finally come back, I think. Again no impaired sense of smell. </p>
<p>I went to a couple of doctors for this and neither of them could find anything wrong with me. But I think I may have a nerve condition that may explain it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anosmia is the loss of the sense of smell. Smell is how you perceive flavor. Taste specifically refers to how salty, sweet, acidic or bitter something is. Taste is something you sense using sensors on your tongue.</p>
<p>So someone with anosmia will be able to tell you food is salty, sweet, acidic or bitter, but that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anosmiacs (hi! congenital here) can only taste sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami.  So we can distinguish between foods, an apple does not taste like a steak. We can't detect flavorings for the most part though. The best example I can give is that all Starburst flavors taste the same. Skittles are the same way, and we can't detect herbs at all. I've noticed that the flavours I can pick up on aren't close to what they're supposed to be at all, cherry and blackberry flavours don't taste like cherries and blackberries, they don't even taste fruity. </p>
<p>Congenital anosmiacs are really good at picking up on tastes in food so we don't feel like we're really missing out on tasting. However, anosmiacs that lose their sense of smell later in life often feel like all food is bland and has no taste anymore as they are not as tuned in on tasting just <del>flavour</del>taste. </p>

<p>You could smell chocolate but you couldn't taste it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. For example, I make chocolate milk with chocolate powder. When I open the lid of the container, a wonderful chocolate smell wafts out. But the chocolate milk itself tastes like nothing I can describe in terms of flavor - only that it's clearly different than plain milk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do dysgeusia and anosmia have anything in common with regards to smell and taste?</p>
<p>I once had <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/wellbeing/lifecoach/9223843/Life-coach-What-is-causing-the-bitter-taste-in-my-mouth.html" target="_blank">pine nut syndrome</a> after a delicious Lebanese meal. For about a week everything I ate or drank tasted like bitter dirt. It looks like itâ€™s a common but unexplained occurrence of dysgeusia. </p></div>		</li>
