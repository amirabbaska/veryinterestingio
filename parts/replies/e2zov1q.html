			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, apparently antibodies can be transferred to babies via breast-milk. So a mother's immune system can, to a small degree, help the baby's immune system while they are infants by being exposed to antigens babies have, and producing antibodies to match and then pass on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a specific type of antibody (IgA) is transferred through the breast milk and helps bridge the gap between passive immunity from antibodies passed to the baby in utero (IgG) and the babies own adaptive immunity, which isn’t sufficient for several months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y'all three got it right, I think. I also learned this in my one of my neurobiology courses (for some reason) and again in animal behavior and I still remember it being one of the coolest things. Effectively the mother kisses the infant and becomes exposed to the environment and antigens present, then magic through the breast milk creates some level of imunity. Crazy shenanigans indeed. Breast feed and vaccinate your children. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but does that mean that vaccines the mother has gotten can also affect the baby?  If so, that's pretty cool since it sounds to me it's like evolution, but evolution that people can participate in in their lifetimes and not over millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is getting to be outside my on-hand knowledge.  I believe it is only a specific kind of the 5 main kinds of antibodies (IgA?) that transfers.  But if a vaccine (or an immunity from a recently contracted virus) effects the creation of those kinds of antibodies, I would assume so.</p>
<p>I think there is also a different type of antibody that makes its way to the baby through the umbilical cord that would likewise confer an inherited immunity for the first several weeks or maybe months of the baby's life. But I just don't recall at the moment.</p>
<p>Hopefully somebody else can give you a more certain answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes me wonder if people that kissed other people had better reproductive fitness and therefore survived to pass their genes.</p>
<p>People that kiss would have more exposure to different antigens and would thus have a more robust immune system than non kissers and would be more likely to survive.</p>
<p>Also I don't know if you're aware, but there are some interesting studies that were done regarding pheromones and HLA alleles (too lazy to look for them now). We subconsciously choose mates with different HLA alleles which can be detected in pheromones so that offspring have more variation in their HLA alleles. I wonder if this is related to kissing in some way. </p></div>		</li>
