			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28electromagnetism%29" target="_blank">Actually</a> this is not precisely true. The electromagentic path between your phone and the base station is identical in both directions (if you disregard effects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_isolator" target="_blank">this one</a> which makes an optical isolator work).</p>
<p>BUT where amkra is right is that the base station might not &quot;hear&quot; your phone as well as your phone &quot;hears&quot; the base station, since of course your phone's transmit power is considerably lower (not so much in the logarithmic domain though, which is where it matters). A second effect is the one of local noise: The base station is mounted high up in the air while your phone is close to electromagentic &quot;noise producers&quot; like microwave ovens, wifi, led bulbs, device chargers...</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Both waves receive the same treatment by the surrounding: direction of travel does not matter BUT transmit power and local effects do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, any CDMA based system (including UMTS and LTE) will suffer from reduced tower strength as more cell phones use that tower. The signal fluctuations could be this in effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been a long time since I have done RF planning in urban, external environments, but if memory serves me correctly, we always planned that the path to the end user device would often times be different than the path to the tower.  This was due primarily to reflection and obstacles between the two devices.  </p>
<p>We always tried to plan for a nice, clear fresnel zone, which would allow for identical paths, but I think the reality was much different.  I always remember saying that RF planning was half science and half magic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, can you explain that whole domain thing? I have always been mystified how a lower power device can make the trip back to the higher power antenna. Everyone says it works fine since the upload doesn't need to be a fast as download and the system is designed that way. </p>
<p>However my point has always been that if you boost that crap out of the TX, at some point your going to get beond the return trip capabilities of the device's TX antenna.</p>
<p>I see this in Wi-Fi all the time &quot;this booster will double the range with a +39db gain&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you are on the edge of the signal...  Could you setup a repeating tower for cell signals?  Like how it works for WiFi in some situations? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  As a matter of fact, I worked at a hospital while construction was underway for a new facility.  We approached 3 of the major carriers in our area about setting up a repeater system for the hospital.  The hospital consisted of 6 floors plus a basement, and we wanted to ensure cell service reach most areas of the hospital.  Our hospital had a very close relationship with Verizon, and they offered to provide the repeating hardware at no charge as long as we provided the antenna throughout the hospital.  The other carriers wanted around $35k for the hardware.   We installed a DAS (distributed antenna system) and Verizon plugged their equipment into it.  And just like that, 5 bars pretty much everywhere in the hospital.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I imagine that has many applications, so hopefully their creativity and hard work has paid off!</p></div>		</li>
