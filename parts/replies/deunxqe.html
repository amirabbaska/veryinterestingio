<p><strong>Too Much Detail Steps</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Version Control Software.</strong> Every change programmers do is stored in &quot;version control&quot;, where they can easily grab older forms of things or even undo and yank out whole changes completely. The build pipeline (9) usually use the most &quot;recent&quot; in Version Control, that way if anything goes wrong for a build it's easy to figure out what or how much to undo.  You can also just step through multiple versions of your house to look for where a problem specifically started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breakpoints and Step Through.</strong> Our delightful house of carpenters of course are all just sitting behind each their own single computer with most of the above tools right there on that computer. This means the programmer can work closely with a lot of the individual steps above to see what's specifically going on in any of them. The most important in my experience is &quot;breakpoints and stepping through&quot;. This is where a programmer tells the compiler to &quot;hey, while I walk through my house, I know you know more about how this house actually got put together than I do. So when you see me reach something that looks like -that thing-, stop me and tell me everything you kind of know about the situation.&quot;. Almost every little number can be seen this way - this is called a breakpoint. From here, programmers can &quot;step through&quot; the program, letting the program go step by step, single piece by single piece, nail by nail, to understand exactly how things are working together (or what might not be).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Error Reporting.</strong> Ever had a program crash and put up a box asking you to send some information out to the internet? Please, please, send those. Programmers tend to set up watchdogs around their program that wait for the house to explode. These watchdogs aren't really smart themselves, but they can at least tell the programmer what kind of explosion it was and what room it was in, and what environment the house built on. So when they run up to the newfound owner of the house - who is understandably angry their house blew up - please don't smack the poor dog away, but let it run back to the programmer that put it there. We use this information to figure out what are the most important possible things to fix. We don't want your house blowing up either.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mentality</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Discipline.</strong> Not all of these above things will be followed by all people and with all changes. A lot of times it's easy for a programmer to change what they think is something small, e.g. slightly moving that cabinet back in isolation (2), and skip checking everything else - leading to problems down the road (or downed the room, in this case). Especially since these checks take time. An experienced team of programmers try to act with more discipline in making sure they follow through with all these steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not everything is worth fixing.</strong> (For now) This is a stranger concept to deal with. Sometimes a change somewhere can cause a problem somewhere else, and that problem might be <em>okay</em>. In our house example, let's say you add a new washroom because there doesn't always seem to be enough and as a result, the showers everywhere can't get <em>quite</em> as hot as they used to. It's definitely annoying for some people, but the 0.5 degree change might just not be worth as much as the new washroom. Now, in a perfect case you could put in a new water heater and everything is fine but that isn't always possible (or in the budget ;) )</p>
</li>
<li><strong>There are limitations.</strong> Deadlines. Budgets. Hiring. Another poster mentioned &quot;fairy tales programmers like to tell themselves&quot;. These limitations can make this more or less true.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Always More</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more than the above. When working on large teams, there is always something that can be done better and I have definitely skipped quite a few small things in this post. Hopefully, this will give a decent glimpse at what you're asking. If you need anything explained better, I'll also happily respond and correct where needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good rundown.</p>
<p>Major emphasis on unit testing and functional testing. Ideally an entire program's functional flow can be tested in a single large automated test. We use this method and dedicate a host to run it around the clock, bringing in new changes to test them the minute they are merged. Fixes tons of problems before production.</p></div>		</li>
