			<div class="markdown"><p>Good call on why boat props are mounted in back. Is there any particular effect on planing capability or performance when using an impeller instead of a propeller, like a jet boat? </p>
<p>What about maneuverability benefits? I know in some contexts the impeller-driven jet is preferred simply because there's no risk of injury from a propeller. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with impeller-driven boats is they lose steering when they reduce power.  It takes some getting used to.  For example, when you would normally lower your throttle when passing another boat on a river.  I have a 21ft Sea-Doo boat.  430hp and lots of fun but if it was the same HP with a prop it would be faster and easier to handle at low speeds.</p>
<p>But on the plus side, I don't have to fix my prop every season.  Another benefit is they are very hard to flip because they lose &quot;traction&quot; if they are turned too hard and pick it back up once straight again.  They also get up to planning speed almost instantly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, having the skeg of a prop driven motor in the water will cause the boat to flip if you try to throw them around like a jet boat.  I have seen this happen first hand.</p></div>		</li>
