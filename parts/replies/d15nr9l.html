			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, the answer is we don't really know. As I tried to explain above, having eyes that are lighter in color doesn't really seem to have any benefit in terms of vision, in fact it can even make things worse. So what is the benefit? There are two main possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Vitamin-D Hypothesis</strong> Blue eyes could simply have co-evolved with fair skin as a means of allowing the body to produce more vitamin-D in regions with reduced sunlight. The problem here is that modern research seems to suggest that blue eyes may have appeared before fair skin, and blue eyes on their own don't really lead to more vitamin-D production. (e.g. see this <a href="http://www.sci-news.com/genetics/science-european-hunter-gatherers-01722.html" target="_blank">simplified explanation</a> of this <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v507/n7491/full/nature12960.html" target="_blank">Nature paper</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Selection</strong> Another possibility is that for whatever reason blue eyes tended to give people an advantage in terms of attracting mates, which allowed these genes to spread through the gene pool (see <a href="http://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/origin-blue-eyes" target="_blank">this discussion for more information</a>).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it simply be a mutation that causes such a small negative effect the selection pressure against it is so low it effectively will never die out? My under standing of the way eye colour genetics works leads me to think the gene for blue eyes would spread quite rapidly once the mutation appeared regardless of whether people found it more attractive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are attracted to someone your pupils naturally dilate. I read once that because people could tell easier who was attracted to them, we became more attracted to blue eyes over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse me if this is totally wrong for some reason, but why wouldn't it be the case that the eye color would selectively filter the excess light that is reaching the retina?</p>
<p>For instance a blue eyed person would allow excess non-blue light into their eye, adding yellow to everything. Given what we know about how perception of color in the environment affects our psychology and mood, might this not be a possible mechanism for eye color conferring an evolutionary advantage?</p>
<p>For instance, people living where it's cold are at greater risk for SAD etc. If everything seems a little sunnier all the time because they have blue eyes, isn't that an adaption? Rather than rewire the whole brain's color-emotion associations, might evolution not just have taken a shortcut by making the world appear more yellow?</p>
<p>It's a bit harder to explain other colors than blue, after thinking about it for a second, but research about color perception and mood is far from definitive so.. It seems to me though that there's enough evidence that colors affect people's moods one way or another (even if not affecting everyone exactly the same way) that this could be a possible evolutionary mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't necessarily require that a new mutation/character is advantageous, it just requires that it isn't so disadvantageous that it lowers the organisms' fitness enough that they are killed or fail to reproduce at a significantly greater rate than others.  Lighter eyes might not be advantageous at all, but if they aren't bad enough to cause a <em>significant</em> disadvantage then the evolutionary process has no &quot;reason&quot; to get rid of them and they just hang around.  It is entirely possible that there <em>is</em> some unrealized advantage, but it is not required by evolution.</p>
<p>Edit: in other words, evolution is not a purpose-driven process, so it doesn't always make sense to look for a purpose in every evolutionary outcome we observe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A trait doesn't have to be an advantage to survive the evolutionary process. If it's not a disadvantage and no advantageous traits displace it all kinds of random traits can crop up.</p>
<p>Most mutations do nothing significant but can be passed on. </p></div>		</li>
