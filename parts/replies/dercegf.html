			<div class="markdown"><p>So the deep Web is anything you have to enter a password to get to?  HBO go?  My bank account?  Does the local servers at my work count because I cannot access them from outside the network?
Edit: found my answer farther down the page</p></div>		</li>

<p>The vast majority of the deep web are old servers and such that are completely useless.</p>

<p>It's a lot more than that. It's been estimated that 99% of everything on the Internet is part of the deep web. Every email you've ever sent or received as part of the deep web. Search engines don't have access to those. Pretty much everything that you have to login to access is part of the deep web.</p>
