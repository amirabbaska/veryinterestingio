			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, just seeing this.  From what I've learned, yes and no.  You can be induced into a coma during brain trauma or certain healing periods.  (Source: <a href="http://www.asahq.org/lifeline/anesthesia%20topics/medically%20induced%20coma%20and%20sedation" target="_blank">http://www.asahq.org/lifeline/anesthesia%20topics/medically%20induced%20coma%20and%20sedation</a>) </p>
<p>However- you won't be in the same &quot;refreshed&quot; state as compared to when you fall asleep and wake up naturally.  </p></div>		</li>
