How do we classify which of the two hosts the disease &quot;started&quot; in? <em>Plasmodium</em> is a proper multi-host parasite, which requires both human and mosquito hosts to complete its life cycle (and it's the mosquito that functions as the definite host, i.e. the one in which sexual reproduction takes place). Humans are a transmission vector between mosquitoes just as much as the opposite is true.</p></div>		</li>
