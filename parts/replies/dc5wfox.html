			<div class="markdown"><p>The lifetime earnings of a neurosurgeon is probably more than the typical NBA player (not superstar) too.  With a typical career length of say 5 years at $1-3M/year, that's $10M in total earnings.  Neurosurgeons can make about $500K-1M/year and are in practice for up to 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Top-tier neurosurgeons make MUCH more than 500K-1M.  There are some single hospitals that pay multiple surgeons 3-4M without them being adminstrators.  Over the course of their career, that adds up to a lot more than <em>most</em> athletes, not just typical ones.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Experience makes a big difference in neurosurgeons' salaries. A survey conducted in 2011 by Profiles found a median starting salary of $395,000 for neurological surgeons. After six years in practice, the average salary grew to $589,500. &quot;Neurosurgery Market Watch&quot; reports that neurosurgeons six to 15 years into their profession earned a median income of $914,796. Top neurosurgeons make more than $1 million annually, according to &quot;Becker's Hospital Review.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the community wants a sports stadium, let them have it. If they do not, do not force it upon them. Let the people decide what's important to them to have as a community. Same with say, municipal internet. If they don't want the hassle, don't do it, just set a legal framework for private parties to do it. If they want to run it as a municipal utility then let them do it.  </p>
<p>In my community we have a small AAA  tier baseball complex that is funded by public funds and usage fees. The local youth baseball/softball and 'beer leagues' plus some other events/concerts then rent the complex. We're okay with this. We like what it provides for the community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this is a huge misconception of capitalism. In capitalism, essential services should never be subjected to the same laws of supply and demand as non essential services. Just ask any economist. In fact, going all the way back to the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith himself said the same thing. So, letting suply and demand dictate the pay of EMTs is NOT truly an example of capitalism and never has been. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will clear up some very common misconceptions that I've seen on here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is assuming there's any one true form of capitalism, just as people talk about 'true' democracy, when we've hundreds of examples of democracies throughout the world and in history. Adam Smith's consideration of the nature of capitalism is different to Marx's, which is different to Rothbard's...</p>
<p>It's true that many capitalist economists very reasonably argue what you argue, but we shouldn't discount the capitalists who argue that <em>all</em> services should be a part of a 'free market', or those who debate quite aggressively on what should be termed 'essential', especially since many of these people have an increasingly strong influence on governmental and economic policy throughout the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That cuts both ways regarding wages: if it's essential, there's an argument that for the common good it should be highly regulated and inexpensively priced, like utilities. </p></div>		</li>
