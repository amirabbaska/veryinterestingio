			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially correct.  Continuous (or repetitive) sensory input is background.  You need to be aware of changes in this background (from an opportunity/threat).  Your sensory systems are therefore  attuned to detect changes in the sensory environment.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is variation.  </p>
<p>Second, high-level behaviors (like what motivates us to keep eating, pizza, for example) are driven by many different things.  The actual sensory input is only one of many complex factors in the observed behavior.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense this <strong>is</strong> what is happening with drugs.  </p>
<p>When you take a drug, you have an effect.  With repeated exposure to the drug, you have changes at the cellular/synaptic level so that subsequent doses of the drug produce <strong>less</strong> of an effect.  This is somewhat analogous to the sensory &quot;fatigue&quot; I described earlier.  </p>
<p>The person, seeking the same high-level effect (i.e. high) needs to use a higher and higher dose of drug to achieve that same effect.  In essence, the system is responding to repeated exposures of the drug by becoming less sensitive to the drug.  </p></div>		</li>
