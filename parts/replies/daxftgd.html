<p>But chimps can't articulate language properly not because of their brains (they learn sign language quite well, indicating that there are no major cognitive issues) or really their lips, but because of the position of their voice box (larynx).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just want to add some clarification here.  While chimps have been successful in learning how to communicate with many of the symbols of sign language,  they have not been able to master some other aspects required for true language, like syntax. Most neurolinguists would agree that this is indeed because of differences in their brains that are reflective of differing cognitive capacity for language. ( Also, they learn this &quot;language&quot; much, much slower than humans and in different ways. )</p>
<p>So while bypassing the difficulties with articulation by using a gesture-based language does reveal an ability to learn symbols, it also reveals cognitive limitations in the ability of primates to learn language. </p>
<p>( I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, so I don't know about the birds either! )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up Nim Chimpsky. Conclusion is that this is unlikely, and those researchers really wanted it to be possible. Sorry I'm about to take a final or I'd explain more. I mean there could be a genius chimp, but it's still unlikely it could truly learn language, let alone teach others</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely true.  I guess I just meant much more successful (1000-2000 signs) relative to verbal (around four) since speech, not full-blown language seemed to be the root of the question. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is why sometimes you can teach your babies sign language, and they will communicate their needs. They WANT to talk to you-- but they can't because their voice box isn't in the right place.</p>

<p>What? Is there an article about this or something</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting side note:  Why would a baby need to have a voice box high in the throat?  Why not be born with a voice box in its proper location?  Because having the low voice box stops you from breathing and swallowing at the same time-- if adults do that, we choke.  Babies, chimps, dogs, cats... they all can breath and swallow at the same time without choking because for the high voice box (imagine a baby breast feeding and stopping to breath every couple seconds-- that would be weird).  Adult humans can talk... but the trade-off is that we also can choke to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for that explanation? It doesn't really make sense anatomically. Even if the laryngeal opening was higher up, you should still have to close it off via the epiglottis when swallowing in order to avoid aspirating your food (or milk). If that wasn't the case, what's stopping babies from getting tons of bacterial infections from feedings? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.  It's not a bad idea, and might be technically possible.  Mostly scientists have focused on teaching apes American Sign Language or teaching them to communicate via images they select on a keyboard.  But it could be possible to create a language based off sounds we know apes can make.</p></div>		</li>
