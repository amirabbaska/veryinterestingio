<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect" target="_blank">Poynting–Robertson drag ... is a process by which solar radiation causes a dust grain orbiting a star to lose angular momentum relative to its orbit around the star. This is related to radiation pressure tangential to the grain's motion.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moving particle is imparted momentum by the radiation from the star. In the absense of a radiation field a particle does not receive an asymmetric radiation pressure and does not accelerate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you (and the other two posters) for the clarification. I understand and figured that was the difference, but I've always heard that you can observe it from the dust's frame as emitting preferentially in the front and experiencing drag as a result; it sounds like this is a simplification as that alone would not slow the particle. Is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is how it works, but the situation is not the same. In the presence of radiation perpendicular to the direction of motion, the particle slows down by absorbing photons that have no velocity component in that direction.</p>
<p>This happens because before and after a photon is absorbed, momentum must be conserved. Absorbing a photon increases the particle's mass (E=mc^2), therefore its velocity must decrease to preserve momentum. Radiating the photon symmetrically back into space does not change the particle's (decreased) velocity, just as in OP's question.</p></div>		</li>
