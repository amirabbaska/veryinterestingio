<p>Chances are the dude-perfect guys have a load of gifs of coin flips that land on the edge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it wasn't chosen randomly, from your perspective as long as you don't know how it was chosen, it's still effectively 50-50. If your partner deliberately found a gif that lands heads, but you don't know they choose that... Then it's still basically just a coin flip from your perspective</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/SQLDave's point is that the actual result of a coin flip as well as the distribution of results in available gifs is unimportant here. Even if every single coin-flipping video on the internet revealed heads, if you don't know that fact then it doesn't affect the probability of your guess being correct. Without prior knowledge of the distribution, you should reasonably assume a flat distribution, which means your guesses should also be flatly distributed. So you'll have a 50/50 chance of selecting heads and being right. The same is true for every other potential distribution of coin-flipping gifs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand, if 100% of the gifs reveal head how it is reasonable to assign 50/50 chance of selecting heads or tail ?</p>
<p>The lack of knowledge about distribution and results in available gifs doesn't mean that this knowledge doesn't effect your chances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probability and odds are about information and predictability.</p>
<p>Human knowledge.</p>
<p>If you're a determinist you largely believe everything is fated anyway.</p>
<p>You could claim the outcome is 99% heads once you calculated the launch velocity, spin rate, wind factor, ground friction, etc while the coin is in mid air. Same with a deck of cards shuffle - each card was moved deliberately, even if human knowledge and perception make the order effectively unpredictable. </p></div>		</li>
