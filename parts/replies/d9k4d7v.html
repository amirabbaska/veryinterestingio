<p>A sea-based location and a Mount Fuji shape are some of this building's other major design features â€” the real Mount Fuji is land-based and is 3,776 m (2.35 miles) high, 224 m shorter than the X-Seed 4000. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A building larger than the mountain it was inspired by. Mind. Blown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, come to think of it, for the building to be efficient, it would probably diminish in size as it goes up to minimize the impact of elevator stacks, structure, and utility chases on the lower floors. Basically, coming full circle, we'd be back to building pyramids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, i read that. Something like that actually being built would've been big news. its still amazing that <em>if</em> we wanted to build it, that its basically ready to go...that the design capability is there.</p>
<p>although, some are drawing parallels to the great pyramids, i can't help think that we as a species have designed the best ant-hill. ever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eye in the sky tower designed by Eugene Tsui. I was wondering why is the building leaning and then looked closer and saw on top of that, it was set to be built in Oakland California and would be taller than the Dubai Tower.  Is this supposed to be serious?</p></div>		</li>
