			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever its faults, at least ESSA provides necessary flexibility for states. I mean, one of the &quot;problematic&quot; aspects of NCLB is that it imposed serious consequences on school districts for failing to meet benchmarks that were statistically impossible to achieve. This led not only to curricula getting bastardized to death in the effort to meet or at least <em>approach</em> these benchmarks (which in turn meant ignoring very important parts of what constitutes a truly well-rounded education), but also to a variety of shenanigans aimed at achieving the <em>appearance</em> of compliance without making any real difference (other than de-emphasizing or eliminating programs that weren't part of assessing compliance). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup. My high school won the top state award two years in a row (set up under NCLB), which was awesome. Then we failed because one of the benchmarks required a certain level of improvement every single year. </p>
<p>FWIW, I graduated in 2005, so that was all awhile ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was supposed to be 100% of students meeting a proficiebnt score by 2015. This includes students with disabilities, non-verbal students, students with autism and those with mental retardation. It didnt matter if a child in 11th grade functioned at the kindergarten level, he was expexted to take and pass an 11th grade test. Literally not one district was able to be at 100%. It was an unrealistic goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's too much cynicism around this Act. From what I've read, it's a lot better than its predecessor. Clearly we need to help our college students as well, but the changes implemented in ESSA are absolutely needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also keep in mind that while mandating impossible standards, it failed to finance the requirements to even start addressing the problem. </p>
<p>Basically it was the boss saying &quot;Tear down that mountain&quot;, then not giving the managers any tools or money to buy tools or hire more workers. </p>
<p>Doomed from the start. (Like almost everything Bush did)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a college bookstore,  and let me say that Mcgraw Hill is one of the most hated publishers out there.  What they do is get really pretty women to talk to old as diet professors and convince them into adopting custom titles that can't be sold anywhere else,  or they package the National title with a bs access key that they never use.  This is all in the name of sales.  The sales rep got herself banned from our campus for screwing an entire department for her own sales numbers.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When states have controls over curriculum one of the things that happens is that certain areas in the country want textbooks that emphasize certain things and deemphasize others. So textbook manufacturers are asked to rewrite their textbooks for different parts of the country.  I'm sure that gives them another reason to jack up the prices.  </p></div>		</li>
