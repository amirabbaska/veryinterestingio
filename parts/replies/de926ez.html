			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I see, thank you. So for example, is the sensation of smelling a freshly baked loaf of bread at the baker's counter, similar to actually tasting the bread but at a lesser effect? Or is the smell of an item completely different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what it's like for you. A large amount of the taste of food, given a normally functioning sense of smell, is actually the smell (going through the mouth and the upper airways) getting mixed into what the taste receptors report. It doesn't feel like smell, but it is, largely. Other perception (e.g. texture of the food) plays into this, too.</p>
<p>Taste receptors can really only detect a few properties: sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness and umami (the taste MSG adds to things, also creating by browning meat and some vegetables and roots). Everything else comes from other senses. So, sense of smell is basically taste minus the parts perceived directly in the mouth. For instance, I can't really smell sweetness but I <em>can</em> smell many things that are typically sweet, including caramel and chocolate, and I've developed very strong mental associations between smell and pure taste, so I can &quot;almost taste it&quot; if I smell it. I <em>can</em> smell salt a little but it's very different from the powerful taste sensation on the tongue. There isn't one singular smell for sour things, but vinegar, for example, has a very characteristic smell. And so on.</p>
<p>I do have experience with tasting things without smell, from when I have a bad cold and the upper airways are all blocked. In direct comparison, almost no taste is left. This will almost certainly be different for you because you don't have the direct comparison. It's quite possible your sense of taste (and some of the other senses involved, like texture, temperature etc.) on its own is rather more refined than mine because you have to deal with a reduced or altogether missing olfactory component and your nervous system found ways to compensate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment explains a good deal, but I would add that it's definitely way more similar to taste than any other sense. It <em>is</em> sort of like tasting in your nose. Hearing would be a distant second place. It's nothing like sight, and even less similar to touch.</p>
<p>95% of the time when I do smell something, it's within 10-15 feet of me. The farthest thing I've smelled in recent memory was a house fire about a mile away. But also I feel like I'm not usually actively experiencing smell sensations, in a way similar to how I'm not tasting anything at all right now. It's not much of an &quot;always-on&quot; sense like sight, hearing, or touch. </p>
<p>Also I feel like 2/3s of the time the smells are either neutral or bad. Good smells don't happen all the time.</p>
<p>Also, even if you feel like not being able to smell sucks, you should at least consider yourself a little lucky for being unable to smell poop or farts, which are, unfortunately, some of the most common smells in daily life. Trash too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh I never really noticed how few &quot;good&quot; smells there are. There's food, flowers and perfumes, and some smokes. Gasoline smells bad, but in an alluring way. And I <em>love</em> the smell of cocaine.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I smell more &quot;neutral&quot; smells than good or bad throughout my day. My car, my new yoga mat, the class room I walk into, or the smell of the person walking next to me (if they don't smell of soap or perfume/cologne) are all smells that aren't good or bad, they're just a smell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id say, like others have said, that it does indeed feel like tasting something, but the way you feel it, imo, would be more like how you feel heat.</p>
<p>If you are standing near something a bit hot, you may feel it from 5 meters away, and if you get closer the heat gets more intense.</p>
<p>If you are standing near something really really hot, you can feel it from very far away. (This is what happens when a trash truck drives by, or the wind breeze carries smell from something with it).</p>
<p>Another example, if you see a plastic, try and taste it. Tastes like nothing right? It smells like nothing either. So taste and smell are pretty entwined.</p>
<p>Also, id say you can smell hot food alot easier than cold food (possibly because hot food releases water vapour).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. Smells are part of subjective experience, strictly speaking we don't even know all smells are the same to all of us humans. The same argument goes for colours. How do you describe green? By referring to things we all know. &quot;Like, trees, man&quot;... but maybe my green is still different and trees look all different to me. The description makes sense to me because my trees are the same as any other green thing, but that still tells us nothing about any differences between your green and my green. It's complicated! :)</p></div>		</li>
