This will obviously evolve over time as it becomes more widely accepted and as more owners request this for their dogs.  It seems unlikely that any intervention will ever be given to all dogs regardless of the efficacy or magnitude of benefit. </p>
<p>With respect to specific at risk populations, this is a great question.  Dilated cardiomyopathy in particular is an interesting example, as we have published that rapamycin can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613228/" target="_blank">protect against DCM in mouse models</a>.  We have discussed the possibility of a dedicated DCM trial for at risk breeds such as dobermans, but so far have not been able to secure funding for such a study.  I think there is great promise here, so hopefully this will be tested at some point in the future. </p></div>		</li>
