<p>I was considering violet to be a shade of purple; you're correct though. So is purple a shade of violet...or even comparable to violet? Or a shade of blue? Is it even worth questioning haha!? I'm confusing myself by combining physics lingo with everyday terms, with the philosophy of subjective colour perception</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Purple is usually considered to be a mix of red and blue. It does look more like violet than red so it is sometimes called violet. The more technical term is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_magenta" target="_blank">magenta</a>. </p>
<p>BTW, One problem with RGB displays you can't make true violet, so we mix blue with red in an approximately 2/1 ratio to make [violet](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(color" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(color</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual, original color name is violet. There was a type of paint or pigment called &quot;purple&quot; that eventually took on a similar meaning to violet. I only know this because I had an art teacher that wanted us to call it violet for said reason, even though words shift meaning like that all the time and it's perfectly acceptable English to call it purple and it's stupid to let Shakespeare's way of talking influence what I choose to call my mix of red and blue.</p></div>		</li>
