			<div class="markdown"><p>Best edit I've ever seen on askscience.</p>
<p>Most physicists you'll encounter in here want to give the most fundamental, most comprehensive response. Sometimes that means we accidentally overlook the <em>spirit</em> of the question. </p>
<p>If you wanna talk about fundamental particles, these other answers are a great summary of contemporary understanding in particle physics. </p>
<p>But we can look at other regimes:</p>
<p>Noble gases don't like to form chemical bonds because, usually, you have to <em>add</em> energy to the system and that still ends up in a very high energy state--the universe likes to be in low states, so it's easier not to bond. </p>
<p>Ideal gases don't interact on energy scales very relevant to daily life. Or better, on macroscopic scales you can often adequately describe the behavior of an ideal gas as more of a fluid than as a collection of individual particles. The <em>mean free path</em> (how far they travel before electrostatic forces make them change direction, called 'colliding') of air molecules is like 50 nanometers, so for the most part a lot of good physics can be done with this assumption (early successful supersonic aircraft used ideal gas law assumptions).</p>
<p>A superfluid acts like it isnt very attracted to itself, showing no viscosity--superfluid can travel up out of the glass against gravity due to its lack of attraction to itself (viscosity).</p>
<p>Gravitational waves like to ignore most everything--it's nearly impossible to absorb them or redirect them. </p>
<p>You can keep making analogies like these, because physicists like to <em>model</em> certain systems using the easiest possible math and science that still allows good experimentally-verifiable predictions....</p>
<p>Edit: let's keep going </p>
<p>Photons have a very hard time interacting with each other, and a lot of good physics is done by assuming they don't interact at all. </p>
<p>Any particle at all affects the curvature of spacetime, even if only very little, because any nonzero energy density slightly warps spacetime. In that way, gravitational interactions occur between any two particles.</p>
<p>But also, because gravity is so <em>drastically</em> weaker than other forces, most theories of particles interacting can completely ignore gravity with no noticeable impact on experimental results. The standard model of particle physics, one of the most beautifully simple and robust models we've ever developed, ignores gravity entirely. (But people have worked on adding it in!)</p>
<p>Interestingly, if space has any regions with sufficient energy (e.g. A high-energy photon), particle-antiparticle pairs can be spontaneously created! This is a different kind of 'interaction,' but in particle physics it's still an interaction. </p>
<p>For a long time, it was good enough to assume neutrinos had no mass at all. Similarly, for a lot of nuclear physics you can assume <em>isospin symmetry</em>, which essentially says protons and neutrons are <em>the same particle</em>. For many of the purposes of nuclear physics, this assumption worked great.</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of physics is not just being able to account for <em>all</em> possible contributions to a problem, but also to robustly say &quot;For this problem, I can confidently ignore <em>these</em> factors.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>FYI modern aerodynamic design use ideal gas assumptions practically everywhere outside of high supersonic speeds, and in the case of internal flows in engines where you have to deal with combustion and a lot of heat and compression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noble gasses do interact with particles just fine, in fact, that's how neon lights work. Noble gasses don't bond with other atoms (a structure made of particles), so there is no such thing as argon oxide or neon fluoride. Because of this they are very useful to use in some situations where you don't want stuff to happen.<br />
However, atoms don't interact with elementary particles in quite the same way other elementary particles would. This is because an atom is made up of several types of particle: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The fact that it has a complete outer electron shell (what makes it a noble gas) changes how it interacts with other atoms, but it doesn't stop the photons and neutrons inside it from behaving in the way they do.<br />
However, that's a bad explanation, and in short it's just complicated. Noble gases are noble in a classical sense, and the question deals more with quantum physics. I would highly suggest researching it more, but there is a lot of stuff to know about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not really true. The heavier noble gases can form stable covalent bonds using their d orbitals, such as in xenon tetrafluoride.</p>
<p>Helium can form a very weak dimer using a Van der Waals bond, and it can even have covalent bonding if it's in a energized state or ionized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another relevant point on a fundamental level:</p>
<p>Any particle which doesn't interact with anything else (gravity, electromagnetism, weak, strong, color, or what-have-you), is by definition unobservable. </p>
<p>So if particles like this exist, we have no reason to think we would ever know, because they ignore all aspects of our universe that we currently find relevant. </p>
<p>Of course, this is a trivial and uninteresting answer to the posed question....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was wondering. Maybe there are particles that do not interact with anything at all.  Maybe they would have mass but nothing else?  Their existence could be predicted through particle physics, perhaps they could account for dark matter. It's also possible you could infer their existence in certain ways, even if you can't observe them directly. For example if you could devise a reaction that would produce one of these theorized particles you could infer its existence if you could observe the other particles and energy given off. If your end products do not have the equivalent mass and energy of your input particles then something else was created that you're not able to observe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correctionn: Dark matter interacts through gravity; the whole thing about dark matter is that we can't see it, but there should be more mass (interaction through gravity) to make things work the way they seem to do.  </p>
<p>Dark matter may be some particle that interacts only through gravity and nothing else.  </p>
<p>For your question, I have a followup for someone wiser than me.
Can a particle have mass, yet be undetectable by gravity? As in, it accounts for missing mass from some proces, but doesnt interact gravitationally. It seems counter intuitive, but then again so does a lot of physics at this scale.   </p></div>		</li>
