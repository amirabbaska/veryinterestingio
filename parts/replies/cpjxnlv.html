			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that sometimes there are other issues involved. For example, if an airline normally flies planes with 150 seats on a route, and sells 145 tickets, that's fine. But when the 150 seater plane breaks down, and there's only a smaller, 130 seater, plane available, then people get bumped. And when the weather is bad, some aircraft can't take the load that the airline planned for. This is often an issue in the summer from hot airports, as the takeoff performance can be compromised (particularly on routes that push the performance of the aircraft at the best of time). At the moment, this isn't too much of an issue, but I know United Airlines have had quite a few diversions due to the weather on their 757 services across the Atlantic, as the headwinds when travelling from Europe to the USA makes it hard for the 757 to make it all the way without a fuel stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also affected a bunch of airlines a few years back during some unusually strong jetstreams winds.  All of the carrier transcontinental flights using the A320 had to stop for more fuel in PHX/SLC/LAS/etc. and added a couple of hours of delay for each round trip.  The flights that happened to be operated by slightly longer ranged 757 were fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup- this was a particular issue with the more elderly A320 family aircraft flown by carriers in the US. The more recent aircraft are fine, such as the A321s flown by American Airlines, which they're using on their transcontinental flights such as JFK-LAX. The newer A321s with Sharklets and the IAE engines seem to be doing really well!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're talking about voluntary bumps (people who offer to go on the next flight). If you are involuntarily bumped, you are entitled to be paid at least twice your one-way fare if you are delayed by an hour or more (and that goes up the more you are delayed).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mind elaborating on this? I fly 48 weeks a year and the best I have come up with is booking a flight early in the day, showing up to the airport early enough (because I have nothing else to really do), volunteering that way to get the $300-$500 in travel credit, and then catching a later flight.</p>
<p>The question I have is how do you book an entire day early and then volunteer up your seat for the travel credit without actually going to the airport to get said credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about canceling a flight when it is underbooked and then trying to shove you onto the next flight, overbooking it and leaving you stranded?</p>
<p>The above is why I'll Delta again.  There were about 15-20 of us waiting for a flight.  Plane was there (747), crew was there.  Boarding time came and went.  No mechanical problems (or so they said, they were just waiting for some info from somebody before letting us on).  </p>
<p>Eventually they sent us to another gate to get on another plane.  Except it didn't fit 5 of us.  So we went on standby for 8 hours.</p>
<p>No compensation, no help in re-arranging connecting flights, hotels.</p>
<p>The original plane?  It sat there at the gate for another 2 hours, then boarded a pretty full flight and left.</p>
<p>And the return trip was even worse.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long ago was this?</p>
<p>IIRC, the DOT's overbooking rules came into effect in 2011. If it was after 2011 and you didn't volunteer to go on a different flight, then they broke the law.  </p>
<p>Pretty sure there's nothing that you can do about it <em>now,</em> though. For future reference, if you get involuntarily bumped they <em>must</em> get you on another flight. Everything else that /u/JohnDoe_85 typed applies, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While not saying this is strictly what happened, often times if a plane going somewhere else breaks, that may be fully booked, they'll take the aircraft for your near empty flight and re deploy it to cover for the broken plane. (AOG)</p>
<p>The airlines aren't thinking about the fact that you're delayed a few hours. To them, it's preferable to get the majority of those passengers out, and the unfortunate consequence is that you're stuck waiting. </p>
<p>Very simple analogy, say you have 3 flights a day EWR-IAD (Newark-Dulles)and 3 flights a day EWR-BOS(Newark Boston)</p>
<p>If you're EWR-IAD flights are booked solid, but your EWR-BOS flights are half full all day, the airline would rather pull a BOS turn and re deploy the aircraft to IAD. Now, to the average passenger, it looks like &quot;oh my flight was half empty so they cancelled it.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, yes, by virtue of your flight having few passengers, it was the low hanging fruit so to speak.</p>
<p>PM me if you'd like me to delve deeper, but airline regs, rules etc are pretty boring for the average person</p></div>		</li>
