<p>Colour is caused by interaction with electrons, and &quot;neutronium&quot; doesn't have any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's been mentioned but your alternatives are a high-density material formed at high pressures as in the core of a neutron star, or a low density neutron gas.</p>
<p>Neutrons don't bind together alone under &quot;normal&quot; (ie. lower than neutron star core density) situations, they only form atomic nuclei with the presence of a roughly equal amount of protons which under normal circumstances will be surrounded by the same amount of electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is true. The Everest one is completely false. A teaspoon is less than a matchbox by volume, and Everest is approximately 60 cubic kilometers of earth.</p></div>		</li>
