			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck thickly sliced deli meats. I always get my turkey chipped. I know it takes a little longer, but that's how I like it. I hate when I say thin or chipped and they think I mean &quot;a bit thinner than everyone else&quot; and I still get this slab of meat. No god dammit, I want it falling apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to really call it a recipe. Just store bought corned beef, slow cooked for 12 hours. Add cabbage, carrots and potatoes for the last few hours. Drain the beef and let it rest, then pull/shred it.
After it cools make a classic reuben. Kraut, thousand island dressing, the pulled beef, swiss cheese all between grilled marble rye.
We usually do classic corned beef dinner night 1 and Reubens night 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the one you're asking, but my recipe is to drop the corned beef in the crock. Put onions and carrots in the crock. Sprinkle seasoning packet if it came with one. Pour a bottle of stout on it. Cover. Set it on high for 2 hours. Put it on low. Go to bed. Wake up to heaven. </p></div>		</li>
