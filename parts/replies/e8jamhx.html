			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may try once with out any analogies:</p>
<p>The voltage (volts) is a potential difference between two points. The higher the voltage is, the more electricity wants to travel from point A to point B. At low voltages, you get nice well behaved things like batteries and phone chargers. At high voltages you get dramatic sparks; IE jacobs ladders, and tesla coils.</p>
<p>The current (amps) is the amount of electricity that is traveling down a wire. If the current is zero then no electricity is flowing (a battery with nothing plugged in). If the current is low then a little bit of electricity is flowing (a wall socket powering a tiny LED). If the current is high then a lot of electricity is flowing (a wall socket powering an electric heater).</p>
<p>Multiplied together, the current and the voltage form the power (watts). The power is the amount of work that is being done by electricity each second.</p>
<p>Short example: An LED powered by a 9 volt battery with 1 amp of current flowing through it is doing (9 x 1 =) 9 watts of work - and will put out approximately 9 watts worth of light. A different LED powered by a 120 volt rectified (changed from AC to DC) with 0.1 amps of current flowing through it will do 12 watts of work. The second LED will be brighter, but only by a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes time to get it. Practical examples, repetition, etc... I took a few classes on it and despite being able to describe simple concepts and do basic equations I never REALLY understood it. </p></div>		</li>
