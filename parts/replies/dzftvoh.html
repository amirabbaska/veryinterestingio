<p>Along these lines I would add that games need high resolution textures in part <em>because</em> the lighting is so approximated.  In a pre-rendered render I might use grass with a 125x125px texture... but I'll use instanced geometry to render a billion blades of grass.     In a game I would use a texture on a card.   And in order to sell the effect that the flat plane of grass is actually a grassy field I'll use a nice high resolution 4k texture that has a few dozen blades of grass.  So all of that nice lighting and detail that would be achieved in the geometry will need to be pre-rendered and baked into a texture.  For the offline render on a render farm that takes 8 hours the texture only needs to be &quot;Green&quot;.</p>
<p>On a somewhat unrelated note on why a 480p DVD is ok but not a 480p game, that's partly down to practicality.  If you can't clearly see an Uruk-hai at 100m on a DVD that's fine, it's just background detail.  If you can't clearly see an uruk-hai at 100m and you need to headshot them with a bow or you'll lose the game,  you need 1080p to aim.  Games could do a lot more with 480p resolution and look pretty impressive, but the gameplay and fun would suffer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point on the different needs. A pinball game looks fine at 480p or even 320p, because everything on the screen is a sphere or plane or &quot;painted&quot; backdrop where the brain will fill in missing details, and the action is distributed across the whole screen. A first-person game concentrates the eye around the center focal point of the screen, so you need a lot of pixels in that area, which means you need better resolution in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, movies, even 3D-rendered ones or ones using hyper-realistic CGI, are still &quot;recorded&quot;. This means that while all the sets and pieces and animations and effects are made and placed together in a 3D environment, each scene is rendered out ('recorded') on a high-end system that's worth tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, and it can often still take weeks. That's time and processing power that your home PC won't have to spend to be able to display it.</p>
<p>This is why games in the past had cutscenes with far more detail than the game itself, because a movie like that is basically just a single 4K texture on a flat plane that's been animated, as opposed to one of many, many textures 'wrapped' around numerous objects that need to be dynamically viewable from every angle.</p></div>		</li>
