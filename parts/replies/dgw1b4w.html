			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I ask because I want to start working out and losing weight again. I stopped because I moved recently. I don't want to work out my legs because I can already leg press 350 lbs but I want to lose weight down there too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know but my problem is when I was working out, I wasn't losing or gaining much weight and then my pants weren't fitting anymore. And I'm too poor to buy more pants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building on this the legs are the foundation for the body. They tie into your core and lower back. If you begin to neglect them you may find you have lower back problems as you increase in weight. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually have a hard time running. I had osgood schlatters a few times as a kid and my right knee is slightly deformed. Not pussying out in PE hurt it a lot. Sometimes my leg would just give out like it wasn't even there when I stepped and I'd fall. Now it doesn't bother me as much because I don't run as much but it does still offer me great discomfort when I do leg extensions and less so with leg press.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see people on the internet saying running is a useless exercise all the time, which doesn't make any sense to me. I run mainly to burn extra calories, I'm eating a very low calorie diet so even a couple hundred calories from jogging an hour or so makes a huge difference. Maybe they just don't have the same goals as me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fat around organs goes first, then other body fat, them limb fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have sources to back that up? I've had a quick google but haven't found any credible sources that confirm it.</p>
<p>I've read some articles (I think it was in New Scientist) that talked about the thin outside fat inside (TOFI) body type that can be seen where someone appears physcially slim but has a lot of fat around the organs. Wouldn't that suggest fat around the organs goes last?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't quite work like that the textbooks all have a broad approximations for these things but everybody's body will perform slightly differently, </p>
<p>the best thing to do is up your cardio amounts and just generally lose fat whilst defining the muscles in the areas you want to show off.</p></div>		</li>
