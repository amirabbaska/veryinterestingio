			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with that this surveillance might be considered warranted by politicians because of a fear of domestic/foreign terrorism. </p>
<p>However I disagree with a lot of your reasoning. You seem to be portraying US and the UK as vastly different even though they are inhabited by culturally and otherwise similar people. You're citing population density as a justification for government surveillance which doesn't really follow logically. I am sure you realise the vast majority of Americans live in highly populated areas not some sheriff controlled western out-back. </p>
<p>Lasting you realise equating the US government worker to a nut job and the UK one as your intelligent friendly pal from the pub should raise eyebrows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's blown out of proportion is my point, but is still an issue of course. I'd like to see priorities shift to targeting mental health issues, gun violence and reigning in the NSA, for example, as a way to save far more lives with less effort and expense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Brit and lurker within reddit for some years now I must say I'm astounded that you believe we are culturally kin. We are quite different, I assure you.</p>
<p>Privacy in the UK has always been something different than what the rest of the world sees it as. Us Brits (and we have an amazing stark difference between counties in our opinions) usually align on the point of 'nothing to hide'. I am a Yorkshireman and that sentiment is seen to be prevalent in response to the charter. Provided they nail one bad egg at some point in the next few years and save a couple of us free range ones in the process I'm fine with it. Ultimately, the home office will have a copy of fairly standard user data for a mid 20s male.</p>
<p>To your point regarding density and how you don't understand it, I will attempt to elaborate. We do not talk to each other. We nod, thank, be polite, but we do not talk to each other. Because of this, we are an incredibly suspicious bunch and if an opportunity presents itself to declare 'I have nothing to hide do you?' We cease it with impunity. I live in a building with roughly 80 other occupants. I can name about 3 of them. God knows what they do up there but they sure do like their grime music...</p>
<p>I think the final point of hillbilly bible bashers vs suave 00 is more banterous but there's likely some truth to it. Our GCHQ is part of our intelligence service and it has a fairly decent reputation domestically and internationally. It's done some illegal things, but meh. Does the job. US has a few too many fanatics from all creeds running around and with a lot more people there's likely to be one bad egg in a position of power ready to manipulate all this juicy information. We Brits are simply too busy watching Strictly and Get me out of here to care. (To divine your question about caring, I refer to not caring about these kinds of things if we don't visibly see the change happen in front of us. If my government wants to see I like big wobbly buttocks then I will certainly be more fervent in my use of search engines to ensure they get their reward. I have nothing to hide nor be ashamed of and provided this power is used in its described way to foil the very real threat the UK faces simply be being an ally of the US then quite frankly monitor away. I'll write them a daily diary of my bottom perusals if they so wish.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is when they use their surveillance of you to limit your freedom. They can easily take what you say is nothing to hide from and make a narrative completely subjectively different, that you then want to hide from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to put words in anyone's mouth, but I didn't read that as population density justifying surveillance, more that population density breeds a tolerance for surveillance due to constant exposure of what might otherwise be kept private.  That is, constant exposure engenders a sense of familiarity and anesthetizes (rightly or not) concern about the motives those handling the surveillance.  Also, while most Americans do live in dense population centers, those centers are not as dense, nor as long established, as the population centers of the UK.Your final point stands, but, in light of the above, could also be considered a poorly worded analogy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In that regard, the level of social decency towards others is quite high, and the standards and codes of conduct the government is held to are also high. This means that when I hear that someone can see my emails or texts in the UK, I do not worry that the person reading them is some rabid right-wing Jesus loving nut-job agent for an apocalyptic police state, but a relatively educated professional who could be the person next to me at the pub. Therefore it is not something I worry about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't think that's true. First of all, I've seen more fights, aggressive behaviour and outright racism in the UK than I've seen anywhere else since I moved here. I was once punched in the face for asking someone to please stop pissing on my doorstep, for example.</p>
<p>And as for codes of conduct for the government, where does that statement come from? It's fairly naive to think that corruption doesn't happen out of some sort of sense of social responsibility. </p>
<p>And on the right wing thing, the UK is insanely conservative and right-wing. To the point that Jeremy Corbyn is derided as a loon for suggesting that perhaps it's worth bearing poor people in mind when running a country.</p>
<p>I love this place, I really do, but the idea that this legislation isn't something to worry about because the British are jolly good old boys is just naive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm basis this off the public opinion I gathered while talking to many residents when I was last over in December.</p>
<p>Comparing the integrity, consistency and competency of the government in the UK versus the US, it's easy to see how stark of a difference there is. I'm not saying the gov't is vindicated of any wrongdoing, sure there have been many instances of corruption, however in general the moral standards are much higher.</p>
<p>And as for the fights and aggressive behaviour, I'm sorry if you live in Glasgow or Liverpool, I truly am, however I'm inferring the professionalism and transparency of public servants, as well as the general ability to expect a fair interaction when dealing with the police. Your examples aside, while extreme, it's impossible to ignore the differences between the UK and the commonwealth or the US when it comes to coexisting, basic manners, public etiquette and conversational style are all unique to the UK and mirror that of other densely populated centres such as Japan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from another perspective, I live in the UK now but have lived in other places (including the US briefly). The UK has a lot of issues compared with the rest of Europe in my opinion. I'll take your point on the police, at least people aren't scared of them like they are over there.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn't have mentioned that incident, as I wasn't basing it on just that- my point was that I've seen much more aggressive behaviour and overt racism here than anywhere else I've lived - I'm talking about London. I could go on with this but I think it's moot anyway, as I don't see how you can extrapolate that the government will act responsibly from people being polite to each other in the street.</p>
<p>I still don't think your core claim is accurate. The UK government aren't somehow more trustworthy than the US government. They have actually recently been found to illegally spy on their own citizens for a long time now. Recent legislation just makes what they've been doing for years legal.</p>
<p>Here's a list of government scandals here, including two incidents in the last 6 years of the government taking money to influence policy. Nothing was done about that. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_scandals_in_the_United_Kingdom#2010s" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_scandals_in_the_United_Kingdom#2010s</a></p>
<p>TBH this country was founded on atrocities. Probably has committed more atrocities around the world than any other nation going back through history. </p>
<p>I don't think there's any reason to say that there are higher moral standards here, bar a vague feeling that you like it here and the people are nice (which you should, it's lovely and they are, mostly). But that doesn't mean they have better moral standards or the country is run more morally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your view is shared by a lot of my friends and colleagues in London. I also share it to a certain extent - in that I'm not worried an agent will be snooping around my pictures and emails.</p>
<p>I am worried though about politicians and journalists I support being monitored and manipulated using information from this system. We have already seen how the police have infiltrated environmental activist groups using underhanded tactics (Bob Lambert), what could you do if a politician or journalist you supported was targeted, blackmailed or their reputation besmirched with information from this system?</p>
<p>I absolutely agree that we should have this system. I just think that it should only be accessible by a court order under a concrete suspicion of guilt.</p></div>		</li>
