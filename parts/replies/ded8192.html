			<div class="markdown"><p>The Incas had a better system - the emperor was considered a god and therefore couldn't die! He was mummified after his, er, breathing stopped, and a circle of priests arose to interpret the messages the mummy would supposedly deliver. After a few generations, there were a bunch of different factions jockeying for political power, each one associated with a different royal mummy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he meant was just that all that shows us is that they left. Without knowing why they leave we can't say whether or not they honored them.</p>
<p>Maybe they left because they knew dead bodies weren't healthy to be around so didn't risk touching the corpse. And they wanted to leave the body out so local predators could eat the body to support their local ecosystem. Or maybe they did it because they were just jackasses, who knows.</p>
<p>The point is action without reason isn't proof of anything other than the fact that the action happened.</p></div>		</li>
