			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, researchers will often include identical questions with reverserd scale. For instance, question 1 reads &quot;How often do you browse Reddit?: a) daily b) weekly c) monthly d) never&quot;. Question 20 might read &quot;How often do you browse Reddit? a) never b) monthly c) weekly d) daily&quot;. If you answer 1a and 20a, it's indication you aren't reading the questions and are filling them in randomly.</p></div>		</li>
