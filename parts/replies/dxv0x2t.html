			<div class="markdown"><p>It would probably help cool you quicker but we are quite good at cooling down as it is, and a small benefit over a prolonged period of time is likely easier for your body to regulate rather than being cool from outside sources (wet hair quickly evaporating) for a short time then more extreme changes once you are dry. </p></div>		</li>
