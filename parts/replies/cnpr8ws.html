			<div class="markdown"><p>My one friend who was in the class ahead of mine back when I was in highschool. He would go to school and right after go work at a dairy farm that was near by all night long until about 4 a.m. then go home to sleep for 2-3 hrs then come back to school. He'd maybe do this for 4 days straight before he had a day off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely possible in the short term. I've done that plenty in college. You just get used to feeling tired. But when you go many days in a row on just 2 hours of sleep each night, everything becomes a bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recent college grad here: The night before any project was due I'd stay up all night adding/finishing/touching stuff up, and the class might not be til late afternoon. We'd present, I'd be tired but functional, then when I'd get home I'd eat something and go to sleep. It got pretty normal but I didn't really like it. The real kicker was if I came back from my presentation and started playing game on my PC, I'd be able to stay up the whole next night if I really tried. I never quite did that but I was always tempted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been getting no more than 4 hours of sleep a night for the past 3 months, usually less (ACT practice/college applications suck). It was rough at first, but after the first month I just never felt tired anymore. Even now when things are more relaxed and I have free time, I literally can't sleep for more than 4 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a professor in college that slept 2 hours every night. He'd get up before sunrise, go to his farm and tend to it, go to school and teach classes until the afternoon, then stay help students in his office till evening, then go back to his farm, then head home, grade papers and such, and then go to sleep and do it all again. He never seemed tired. Although he did drink about 2 pots of coffee a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work Mondays to Fridays 9-5.30 and rarely sleep before 3 in the morning. I don't sleep about 2 Saturday nights every month to make the weekend basically 1 long day for gaming or watching shows that I want to catch up with. Once you're into the routine of it all it's actually surprisingly easy to do. Just have to be careful of the sudden crash that can hit if you're sitting still doing nothing for too long </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I only get an hour of sleep, I won't feel it until later in the afternoon the next day, and even then I don't find it that hard to push through. Last week one day, I was up for 22 straight hours after I got 2 hours of sleep the night before. At the end of that 22 hours I didn't really feel that tired as I was laying down for bed. However I then slept so hard I didn't dream and woke up 8 hours later. </p>
<p>Genes are amazing. </p></div>		</li>
