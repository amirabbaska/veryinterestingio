			<div class="markdown"><p>News outlets having a political affiliation is a well-known fact. Bias in the media is, unfortunately, the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>Any idea which American news outlets can be viewed as 'truly' independent, if any?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the million dollar argument right now. </p>
<p>Politifact isn't so much a news source,  as it is a fact checker. I normally read an article or two from. Different sides and see if they have done research on the topic or some claims. </p>
<p>Unfortunately,  main stream media is the status quo, so read it with a grain of salt and form your own opinions and back them up with facts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>News outlets have always had political affiliation. In fact there are still newspapers with the name &quot;Democrat&quot; in their names. I don't know of any with the word &quot;Republican&quot; in their names but they probably exist. I think I'll look into it after this post and I'll edit if necessary. If I'm wrong I'll eat my words. Anyway the concept of a &quot;fair and objective&quot; media is a myth. Edit: those papers do exist but not as many in the past and some are owned by people who belong to the other party. It's kind of interesting actually. There are some weird ass newspaper names out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has always been the case though. In fact, the prominence of newspapers with a purposeful bias was more common in the 1800s. I live in Milwaukee and we have a long Socialist history. There were many newspapers specially published for socialists and labor leaders. </p>
<p>There is no such thing as a newspaper without a political leaning. There is however, news sources that perform actual analytical journalism and those are the ones you should be reading/watching. I will highly recommend ProPublica. They are truly independent. Their only funding is from their readers. They have won journalism
awards. They are fantastic. They are however not exactly a daily publication. They do deep journalism. There are plenty of great dailies though. The New York Times is independent. They're not owned by any major corporation. The company is rather large but it's not like MSNBC, Fox, CNN, corporate media. The New York Times has published thousands of publications and has stood the test of time becoming one of the most well-known and trusted sources in the country. Their stories do not tend to have a bias but most of their opinion columnists tend to be more liberal. They are making efforts to include more right leaning voices. I'll also recommend the Economist. The Economist is fairly widely known as relatively conservative on the economy but they are more left leaning in their social views. This isn't an American source but it's a good one. I personally like the NYT and WaPo. The Economist is great but because they're a weekly, by the time I get it, I've already heard and seen analysis of most of the stories. </p>
<p>For visual media or audio media, try something like PBS News Hour. They make concerted efforts to stay neutral and I think they do a great job. I've seen some Trump supporters call them liberal propaganda. Whatever. I have never gotten that sense. Anything that rightfully criticizes him is automatically branded as fake news propaganda. PBS has a lot of other fantastic shows like Frontline, which is award winning journalism. If you're liberal, there's always the Young Turks. Also podcasts like Pod Save America. There's a great podcast from the more moderate libertarian point of view called Common Sense. I really like listening to him. There's also NPR which is fantastic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>CNN is as much news today as MTV is music</p></div>		</li>
