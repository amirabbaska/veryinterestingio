			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey OP, if we’re going to be splitting hairs, your use of “nauseous” in your question is grammatically incorrect as it means “to cause nausea”. You should’ve used “nauseated” to describe feeling nausea, as was the intent of your question. </p>
<p>Edit: OP, you used “nauseous” correctly. You don’t need to edit your title, even though I know you were joking and Reddit won’t let you anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a professional editor, armchair grammarians who try to enforce arbitrary &quot;rules&quot; that have no relation to the actual structure and established usage of English make me nauseous.</p>
<p>But you <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nauseous" target="_blank">don't have to take my word for it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who insist that <em>nauseous</em> can properly be used only to mean &quot;causing nausea&quot; and that its later &quot;affected with nausea&quot; meaning is an error for <em>nauseated</em> are mistaken. Current evidence shows these facts: <em>nauseous</em> is most frequently used to mean physically affected with nausea, usually after a linking verb such as <em>feel</em> or <em>become</em>; figurative use is quite a bit less frequent. Use of <em>nauseous</em> to mean &quot;causing nausea or disgust&quot; is much more often figurative than literal, and this use appears to be losing ground to <em>nauseating</em>. <em>Nauseated</em> is used more widely than <em>nauseous</em> when referring to being affected with nausea.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this the human body is full of 'design flaws'.</p>
<p>For example the optic nerve goes <em>through</em> the retina which means you have a blind spot in each eye about 15 degrees off central vision. Your brain compensates for this by filling in the blank spot by combining the image from both eyes. You can see this blind spot by closing on eye and moving a pencil or pen 15 degrees off central vision; you wont be able to see the end of the pencil/ pen.</p>
<p>This is the nature of being evolved creatures; evolution can't go back and correct 'errors' in our 'design'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this answer. I see there is a whole spectrum of people's experiences here, but I definitely get this feeling in the worst way. I actually throw up when I get that nauseous from not eating enough which is such a confusing thing to me, but I guess that makes sense if it's a build up of the fluids. I used to keep a PB&amp;J sandwich by my bed at night in college in case I started to get nauseous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong, but based on my own experiences, I think this is the feeling a lot of women get when they're pregnant. I would start to feel queasy if I didn't eat when I was pregnant, so I ended up having to snack pretty much all the time. Sometimes I'd have to eat something small in the middle of the night, too. If I made sure to eat a little bit throughout the day and at night, I wouldn't feel sick at all. Of course, I gained 40 pounds with each pregnancy, so pregnant women should take my advice with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, those are totally what I would use nowadays! Back in college, I did play a sport and was a fairly small person, so I justified it by remembering I'd already had practice 2+ hours that day. Now that I'm lazy and not as small, I definitely have no need for the extra calories!</p></div>		</li>
