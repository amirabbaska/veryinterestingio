			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a followup to this? You mentioned vitamine B12. As far as I know we (humans) cannot produce it because the fermentation occurs in the colon and that's too late to absorb it, but cows can because fermentation occurs before it reaches the small bowel. How does it work in horses and other herbivores with regards to this vitamin?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cats, on the other hand, must find an external source of niacin and therefor must eat every 3-5 days or they will die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Errr, what? Cats canâ€™t survive for more than 5 days without food? I find that hard to believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats get permanent liver (or other internal organ) damage after just a few days of not eating. Afaik, this is not the case with big cats.</p>
<p>This can be a bad situation for pet cat owners because when a cat gets sick, they stop eating. Not eating can be worse than the illness itself.</p></div>		</li>
