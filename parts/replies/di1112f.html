			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also another thing: low voltage cutout. When the battery reach a certain low voltage, a protection in the device kick in and stop it from draining power. This prevent an over discharge, which can cause the battery to leak.</p>
<p>Once the load is shut off, the battery voltage recover, but the protection is still active: it is the same cell, so still discharged.</p>
<p>Removing the cell and reinserting it cause the protection to reset, and you can now use a bit more power out of the same cell.</p>
<p>Of course, this also mean that you may be overdischarging the cell, and cause internal shell corrosion at an accelerated speed. This mean that the cell can leak faster than expected.</p>
<p>For example, duracell garanty that their cells is good for atleast 10 years with over like 80% energy left and still won't leak. However, a fully empty cell may leak after just a bit over a year.</p>
<p>So, the duracell cell in your remote control may last 15 years, but leak in a forgotten toy after maybe 1.5 year.</p>
<p>edit: eevblog on youtube made a video about the batterizer scam, one of them cover the recovery, discharge curve and all. I'm too lazy to link it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of OP question, this is likely the answer. Especially in mice that may use rechargeble batteries. It is a protective mechanism in place to protect the battery to prevent over drain, so you can recharge it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>everything ive seen that kind of protection circuit in, measures the voltage from the battery then cuts it off.  removing and placing in same nearly dead battery wouldnt do anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Joule Thief&quot; type circuits aren't entirely without merit (they're used in most solar yard lights sold today), but there are limits on their usefulness:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They rapidly DESTROY rechargable batteries. It's why the NiCd, NiMH, or Lithium batteries used in solar yard lights die by mid-winter... they don't get enough light to fully recharge during the day, and fully drain the previous day's charge HOURS before dawn.</p>
</li>
<li>It only works well enough to be useful with very low-power devices (like LEDs). Think about an &quot;empty&quot; ketchup bottle with residue clinging to the inside. You can wring out every last drop by putting the bottle in a centrifuge, but ultimately, there's not much left TO extract. You might extract enough residue for one more hamburger, but it's not going to magically provide enough for an extra-value-supersized pail of french fries.</li>
</ul>
<p>A JT circuit <em>would</em> have been pretty handy to have 20 years ago to build into Palm Pilots (they didn't draw much power, but cheap store-brand Alkaline cells only lasted about half as long as Duracell/Energizer because they had a relatively high &quot;brownout&quot; voltage), but if you tried that with a modern Android device or iPhone that uses lithium batteries, all you'd achieve is the battery's destruction within days, for maybe an extra 5-15 minutes of active use for the first few days.</p></div>		</li>
