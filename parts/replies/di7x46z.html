<p>Which sucks!  I learned of this recently and was very pissed-off, you feel cheated when you <em>ass</em>ume something is consistent, I mean part of the idea of branding is so the customer can count on something being the same - you go to different McDonald's, you're supposed to get the same burger regardless of location.  For me it was Levi's jeans, I love(d?) them as I could count on the <em>sizes</em> being right, I could order them online w/o trying them on because they were homogeneous <em>in that context</em>, it was only recently that I found out the reason for the discrepancies in how long different pairs would last, or keep color before fading, because they use inferior quality with some retailers <em>and pass it off as being regular</em>, nowhere is it said &quot;levi's, <em>outlet-version</em>&quot; for the consumer to know the product is different, I've bought multiple pairs that I would not have had I known they were inferior to my first (more expensive) pair - I'd thought it was great I could find the jeans I loved for great prices, and after almost a year I found out why.  'Fraud' comes to mind though I'm sure it only applies in spirit here, not in any practical/legal context :/</p></div>		</li>

<p>levi's with the big E are the old-style selvedge denim. dunno how old you are, but these are more like the levi's from back in the day.  selvedge denim is a huge thing again, enough for cheaper brands to put a fake selvedge line on the bottom ends of the leg so they look more quality. people laughed at me for buying multiple pairs of $300 jeans, but i'm still wearing them years later, and not only are they still holding up, but the fadez are sick, bro. they're more expensive, but worth it. i'd rather buy one pair of siicckkk $300 jeans per year that last years, than 6 pairs of $50 jeans that only last a few months. </p></div>		</li>

Also find that they have 50%+ off quite a few times.  Snagged several pairs for ~$20-30 around christmas time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outlet stores used to sell excess stock and seconds (minor flaws). But they would only have a single sale once a year and at only a single location. Due to popular demand and to fool people to think they are getting a deal, they started making outlet-specific clothing to be sold year-round at multiple &quot;outlet&quot; locations. No longer good quality for lower prices like in the late 80's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather selection is also a lot more static. I worked at Old Navy, and got a Banana Republic discount because of it. Full retail banana stores would get new cuts, patterns, materials and a much greater selection of clothes each season. Outlets BR stores had the same clothes all year long besides rotating sweaters and knits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a Banana Republic distribution warehouse in college. I can say for a fact that we constantly sent stuff to the local outlet stores. Now I know there are also items specifically made for the outlet stores, but they also got real clothes that were &quot; defective&quot;. And it was for little stuff, the box came in and was suppose to be dark blue shirts but when opened it was light blue, no actual defects, just the wrong color, whole box would go to outlet. I think the worst &quot;defect&quot; I ever saw was short sleeve shirts that were suppose to be long sleeve &amp; another shirt that was a button down that was suppose to have a map pattern covering the whole thing but just showered up in plain tan. My only disclaimer is that this was over 20 years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Once you step above the fast fashion, unashamedly cheap and cheerful, polyester shit show that is high street fashion warehouses it's much of a muchness in terms of quality of make and design as long as you learn to understand the difference between subjective quality (Does it fit me? Is it a good cut for my body? Does the colour, shape and material blend well with the things I'm going to wear it with? Does it make my bum look big?) and objective quality (Is the cloth well made and appropriate to use? Is the stitching durable and attractive? Is the lining well attached and appropriate? Is the garment going to survive the length of time I want to wear it considering the amount of care I'm willing to invest in its upkeep? Does it make my bum look big?) you can dress very well for many years for a moderate spend, at least as a man. </p>
<p>Always remember this rule of thumb &quot;Shirts are made of cotton, suits are made of wool. And never wear plastic next to your skin if it wasn't designed by NASA.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is polyester &quot;plastic&quot;? If so I don't think this is accurate at all. For example I have pieces from Arcteryx made of poly that breathe better than Versace linen pieces I own.</p>
<p>If I am not in a situation where I should be wearing a fashion brand, I prefer to wear tech fabrics. Of course Merino wool is the current darling of that industry, and I do love it, but I have poly tech pieces from not only Arcteryx but Iceberg, Outlier, etc that breathe far better than pieces* constructed out of all natural fiber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is but you seem to be talking about the design by NASA tier of quality.  My, thankfully now ex, wife once bought me a fifteen dollar target business shirt. It was 100% polyester and possibly the most disgusting, disturbing and horrible thing ever wraught by the hands of man. It was shiny, Itchy, sweaty and wrong in every way that a shirt can be wrong. No NASA involvement there, just lots and lots of cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Pay no mind to the ecological whatsits below.  There are newly fishless rivers in India and China that literally run bright blue with the dye runoff from denim factories, not to mention the huge amount of used-to-be food producing land and the gigantic quantities of water it takes to grow cheap cotton to make the denim in the first place. Plastic's fine from that point of view, especially if it's made from chemicals that are produced in another process and would be landfill otherwise. Neither is most plastic used in clothing going to raise your cancer risk more than walking along a busy road to buy the five dollar shiny shirt in the first place.</p>
<p>No, the problem with wearing plastic next to your skin (and if that's how you're wearing your jacket then you're jacketing wrong) is that it will itch, make you sweat like a cheese in summer and make you smell bad. It will also make you feel and act like a sweaty, itchy, smelly person wearing a cheap five dollar shirt that smells, itches, creases weirdly and is shiny in all the wrong ways. Spend twenty or thirty bucks more and buy a reasonable shirt made of cotton. You'll feel a thousand times better about yourself and you won't ponk like a teenager with a hormone rush. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect answer. I think this goes for most things: it's worth spending a bit of money on the thing, but there's definitely a point past which you're spending <em>too much</em> money on the thing. </p>
<p>eg. I always buy leather bags/boots because non-leather $30 boots last me three months. So I'll spend $150 on a pair of boots that will last me years but I'm sure as hell not gonna spend $900 on them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-leather actually ranges MASSIVELY in quality and durability also, and in some cases its better quality (no water staining).</p>
<p>At the top end of the fake leather market, you find brands like Stella Mccartney - the shoes and bags will last just as long as high-end leather brands (a lifetime if taken care of)... but the price is $600-1500 for shoes and bags so out of question for a lot of people...</p>
<p>BUT! Because Veganism is gaining popularity a lot of vegan fashion brands are trying to hit that mid tier point. Brands like Beyond Skin (shoes) and Jill Milan (bags) have AMAZING and beautiful &quot;leather&quot; products that are at a reasonable fashion cost ($100-$400), they are made sustainably (no sweat shops) and are being worn a lot on the red carpet now! You should check it out ! Fast fashion is killing a lot of animals and the planet and so if we make it &quot;cool&quot; we can still look amazing and save the planet! Win win.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A really good pair of leather boots, the sort that would last years and years, cost fifty dollars. This was beyond his pocket and the most he could hope for was an affordable pair of boots costing ten dollars, which might with luck last a year or so before he would need to resort to makeshift cardboard insoles so as to prolong the moment of shelling out another ten dollars.</p>
<p>Therefore over a period of ten years, he might have paid out a hundred dollars on boots, twice as much as the man who could afford fifty dollars up front ten years before. And he would still have wet feet.</p>
