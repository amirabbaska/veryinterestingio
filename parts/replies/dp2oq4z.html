			<div class="markdown"><p>Twenty minutes is excessive. Unless you left your hand on a burner for 20 minutes, it's not going to take 20 minutes to bring it back down to temperature. Five minutes is plenty time to be cooling a burn for, so long as you don't require a trip to the hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I burn myself regularly (hobbyist blacksmith) and the longer you cool the burn, the better it heals. It makes a phenomenal difference, like you wouldn't believe. Cool it in running water for 20 minutes minimum, and it scars less, blisters less, hurts less. Especially do this is if doesn't hurt, because that's a third degree burn and you've killed the nerves in that area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree! One time I burned the heck out of my fingers... Blisters, pain(!), etc. Ran it under cold water for forever, felt MUCH better! Pain went from a 7 to a 3...</p>
<p>Here's where it gets weird: a couple of years later, I had a very similar burn... Same place, mechanism, etc. Ran cool water over it, and it felt much better. But... I was heading for bed, couldn't keep running water on it. Put ice and water in a hot water bottle, wrapped it in a thin towel, and slept with my hand on it. </p>
<p>Next day, literally zero pain. I had the blisters, and it LOOKED like a burn, but absolutely no pain and no peri-burn swelling. I haven't had a chance to recheck the methodology (have avoided burns), but this one example was freaking magic. So... My new theory is 20 mins isn't long enough. HOURS is my new strategy :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>cool down a burn for 20 minutes. This is much longer than anyone typically cools down a burn for, because in the case of minor burns you'll start feeling relief much before then. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can quote it all you like, but the physics of it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Granted, I only know this from sous vide cooking, but if you look at this <a href="http://douglasbaldwin.com/sous-vide.html#Table_2.2" target="_blank">thickness chart</a>, it takes a 5 mm thick steak 5 minutes to get up to the temperature of the bath its in. Given that the center is 2.5 mm away, that's how long it takes for the heat to penetrate that far.</p>
<p>Similarly, the reverse is happening when you're cooling a burn. 2.5 mm is the depth of a typical second degree burn (partial penetration into the dermis), hence 5 minutes. If you need to get 20 minutes of cooling, i.e. 5 mm in, that's a third degree burn, bordering on a fourth degree burn. At that point, it's made it into fat layers. As I said:</p>

<p>What kinda cooking are you talking about? You talking about a mix from the store (don't hurt me, legit question), cooking by recipe, or cooking completely on your own?</p>
<p>Reason I ask is because box/prefab mix, and even recipes out of a book, take that ongoing cooking into account. A lot of times they'll even say right on the instructions &quot;let cool for :10&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to insult you by equating Betty Crocker Yellow Cake Mix to the kind of thing someone who enjoys baking would do.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make the point that a lot of recipes, especially printed, likely already take that into account and you may actually be undercooking stuff. </p></div>		</li>
