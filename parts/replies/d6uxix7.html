			<div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but there is more to this question as well. There is an &quot;exchange zone&quot; for the baton pass. This zone can be used to lengthen the distance that the fastest legs can run and shorten the slowest. The fastest runner could potentially run 110m while the slowest could run just 90.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very late to the party, but the final piece of the puzzle is reaction time. In both races there is a time delay at the beginning as the runner has to react to the sound of the gun before starting to accelerate, which typically takes around 0.15s at an elite level. That delay is also eliminated by the running start changeovers between the subsequent legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the fastest could run 120 and the slowest 80</p>
<p>Remember that the exchange box goes 10 metres before and after the 100m marks. Thus on the 2nd and 3rd runners could potentially run 120 if they change it properly, obviously cannot do it in the same race</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone looked into this or know detailed strategy in these races? I'm curious to know if they organize the race using this fact. I expect it mostly rests on whether elite runners can accelerate in 10 meters to roughly the speed you are at around 90 meters into your run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As my high school physics teacher told us, this is also why a 200m dash is faster than 2 100m dashes. Both 100m times have to accelerate vs the one 200m.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also helps explain why the Japanese (!!!) were able to win the silver in the Olympic men's 4 X 100m at Rio.</p>
<p>Compare 100m PR (personal record) times for the runners from the US vs. Japan.</p>
<p>100m personal records for the 4 Americans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justin Gatlin: 9.74</li>
<li>Mike Rodgers: 9.85</li>
<li>Tyson Gay: 9.69</li>
<li>Trayvon Bromell: 9.84</li>
</ul>
<p>100m personal records for the 4 Japanese:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryota Yamagata: 10.05</li>
<li>Shota Iizuka: 10.22</li>
<li>Yoshihide Kiryu: 10.01</li>
<li>Aska Cambridge: 10.10</li>
</ul>
<p>So US average is 9.78 and Japanese average is 10.10 - basically no competition at all.  In an open 100 the 4 Americans would leave the 4 Japanese runners in the dust.</p>
<p>In the 4 x 100m, however, the question is how quickly can you get the baton around the track?  Can you keep the velocity of the baton up throughout the race? Most importantly can you keep the velocity up in the transition (passing) zones?</p>
<p>The Japanese, who had been practicing together for more than a year showed a masterful ability to keep the baton velocity up in the transition zones.  The Japanese receivers basically took the baton while running at (almost) top speed from their respective passers.</p>
<p>In the case of the Americans, however, the receivers in every instance either weren't up to full speed when they took the baton, or they had to slow down to avoid receiving the baton out of the passing zone.</p>
<p>Recall that the Japanese team ran 37.60 and the US ran 37.64.  So in the 4 x 100m final the splits probably looked something like this:</p>
<p>100m splits for the 4 Americans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Justin Gatlin: 9.84 (curve in leg 1 is usually slower because of turn)</li>
<li>Mike Rodgers: 9.32</li>
<li>Tyson Gay: 9.17</li>
<li>Trayvon Bromell: 9.31</li>
<li>Team = 37.64</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically US legs 2, 3, and 4 run about 0.5 seconds better than each individual runner's PR.  Each runner spends a significant part of his leg at something less than top speed.</p>
<p>100m splits for the 4 Japanese:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryota Yamagata: 10.15 (again slower on leg 1)</li>
<li>Shota Iizuka: 9.26</li>
<li>Yoshihide Kiryu: 9.05</li>
<li>Aska Cambridge: 9.14</li>
<li>Team = 37.60</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically Japanese legs 2, 3, and 4 run &gt; 0.9 seconds (!!!) better than each individual runner's PR.  Each runner basically ran his leg without slowing down significantly.</p>
<p>Most people underestimate the power of teamwork in the 4 x 100m, but the Japanese clearly showed that by working together and keeping the baton speed up a team can overcome significant deficits in individual talent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The failure of the US team is more likely linked to their isolated individual training than any coaching defiencies. The us men don't train together. They practice with their own clubs and coaches and only work on relays in the time leading up to the game every four years. Learning to time a handoff to get it near your top velocity takes a lot of trial and error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought Gatlin ran the second leg.  It makes much more sense for him to do that, because it allows him to take the baton in the start of the exchange (which coincidentally resulted in a DQ) and hand off at the end of the exchange to Tyson Gay.  Regardless, that's a good explanation.  USA men always have terrible stick work in the 4x100, and it was no exception at Rio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad.  Olympics result site had order flipped.  You can make similar assumptions about his split.</p>
<p>BTW, teams often put their fastest guy in the #2 spot (as opposed to #4) - and Gatlin is clearly the fastest guy on the team.  Why?  In the 2nd position (and the 3rd) a runner can actually run a longer distance - up to 120m - which results in a faster time.</p>
<p>How?  By receiving the baton at the beginning of the passing zone (#1 &gt; #2 transition) , and passing right at the end of the passing zone (#2 &gt; #3 transition). </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This really puts it in perspective. IIRC Bolt was about 30 - 40 years ahead of the WR improvement curve. I wonder how long will it take to someone come close, let alone beat his records (Yohan Blake was close in 200m but I'm fairly confident he won't ever be able to repeat that).</p></div>		</li>
