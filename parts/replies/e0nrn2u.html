			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;ideal&quot; zone for this with regards to the math. When it comes to volume to surface area, infinitely larger is always better. Our more realistic limitations come down to engines. If you want to lift more weight off the ground, you need more thrust. This either means a more powerful engine (tons of great documentaries on the technical challenges faced with the F1), or more engines (the route that SpaceX is going -- The N1 famously failed because it couldn't coordinate that many engines, but software is much more capable of handling that today)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another limiting factor is materials. we cant just scale up our current rockets arbitrarily and expect them to withstand the extreme forces of a launch. this isnt a problem yet but eventually may put an upper limit on what can be put into orbit. hopefully by then we'll be building our orbital structures out of lunar material or asteroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You start running into other limiting factors the larger you go. Material and overall stability start to become an issue, as does engine efficiency. And then practical concerns start intruding, like how do you get sections from where they're produced to where the vehicle is assembled and to be launched. So there's a sweet spot to hit, and that's where things like the Soyuz and Falcon Heavy seem to be operating right now.</p></div>		</li>
