			<div class="markdown"><p>No actually they're both partially right. It's a combined mass and heat transfer problem; it's not just heat transfer and it's not just mass transfer. The real question is which is the limiting resistance. Is the heat transfer slowest, or is the mass transfer of CO2 away from the surface slowest? That question is much harder to answer qualitatively.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paper is crazy good insulator. Air is too. Both have low values for spesicif heat capacity. You might need some significant convection above the paper to remove the heat. Which would make it again mass transfer problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the lack of oxygen is far more important. The guy uses a flame because it suits his example, but the paper is not what limits the heat, it's the trapped Co2. Take a soldering iron and use it to ignite the paper instead and it will go up in flames. Or, use the flame on top of the paper and it will ignite more easily as well. That is why he is wrong. The CO2 build up limits the amount of combustion underneath the paper, and therefore the heat. It doesn't fail to ignite simply because the heat is being dispersed through conduction. While it does have some effect, it is certainly not the primary factor. The absence of oxygen is absolutely the primary factor. The fact that he doesn't mention oxygen at all makes him wrong. I would have been inclined to agree with him if he mentioned oxygen anywhere in his answer, but he didn't.</p>
<p>The answer you linked is correct, but that answer is different from taggedjc's answer, because he also states that the gas is what limits the heat transfer. Taggedjc's answer pretends that air is some super conducting material that disperses the heat before it can reach combustion temperatures, and that simply is not what is responsible for the failure to combust. He even states that &quot;Conduction and heat-sinking play only a very minor role as paper is a poor thermal conducter&quot;. </p>
<p>So as you see, readytoruple agrees with me and disagrees with taggedjc. You managed to contradict yourself and prove me right with your own link, well done.</p></div>		</li>
