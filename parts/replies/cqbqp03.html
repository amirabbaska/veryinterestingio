			<p>You are one of the few to notice this.<br><br>I would say though that 15% is getting large and is ripe for disruption. That number and that number alone is why TV is changing so quickly.<br><br>TV itself will become much cheaper. Anybody with good negotiation skills and some cash can resell movies and TV. There will be little price differentiation between services.<br><br>Content owners will always make money because they have unique products. CBS makes 30% profit.<br><br>Unfortunately, Internet service will become much more expensive. The costs to convince someone to climb a telephone pole in a thunderstorm as well as the cost of copper or glass fiber will not collapse until we are saturated with more bandwidth than we need.<br><br>Cable companies are in three businesses. 1. Internet access. 2. Content Owners, 3. Content resellers.<br><br>The cost of the cable (or wireless) to you is relatively fixed but will shift between those businesses. </p>		</li>
