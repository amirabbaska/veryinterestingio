<p>But to be clear, neural networks are not AI. </p>
<p>AI is made of many different subfields. The dominant paradigm in AI is machine learning. Machine learning (ML) is the ability for machines to make decisions without being explicitly programmed. There many different models of machine learning. Examples of ML models include decision tress, naive bayes, and K Nearest Neighbor. (There are dozens of machine learning models).</p>
<p>TLDR good video. Neural nets are not AI.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neural net analysis is regularly used in ML to combine the methods you listed (along with other methods) for analysis. I use them all the time to create and train models for machine learning. As a caveat to my statement, I am studying data mining in grad school, not AI or CS. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, i completely agree.</p>
<p>Going back to my &quot;how do animal work&quot; example, responding with neural networks it much like responding with a video on the food cycle for animals. (Not literally, of course)</p>
<p>I personally think that the video is a somewhat nice introduction to <strong>a</strong> field in AI, which then might spark interest in other areas. But that's just me :D</p></div>		</li>
