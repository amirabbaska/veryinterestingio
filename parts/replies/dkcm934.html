			<div class="markdown"><p>I plotted some of the data from that website: <a href="http://imgur.com/EuQW7lp" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/EuQW7lp</a></p>
<p>I compared the US to Japan because <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/02/24/national/media-national/japans-vegetarians-stay-in-the-closet/#.WW1hasZok0o" target="_blank">vegetarianism seems quite rare in Japan</a>. There does seem to a slight decrease of meat consumption in the US since 2007 where there isn't one in Japan, though we still eat a lot of meat overall. If anyone knows another country that would be good to compare let me know and I'll add it to the graph.</p>
<p>From that website, food supply kcal/capita/day of bovine meat, pigmeat, poultry meat, mutton &amp; goat meat, meat meal, and meat other over all available years. I decided not to count seafood because pescatarians seem to be a part of the vegetarianism movement, though I bet Japan's meat consumption would be much closer to ours if I included it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently read that meat demand has actually decreased in Germany, but production is still increasing, due to exports.</p>
<p>But bottom line, yes, vegetarianism and veganism do have a measurable impact on meat consumption. But the increase on a global scale due to a higher standard of living in many developing countries like China make it look insignificant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is basically just Berlin. There I found tons of vegetarian and vegan stuff, but go to Munich or Cologne or something and its a different story from what I can see, nevermind the smaller cities/towns all over the place.  </p>
<p>Would be interesting to see a breakdown of trends by city/region in DE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a heavy understatement: &quot;we still eat a lot of meat overall&quot;. Right, US have the highest consumption of meat in the world! World wide average per capita is  ~42kg/year, whilst US average is 3x that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that you wouldn't want to look at per capita, as it's the absolute consumption that's the real issue, considering finite land, water, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if current trends continue you'd expect the world population to plateau and then slowly decline, so the per capital consumption will end up being very important in determining overall consumption in the future.</p>
<p>Also, the original question is &quot;do the people who are avoiding consumption make a sizable impact&quot; which can be true (or false) regardless of either per capita or total consumption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the whole point of OP's question is whether or not non-meat eaters are making a dent. Of course overall consumption will grow as the population does but the question being asked is whether or not we would be measurably even <em>worse</em> off without the vegetarian portion of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be shocked if the per capita was declining given the economic progress we have been making, especially in terms of combating world hunger. This question seems very developed world focused, which is fair, but I think we are forgetting that countless people are just struggling to get enough protein to stay healthy...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The right question to be asking is if meat consumption is accelerating or decelerating relative to the rate of population growth. There are more people, so of course consumption would go up absolutely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I checked some of the datasets provided by the link from wichtich.</p>
<p>Meat production has increased everywhere. It has almost doubled in some places (e.g. China). So it has grown faster than the population (population growth is slowing down)</p>
<p>An important thing to keep in mind on this is that most people who consume little meat do so out of economic reasons. As poverty in the developing world decreases meat consumption will continue to increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is what would count as consumption? There's an enormous amount of food waste in the US. IIRC we have a massive dairy surplus, for example, which creates a lot of dairy food waste. Are we factoring in the overproduced amounts of meat into this question? Meat that's likely never consumed? Or are we factoring in the impact it has on the meat industry before any surplus?</p>
<p>We don't do food production intelligently in the US, so I imagine it's difficult to get reliable data. How much do we even know is actually being consumed?</p></div>		</li>
