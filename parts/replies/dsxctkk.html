			<div class="markdown"><p>You still have an estate, which is going to “own” all of your property and debt, someone will administer it.  That person’s job is to try to use your assets and money that you’ve left to pay off as much of your debt as they can.  So basically if you have nobody who qualifies as an executor(usually a relative) then your property is basically liquidated by the state to pay whatever debts you owe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine that would be very hard to prosecute. I also imagine that, if much of the eatates value was in tangible goods, such as valuable paintings, jewelry, antiques, etc that it would be hard to prove they were gifted, or that they were even owned in the first place, especially is the relative they were gifted to denies it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do have a family then the above statement is correct...you would be leaving your spouse and/or children in a precarious position. Also, check your life insurance policy, some have a rider on it that allows terminally I'll patients to access a percentage of the money prior to death...that you could use in any manner you want. Just a thought</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_conveyance" target="_blank">fraudulent conveyance</a> that covers this situation. It usually covers people who are about to go bankrupt, but it'd apply to someone who was about to die, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Statute of limitations (at least in california) is 2 years, so you could theoretically buy like, bitcoin, and set up something automated where your heirs don't get it for 2 years.</p>
<p>ofc by then the BTC might be worthless, or like, through the roof.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what.</p>
<p>Material goods can be repo'd and the recipients (if complicit) could be charged.</p>
<p>Ideally if you wanted to do this you would do it on &quot;experiences&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grand father wanted to go out with a bang, so he booked a world cruise for the entire family and paid for it all. He didn't tell us he paid with it on a credit card we thought he was just blowing his last savings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this such case, the creditors are most likely SoL. They can put liens and claims on the estate but such laws are quite complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my grandfather died he left some debt. Even though he was still married to my grandmother (they lived separately), because of state laws, she got to keep what was essentially his house and the debtors had to eat the debt. It wasn't a lot of money. Maybe $75k, and mostly credit card debt. </p></div>		</li>
