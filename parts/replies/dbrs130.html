			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I feel that the load is being distributed around the outer skin of a drop... even the bending loads (not unlike an I beam or a circular power pole resists bending on out outer edges).  At some point those loads have to reach inside the back of the tail and also accelerate the mass that's inside the fibers.  I believe this is what causes the stress concentration and starts the fracture.  This is all my theories after watching these particular failures.</p></div>		</li>
