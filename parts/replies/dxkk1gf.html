			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be just a crazy person on Reddit, but is there anyone else who thinks that orientation is just a societal thing?  Like, if no one ever talked about &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;straight&quot;, we'd all just be openly bi- or pan- and just be cool with that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I say yes you can absolutely be attracted to a man even if you a straight man. I don’t think finding a person of the same sex’s physical features admirable or good looking makes you homosexual. Personal example, I think marylin Manson pre 2000’s was “attractive” as fuck. Total badass, did what he wanted said what he wanted, had a very unique and shocking look that was pretty androgynous. All of those things I find attractive just not sexually. That’s the difference. Finding some one appealing to look at versus being sexually excited by the way they look is what I would say draws the line between straight or homosexual when considering someone attractive. </p></div>		</li>

<p>David Bowie is extremely sexy and attractive to me. Just how the human brain works. </p></div>		</li>
