			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is in Planet Earth, they mention that the redwoods are so tall that can't grow taller anymore. The fog is one of the reasons they can grow taller than average trees; they pull water from the air instead of having to haul all the water from their roots. </p>
<p>The rings you are thinking of are called fairy rings. When a redwood loses its trunk, the roots remain. The remaining stump can then sprout new growth using the root system of a huge tree. That is why you see rings around stumps. </p></div>		</li>
