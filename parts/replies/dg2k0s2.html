			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAD, but If you used to stay up late regularly in the past, it would be similar to people who get red noses from drinking too much too often. The blood vessels aren't 100% elastic, so if they're regularly dilated, they'll stay that way until you take the time to actively counteract it. Stress is a factor too as it also releases cortisol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thickness of the skin under your eyes is genetic, so if you were born with really thin skin, then the colour underneath is seen much more easily than someone with thicker skin. For some people the skin is so thin that the colour is always seen.</p></div>		</li>
