			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't know about shaking your hands I don't really do that. If I slam my finger I will squeeze it like hell. Pressure on any wound, whether it's a cut or contusion, always makes it feel better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, if this was the case pressing the skin with your other hand or against something should be way more effective in stopping the pain than shaking. That isn't what we do though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you stub your toe you grab it and if you bang your knee you rub it. Thats because light touch sensation travels on a faster tract than pain. Proprioception, which is the sensation of where your limbs are in space, also interferes with the pain signal. This as well as the psuedo light touch from the wind you make with your fingers waving through air probably combines to be more effective than just touching alone</p>
<p>Look up gate theory if you want more specifics</p>
<p>Edit: gate control theory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps its a partially social construct? Not as effective as pressing, but communicates to others what happened and that you're in pain so they don't try to touch it. Just a guess though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually do both; when I get hurt, my first reaction is some stupid hasty blend of shacking, squeezing it, and if possible shoving it in my mouth(and it usually feels better IMO if I put some sort of pressure on it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the same exact thing. Shaking is usually the initial reaction, but then squeezing the hurt part as hard as I can usually makes the pain go away and if that doesn't work I'll bite the area. Biting it should make it hurt more but it doesn't. Of course im biting around the area and not directly on top of it. So say i slammed my finger, I'd then shake, squeeze it as hard as i can, and then bite the whole finger. But if I cut the finger I'd just squeeze and then suck/bite around the cut and not directly on it. I've been doing this for years...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I'm on board with this method too. If I get hurt anywhere other than my hands, though, I tend to add pacing in a small circle while holding/ rubbing the area. I don't know if it's the same principle as shaking, but fast-walking around a tiny area really seems to help (might just be a placebo effect though). </p>
<p>Oh, and cursing. So much cursing. </p></div>		</li>
