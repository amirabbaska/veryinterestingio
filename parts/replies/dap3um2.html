			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking the top comment to provide an additional perspective:</p>
<p>While the severity was definitely a really huge deal, the affected areas were blown way out of proportions. I'm working for a hotel in East Africa and the visitor drop was enormous. Even guests from South Africa, who should know better, cancelled their stays because they were scared of &quot;EBOLA IN AFRICA&quot; news. We sometimes had people from Europe call and ask whether we already had ebola. I wanted to tell them no, but I could try preordering it for them.</p>
<p>It's all fun and games until people start losing their job because of media and internet craze. Especially in poor areas, where sometimes crime is the one thing left if the economy breaks down. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Trevor Noah, being South African, had a pretty good comment about this. He said everyone back home was worried about him going to the United States because they were worried he'd get ebola.</p></div>		</li>

Our best method was to illustrate that the distance it would take to drive from Free Town in Sierra Leone to Capetown in South Africa would get you from New York City to San Francisco <strong>and back again.</strong> People just had no sense of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important reason ebola spread so fast had to with local cultural practices regarding embalming of the diseased. This of course went against the clickbait news narrative that ebola was the ultimate killer disease. Ebola was one of the most horrible disease outbreaks of our time but still the overblown fear in the west actually helped to actually end it instead of just something horrible that happens in 'Africa'. </p>
<p>Lets hope for a huge media fear for waterborne diseases in the media next. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently attended a Global Health Conference where Dr. Alaa Murabit, a UN Sustainable Development Goal Advocate, made some interesting comments on this.</p>
<p>Essentially, the ebola outbreak was well known in Western Africa. Doctors were being dispatched from the affected and neighboring countries to help, and emergency community-focused relief efforts (especially directed towards local medical practitioners and female populations) were well underway before the WHO declared the state of emergency and entered the fray. </p>
<p>Global involvement made matters worse in many areas, as medical aid was now being controlled by a global panel and centralized in large military operations. Medical care was now associated with long trips to military bases, being surrounded by intimidating foreign personnel, and being stigmatized with a globally reviled disease. Many rural affected stayed away, and because of quarantines doctors were no longer allowed to aid local practitioners and women. Additionally, global travel bans and aid organizations further brought media attention to the disease, causing stigmatization of West African populations (both affected and unaffected) around the world. In all, it was a mess that hindered efforts and made the response clumsy and worse than it could have went.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that the media was so eager to pick up on this (partly due to coinciding with 2014 midterm elections) was troublesome, as compared to other global health crises ebola was a relatively isolated outbreak. With proper response, it should have remained contained to the outbreak area and would have been eventually treated out of the population. The chaos caused by the media storm caused it to spread further and get a great deal of attention when it was not nearly as dangerous as other global health crises.</p>
<p>Speaking from memory, so there may be some small inaccuracies. I was really just fascinated at how something we might see as a positive global effort (i.e. WHO declared emergencies) can really cause a whole lot of problems on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why people are concerned about Ebola is:</p>
<p>1) It has an extremely high fatality rate.</p>
<p>2) It is unusual (flu season is normal, Ebola isn't).</p>
<p>3) There's no vaccine.</p>
<p>4) It is one of those &quot;worst case scenario&quot; diseases that gets talked about periodically.</p>

<p>There's no evidence at all that the media contributed to the spread of the disease. Countries locking down hardcore on Ebola is necessary; it is a nasty, nasty disease. It has long been feared that Ebola would make it to a major population center and infect a lot of people, and it finally did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely. However, in talking to people who were in West Africa during the ebola crisis, you can find quite easily that the WHO's boots on the ground approach not only kept the disease confined to the region, but also helped to decimate the traditional medical processes that helped treat people to begin with. It exacerbated an already tenuous situation and made it much worse for the primary care givers who were trying to handle the situation.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn't have insinuated that the media helped definitively spread the disease, but it's tough to ignore that the media's choice to focus on the disease hindered the actual treatment and healing of affected populations. The reality is that people in North America were at a very low risk of being affected by the crisis, yet the media storm that took place around it resulted in negative reactions towards West African populations in America, stigmatization of the entire region resulting in economic losses, and an overall misunderstanding of how global disease transmission works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does anything ever not coincide with US elections?  You guys seem to be in a permanent state of election season, whether it's presidential, mid-terms, full-terms, half-terms or whatever other crazy stuff you do, and election season seems to start 2 years in advance of the actual elections with 2 years of constant media coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with what Dr Alaa Murabit said, there were certainly a lot of mistakes made in the response by the international community. However just to balance out what you've said we shouldn't forget the huge positive role the international community played in stopping the spread of Ebola. </p>
<p>I've worked on healthcare in Sierra Leone for a short time post Ebola so I've some (limited) experience of the healthcare system there. The entire healthcare system was incredibly under prepared to deal with such an outbreak. </p>
<p>For example, medical staff lacked knowledge and practices (e.g. basic infection prevention and control such as hand washing) and equipment (e.g. gloves, soap, running water in hospitals) to deal with such an outbreak. This lead to a high rate of medical staff (almost 7% in Sierra Leone) becoming infected with Ebola and losing their lives. </p>
<p>This is just one small example of how Sierra Leone struggled to deal with Ebola on it's own. Mistakes were absolutely made by the response from the international community, but I believe the situation would have been much much worse without their assistance. I also completely agree that we should learn from the mistakes of that were made in the response to this outbreak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Laurie Garrett's 1994 book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coming-Plague-Emerging-Diseases-Balance-ebook/dp/B005FGR6RO" target="_blank">The Coming Plague</a>,</em> addresses this from the perspective of Centers for Disease Control and US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease specialists, and it makes a few things clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There have been local epidemics of highly infectious, highly lethal hemorrhagic plagues for as long as we've had written history. Literally. The Great Plague of Athens changed the outcome of the Peloponnesian War. (Hemorrhagic just means &quot;makes you bleed out.&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They always burn out when they run out of victims, which is why the parts of Africa where these fevers are native has a cultural reflex towards quarantine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Global air travel, global war, and global refugee flows make this a bit more of a risk.</p>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, even basic hygiene is enough to stop the spread of most of them altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent Ebola epidemic was hell on earth for people living in crowded urban slums with no sanitation and no clean water. It was a super-rare but serious risk for people in the developed world who came in contact with infected people. It was mostly solved the same way it's always been solved: proper quarantine and at least slightly better hygiene.</p></div>		</li>
