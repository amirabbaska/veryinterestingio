			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that I stop and think about that, I'd actually love a tattoo like that. Not as a blocky cover-up, but as a sleeve of intricate pattern-work that remains subtle enough that it's not what people immediately notice about you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually would be a pretty legit tattoo. Something nobody notices in, say, the winter when your skin is really light from being covered all the time and getting no sun, but once summer rolls around and you get a nice tan, this cool, subtly-colored pattern emerges on your skin. That'd be awesome!</p></div>		</li>
