			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important point.</p>
<p>You can see the same effect by flipping a book or tennis racket here on Earth, but, due to gravity you don't get very long to  observe it before it hits the ground (maybe a rotation or two).</p>
<p>The main benefit of doing the experiment in space is that you can observe it for longer, so it becomes a lot more obvious that something unusual is happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool point. It really makes you think about how fucking awesome physics is. It also makes me wonder, what else on Earth is happening yet we don't know because we can't really observe it happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's something that physicists know well, there is something the average person is completely unaware of because they lack the experience to realize it: you can't feel gravity. What you experience as weight due to gravity is actually the force you need to exert on yourself to keep yourself &quot;motionless&quot; in your non-inertial frame of reference.</p>
<p>If you're on the ISS in orbit you're still experiencing 90% of the gravity you'd experience on Earth's surface, but you feel weightless. This is because the ISS is in free-fall; it's in an inertial frame of reference, so you don't experience the fictitious force of gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this is an incredibly stupid question, but if the ISS is in free fall (presumably towards the centre of the Earth) then how does it maintain it's orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a Newtonian point of view, surely gravity is not a fictitious force? The only fictitious forces on Earth are those caused by choosing a rotating reference frame - the centrifugal and Coriolis forces - rather than gravity, which is supplying the very real centripetal force.</p>
<p>Also, can the ISS really be treated as inertial? It is experiencing constant centripetal acceleration (also by gravity). Also, if you released a test particle slightly above the ISS and one slightly below, their motions would differ due to orbital mechanics, despite having the same initial conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading somewhere that much of what we experience as &quot;weight&quot; is a result of all the air that's pushing down on us. Any truth to that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a great point. Gravity (there is a lot of it where the spacecraft is) affects all parts of the tool equally so there is no effect on spin. </p></div>		</li>
