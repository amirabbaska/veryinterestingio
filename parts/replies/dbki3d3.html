			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you and your doctor decide to go about switching you. Each case is a little bit different and more specific to the individual. It's unlikely they'll have you stop the Effexor cold-turkey and immediately put you on Prozac, so I'm inclined to say no to your question. </p>
<p>If Effexor isn't working for you, or has a bunch of side effects you'd like to stop experiencing, they might try a quicker taper, but it should still be a weening process. </p>
<p>You very well might notice side effects as you are tapered off and switched, everyone reacts differently, but nah you shouldn't experience withdrawal symptoms like you would if you quit cold-turkey. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a good chance you'll experience some withdrawal side effects switching from Effexor. I was tapered off the medication by my doctor and still experienced severe &quot;brain zaps&quot;, nausea and insomnia for about 4 weeks after stopping entirely.</p>
<p>Of course everyone is different, so your experience may vary.</p>
<p>As a side note, here are a few things I found that really helped curb the nausea and &quot;brain zaps&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger Root</strong><br />
I picked up some ginger root supplement pills and some ginger root candy to suck on throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>Omega 3 Fish Oil</strong><br />
I took these in pill form once a day and they did seem to help make my &quot;brain zaps&quot; slightly more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br />
Same effect as the Omega 3 for me.</p>
<p>I hope some/any of this is helpful to you if you decide to make the transition from Effexor. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talk to your doc. A crossover might work well unless it is contraindicated. That means slowly (very slowly) decreasing Effexor while very slowly increasing Prozac until you have completely switched. And when I say slowly I mean something like over the course of 3 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its funny to see this question pop up because ive been on effexor for about 5 years now and im struggling to get off it, but the nausea forces me to get back into it. The withdrawl effects are so severe that I feel like my brain just stops functioning and my emotions get super negative. Anyway im down to 37.5mg every other day (as per doctors advice) and so far im still hanging in there (barely)...we'll see how it goes. I really want to be off of it though.</p></div>		</li>
