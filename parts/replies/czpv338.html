			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Portuguese man from ol' Porto,
I find your suggestion all sorto
Wrong when it comes to the milk kind.
A splash of the ruby is just fine.
But tawny's a choice, last resorto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Portuguese language, we employ a lot of definite articles, which indicate gender and singular/plural characteristics of the subsequent word. &quot;Porto&quot;, the name of the city, is exactly the same word as &quot;porto&quot;, as in &quot;naval port&quot;, which is treated as a male noun. This means the name of the city is also &quot;male&quot;, and we refer to the city as &quot;o Porto&quot;. There is really no equivalent to this in English, even if you discard the gendered aspect, because you don't go around sticking &quot;the&quot; before most nouns. So if I remember correctly, it is believed that the English name for the city was coined by English sailors hearing our sailors refer to it as &quot;o Porto&quot;, which sounds like &quot;Oporto&quot;.</p>
<p>Port wine is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this why milk is very good in this:</p>
<p>Casein micelles in milk behave as an emulsifier. So to simplify, milk behaves slightly as soap. This is why milk does wonders to rinse spicy food and soothen the burning sensation. </p></div>		</li>
