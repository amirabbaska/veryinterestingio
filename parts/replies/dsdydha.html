			<div class="markdown"><p>I tested this, it's cool and interesting to observe! I'd put a little dot of lipstick on the tip of baby's nose and see if she'd touch her own nose or just play with her new twin friend. Was also funny watching her try to wrap her head around seeing another mama both in front and behind her at the same time. Thought she was going to get whiplash. Think she noticed the dot around 16 months or so. </p></div>		</li>
