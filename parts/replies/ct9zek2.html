<p>There are no automatic exemptions due to your profession. Famously, Rudy Giuliani served on a jury when he was Mayor of NYC. The Chief Judge of the NYS Court of Appeals was called and I believe she served. I've been called a few times myself, never got picked though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm called for jury duty (Dutchess County) in about a month (having postponed from April as I was called to appear the day my daughter was born). I am an adjunct professor, so technically a freelance worker –– I can be released at any time for essentially any reason; although in practice I can usually cancel class once or twice a term for snow or illness if it's severely necessary, <em>technically</em> I am not permitted to cancel class for any reason. I don't know how my school handles jury duty for adjuncts specifically, but I have heard from a few other adjuncts at other schools who were released because of it (which makes some degree of sense, as my students might not have a course to attend if I'm not there –– we do not do subs) and, as far as I'm aware, had no legal recourse. I am also the owner and sole proprietor of my own business on the side, and have a four month old daughter (my wife also works from home, and we split childcare duties 50/50). I've always wanted to do my duty and serve on a jury and would do so with enthusiasm, but right now to do so would be catastrophic for my family and my students, much as I would regret missing out. If you have a moment (if you are busy I understand), do you think I have a decent case for hardship? Any suggestions for what I might say other than the above?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The judges I appear in front of would release you, but I'm not in Dutchess County.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, the questions is - would the hardship you described affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror?  That is, if selected for the jury despite your reasons for wanting to get off, would you be able to focus on the trial and the evidence presented, or would you be worrying about your students, your job, your business, your family, etc.</p>
<p>And bear in mind, some trials last only a day or two.  You'll know right from the start how long it's expected to last, the judge should state that before asking who has a hardship.</p></div>		</li>
