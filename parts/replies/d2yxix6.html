<p>Back in the dawn of time (the late 80's) I was in a small navy school to learn how to fix stuff. This wasn't the first school you get sent to after Recruit Training, or even the 2nd school, this was a 3rd, 19 week school they sent you to, to punish you for being too good at taking tests, so that you would learn limitations.</p>
<p>At the end of the 1st day, a grizzled Chief came into the classroom with a briefcase; after locking the door behind him he looked over the class with totally unveiled contempt, shrugged, and opened the case. He took out a clipboard and told us to read &amp; sign.</p>
<p>After it got passed to me, I saw it was a fairly standard clearance form; at the top it had a statement about how you agreed to keep classified all the information that was about to be presented. I think the top line had COSMIC TOP SECRET in block letters. The penalties section of the disclaimer I remember as being considerably longer than the ones I had seen and signed prior to this.</p>
<p>After this was done, he made the standard statement about allowing one minute for those who had not signed to go to the door to be let out, then went back into the briefcase and removed 4 dark blue books. He stated that no Navy Facility was allowed to have over 4 of these books, so we would have to share.</p>
<p>The Book was liberally stamped with various secret stamps, and I think it was called &quot;Advanced Theoretical Troubleshooting&quot;. I think it had a 1970's publication date.</p>
<p>It was a very, very detailed History and textbook on Magic Smoke. It covered the early observances of the stuff back in the days of Edison &amp; Tesla and how scientists had came up with the various laws of electronics to explain it. It THEN described how a Navy Scientist working on &quot;Project Tinkertoy&quot; in the 50’s had received an anonymous package in the mail that contained the Lost Notebooks of Tesla.</p>
<p>Using the information, formulas and rituals in the notebooks, and with the help of among other things an Ex-Nazi Wizard-Physicist, they were soon able to compress standard Magic Smoke into a block of rare earth alloy. Knowing that the public would not accept technology that incorporated ritual magic, they came up with a semi-logical explanation for how the new &quot;Semiconductor&quot; worked.</p>
<p>There were a couple of pages on how the &quot;modern&quot; facilities used teams of Wizard-Physicists to design and fabricate modern Chips at Texas Instruments and in Silicon Valley, and how the Japanese method of using Shinto priests was considered inferior, their binding rituals resulted in a much higher likelihood of the Magic Smoke escaping (I'm guessing they improved since the 1970's).</p>
<p>After that there were pages and pages of formulas I recognized from physics classes, mixed in with incantations and magic circles I (later in life) recognized from the &quot;lesser key of Solomon&quot;. I started to write out one of the formulas to play with it, but the Chief saw me and bellowed &quot;No Notes! You signed the disclaimer!”</p>
<p>After 30 minutes or so, he collected the books and told us that every ship in the Navy had one copy in their Classified Information safe; if we encountered a piece of gear that absolutely had to be fixed but the Magic Smoke just wouldn't stay in place, and we couldn't use normal methods or spares, we could use the book to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The Chief then made an odd expression (possibly it was intended to be a smile? It was obviously something he wasn't practiced at doing because it was scary as hell), wished us a cheery &quot;Have a fine Navy Day&quot; and left.</p>
<p>About a year Later, I was on the USS Independence, in the TS/AVIONICS shop. At the bottom of the Classified Information safe was a single, immaculate, like-new copy of the book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's annoying that your answer only has a couple upvotes because I think it's one of the only ones that answers what OP is asking.</p>
<p>Everyone else is giving reasons <em>why</em> electronic equipment fails, i.e. causes of damage.</p>
<p>I think what OP really wants to know is, why does electronic equipment fail suddenly and completely - as opposed to a mechanical piece whose functionality is reduced over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for noticing what I was trying to do. It wasn't a great answer though, I thought &quot;I know about this stuff&quot; and then started to ramble a bit, then I thought &quot;Um, what's the question&quot;, then I had an existential crisis, then it was bedtime.</p></div>		</li>
