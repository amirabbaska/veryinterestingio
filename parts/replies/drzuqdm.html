			<div class="markdown"><p>All those factors also apply in Japan, but in Japan over 90% of cars are automatic. One difference raised is the greater density of urban traffic (and higher urban concentration) in Japan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Japan's cities are very modernized by comparison (from what I have seen in visits to both Japan and Europe). The &quot;medieval urban&quot; is the part where larger, heavier cars were a problem. Now there isn't as much a difference, but in the advent of automatic transmissions it would have been a factor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cost I’ll give you, but like others in this thread the old arguments for efficiency, traction, performance, etc are all firmly on the side of automatics nowadays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure of your example, but many automatics now use more gears and different ratios than their manual counterparts. That is a big factor in it too. On the cheaper end of cars, where you have manual 4 speeds vs automatic 4 speeds with the same gearing, manuals win out but by a very slim margin. CVTs and more advanced automatics are unbeatable by manuals in recent years in power delivery and efficiency.</p>
<p>So I think this is still applicable, but will become less so as we move forward. </p></div>		</li>
