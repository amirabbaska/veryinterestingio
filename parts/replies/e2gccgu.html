<p>'Fats' as we think of them (oils or tallow or some other such foody thing) are not just fatty acids, but are mostly fatty acids with the polar end stuck on to a somewhat non-polar molecule called glycerin. Usually three fatty acids will be stuck to one glycerin, making a triglyceride. This means that the fatty acids effectively stop having a 'polar' part, as the end of the fatty acid is now a somewhat non-polar glycerin with two other very non-polar fatty acid back ones sticking off of it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The glycerol isn't really less polar per se. What it does is make the carboxylic acid in each fatty acid unavailable for acid-base reactions. It's the acid-base reaction that can make a fatty acid very polar at one end, as it'll then be carrying a full negative charge.</p>
<p>PS: Fatty acids are not detergents, at least pretty crappy ones. You need a salt of a fatty acid to have a proper detergent/soap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, probably not actually. The kind of &quot;salt&quot; we're talking about is just soap. Chemically that's a salt, but in regular parlance it's very different from what you'd think of as salty.</p>
<p>I don't know what McDonald's is using, but it might be calcium carbonate. That's commonly used just as a scrubbing agent. It is indeed a salt, but one that's poorly soluble in pure water. It just stays as little crystals, which are good for mechanical scrubbing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I bought some 'micellar water' to remove make-up, and it works really well, but I'm confused about the science of it. From all I've read about micelles, it seems like a branding gimmick for just plain old soapy water. Is there any difference between those 'micellar water' products, and a bit of soap/detergent dissolved in a bottle of water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope,  you hit the nail on the head. </p>
<p>I imagine they're using micellar waste as a term to describe what happens when you break up micelles (to much water) and reduce them to aggregating on the surface again.  And possibly it's such a low quantity ad to not form a surface barrier between any oil and water.  </p>
<p>It's an oil and water mixture with a super dilute amount of surfactant. </p>
<p>When you leave in on your dresser does it separate back to two layers? And you must shake before use?
Then yep,  oil and water and a bit of soap</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. Possibly related follow-up: When we have a really nasty grease on something on the ship, we use mineral oil to dissolve it, wipe up most of the mineral oil, then clean up the residue with alcohol or soap. Alcohol or soap can't touch these greases by themselves, but the mineral oil makes quick work of it. Any idea why, or would you need more info on what the grease is? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An answer from my somewhat rusty batchelor chemistry knowledge.</p>
<p>Most likely the grease is build up from non-polar long-chain molecules. When applying mineral oil you take a non-polar solvent to dissolve the grease into a substance that is less viscous. On molecular level you are likely separating the long chain molecules from each other which makes it easier to wipe or flush away. soap(-water) or alcohol are probably too polar to separate the 'grease'-molecules from eachother.
After dissolving with mineral oil, it is easier to use a polar solvent with soap micelles to remove the mineral oil or non-polar mixture residue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What u/qaatloz said is correct, but I would recommend using an alternative solvent to clean up the grease instead. Using a volatile hydrocarbon solvent such as white spirits, limonene, kerosene, mineral turpentine etc. will help remove the grease without needing to clean up the oily residue after. They are commonly available from hardware stores, and they even sell them as degreasers or wax and grease removers.</p></div>		</li>
