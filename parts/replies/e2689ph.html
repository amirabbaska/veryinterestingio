			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of an issue is the IFHX and ETCS for power and mass? Is it something that could really use improvements for Lunar Gateway or is the general feeling it's good enough? Asking as someone that would be proposing R&amp;D to those sorts of problems. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, fair enough. Thanks for the info you shared, though. I work on unmanned stuff, so it's cool to learn how the other half of NASA does things. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll throw in one point for clarity: the mention of radiators can be confusing, because in ordinary speech, that name is attached to the heat exchanger in the front of a car -- which is a serious misnomer. Only a small fraction of its heat rejection comes from genuine radiation -- it really should be called a &quot;convector&quot;.  </p>
<p>By contrast, a spacecraft radiator, sitting out in vacuum, operates <em>entirely</em> by radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What safety measures are in place at the IFHX to prevent accidental contamination of either of the systems?I know that there is wall between them, but it must be highly conductive in terms of heat exchange so... what is it made of how thick is it?Are there any active systems like ammonia sensing circuits in the ITCS?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The walls are VERY thin (thicker than foil, but thin) and it is the one place we are seriously concerned about an ammonia leak. We regularly do ITCS sampling for ammonia concentration and there are multiple ammonia sensors on the interior.</p>
<p>That said, any serious ammonia leak through the IFHX is basically the only emergency that would just end the space station - aside from hitting a giant asteroid or something of course.</p></div>		</li>
