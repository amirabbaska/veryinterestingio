			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I've never considered this. So when I'm hungry/haven't eaten in a while, my stomach is just shriveled up, with no air in it? For some reason I always imagined it empty but still a similar size to when I've eaten. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In adult humans, the stomach has a relaxed, near empty volume of about 75 millilitres. Because it is a distensible organ, it normally expands to hold about one litre of food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably think of it that way due to all the pictures and diagrams that draw it as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait a minute, 75 millimeters is not a measure of volume. Do they mean 75 cubic millimeters? If so, that's crazy, because that would mean that an empty stomach is just over 4mm x 4mm x 4mm, or approximately the size of a sugar cube, maybe smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it shrinks down and expands as needed.  Maybe a smidge of air but not any significant amount, how would that feel if your stomach were puffed up like a lung?  </p></div>		</li>
