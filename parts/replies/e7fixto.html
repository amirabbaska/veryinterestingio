<p>While it doesn't go in to the whole cascading stuff, the gif is a cogent explanation of what average temperature actually <em>means</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a great way to explain something to a 5 year old, which is one of the best aspects of this sub that is often forgotten about when a subject that people are passionate about is brought up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>considering that this is eli5. this, imo, is the only CORRECT answer. i asked myself this question as well after that show on discovery &quot;6 degrees could change the world&quot; as i too thought it sounded like BS. someone simply needed to explain &quot;average&quot; to me and that would have been that. so annoyed the top answer is a fucking college thesis that goes into an explanation of fucking CO2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I'm not sure I'd go that far.. For sure being explained what they mean by &quot;average&quot; is a big part of it in terms of basic comprehension of the headline, but it feels like the meat of the worry (and why its so disastrous if it happens) is rooted more in the unstoppable cascading effects it can cause.</p>
<p>But yea, take this answer, pair it with a simple explanation about tipping points / feedback loops, and permafrost that'll be gone forever, and it'd be the best answer. Looking at most of the answers, had honestly not realized I was on r/ELI5 tbh, thought I was on r/science or something..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would've thought that the curve gets shallower? Because the moderate temperatures are reducing and the extremes are increasing. Not only increased hot but also increased cold weather (Thinking of the SSW over the artic early 2018 causing the &quot;beast from the east&quot;)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it most definitely should get shallower. Not only is the averages shifted rightward towards the hotter temperatures but also the variance increases as well. You'll start to see more extreme hot and more extreme cold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. It explains extreme cold or hot temperature better, which does not seem accurate in the graph.</p></div>		</li>
