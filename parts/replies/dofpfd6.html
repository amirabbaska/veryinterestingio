			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, you'd work a little backwards. Take a bearing to what you perceive to be the summit (this may not be the actual summit once you are up there) at some point, preferably at a known altitude. Then go to another marker that is a known distance between from the first marker and take your bearing to the perceived summit. Then you can figure your distance from the summit based off of those bearings and the distance between the two markers. Then, an angle between horizon and summit can be taken. Knowing the distance and angle of rise, you can calculate height. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With horizontal angles. You use two <em>control points</em> which can both see the peak and each other. First you measure the distance between those points, establishing a <em>baseline</em>. Then set up a theodolite at each end and measure the horizontal angle from the other control point (the <em>backsite</em>) to the unknown point (the <em>foresite</em>). Now you've got a triangle with two known angles and one known distance, which is enough information to solve the rest of the triangle.</p></div>		</li>
