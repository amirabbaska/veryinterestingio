			<div class="markdown"><p>Light from a flashlight is too small to propel a flashlight forward....on any meaningful time scale. But if you had an infinite energy battery and turned your flashlight on it would accelerate. just very very slowly. But as long as it never turned off you could eventually get very close to the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On earth, a flashlight's light can't overcome friction, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if your spacesuit was shaped like the em drive? Would there be an unequal force applied to your suit and you would propel forward? </p>
<p>No, no you wouldn't. Farts in a spacesuit do not have the relativistic properties that electromagnetic radiation does, which is probably what allows for the acceleration (that is, <em>if</em> it's actually real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a pedantic note. If you had an infinite energy battery, it would have infinite mass, and therefore it would be un-acceleratable. </p></div>		</li>
