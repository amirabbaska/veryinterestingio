			<div class="markdown"><p>SMTP was the problematic in the  distance past because both sysadmins and software didn't check MX records correctly. When you send mail to x@x.com modern servers do a MX lookup of x.com which should return the address of a SMTP server. Even in the mid 90's this didn't always happen correctly and an A record lookup for x.com commonly occured. If your HTTP server and your SMTP shared the same address that was fine, if they didn't, there was problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are partly right...buuut...FTP, HTTP, and POP services can actually all be hosted on the same server.  The redirection of subdomains is done at the IP level not the machine level so its a little differen than you are saying.  </p>
<p>And both pop, IMAP, and FTP are still very widely used even today.  After alal you might browse to a site via HTTP to find a download link that delivers the file via FTP services.   </p>
<p>Browsers have incorporated the protocols into them as multi-function software, but it's not true that somehow HTTP has replaced the other protocols on the internet, not even by a longshot.   </p>
<p>That and subdomains can still direct to HTTP services.  Forexample inside.businessnetwork.com could direct to a website for employees rather than the customer-focused site of just www.businessnetwork.com. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>99% of what everyone does on the internet is through browsers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is false. Most of the traffic on the Internet comes from P2P services like BitTorrent and video streaming services like Netflix and Skype. Looking at time spent online, web browsers also lose, as more and more is done in native apps. Wildly popular service Instagram canâ€™t even be used without first downloading their native app.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok it's a bit of an exaggeration, but even P2P these days revolves around searching on the web for files before switching to a dedicated app. Plus doesn't Netflix still run through the browser on desktop computers?</p></div>		</li>
