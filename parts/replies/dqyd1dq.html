			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. </p>
<p>You don't need good eyesight to set traps, chase prey to exhaustion, or even use weapons to bring down large animals. Before I had LASIK my eyesight was pretty bad and I still would have had little trouble learning to hit most decent sized animals with a bow or spear. You can still judge distance and while things are blurry, they are where they are. You certainly don't need good distance vision to gather up food. </p>
<p>Humans have also always lived in communities. Not everyone in the community needs good vision and can rely on those that do when needed.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but we still have superior tools and formidable cooperation.  I'm certainly not trying to say it's ideal or insignificant, only that treating 20/20 as the baseline for survival isn't necessarily consistent with what we see in the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly disagree with that.  The fact that humans have excellent eyesight compared to most other mammals is telling you something...namely, that excellent vision is under strong selection in humans.  </p>
<p>Good eyesight is vitally important for humans &quot;in the wild&quot;.  It's important for spotting predators, which humans are less likely to scent due to our rather poor sense of smell.  Eyesight is important for tracking prey, which often involves spotting tufts of fur or broken twigs or drops of blood at a distance.  It's important for gathering plant based food, which again relies on vision to spot appropriate plants (based often on subtle differences in leaf shape and the like)  at a distance.  It's important for knowing if the person coming up the trail is from your group or a possibly hostile member of another group.  Humans live in a visual world.</p>
<p>And this is born out by real world data...several studies of hunter-gatherer eyesight have been done, and observed rates of myopia are extremely low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't entirely disagree with what you are saying.  There certainly are disadvantages to bad vision and advantages to good. And humans do live in a visual world. And I by no means am trying to contradict the studies that show that people who live in a state closer to what our ancestors would have lived in routinely have excellent eye-sight. It's right up there with sweat as one of our great advantages. </p>
<p>But, I think there's a tendency to treat 20/20 vision as a sort of baseline for &quot;reality,&quot; and assume that anything less than that is an enormous handicap. If I am remembering correctly, most dogs have something like 20/75 or 20/100 vision, and cats are somewhere closer to 20/200.  Of course, they can have other advantages in how their eyes work or are positioned, as well as supplementing their eyes with things like scent, but in terms of myopia, they can still be successful animals even in the wild. </p></div>		</li>
