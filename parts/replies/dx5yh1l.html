			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you on this one. I was a bit sleepy at a nascar event my dad took me to see before he passed away. Decided to take a nap early on at the race track since I knew I wasn't going to miss out on much. The stupidly loud cars and roaring crowd didn't disturb me one bit, but I'll be damned if a floorboard or door creaks in ANY part of my house I'm up. You can shake me and it will be difficult to wake me, but a gentle movement of the bed does the same. I don't get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right!</p>
<p>but does it work for you?</p>
<p>my kids are training to be ninja's as they aren't able to sneak around otherwise. but want to have a party? as long as it's steady, kind of white noise, have at it, I'm going to bed. extreme shifts though of quiet and then a ruckus, I'm up and wondering WTF.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White noise is one of the few things that consistently help me fall asleep quickly. I hate a fan blowing on me, even a ceiling fan on low, but I found an app that plays a good mix of white noises and I can consistently fall asleep in less than five minutes when I use it.</p>
<p>Once I'm asleep though I might as well be dead for all that I hear or wake up to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup. my sister though was simply a deep sleeper. she's my reference to alarm clocks. growing up, hers would be buzzing away at the other end of the house and I'd wake and shut the thing off and she'd not bat and eyelash.</p></div>		</li>
