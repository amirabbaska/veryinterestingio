			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually makes the most sense. The other comments are good but still raise too many questions. This question came to me because of the news articles I'd been reading about Apple Music being the &quot;death&quot; of Spotify, because it's pre-installed and blah blah.
Good reply, thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some detail to /u/standardengineer 's reply, Microsoft had been judged to hold a monopoly in operating systems for PCs.  Having this monopoly didn't violate laws.  However, how they obtained that monopoly did violate some laws. And by having a monopoly, Microsoft then came under additional laws they had to follow, meant to curb abuse that could occur from a monopoly holder. These laws go back to the era when monopolies were appearing during the industrial revolution, and their power was putting US interests at risk.</p>
<p>When a PC vendor wanted to ship a computer with Windows on it, Microsoft would only sell them as many copies of Windows as PCs they shipped out the door.  Even if the person who ordered the computer didn't ask for Windows, and wanted say OS/2 Warp. These agreements were kept secret for a while, and successfully helped Microsoft kill off any competing operating systems.</p>
<p>There was a &quot;Microsoft Refund Day&quot; kicked off in the late 90s by users of (then the new) OS called Linux. They demanded money back from Microsoft for the unused copies of Windows shipped on their computer. They did so because the end user license agreement said that if you don't agree to the terms, you could seek a refund.</p>
<p>Multiple states in the US were investigating Microsoft during this time, uncovering those agreements. Eventually all these investigations and lawsuits were rolled up into one case led by the DOJ. This process took a long time, and while this was happening the rise of the internet began.</p>
<p>Microsoft saw the internet as a threat initially, as many companies were promoting the concept of network computing.  MS's precieved threat was that if people just worked off the network, they wouldn't need a desktop OS. Java came to be the language seen as the way forward, and the world wide web was also growing in popularity. </p>
<p>Microsoft then made moves to kill the leading browser, Netscape Navigator.  Back then, browsers were usually boxed software bought by users like any other software back then. Thus Microsoft decided to make IE, and release it for free. The idea was that if the WWW was going to take over computing, at least Microsoft could control it.</p>
<p>Many PC vendors had deals with Netscape to bundle their browser with the computer. Microsoft pulled some illegal moves here too to try and kill those deals. Gateway for example was punished by Microsoft twice. Once because Gateway employees used Netscape internally instead of IE.  And the second time because Gateway launched their own ISP, and during signup, a user was asked if they wanted to use IE or Netscape.  Microsoft ended up charging Gateway the highest price they could for both Windows and Office.</p>
<p>Microsoft also tried to kill Java cross platform capabilities, by using their classic strategy of &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot;.  Microsoft claimed they supported Java (Embrace), wrote their own virtual machine, then came out with something called J++ (Extend).  Code written in J++ wouldn't run in a JVM on another platform (Extinguish), only Windows. To this day, Microsoft is barred from shipping anything related to Java due to a separate lawsuit. MSDN members for example can't download Windows 2000, and certain other products that had Java embedded deeply in them, similar to how MS embedded IE into Windows.</p>
<p>Much of the EU cases came up, because they felt the US didn't go far enough.  Microsoft was on the verge of being broken into three companies around 2000.  One for Windows, one for Office (I didn't address their anticompetitive moves with this here), and one for everything else. The election of George W. Bush is why the breakup didn't happen, as his administration asked the DOJ to avoid that remedy for the long running case.</p>
<p>tl;dr The lawsuits against Microsoft were about so much more then just bundling IE with Windows. The amount of monopoly abusing actions they did ultimately landed them in a lot of trouble. Apple on the other hand does not hold a monopoly in any area, and generally hasn't had lawsuits filed against it by governments for anti-trust violations. (They had one recently over ebooks, but it was nowhere near the depth of Microsoft many lawsuits).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You void the warranty?  Can't sign in to xbox live?  </p>
<p>I'm not arguing, maybe that is bad enough.</p>
<p>The reason I'm saying this is, I remember people buying xboxes and using then as cheap webservers back in the day.  As long as they didn't get sued for it, is that fair?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, but you <em>can</em> remove Apple's Music app. It's just not easy. Jailbreaking was recently deemed a customer's right by US Justice. Similarly, you can install whatever you want in your Xbox, it's just hard to change the operating system.</p>
<p>Microsoft's case was technically more about hardware sellers' rights than it was about customers' rights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is with the DMCA, in order to install another non official OS, or any software really, you would have to break the machines and or OS's encryption... it's kind of like you can freely copy a dvd or bluray, but you can not break it's encryption in order to do so, so if you do copy a dvd or install non officall software on an xbox you are nessecarily breaking DMCA law... at least thats as I understand it...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I went to the nearest shop and bought a PC mag-whatever with a CD containing the latest Netscape or IE â”€really can't remember. We used to do that with a lot of software (get it from a CD), pre-DSL, if only to avoid the insanely long and costly dial-up connection cost.</p>
