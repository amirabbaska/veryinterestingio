			<p>This actually makes the most sense. The other comments are good but still raise too many questions. This question came to me because of the news articles I'd been reading about Apple Music being the &quot;death&quot; of Spotify, because it's pre-installed and blah blah. <br>Good reply, thanks. </p>		</li>

			<p>To add some detail to /u/standardengineer 's reply, Microsoft had been judged to hold a monopoly in operating systems for PCs.  Having this monopoly didn't violate laws.  However, how they obtained that monopoly did violate some laws. And by having a monopoly, Microsoft then came under additional laws they had to follow, meant to curb abuse that could occur from a monopoly holder. These laws go back to the era when monopolies were appearing during the industrial revolution, and their power was putting US interests at risk.<br><br>When a PC vendor wanted to ship a computer with Windows on it, Microsoft would only sell them as many copies of Windows as PCs they shipped out the door.  Even if the person who ordered the computer didn't ask for Windows, and wanted say OS/2 Warp. These agreements were kept secret for a while, and successfully helped Microsoft kill off any competing operating systems.<br><br>There was a &quot;Microsoft Refund Day&quot; kicked off in the late 90s by users of (then the new) OS called Linux. They demanded money back from Microsoft for the unused copies of Windows shipped on their computer. They did so because the end user license agreement said that if you don't agree to the terms, you could seek a refund.<br><br>Multiple states in the US were investigating Microsoft during this time, uncovering those agreements. Eventually all these investigations and lawsuits were rolled up into one case led by the DOJ. This process took a long time, and while this was happening the rise of the internet began.<br><br>Microsoft saw the internet as a threat initially, as many companies were promoting the concept of network computing.  MS's precieved threat was that if people just worked off the network, they wouldn't need a desktop OS. Java came to be the language seen as the way forward, and the world wide web was also growing in popularity. <br><br>Microsoft then made moves to kill the leading browser, Netscape Navigator.  Back then, browsers were usually boxed software bought by users like any other software back then. Thus Microsoft decided to make IE, and release it for free. The idea was that if the WWW was going to take over computing, at least Microsoft could control it.<br><br>Many PC vendors had deals with Netscape to bundle their browser with the computer. Microsoft pulled some illegal moves here too to try and kill those deals. Gateway for example was punished by Microsoft twice. Once because Gateway employees used Netscape internally instead of IE.  And the second time because Gateway launched their own ISP, and during signup, a user was asked if they wanted to use IE or Netscape.  Microsoft ended up charging Gateway the highest price they could for both Windows and Office.<br><br>Microsoft also tried to kill Java cross platform capabilities, by using their classic strategy of &quot;Embrace, Extend, Extinguish&quot;.  Microsoft claimed they supported Java (Embrace), wrote their own virtual machine, then came out with something called J++ (Extend).  Code written in J++ wouldn't run in a JVM on another platform (Extinguish), only Windows. To this day, Microsoft is barred from shipping anything related to Java due to a separate lawsuit. MSDN members for example can't download Windows 2000, and certain other products that had Java embedded deeply in them, similar to how MS embedded IE into Windows.<br><br>Much of the EU cases came up, because they felt the US didn't go far enough.  Microsoft was on the verge of being broken into three companies around 2000.  One for Windows, one for Office (I didn't address their anticompetitive moves with this here), and one for everything else. The election of George W. Bush is why the breakup didn't happen, as his administration asked the DOJ to avoid that remedy for the long running case.<br><br>tl;dr The lawsuits against Microsoft were about so much more then just bundling IE with Windows. The amount of monopoly abusing actions they did ultimately landed them in a lot of trouble. Apple on the other hand does not hold a monopoly in any area, and generally hasn't had lawsuits filed against it by governments for anti-trust violations. (They had one recently over ebooks, but it was nowhere near the depth of Microsoft many lawsuits).</p>		</li>

			<p>I was working at Gateway when some of this was going on, so I had a sort of front row seat to it. Somewhere I have a binder with the entire <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm" target="_blank">Findings of Fact</a> printed out, and read through the entire thing. What I posted above still only scratches the surface.<br><br>I was similar to you in that a lot of this happened in my teen and early adult years. I had my head down purely in the tech for a long time, and had exposure to other platforms earlier in my life (Commodore 64, Amiga and Apple ][).  I was always confused at how Microsoft's software seemed so dominant back then, when it rarely was the better product.  Even when I did use DOS, I'd swap out command.com for 4DOS or similar. Windows 3.1?  Ran it with Norton Desktop.  I also had a taste of Windows NT and OS/2, wondering why Microsoft didn't bring either of these to the consumer market.<br><br>Following the lawsuits and seeing how Microsoft was holding the entire industry back upset me, and I learned more about the business dealings and non technical aspects behind things. Taught me a lot about how cutthroat the business world could be, before I stepped fully into it. And it helped me to find companies I'd want to support not only for their good technical skills, but also their ethics in business issues.</p>		</li>

			<p>The office stuff wasn't quite as dirty.  There was a myth about &quot;Dos ain't done till Lotus won't run&quot; referring to the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.  This was in the 80s though, back before Microsoft had an OS monopoly, and back when they did actually work hard to ensure Lotus would keep running on MS-DOS releases. Microsoft at that point saw it as a disadvantage if Lotus didn't work since it could make DR-DOS or the other alternatives look better. Microsoft even went to the extreme of coding DOS to deal with bugs in Lotus 1-2-3, a situation repeated frequently today with video games and video drivers. <br><br>What ultimately killed Lotus 1-2-3 was their slow adoption of Windows and Mac. Microsoft had a leg up here not because they made Windows, but because the competing Excel started as a Mac app. Thus MS didn't have as much work since they skipped the conversion from text mode terminal apps to GUI apps.  Microsot's older MultiPlan terminal spreadsheet did jump through the terminal to GUI conversion, going from a DOS to a Mac app, but it was constantly beat by Lotus.<br><br>Where Microsoft was anticompetitive was with Word vs WordPerfect. Gates is on record saying the following:<br>&gt;I have decided that we should not publish these [Windows 95 user interface] extensions. We should wait until we have a way to do a high level of integration that will be harder for likes of Notes, WordPerfect to achieve, and which will give Office a real advantage.... We can't compete with Lotus and WordPerfect/Novell without this.<br><br>This is in the lead up to the Windows 95 launch, along with NT 4 soon after.  Lotus Notes (office e-mail) was a threat along with WordPerfect. This was the era that Office was born, and when Microsoft was also looking to capture the business productivity suite end to end with e-mail too. To do so they had to kill off the WordPerfect market to control the file format, while killing off Notes to control the path to sending these files around, and kill off Netware to control the server relaying these messages.<br><br>The most popular tactic they used was to spread information in their developer network during the betas of Windows 95 for an API, and later yank the API entirely. Often times it would be replaced with an API they kept secret, but were using internally on the Office team. This caused Lotus and Novel to waste time coding to an API that wouldn't work, and having to recode to the newer one, possibly only after the release of Windows 95.<br><br>Microsoft was also working to further harm IBM during this time (who ended up buying Lotus). IBM was building a competing stack with their Lotus properties, along with OS/2 Warp.  IBM was also still selling a lot of PCs to the business world. Microsoft didn't grant IBM a license to ship Windows 95 on their computers until 15 minutes before launch.  Back then, OS/2 Warp was being seen as a way to get to NT like stability, but also with app compatibility.  DOS and Windows 3.1 apps even ran inside OS/2, but MS did everything they could to ensure the same wouldn't happen with Windows 95.  This helped keep OS/2 Warp from rising in the consumer space.  Windows NT 4 with Office/Exchange was how Microsoft competed with the threat of IBM's PC+OS/2 business in the enterprise space.<br><br>The 90s had a lot of similarities to what's going on today.  Each company was assembling quite the ecosystem, and used it as a form of positive lock-in. Some of Google's moves with Android remind me a lot of what Microsoft was doing back then.</p>		</li>

			<p>Microsoft made Office very attractive to businesses and schools alike getting early mind share. Many people's first computing experience back then wasn't at home, so they got used to using Office. When they bought a computer, they got a pared down version in WordPad or Office Works (I think that was the name) or bought Office. Or Offce was bundled in for free or at a discount. Since the document format was proprietary, if you wanted to work at home or send files to someone, you had to use that format. Conversions to RTF sometimes worked provided the document formating was simple. <br><br>Competing office products like Wordperfect, etc, had conversion tools, but the success was very spotty and if the conversion blew up your document, you were screwed.<br><br>Between gaining mind share in the workplace and schools, bundling, and a closed document format, no other company had a chance.</p>		</li>

			<p>I doubt it, that wasn't where Microsoft was going with IE, their aim with it was to make it a standard so that they could control internet standards. If they could attain a near monopoly with IE due to it being preinstalled with Windows, they could make it work differently to other browsers so that the web didn't really work right on other browsers (and other OSes). If the web only works properly with IE on Windows... well people need to keep buying Windows.<br><br>That was their aim with it, and they were successful with it for many years, they annihilated Netscape and for a long time IE was the dominant browser and everybody designed for it, with a lot of websites not working quite right if you used anything else.<br><br>It was to protect their Windows monopoly that they bundled IE, it was absolutely integral to the OS, there was no way they either wanted to or even COULD, technically, sell it as a separate product, unbundle IE and half of Windows would stop working. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, doubting it isn't worth the risk. Antitrust laws are there for a reason, there are more than enough historical examples of well liked companies turning into profit securing monsters after they gained control of the market.

			<p>It matters because market share of a browser often influences the entire website business.  Look at how IE6 held the industry hostage effectively by not following standards and Microsoft's unwillingness to adopt newer HTML features.  Didn't matter that the W3C was creating cool new stuff, unless IE adopted it, it was effectively dead.  Web developers either coded their sites for IE, or they wouldn't likely be seen.<br><br>And this was the key reason Microsoft wanted IE to dominate. Creating their own de-facto web standards via IE meant they were on the offensive in that space, instead of having to be on the defensive.  Consumers suffered in the end for a while. Firefox didn't rise to prominence due to it's standards based browser. It rose to power because it started offering user features that made browsing the web better. Tabs, pop up blocking, search bar.<br><br>The money maker here was Microsoft saving money by not needing to staff a large web development team. And by selling their own products to the corporate market for their intranets. IE was also a vector for lockin in that environment, with ActiveX.  Helped lock people into Microsoft's servers and desktop OS as well, since the up and coming Linux was growing into a threat.</p>		</li>

			<p>They could sue you to get the phone back if you reverse engineered it, essentially. But that's never actually happened, I just know it can because I read those lengthy agreements from time to time. What DOES happen is that people jailbreak their phones, and send the phone back for an in warranty repair, and are stripped of their warranty for using the software in a manner not specified in their EULA. The consumer has to agree to such terms because if Apple said &quot;give us 600$, and you own it&quot;, you would literally own Apple's software / hardware. Meaning you could resell it, reverse engineer it, and have any other rights that the &quot;owner&quot; has. Instead, you're &quot;licensing&quot; it, and they still own the rights, and if you jailbreak, or something like that, you void your warranty, and they don't have to fix it for you.<br><br>The only real reason why they have the latitude to sue and get their hardware back is so they can protect their copyright. Essentially, if Samsung buys 200 iPhones, Apple can say &quot;You're reverse engineering those, and breaking your contract, give them back&quot;. </p>		</li>
