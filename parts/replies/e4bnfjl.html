			<div class="markdown"><p>Think that when they do, it causes a lot of pressure on the heart such as holding in breath, pushing it out and so on that they could even die while doing this on the loo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can die pooping but it’s actually due to a lower heart rate and decreased blood pressure that happens when you bear down. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver" target="_blank">valsalva </a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valsalva maneuver. When you “bear down” like when you’re going to poop your heart rate drops. This is normal. You can do it right now. Occlusion of coronary vessels causes chest pain. If the occlusion is in the right spot it can interfere with conduction of heart beats through your heart and make it do funky things. Bearing down to poop can make it worse. </p>
<p>Although I’ve never seen anyone die from having to poop, certain Heart attacks can present as indigestion or make you feel like you have to poop because the vagus nerve runs behind the heart and sort of shares a blood supply. </p>
<p>Edit: the term Vasovagal is probably a little better descriptor. Bear down and heart rate drops and your blood pressure drops because your blood vessels dilate. It’s dangerous in inferior MIs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI...heart attacks can also present with back pain.  My brother tried to go to sleep one evening but woke up about two hours later, the top of his back was killing him and he was having a hard-time breathing from the pain.  Something told me &quot;heart attack&quot; so I got him to the ER.  </p>
<p>Now, here's where it gets strange.  They do an EKG and it was normal, no MI, nothing strange with his heart beat, etc. but he was still having pain but it had decreased.  Thank god the doctor thought to run a blood test for the heart attack protein and BAM!  it was super high.  They rushed him to the Cath Lab and...surprise...he had a 90% blockage in one of the main vessels (I can never remember which one it was, but the doctor used the term &quot;widow maker&quot; to describe the type of MI that happens when that vessel is blocked). </p>
<p>After all the excitement died down and they put a stent in his heart I asked the doctor if he had a heart attack why wasn't he having chest pain or the pain radiating down his arm and the doc said that while those are symptoms, back pain in the upper part of the back is also a symptom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here, I can account to seeing someone die from having to poop. Patient was just transferred out from the ICU due to Acute Myocardial Infarction or Heart attack, it wasn't that serious and the patient was a woman at her 40's, ambulatory, completely looks normal and doesn't complain of any chest heaviness nor discomfort even during ambulation. It happened when she was transferred to a regular room and had been given bathroom priviledges (she was allowed by her doctor to use the bathroom, yes they need the doctor's instructions for this especially for patients who suffered from a heart attack). Although she was instructed to NOT force herself when defecating she still did (this is one problem with young, non-medical oriented, people who suffer from any sort of disease especially any form of heart attack or stroke). Her relative just noticed a thumping sound on the bathroom and saw her collapse there and then. When we rushed to her she already flatlined (asystole) with no vitals, she didn't recover from the resuscitation afterwards and that was it. </p>
<p>It was a heatbreaking moment for her relatives and also for us and hope that this will be a lesson to anyone who reads this to please follow what your doctor says even if it seems mundane and a hassle. There's a reason for it and it's always for your own good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They still will. When I was working as an RN on the floors we'd have palliative people sent to us due to no room on the palliative floor. They still produce urine and defecate, albeit very little, mostly because they are in a highly confused or unconscious state and are no longer eating. Certainly &quot;can't poop&quot; isn't an indication of any kind of end-stage. More commonly people who're days from death will be incontinent, as organ dysfunction has rendered them extremely dysfunctional mentally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m exactly sure if this is what we were getting at, but there is something called a vasovagal response. It basically breaks down to when a person tries too hard to pass stool a nerve (vasovagal) gets over stimulated. When this happens it bottoms out their involuntary functions. Blood pressure plummets, pulse falls, oxygen isn’t moving so it drops. This can all happen in large numbers very quickly. Sometimes it cannot be reversed. So, they pretty much crash and die.
5 years Oncology nursing is very educational and truly an amazing place to be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.</p>
<p><em>Huh.</em></p>
<p>Once when I was in high school I was having constipation troubles (horrible diet) and was also pretty much chronically dehydrated due to not drinking a lot of water. I was on the crapper and straining, and suddenly everything blurs out and next thing I know I’ve fallen off and slammed my head into the wall—I fainted.</p>
<p>Nice to finally get an explanation all this time later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for explaining! And that's interesting. I looked it up, and other triggers are seeing blood or heat exposure... And a way of getting better is by putting your feet above your head aka getting blood back to your brain...</p>
<p>You said oncology, does this specifically happen more with cancer patients? </p></div>		</li>

<p>makes trying to save their life after their heart stops much harder, which makes death far more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: #2. The body is very good at keeping you alive. It does so through mechanisms which are often unpleasant, possibly because that unpleasantness provided a motive to stop doing whatever you were doing to make you sick. By way of a simple example, holding your breath.</p>
<p>But, keeping a dying body alive is a lot of work, and especially in the case of chronic illnesses lasting months or years, eventually the body can just sort of 'give up'. This manifests differently in different conditions. For instance, for someone with advanced smoking related lung disease (COPD), breathing is extremely labour intensive. This is mostly because the body artificially overinflates the lungs in order to be able to breathe at all. When the body eventually gives up on that, the lungs return to their 'normal' volume and breathing becomes easy again, but the person very quickly becomes acutely ill due to low oxygen and high carbon dioxide in the blood.</p>
<p>Fighting a chronic infection or cancer is extremely taxing on the body. Sometimes the body goes down swinging. Other times it calmly bows out, and the energy that was previously being used to churn out white blood cells is now allowing the patient to walk and talk and be themselves, though there may be a cancer or infection rampaging unchecked through their organs at the same time.</p>
<p>I think that, all told, it's a good way to go. </p></div>		</li>
