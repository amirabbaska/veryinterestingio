			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have an app and you would set a wake up time. place your phone on your  bed and it would use your phones accelerometer and other sensors to determine how much you were moving and what phase of sleep you were in.  It would slowly wake you up in a light phase. It gave you graphs and shit about your sleeping. Cant really vouch for its accuracy, but i can say i did feel like it was way easier to wake up and i have an extremely difficult time getting  up in the morning. Cant remember what it was called  but ill look around and see if i can find it again</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've used an app called Sleep Cycle. You place your phone either on your bed to track your movements or on a table near your bed and then it uses sound to determine what state of sleep you're in. </p>
<p>I don't have problems waking up tired so I mostly used it out of curiosity, but it did seem to be able to wake me up between deep sleep cycles, according to the apps info about my sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each sleep cycle lasts for 90 minutes. If you plan ahead a bit, you can make sure that when your alarm goes off, it goes off roughly between the cycles when you are most easily wakened</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, when people wake up naturally (i.e. without an alarm), it usually happens during or right after a REM stage. that's because in non-REM bodily functions all go down (BP, temperature, breathing rate etc.) and then in REM go up again, almost to awake levels. so the idea that waking during REM causes extra tiredness is a misconception. sleep inertia is greatest when awoken during slow wave sleep (deep non-REM sleep).</p></div>		</li>
