			<div class="markdown"><p>The coast of the Atacama desert in Chile has frequent dense fog but there are places with absolutely no actual rain on record since people started monitoring.</p>
<p>This supports a bizarre collection of weird spiky plants optimized to collect as much fogdrip as possible. <a href="http://www.chileflora.com/Florachilena/FloraEnglish/HighResPages/EH1153.htm" target="_blank"><em>Tillandsia landbeckii</em></a> is basically a solid mass of bristles to maximize surface area, and is in the same genus as Spanish moss seen hanging from trees in humid southern parts of the United States. <a href="http://www.ann-geophys.net/27/3571/2009/angeo-27-3571-2009.pdf" target="_blank">More on this plant</a>. It might not be as cool as a redwood but you have to give it credit. I remember a cool documentary on Chile's fog plants years ago but I can't find it.</p>
<p><del>Native Americans</del> Canadians figured out how to catch fog using <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0308/feature3/" target="_blank">fog nets</a>. Apparently I made something up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also remember reading about some kind of insect, or spider that lives there, which stands in the mist every morning then collects the droplets of water that form on its legs and drinks it, which is the only water it gets all day.  Really cool stuff..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, interesting. I'm no botanist nor very well educated on flora in particular, but I must ask; does this mean that if you were stranded in a desert and found this plant, you'd have a good chance of getting water from the 'conical tap root?'</p></div>		</li>

<p>The article that you linked actually said that Canada gave those nets to the people living there, native Americans didn't figure that out. It actually said some pre-Columbian natives took advantage of snow melt in that area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry for the preachy bullshit, but I really like the redwoods. Fuck Bruges, Redwood Natl Forest is like a fairy tale world. No where else on earth do you get trees as tall as football fields that are wide enough you can make a tunnel for a car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trees you could drive cars through are Giant Sequoias (<em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em>), not Coastal Redwoods (<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>).  Giant Sequoias are found in the Sierra Nevadas, quite far from the coast.  Giant sequoias are wider and more massive than coastal redwoods, though not as tall.  The particular tree in the picture you linked is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawona_Tree" target="_blank">Wawona Tree</a>, a giant sequoia in Yosemite National Park's Mariposa Grove.  It fell down after a heavy snowfall in 1969.  There still exist some giant sequoias you can walk through, and certain coastal redwoods (or clusters of them that have grown together) have been hollowed out by fire and healed over, allowing you to walk inside.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently there are a few coastal redwoods on private land that can be drive through, most notably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandelier_Tree" target="_blank">Chandelier Tree</a>.  The other ones are smaller and a much tighter fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh sweet, thanks for the clarification. I knew that the coastal redwoods were a type of sequoia, but I thought they were also the big ones. I learned something today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh trust me, coast redwoods can get huge. Besides the Chandelier Tree there's also the Shrine Tree, and there are various parks up here with beautiful examples. Unfortunately they say that something like 97% of all redwoods have been cut down, and it's more likely than not that the biggest ones went first, so we'll never get to see that kind of majesty in person again. Sad, really. There are almost no old growth redwoods around anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i dont know what kind of tree it was, but in British Columbia Canada there are a couple trees with roads going right through them. I remember them clearly traveling from northern Alberta to Nelson BC,  so these huge tree tunnels on public roads do exist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to chime in and say I experienced this the other night. We have a large Norfolk Pine in our backyard (in Australia), and I thought it was raining... until I went out the front yard and realised it was just fog that had rolled in. The backyard was being soaked by the pine-  like a moderate to heavy shower. Very surreal moment. </p></div>		</li>
