<p>Higher wavelength typically means faster speeds but lower building penetration. Hence why 5ghz WiFi is faster, with slower range and 2.5 GHz has better range.</p>
<p>Verizon, ATT and TMobile have more lower band spectrum than Sprint has low and mid spectrum .  That's why Sprint gets a wrap for either having no usable LTE, or 50mbps+ speeds with no middle ground</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold up, 5GHz is actually faster than 2.5GHz? I thought that the advantage of the higher frequency signal is that less devices use it so there's less interference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WiFi works using frequency modulation. Which basically means the signal is transmitted by switching between a set of similar frequencies. At its most basic you use two frequencies to transmit binary data one bit at a time. But you can also use any number of frequencies to transmit a multiple bits of data in one go. For example, if I use four frequencies I can package up two bits of data and send them at the same time. This is what 5GHz has over 2.4GHz - its channels are wider (so less interference), but also more frequencies to choose from.</p>
<p>ELI5: 2.4 is like the Latin alphabet and 5 is like Japanese kanji - it can represent much more information in a single character. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2.4Ghz only has 11 channels vs 5ghz 23 channels (that don't overlap).  Both have channel width of 20/40 mhz.</p>
<p>So that adds to the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like some windows can be semi transparent or icy and not let all light through. Walls and doors aren't completely transparent to the WiFi waves. So yes, you might get a stronger signal if you open the door, or in general clear the path between the WIFI router and your computer.</p></div>		</li>
