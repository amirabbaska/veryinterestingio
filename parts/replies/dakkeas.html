			<div class="markdown"><p>The Israeli <a href="http://www.israel21c.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/117.jpg" target="_blank">Bamba</a> story was a wives tale for years, and now science has proven it correct! My wife grew up in Israel, and grew up on Bamba... they're devoured by toddlers there like Puffs or Cheerios are here.</p>
<p>And they are awesome... basically puffy Cheetos but peanut butter flavored instead of cheese. I keep meaning to make a mix of the two -- if the cheese crackers w/ peanut butter are good, so too should a mix of Bamba and Cheetos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just for peanuts. We don't know if it generalizes to other food allergies. </p>
<p>They do also note that some babies may be at increased risk and should be monitored - 80% reduction isn't 100%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peanuts is one of the things he tested positive for early on, although not at first (first was milk). But he was exposed to peanut butter before 12 months old multiple times, and ended up developing a peanut allergy. I do wonder in my (non medical professional) way however if having a reaction can sensitize you to another allergen by accident, if you were in contact with both at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
