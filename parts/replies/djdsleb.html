			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely true, I moved from sales for that reason. I couldn't stand to sit across from an 80 yr old woman, and take more than her social security for the month, every month. </p>
<p>So I moved over to service, and take less money from people there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at a car dealership. To me, service was arguably more of a rip off than sales. Old lady comes in for an oil change and gets a laundry list of &quot;dangerous&quot; faults her car has and they &quot;recommend&quot; for her safety and safety of the vehicle that she have the work done. Gross. Thousands of dollars later she leaves thanking them for the good service they've done, not even knowing what the hell they even did to begin with. It's a nasty business. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reputable dealers aren't like that. The only reason you're getting a long list of things to repair is because they haven't done anything but oil changes since they got the car and it's a piece of shit now because of that. Just because the car is driving fine doesn't mean it doesn't need a shit load of things to be considered safe. You brought your car to the experts and are now upset that the experts say the car needs work? It's not like the shit isn't optional if you feel like continuing to drive a shit box anyways lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the right answer.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> cars that appreciate the second you take ownership of them they are absurdly rare Ferraris and Porsches.  </p>
<p>New cars include a premium for utilizing the dealer/manufacturer relationship that goes away on resale unless that relationship is hard to come by (e.g. new Ferraris)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone in the business of inspecting and estimating cars, if you knew what I know, you would never be able to buy a used car again, because the salesperson would have you kicked off the lot. I have seen cars with less than 10,000 miles on them be almost completely previous repairs that were undocumented. And just  to get it out there, Carfax and other related services are completely useless. They only show what was reported to them. You will almost never see a car with any miles on it that hasn't been messed up somehow. It just won't happen. In the odd occasion it does happen, expect to pay a good sum for it. Taking care of your vehicles really pays, folks. And for the love of god; don't buy from Craigslist unless you are expecting a hunk of junk.</p></div>		</li>
