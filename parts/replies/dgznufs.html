<p>you would do it similar to an alternator/generator, where a moving charged particle generates an electric force through a coil. We can't make sustained neutron-full fusion reactions yet, and neutron-less ones are much more difficult so no one has really bothered, but the theories are being tested.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did for a while wonder if a plasma can oscillate in a way acting as heat engine. However, the temperatures are those of the range of plasma, so it would seem this limits the temperature difference and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_engine#Carnot.27s_theorem" target="_blank">max efficiency</a>=1-TC/TH so a higher cold temperature is less efficient.</p>
<p>On the other hand, apparently, steam-based equipment are limited in temperatures that are usable. Barring a better approach, multiple stages might help.</p></div>		</li>
