			<div class="markdown"><p>Would Lawrence Krauss' work on the nature of nothing begin to explain the difference here? I'm a layman, so please excuse any misunderstanding on my part, but his work talks about weighing the nucleus of an atom and that the conclusion was that virtual particles are popping into and out of existence in the &quot;empty space&quot; of a nucleus, which is giving it the &quot;missing&quot; mass, at least in part. There was a follow up experiment, I can't remember who did it, that they verified this calculation.....had something to do with a vacuum and cesium rods placed close together and a pressure difference that could only be caused by virtual particles that could not be seen or measured in any other fashion since they form and evaporate in nano seconds. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable and eloquent can add to this. I hope they do and correct any inaccuracies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole &quot;virtual particles popping in and out of existence&quot; mumbo-jumbo is bad pop-science. There are calculations you can do which are representing by cute little pictures (Feynman diagrams) which the mnemonic of virtual particles comes from, but they don't represent what's happening. (And actually, these calculations cannot be used to describe nucleons.) Krauss has done good science in the past, but the &quot;Universe From Nothing&quot; book got mostly bad reviews from scientists.</p></div>		</li>
