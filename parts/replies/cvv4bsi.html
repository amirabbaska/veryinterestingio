			<div class="markdown"><p>To put a slightly finer point on it, the scale measures the force between its two sides. We usually think of a bathroom scale as measuring the force between the floor and a person, but think instead it's the force between (a) the top plate of the scale and a person standing on it, and (b) the earth, the surrounding structure, the floor, and the bottom part of the scale. The scale's zero calibration just subtracts the mass of the top plate. If you flip the scale over, the forces remain the same as if it were right-side up. However, the zero point will change.</p></div>		</li>
