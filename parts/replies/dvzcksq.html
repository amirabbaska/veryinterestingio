			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's part of the reason why certain interview techniques and learning techniques are flawed. We know and learn things &quot;just in time&quot; for when we need them, when the interviewer asks me to list everything I know about &quot;topic x&quot; it's pointless because I know and understand based on situations not being able to dump my memory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why you prep for your interviews!  It's like a play.  How else should they get to know your skills?</p>
<p>One thing I like to do with those kind of questions is to give an example of when I've used that. That way it's more relateable in your mind. If you haven't used that specific skill/technique/procedure you could always just talk about it in broad strokes, kind of create and dialogue just so the interviewers know you're familiar with the topic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's about memory, at all. It's about understanding. If I ask in an interview, &quot;tell me what you know about TCP/IP&quot; I don't expect anybody to start quoting Vint Cerf's paper and all the RFCs since 1974. I expect you to show that you understand the basic concepts of the protocols by summarizing all that information into a few coherent and sufficient phrases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good interviewer will ask the right questions in an attempt to provoke thought from the interviewee. These questions don't give away the answer but leave room for those who are nervous or just having a bad day on the interview. There is also too much to know in the field to know everything cold, some things you have to know cold granted but others you just need to know how to bootstrap the process of learning it again. </p>
<p>Bad interviewers will do what I mentioned, I assume this is due to them not knowing enough about the subject themselves so they ask the lowest common denominator questions, the type of questions like.</p>
<ul>
<li>List all ports numbers </li>
<li>Tell me everything you know about &quot;x&quot;</li>
<li>What do you know about &quot;y&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these seem like good questions at first they really don't prove much in terms of getting an understanding of what someone knows. I can personally rattle off a lot of port numbers when asked but sometimes I walk away and others start coming to mind that I didn't even think of as my subconscious starts working on scenarios and situations which remind me of further ports I could have mentioned. I have for a long time used the smartass line of saying &quot;If I need to know a port number I can always <code>grep</code> for it in <code>/etc/services</code>&quot;</p></div>		</li>
