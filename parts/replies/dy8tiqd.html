			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing you overlooked, a baby from 200,000 years ago might not have evolved the genetics to resist modern diseases. Anyone alive today is assumed to be resistant to the various pandemic flu strains that killed a lot of our ancestors. </p>
<p>We saw the effects of intentional and unintentional germ warfare on many of the native American cultures. It would really be a roll of the dice to see if modern medicine could protect someone with an immune system not evolved to resist stuff we shrug off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of an infant's microbiota is acquired during vaginal birth. In modern times, it's common for caesarean born children to be wiped with their mother's vaginal secretions in order to acquire normal flora. In the case of midwife breastfeeding, I'm not sure if it would be sufficient for proper immunity. </p></div>		</li>
