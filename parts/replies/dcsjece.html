			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use the mobile phone camera to see the IR led on the remote, you can see that it's active for quite a long period. Each code may be very short, but the remotes repeats the signal many times, just to be sure the TV gets it..</p>
<p>At least that's how it was some years ago, I haven't looked on the remote of my newest box..</p></div>		</li>
