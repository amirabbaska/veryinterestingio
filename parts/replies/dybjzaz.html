			<div class="markdown"><p>The thickness/amount of solar shielding wouldnâ€™t interact with the high frequency of cosmic radiation. It would pass right through without interacting.
Also, all this (photon) radiation travels at the same speed of C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, only gamma and x-rays (photons) travel at the speed of light.</p>
<p>Neutrons and charged particles (alpha/beta, cosmic rays and much of the solar radiation) are always less than <em>c</em>.  Speed varies over a wide range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that argument similar to the one that proton radiation therapy would increase radiation pneumonia, relative to xray therapy? (Due to the protons slowing down in the target lung, and the slow protons interacting more readily in the non-target lung.)</p>
<p>And I thought the consensus was that didn't happen. Has anyone actually tested whether or not cosmic-ray slowing/secondary-radiation is a valid concern?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is a completely different energy range.</p>
<p>Some cosmic rays have a huge amount of energy, collisions with nuclei lead to multiple secondary particles, which can again collide and produce even more particles, and so on. For these particles a thicker shield is harmful until it is thick enough to absorb everything. On the other hand you shield all the low energy stuff, and the thicker the shield the higher the energy has to be before anything goes through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 2 stage shield might be necessary for long trips.</p>
<p>A Sci fi novel suggested freezing the water supply, and building a huge spherical shield around the spacecraft with octagonal blocks of ice. Blocks of ice could be removed, and used as needed.</p>
<p>High energy particles would interact with the ice to form low energy particles that could be stopped by a few feet of lead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the theory. I just wondered if real data had substantiated that this effect kicks in, in a detrimental degree, on real missions.</p>
<p>I'm sure all kinds of factors are at play in the models, but it's always interesting to see what the real-life parameters are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Despite what OP said, it's kind of too important to just ignore. You could shield your ship with anything provided you have a thick enough layer of it, the interesting question is about which materials allow you to <em>practically</em> shield your ship, which is entirely based around mass efficiency, since that's the single most important thing for efficient space travel.</p></div>		</li>
