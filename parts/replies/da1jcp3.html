			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, not only is it possible but we now believe it is fairly common. They're called &quot;slow quakes&quot; and the science on them is still brand new so we don't know a ton about them. We do know that they cause large amounts of movement but are imperceptible to humans at the surface and can be possible indicators of an imminent large earthquake. </p>

<p>Here's a video that does a good job of explaining them as well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l5Bc1ZFjkg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l5Bc1ZFjkg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've seen the difference in Christchurch, New Zealand over the last few years. </p>
<p>In 2011, we had a 6.3 that lasted ~10 seconds, but was incredibly violent with ground acceleration of ~2.2g. It destroyed most of the central city and killed 185 people. A few months earlier we had a 7.1 which lasted 40 seconds. Despite being larger, the shaking was much less intense at only 1.2g.</p></div>		</li>
