			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way something can move around a center of mass, is in a disk. If it wasn't a disc, things would collide over time, or more likely, be drawn to a single direction by the gravity of other objects.
So a solar system or a galaxy doesn't start out as a disc, but over time, collisions forces everything to move in the same direction(before objects like stars and planets form).
So yeah, it's basically the same principle to my knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that explain why there are spiral galaxies and then there are the more &quot;blobbish&quot;, irregular galaxies? Is the general shape of the galaxy indicative of its relative age?</p>
<p>EDIT: It seems u/ImaPBSkid answered my question below, arguing the relative shape of the galaxy is affected more by gravitational interaction with nearby galaxies than it is determined by the galaxy's age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not exactly true, at least not according to the theories that gave rise to the belief in Dark Matter. Stars in galaxies orbit as if they're embedded like a plate inside a sphere/spheroid of mass. The planar form of visible matter is somehow linked to ordinary matter interacting at the electromagnetic and nuclear forces level when particles hit each other. The theories of dark matter postulate it is made of WIMPs, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles - the key point &quot;weakly interacting&quot; meaning, they don't bump into things or deflect each other when they do. The formation of visible matter into discs is dependent on the fact that they do interact when they bump into each other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it works the same.  Galaxies tend to stay disky until they interact gravitationally with other galaxies, then they become distorted into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_galaxy" target="_blank">irregulars</a> or full-blown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy" target="_blank">ellipticals</a>, with stars that have randomly-oriented orbits, rather than all orbiting the same way in a disk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matter of all elements collapses in from all directions to form a proto star. The star will have a resulting spin and as more material collapses it will spin faster. This spin throws the heavier elements out into the planetary disc, leaving the lightest elements in the star. The heavier elements then clump together form planets which are almost all in the same plane. Over time their mutual gravity will flatten the plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a stab at this:</p>
<p>The stuff that makes up the planets (and by extension our own bodies) come from the cores of older stars that have since gone nova and expelled their heavier elements. These heavier elements are created within stars during the fusion process that generates a star's tremendous energy. As hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, there's more than enough after a nova for it to build up into significant quantities to form a new star like our sun, whereas there's comparatively less of elements of carbon, iron, uranium, etc. to form planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that every element past iron is created during super nova's.  I've just never heard how it accreates into planets or ends up in the dust disks that form planetary systems.  It seems  it would all be blown every which way during super novas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, the Sun is mostly hydrogen and helium, but it also contains a small percentage of heavier elements. The nebula surrounding the Sun as it formed was also mostly hydrogen and helium with a small amount of heavier elements in the form of dust and ice. The planets initially formed from the solid material, the dust and ice, because it was able to stick together. A few of the planets grew very quickly, and became massive enough (about ten times the mass of Earth) that their gravity collected a thick hydrogen/helium atmosphere from the surrounding nebula. These are the outer giant planets. The inner planets grew more slowly, and never became massive enough to collect thick hydrogen/helium atmospheres before the solar wind blew the gas out of the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just a clarification, centrifugal force is just inertia.  It is not actually a real force.</p></div>		</li>
