			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't work like that. Imagine a balloon being blown up, space is like the surface area of the balloon except it's in four dimensions instead of two. People get confused because they imagine the universe is like the volume of the balloon expanding into the surrounding space, but the analogy is only referring to the surface area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what is the surface of the balloon expanding into? I never got how this analogy answers the question. It just re-states the same 3D question in 2D. </p>
<p>Also, isn't scientist's leading position that the universe is flat? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that objects get bigger as well, or is it just the space between object that expands??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, what exactly is space/universe expanding into? Space/Universe isn’t expanding into anything, it’s just expanding.</p>
<p>The Universe contains everything. If something was outside the Universe, it would also be part of the Universe too. Outside of that? Still Universe. It’s Universe everywhere you look. </p>
<p>Either the Universe is infinite, going on forever, or its finite, with a limited volume. In either case, the Universe has no edge. When we imagine the Universe expanding after the Big Bang, we imagine an explosion, with a spray of matter coming from a single point. But this isn’t accurate.</p>
<p>A much appropriate example would be the surface of a balloon. Not the 3 dimensional balloon, just its 2 dimensional surface. If you were an ant crawling around the surface of a huge balloon, and the balloon was your whole universe, you would see the balloon as essentially flat under your feet.</p>
<p>Imagine the balloon is inflating. Other ants are moving away from you in other directions. The further they are, the faster away they’re moving. Even though it feels like a flat surface, walk in any direction long enough and you’d return to your starting point.</p>
<p>You might imagine a growing circle and wonder what it’s expanding into. But that’s a nonsense question. There’s no direction you could crawl that would get you outside the surface. Your 2-dimensional ant brain can’t comprehend an expanding 3-dimensional object. There may be a center to the balloon, but there’s no center to the surface. Just a shape that extends in all directions and wraps in upon itself. And yet, your journey to make one lap around the balloon takes longer and longer as the balloon gets more inflated.  </p>

<p>You are imagining the universe as a sphere that's expanding, it's actually more like the surface of an expanding sphere.</p></div>		</li>
