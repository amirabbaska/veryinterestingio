			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer describes the abstraction but not the underlying roots.  It's like saying greenland is further north than Italy because it's higher up on the map.  It doesn't actually explain anything, sorry.</p>
<p>Edit: I feel people are misunderstanding me: if the question were how do I multiple two negatives, or help me understand what I need to do when multiplying negative numbers, this would be close to a perfect answer, it's concise, understandable, easy to remember.  </p>
<p>But I feel it does nothing to explain <em>why</em> multiplying negatives reversed the sign.  </p>
<p>If we reduce math to counting physical things, like bottle caps lets say, then a negative number can be seen as a bottle cap debt.  so, 5 + 5 is 10, 5 - 5 is 0, this is obvious.  5 + -5 is 0, 5 - -5 is 10.  Only slightly less self evident yes?  -5 means take away 5, so 5 - -5 means take away a 5 unit takeaway.  Semantically: don't not count these 5 caps, which means count them.  (there's a reason we say don't use double negatives when writing language because it's confusing.  In math we have developed rules, abstractions, to make it less confusing)  </p>
<p>Multiplying is simply saying add a number to itself some number of times.  5 time 6 means add 5 to itself 6 times.<br />
0 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 30.  By the same token then, -5 times 6 (0 + -5 + -5 + -5 + -5 + -5 + -5) is -30.  </p>
<p>So what about 5 times -6.  What do we mean when we multiply by a negative number?  Well, then we subtract instead.  0 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5 = -30, and -5 times - 6 : 0 - -5 - -5 - -5 - -5 - -5 - -5 = 30  </p>
<p>The answer I was criticizing is essentially just another way of saying +<em>+ = +, -</em>- = +, -<em>+ = - and +</em>- = -, or so I thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breaking multiplication into the 'multiple additions' as you have done is a much better explanation than the abstraction, imho. Thank you for this. </p>
<p>I was also going to suggest breaking it out into the identifiers to explain WHY we have to define multiplying by -1 as 'reverse the sign':</p>
<p>-1 x -1 = 1 because IF -1 x -1 = -1, AND -1 x 1 = -1, THEN -1 = 1 and we're all cats. Because we don't want to be cats, Y x -1 = -Y. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, multiplication is not really multiple additions. It just happens to work that way for whole numbers. Really multiplication is scaling by a factor, and &quot;negative&quot; multiplication is, exactly as this guy mentioned, changing direction. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Then we have invented imaginary numbers.</p>
<pre><code>-i * -i = -1
-i * i = 1</code></pre>
<p>The answer really boils down to &quot;they don't have to, but if you choose the other option you get a different system of numbers that are useful but not for the same things&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiplication is <em>not</em> repeated addition. </p>
<p>Or, to be precise, only for the set of natural numbers (positive integers) is multiplication actually identical to repeated addition. Leaving aside examples where that is obvious (do pi*sqrt(2) with addition, please), devious (matrix multiplication), or flat-out impossible (algebraic structures with multiplication but no addition), it even fails for the multiplication of negative numbers. Or fractions.</p>
<p>You have seen here examples in the OP (simply restating negative*negative=positive, using an example) and here (multiplication of negative numbers is now suddenly substraction). There are reasons math is often confusing for students, and teaching it this way is among them.</p>
<p>The actual reason why negative*negative=positive is far beyond the scope of ELI5 (maybe ELI15? usually only taught at a college level). In the end, it is about how multiplication is defined, here starting with the natural numbers, and extending it in a consistent and useful way to include more solutions for additional equations. </p>
<p>So, the ELI5, if one is really needed, might be: &quot;Multiplying a negative number with a negative number results in a positive number, because it is defined that way&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh please, if you're going to pull out the old this is too complicated for ELI5 you should at least be correct about it. </p>
<p>I start by saying if you think of mathematics as counting physical markers, which you should have immediately spotted as an ELI5 way to say when limited to whole number sets: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication</a></p>
<p>furthermore, the proof for multiplying negatives is extremely simple, one of the simplest mathematical proofs there is:</p>

<p>Now is my original explanation simplified?  yes yes it is, but it's also consistent and can be tested for rigor using any combination of whole numbers and any possible iteration for addition, subtraction and multiplication of whole numbers.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bob is $5 in debt (He has -5 dollars). If he has twice as much debt he would be $10 in debt (-10 dollars). Debt is negative assets. Negative debt is positve assets, i.e. plain ol' assets.</p>
<p>The positive numbers are up against the negative numbers in the superbowl. The positives have possesion of the ball and try a fancy play but fail losing 5 yard as a result ( -(+5), or just -5 ). The next play the positives gain 10 yards ( +10 = 10 ) which from the negative's point of view is a loss of 10 yards ( -(-10) = +10 = 10). </p>
<p>A precision tunneling machine is set to dig a 1 kilometer long, perfectly level tunnel through a mountain. Unfortunately it has a bad widget that will cause it to come out the other end of the tunnel 3 meters too low ( -3 m ). However before excavation begins the bad widget is put in backwards, which reverses the error. Now it will come out 3 meters too high ( -(-3) = 3 ).</p>
<p>Other examples might use air pressure or walking forwards and backwards.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you can think of that -1 like a direction reversal in Uno. What happens when you get 2 'reverse' cards in a row? It goes forward.</p>
