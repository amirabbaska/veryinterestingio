			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I've done this on so many occasions. I think they are afraid their insurance won't cover them but they cover idiots too. We will physically show them the stove was on and they finally admit they were frying chicken and fell asleep. Not to mention the aluminum pan is melted with chicken bits in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who makes the effort to fry chicken and find it so exhausting that they fall asleep?</p>
<p>Stoned people? People who cook for others?</p>
<p>Edit- For the example provided, I'm working under the assumption that people are doing more than boiling a hot dog and forgetting about it. There's like 8 steps involved in making fried chicken specifically. I already know more than half of you are silly irresponsible drunks fresh out of mom and dad's house. </p>
<p>I realize now I probably jinxed myself into setting my own house on fire now over hot dogs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. So I'm currently in a sort of halfway house, and last year several of the residents were cooking stuff, one put a pizza in the oven. I went into the kitchen for something and I saw the smoke coming out. I opened it to find that a pile of grease on the bottom had ignited and was burning. The fire alarms go off as I'm turning off the oven and trying to find the box of baking soda I knew was around there, everyone else is just standing there watching me going &quot;uh what happened?&quot;, the gal who had put the pizza in was calmly <em>turning the fucking oven back on</em> and lecturing me that everyone was hungry and the pizza wasn't done! I managed to find the baking soda and put the fire out, called the landlady and maintenance guy and find out how to shut off the alarm. Ugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fire Investigator here... the part of the building that has the most damage is not necessarily where the fire started. Let's say for example that the fire started in a back bedroom,  but had limited air supply. The fire growth will be limited by the lack of oxygen. The fire can spread out the living room where there is more fresh air. The fire can grow there a bit more. In this example, the fire can break a window, which feeds oxygen to the fire. The living room will likely show severe fire damage,  but the back bedroom will have less damage because the fire was what we call oxygen deficient in that area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very common criticism of fire investigation is that it is basically a non-scientific enterprise where basically an apprentice system perpetuates myth and superstition.</p>
<p>E.g. &quot;crazed glass&quot; and V-patterns were taken to indicate the presence of accelerants, but you can have both of these without them.</p>
<p>Have you noticed any change in your field since towards more evidence-based investigation in the last several years?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  Over the past 15 years there have been <em>huge</em> advancements in our understanding of fire behavior and it's impact on structures and materials it interacts with as well as what happens when we interact with the fire (IE fire suppression activity).  In order to qualify as an expert witness, you must prove to a judge that you are basing your testimony and investigation, first and foremost, on the scientific method, your techniques abide by common and accepted scientific practices current in the field, etc.</p>
<p>In the near future, who can be a fire investigator is going to shift in a big way and it's going to focus a lot more on engineering experience than on service in the law enforcement or fire departments.</p>
<p>When you read about cases like Cameron Todd Willingham, today, that investigator would have been thrown out of court.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, not trying to become an arsonist, but the science of fire and the investigation has always fascinated me. I see sometimes in TV shows things like &quot;they tried to make it look like an accident, but obviously it started over here with a match&quot; (or whatever). But how hard would it be to make it look like an electrical fire for example? Lets say I open up an outlet or junction box somewhere and loosen some things up and physically make sparks and black marks inside the box. Then light the fire however (with a lighter or something). Can you still tell if a lighter or match was used at that point, and can you tell when it's really an electrical fire only? (Again, honestly not trying to commit arson, just fascinated. I'm an engineer). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are identifiable failures that can be seen in many electrical devices after a fire. In what you described, an electrical engineer on behalf of the insurance company and the product manufacturer would destructively examine the item, looking for said failures. For example, I was just observing an exam where a certain power strip was identified in the area of origin. All of the contact points where you would plug in the blades were relatively intact, except for one, which showed the characteristic 'chomp' of an arcing event. This information, considering no other electronics in the area of origin showed characteristics of failure, places significant reason to believe the power strip was the point of origin.</p>
<p>Edit: the ability to conclusively exclude items as potential ignition sources is equally important as identifying them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can agree with this completely. I am helping a student of mine get his papers on locating the origin of a fire through arc mapping published. He is doing a PhD and his research is focused on identifying different kinds of short circuits (and the preceding leakage current) which result in different kinds of arc beads on electrical cables. The shape and size of the arc beads show in what way the electrical cable melted or popped from an excess of current. By mapping the arc beads around a room that has burned, he can scientifically, often to a very small area, determine the origin of the fire. It is a fascinating science and his discoveries so far have been lauded by the fire investigation community. Only problem is I have to help him translate the papers from Japanese to English and then get them up to journal standards. We've been at it for a few years already. </p></div>		</li>
