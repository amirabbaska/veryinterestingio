<p>This has been my experience with my pacemaker. They do indeed set a value and if that threshold value is compromised, the pacer will fire. I've had Medtronic and my experience has not been positive in the 10+ years I've had it. I guess the &quot;accelerometer&quot; you talk of just doesn't work well with my heart. I'm now using a Boston Scientific pacer/defib for a few years and I've had no issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the programming we do with pacemakers is to preserve battery.  People sometimes feel worse with pacing than they do with their natural heart beats so we try to usually avoid pacing if possible.</p>
<p>Theoretically, if we paced at a really high rate (&gt;100 beats per minute or so),  it could damage your heart and lower its overall function,  but this is not something that we ever do </p></div>		</li>
