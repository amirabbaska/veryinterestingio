			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem knowledgeable in the area, are the orbits three+ star systems mathematically impossible to predict?</p>
<p>I finished the Cixin Liu series that started with The Three Body Problem, and the central premise is that a three star system is essentially chaotic and the orbits of the stars are impossible to predict.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah.  The only analytical solutions are when one of the bodies has negligible mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no <em>analytic</em> solutions to the three body problem, but the orbital movements can still be well predicted through numerical methods. Saying that they are mathematically impossible to predict is flat-out wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice, what happens is a situation like two stars that are so close to each other (or the third star is so far away) that the third one basically feels the force of one big star. Essentially, the stable systems are the ones that are a hierarchy of two-body problems. Those can actually be solved fairly well. This could even be quite complex, like two pairs of small stars in tight binaries orbiting at different radii around a more massive binary pair to make a stable 6-body system. </p>
<p>The unpredictable ones would tend to throw out one of the stars eventually. So you really only see the stable ones in practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NO, they are NOT impossible to predict, the three-body problem has no analytic solutions, but stepping through the differential equations iteratively at arbitrarily small time-steps works perfectly fine. The smaller the time-steps, the more expensive it is, but for three bodies it's not an issue. Modern N-body simulations use tens of thousands of objects, not just three. </p></div>		</li>
