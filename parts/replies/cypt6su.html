			<div class="markdown"><p>Why couldn't diagnosis criteria and other societal factors explain the increase?</p>
<p>Attitudes toward behavior problems have changed quite dramatically. Health care overall seems more accessible. There is also an incentive now to actually diagnose something like ASD; when there were no treatments or social services of any kind there was no reason to put anything on paper, but now diagnosis is a prerequisite for getting all kinds of support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that is that people don't just disappear, nor does autism disappear with age. So we can re-evaluate. It's not like you get one shot at it when they are 4 years old. </p>
<p>Maybe this will be more clear. Say we sucked at diagnosing this in 1978. Those people are still alive, in their late 30's, meaning we can diagnose them again with modern standards. </p>
<p>It would be one thing if the increase was only in people who are mild on the spectrum, but it it's not. There are more cases of full on completely debilitating (needing care their entire lives) now than in recent history. </p>
<p>It's not like we are comparing numbers from 1910 to 2010. It is 1985 to 2005. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And, this is just a speculation, but if you've managed to live decades with something you are not very likely to put effort into going to see doctors and get diagnosed. For all you know, there's nothing wrong with you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whats the actual age one can diagnose autism at? I have a theory thats its not so much about genetics but about brain function. We have become very left brained and analytical - and im not saying we only use left or right, but seems like autistic children have a hyperactive left brain. </p>
<p>i used to consider myself autistic untill i started meditating and consciously using my right brain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A ) The confidence intervals in that study are unbelievable. The 60% figure could be anywhere from 33% to 87%.</p>
<p>B ) That study specifically evaluated one change in the diagnostic criteria and one change in reporting policy. I suspect both of those have seen more than one change in the last few decades.</p>
<p>C ) The study also did not evaluate societal factors outside of government/medical policy, like changes in doctors' knowledge, behaviors, and beliefs or changes in cultural acceptance of psychological issues (I suspect that the parent in the doctor's office can exert some influence over the proceedings).</p>
<p>Given all of that, there's no particular reason to believe that incidence of ASDs has actually increased. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Citation please? I don't think there is evidence to support this statement, especially the bit about &quot;chemical exposure&quot;.  The other part of your statement is perfectly acceptable however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they couldn't explain it, it's that they don't (or don't seem to based on current evidence). Is possible to estimate the effect of various causes, test these estimates against real data and determine if some factor explains the variation. My understanding is that studies like this have been done, and generally show that changing diagnostic criteria does not explain (all of) the increase.</p>
<p>Studies like this are not necessarily definitive, but at least suggest that we should be trying to come up with other hypotheses to test and not just say &quot;diagnostic criteria have changed&quot; and leave it at that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I've been going back and forth in another sub-thread with someone who is clinging really hard to an interpretation of a study that tells this story. Problem is that the study isolates two specific changes to the medical/diagnostic process and finds that those two changes could be responsible for about 60% of the increase in diagnoses. So the other 40% <em>could be</em> vaccines or pesticides or whatever solution the Internet is pushing. But the other 40% could also be <em>everything else that has changed in society besides those two diagnostic changes</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not really an objective method to tell whether doctors are more likely to give a diagnosis. Most of these studies only control for some small part of the diagnosis process, and there are variables that none of them have been able to measure.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> compare, for example, the DSM-III to the DSM-V and say &quot;guideline X results in z% more diagnoses than guideline Y <em>when intrepreted by similar doctors for similar patients in 2015.</em>&quot;  You're allowed to do this because the only independent variable is the written criteria.</p>
<p>But that's not the full story.</p>
<p>Without a time machine, you <em>can't</em> say &quot;Doctors from 1985 using the 1985 criteria diagnosed z% less often than doctors from 2015 using 2015 criteria&quot;. Here you're varying the criteria, the patients <em>and</em> the doctors.</p>
<p>Even after controlling for the changing guidelines, you still can't attribute the rest to a change in ASD incidence. A chunk of the 40% could be doctors' interpretation of the diagnostic criteria, not the criteria themselves.</p>
<p>I'm not denying an environmental influence. There are several studies out there linking specific environmental factors to autism with &gt;95% confidence. I'm just saying that &quot;Diagnoses are becoming more prevalent&quot; is a sufficient explanation within experimental error (simply because there's no way to reliably measure a change in human opinions over time.)</p>
<p>Here's an analogy. &quot;Changes in constitutional law account for a 60% increase in the US federal budget from 1965 compared to 1865. The actual budget (correcting for interest, population, etc.) increased 800%. After correcting for changes in the US legal system, this leaves a 740% increase. We expect that spending is proportional to the number of people in need. We conclude that the 1965 US had 740% more poverty compared to 1865.&quot; This is certainly a strange thing to conclude. The conclusion overlooks the fact that the <em>interpretations</em> of the laws have changed, and the government can now spend a ton more money under looser intrepretations of the constitution.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit misleading. The linked article states that 33% &quot;could be explained by the change in diagnostic criteria alone&quot;, while 60% is explained &quot;by the change in diagnostic criteria and the inclusion of outpatient contacts.&quot;  This inclusion of outpatient contacts still essentially constitutes an artifact of how the data are counted, rather than an actual rise in prevalence.  </p>
<p>As with any topic though, one study can't make a definitive conclusion.  For example, <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9495906" target="_blank">this study</a> from earlier this year found no significant increase in the prevalence of autism between 1990 and 2010 after accounting for methodological differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer this, look at the influx of ADD/ADHD diagnoses that have popped up in the last couple decades.</p>
<p>We have a broader understanding of the 'disability' and have established many more symptoms that qualify a person for certain categories.</p>
<p>Previously we just labeled them as hyper, weird, awkward, etc but now that we are understanding abnormal brain function, we are able to diagnose on a broader scale.</p>
<p>Also, take malaria for example.  The Italian root of the word means 'bad air' because people thought that you got the illness from air that was contaminated.  It was not until scientists studied the transfer of the illness from person to person, that they understood the role mosquitoes played in the equation.  Upon that discovery millions of people were found to have malaria and not some unknown sickness.</p></div>		</li>
