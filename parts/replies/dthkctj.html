			<div class="markdown"><p>it has been found to be likely that vomiting after exercise is due to your body not being able to filter hydrogen ions out of the blood. This leads to your blood being more acidic than normal. Vomiting gets rid of stomach acid, and hence hydrogen ions. Therefore the stomach is able to pull more hydrogen out of the blood in order to replace the lost stomach acid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't strictly true. The reason we feel nausea after intense exercise is the ditrubution of blood in the body. We have a finite amount, and cannot supply blood to all organs, all the time. During exercise our muscles require greater blood flow for respiration to occur and waste products to be removed. Blood is diverted from less vital organs such as the gastrointestinal system, which causes it to void the contents of our stomach as it cannot be effectively processed.</p>
<p>This is also true for sensation of nausea during times of stress, also referred to 'fight-or-flight'. The blood is being diverted away from non-vital processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, although vomiting can be caused by several reasons after finishing a run stopping quickly can cause the issue because your body doesn't react quickly enough after the sudden change in exertion. </p></div>		</li>
