<p>Nothing beats diesel fuel as a concentrated energy source for a mobile engine. The most important diesel engines in the world are in tractors. If you do not use tractors for farming you must use horses and mules. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you use something like HVO for tractors. Burning CH-chains in a ICE doesn't require petroleum. Non-fossil CH fuels are possible, but more expensive (currently).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are alternative fuels. Brazil is producing a lot of alcohol and running a lot of engines on it. Diesel fuel is the densest energy fuel around.All alternatives will be more expensive and less satisfactory. But farm tractors can be used to grow enough oil that we can still use them and not revert to horses, mules, and oxen. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Uranium-235's fission products would like to have a word with you. :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HVO is just as dense, it's a synthetic fuel that can be run in any diesel engine without modification. Can be made from more or less any HC, such as waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though the biggest polluters are heavy cargoships which we have no alternative either. Next you get airlines and trucks, guess what, no alternatives either and no those battery trucks aren't an option either. They can't go from A to B driving 24x7. So just your personal car and even that's limited we could cut out our oil usage, but again, that's only a sliver of the entire pie. And not even every car user can go electric. </p>
<p>And then we aren't even going to other chemical qualities oil has as it's being used in far more products then you can imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When cars become autonomous and companies like uber grow, personally owned cars should go down, because it will probably be cheaper to pay for an auto uber when you need it than buy a car. To make this work uber would want to run the car 24/7 for maximum profit, so like you said about trucks having to run all day and night no time to charge, neither would autonomous ubers.</p>
<p>I'm guessing they would just have places to swap batteries like propane tanks and charge time on batteries are going to be much lower in the future...according to my crystal ball at least lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rail is neat but you still require trucks for end to end deliveries. And while trucks could be partially replaced by trains, in Europe that is near impossible as well requires vast investments that aren't happening. Last but not least, the amount of trucks simply dwarfs trains at ease. Without having hard data, I bet Japan isn't doing any better then the EU/US.</p></div>		</li>
