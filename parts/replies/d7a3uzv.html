			<div class="markdown"><p>Hemoglobin has a molecular weight of about 64400 atomic units per protein. The average total amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell is around 30 picograms.</p>
<p>64400 atomic units = 1.06938789* 10^-7 picograms per protein.</p>
<p>(30<em> 10^-12) / (1.06938789</em> 10^-19) =280534316 hemoglobin proteins per red blood cell. I think /u/bremidon is right, if he means million instead of billion.</p>

(handy if you want to do the math yourself if you think I'm incorrect)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably did read it right.  I was only thinking with half my brain when I quickly hacked that out and didn't do a sanity check.  I fixed the numbers after the fact.</p>
<p>Thanks for showing the math :)  I was too lazy to type it all out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The number you gave isin hundreds of millions which is 3 orders of magnitude different from what he originally said. The difference in exactly how many hundreds of millions of trivial because it's a range. 250-300million. </p>
<p>So what you're actually saying is I was right.</p></div>		</li>
