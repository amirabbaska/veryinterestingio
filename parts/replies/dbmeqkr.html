<p>I can't read in dreams. When I see words, sometimes ill &quot;know&quot; what it says, but if I try to actually spell it out, i can't focus on it. The letters will actually change and sometimes Ill be able to read it for a second. And then ill look back and it says something different. </p>
<p>It's one of the instant signs that I know i'm dreaming. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a good ELI5 way of explaining it, but the fact of the matter is that none of your brain is truly 'inactive'. Sleep is super interesting :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird. Before, all text would be scribbles or just not make sense. Then one day in my youth I watched a Batman cartoon about him getting trapped in his dreams and he notices it's a dream when all books only contain scribbles, and I always thought how peculiar that was. Ever since then, I can read in my dreams, though I don't remember if I remember after waking up.</p>
<p>My whole life I've never been able to realize I'm in a dream or control any aspect of it though.</p></div>		</li>
