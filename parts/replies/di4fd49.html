			<div class="markdown"><p>Backflow preventer/RPZ valves do not serve for this type of function.
That sprinkler/standpipe system should have an independent water source (unless it's a combined fire/domestic tank) with an independent booster/fire pump to pressurize the system.
Even if the system was fed by a combined fire/domestic tank, the domestic water would be supplied via a discharge line that would sit directly above the fire reserve.
The sprinkler system is almost always independent of domestic water. Unless it's a dry system, sprinkler lines will always remain filled with water and pressurized via pumps.
Surges in domestic water use would affect the sprinkler system immensely. If the system were tied to a pump, water flow detectors would immediately sense a drop in pressure and this would trigger pressurization pumps and the fire alarm system that monitors the sprinkler system.

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this stadium was built to be &quot;eco-friendly&quot;, in fact, it is to my knowledge the most energy efficient NFL stadium currently in existence. It was using a near by small lake for sustainability and water supply. Basically, during inspection we wanted to verify that this &quot;eco-friendly&quot; system was capable of handling a sudden drop in water pressure while being up to fire code standards. </p>
<p>I don't remember the exact specifics of the water system since I had just completed training and was essentially shadowing a Captain at the time, but I do remember the details around why we were spending so much time there and what the end goal was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the backfliw preventers would be pretty much mandatory these days. No engineer worth their salt would not have them in there.....well....unless it's built in Quebec.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the former, but as I understand it it will keep pressure in the sprinkler pipes if the supply goes low? Is this incorrect? I only deal with fire alarms themselves, not suppression,  so I would appreciate clarification without having to get certified in NFPA 13.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, a backflow preventer is to prevent contaminated water back into the potable supply. An owner can't not install one its federally required by the clean water act of the seventies.
Secondly what can happen if the fire system doesn't have the supply in the event to of a fire is not enough water will be sent to the sprinkler heads until pressure is restored, that's if there's no fire pump. If there is a fire pump it will draw water to it up until about a negative pressure of 25 after that it won't be able to pull any water, and all this is based upon the water main not collapsing from the negative pressure.
Third the fire system is on its own dedicated line directly to city main. When the fire pump does draw the water the lower pressure should shut down the water supply to the domestic water if it does go to the negative pressure. </p></div>		</li>
