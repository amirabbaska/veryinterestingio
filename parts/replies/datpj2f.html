			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Taiwan maintains an unofficial ambassadorial presence in the US called TECRO (Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office).  The Representative lives in Twin Oaks, one of the most impressive estates in DC proper. If I remember correctly it is the largest privately owned residence in DC. It is incredibly beautiful and the interior is impressive.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been there for diplomatic dinners. Bring wine!</p>
<p>Fun story that isn't in the article above!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the pending change in diplomatic relations between the ROC and the United States in late 1978, Twin Oaks was sold to the Friends of Free China Association, an American non-profit organization. With the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act in April 1979, which provided legal protection for the original ownership, the Taiwan Government purchased Twin Oaks back from the Association in 1982. In official recognition of its historic and cultural significance, Twin Oaks was placed on the National Register for Historic Sites by the United States Department of the Interior in February 1986.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story told at the dinners frequently is how they sold Twin Oaks to FoFCA (Friends of Free China) for $1 more of as a temporary thing so that they didn't lose the property during the diplomatic relationship changes during the late 70s. In 1979 the United States switched diplomatic recognition from free China to Communist China  and abrogated its defense treaty with an ally as old as the ROC-Taiwan. ROC-Taiwan was concerned that it would lose possession of Twin Oaks, a historic estate, originally built by the founder of the National Geographic Society, that had served as the residence for nine ROC ambassadors since 1937. Senator Goldwater backed the FoFCA and challenged Jimmy Carter on this (as an old ally of the Taiwan-ROC since the 50s). 10 days before the treaty took effect, ROC-Taiwan sold Twin Oaks Estate for $1 to FoFCA (Friends of Free China) to prevent it from falling into the hands of the community government as their embassy.</p>
<p>The twist? FoFCA then turned around later and sold Twin Oaks back to Taiwan for several million dollars (estate price) rather than giving it back for $1. </p>
<p>Anyways that's the story told more or less. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to work for a politician in Canada as a right hand man type of guy.</p>
<p>If you've watched the west wing, I was like charlie. </p>
<p>We got a request from the Canadian TECRO and requested an introductory meeting with my boss.</p>
<p>We got permission to meet with them from the leadership but there couldn't be any Canadian or Provincial flags in the room, there was to be nothing that would identify it as a &quot;state&quot; meeting. it was just an informal greeting given the relationship between our government and China.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting my counterpart (the dude who accompanied the politician) asked if I could take a picture of my boss and his boss together; RIGHT UNDER THE SIGN IDENTIFYING WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICE MY BOSS WORKED IN.</p>
<p>I saw what he was doing and moved them to another position saying I could get a better angle that way. </p>
<p>My counterpart grumbled but I won.</p>
<p>Only twice in a seven year career did I have a west wing moment and that was one of them.</p>
<p>tl:dr; met with taiwan political representatives who tried to take pictures under gov't signage, didn't let them</p></div>		</li>

<p>ETA: It also can't be a consulate, because that would mean Taipei is just a significant city in the People's Republic of China, rather than the capital city of the Republic of China, and we can't say that either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially if you are worried about going through 5+ years of hard times. Right now with China doing well (strong growth, many new jobs, better education, etc) it doesn't make sense that the people of China would want a major change. Yes there are HUGE problems that China is still facing but they have gotten a lot done in the last 25 years. It's actually really impressive. But to do that they also had to pollute like crazy and allow some shady things to go on.</p>
<p>But imagine if the US formally recognized Taiwan and China's growth halted and their problems stayed the same. Now double imagine if people got around the great firewall and realized that there was another Han Chinese place much like them that was doing great and had a more democratic system. </p>
<p>Taiwan is and will always be a threat if it continues to show what China &quot;could&quot; (you never actually know) have been if the Nationalists won or if Democracy/Capitalism was allowed. It is a direct message that there is another way that might be better. That is scary if you are the main power in the Chinese gov. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation goes into the history of the matter relatively accurately, but it doesn't quite go into why Taiwan is such an important issue for China, nor does it go into what the potential consequences of the US interacting with Taiwan is.</p>
<p>This has been discussed quite a bit in the last few days over on /r/geopolitics, and I'll cross post a few of my replies there for greater context if people are new to the issue.</p>
<p>Regarding why Taiwan's political status is such an important issue for China, this is why:</p>
<p>&quot;For China it's a combination of territorial, historical, geopolitical, and as a matter of &quot;principle&quot; or even &quot;destiny&quot;. All these things put together help to inform China's big problem with Taiwan independence and why reunification is on China's long term plans.</p>
<p>Territorial: simply put, China sees Taiwan (the island) as a province of China. The lineage of this issue goes back quite a few decades to before the Chinese Civil War to the results of the first Sino-Japanese war in 1895.</p>
<p>Historical: partly related to the above, but also part of China's participation in WWII with the results that the territories occupied by Imperial Japan were to be restored to China. The PRC sees itself as the successor to the ROC, and Taiwan as their territory. An uneasy peace has lasted since the end of the civil war with a few minor clashes occasionally (First, Second, Third Taiwan Strait Crises), but technically the civil war has never really been settled. If Taiwan declares independence, then for China, it essentially means one of their provinces under &quot;enemy occupation&quot; is attempting to secede and would require a military response. One can see such a scenario as a continuation of the Chinese Civil War.</p>
<p>Geopolitical: if Taiwan declares independence, it means it will be able to have the rights of a standard nation, such as hosting foreign troops, or conducting a true foreign policy etc. For China, this presents a real and existential risk/liability of facing deployments of capable and foreign military assets that close to their southeastern border, that they'd prefer to not have to face. On the flip side, Taiwan independence also means China will be unable to have access to Taiwan as a base to the open Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;Principle&quot;/&quot;destiny&quot;: this is a bit harder for non-Chinese to understand. Basically, it comes down to the idea that in China's multi thousand year history, since the original warring states was unified to form China by the Qin emperor, all the subsequent dynasties of conquest and cyclical fractures of China into smaller states was always followed by the goal of reunification. This is more of a traditional/cultural/emotional reason but it still strongly resonates with most if not all Chinese -- that the &quot;destiny&quot; of China, is if it suffers a schism, it must always return to whole again (I know it sounds a bit silly/mystic but I attest that it is also a very important reason people believe in). More practically speaking, the principle of Taiwan independence also opens the can of worms where other provinces in China may wonder why they cannot also secede -- basically accepting Taiwan independence would present a massive and dangerous precedent for China's overall territorial integrity.&quot;</p>
<p>From this comment thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/5g67vi/trump_risks_dispute_with_china_after_call_with/daqcqeq/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<hr />
<p>As for the potential consequences of greater US formal recognition of Taiwan or even Taiwan declaring formal independence, China has a very public record of vowing to use military force in the event of that happening, and we came very close in the 1996 Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. Obviously in such a scenario, the US will probably intervene on Taiwan's behalf in which case it may be US vs China. Such a war would obviously be one that China will lose, but the problem for China is that Taiwan is the single most important geopolitical and territorial interest for it that it will be willing to wage a war for it, if the red line of independence is crossed.</p>
<p>Another reply of mine which directly addresses this matter:</p>
<p>&quot;It's true that China cannot &quot;win&quot; a full scale conventional war against the US in a Taiwan contingency.</p>
<p>But that isn't China's goal. China is instead using its military and economic capability to try and deter Taiwan from moving towards formal independence and deter foreign nations from explicitly supporting Taiwan diplomatically or politically. If the US chose to intervene in such a scenario where China invades due to Taiwan declaring independence (or something similar), then China will seek to make the fight very costly for the US and for Taiwan as well (not to mention the economic and geopolitical consequences for the world). China knows they will probably lose that fight and the whole of China will suffer for it (possibly with even the nuclear option being taken), but Taiwan moving to independence is something they simply cannot tolerate, so in the present and foreseeable future they are trying to develop capabilities that will hopefully make the costs of a war so high for Taiwan and/or the US, such that Taiwan will not move towards formal independence and that the US will not intervene if China is obligated to attack Taiwan.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good explanation except for the suggestion that China cannot win a full scale conventional war there.  Taiwan is literally right off the coast of Fujian province and the amount of arms China has lined up in Fujian province would easily annihilate the entire island.  China has purposely underdeveloped the coastal area immediately near where Taiwan is as well, to prevent forces based in Taiwan from easily destroying critical infrastructure.  There are large cities in Fujian province but they haven't been built up as much as cities elsewhere because of paranoia over needing to eventually fight a war, and instead they've built up a ton of military capability there.  There's a reason why cities in Fujian are relatively less developed than other big coastal provinces that have megacities like Shanghai and Shenzhen, the PRC purposely puts less money into building huge industrial centers in Fujian out of fear that in an all out war it would cause too much damage.</p>
<p>The other reason why there's no chance in hell that the US would win is simply that the US has zero reason to go fight a full scale conventional war against China, while all the Chinese troops would psychologically be fighting for the integrity of their country.  It doesn't really matter how superior your arms are when there is no reason for US troops to be willing to go try and wage a full blown conventional war with body counts in the hundreds of thosuands against China just so Taiwan can claim it's independent.  If you actually tried to fight a conventional war for Taiwan it'd be even worse than the Korean war or the Vietnam war.  The Chinese already freaked out and stormed Korea when they thought the US would be right at their border.  With Taiwan being considered an actual province of China the response would be that much more intense, and Chinese military capability has come a long way since the 50's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still, in order for Chinese troops to land in Taiwan, they'd need to be able to get past the US Navy and Air Force, and the Chinese Navy is so far inferior that I have a hard time believing they could even come close to landing. </p>
<p>US still has air superiority as well, so good luck to China in getting planes in the air over Taiwan. </p>
<p>The US could really just dig in and say &quot;Come try to take it, I dare you&quot; and China wouldn't be able to do anything. </p>
<p>But it would never come to that. Despite our rivalry, both countries depend on one another and China would be endangering all they have gained in the past 20 years for an island. There is no point in doing so. </p>
<p>In reality, China will just continue to buy up Taiwanese talent. They can afford to pay Taiwanese doctors, engineers, professors, lawyers, etc. way more than companies in Taiwan can, and Taiwan's economy stands to get wrecked as a result. </p>
<p>Its probably in Taiwan's best interest to eventually try to unify with China while keeping some of their freedoms, like Hong Kong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>When Nixon was considering recognizing China, he asked his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger about Taiwan. Kissinger hid information about the sentiments of the people of Taiwan (separate from the brutal Chinese Nationalist regime) to make it easier for Nixon to come to his decision.</strong> This set the precedence for years to come.</p>
<p>But the US's &quot;One China Policy&quot; is different from China's One China Policy. Our One China Policy merely acknowledges China has a position, but that the resolution must be done peacefully. It does not name which side belongs. This ambiguity is there to appease China and still promote our interests. We have unofficial military exchanges with Taiwan, a defensive pact, and even unofficial reconnaissance bases in Taiwan facing China. About 6 years ago, the Democrats added a line that Taiwan's future must be determined solely by the people of Taiwan under peaceful means. China's One China Policy would never have that.</p>
<p>As for pretending to be China, in 1991, Taiwan amended its constitution to say it rules over the Free Areas of the Republic of China, which means basically Taiwan and not China. So that oft-repeated claim that Taiwan thinks it's the 'real china' has been basically untrue for 25 years. That said, the Chinese Nationalist Party themselves have not let go of this claim however, but they make up a tiny portion of Taiwan (but not in terms of power or votes).</p>
<p>But there's a major missing piece to all this, the people of Taiwan who have been living there for hundreds of years before the Chinese Nationalists came. <strong>Taiwan was given to the Chinese Nationalists just 4 years after WWII before they fully fled to Taiwan.</strong> Given that Taiwan's infrastructure, education, and everything else was built by the Japanese Imperials, when the Chinese Nationalists came to Taiwan they saw the Taiwanese people as traitors or Japanophiles. The Taiwanese dressed like Japanese, spoke Japanese, so they killed a lot of Taiwanese people and then banned Taiwanese and Japanese from being spoken in schools and in most public places. It devolved to mass rapes and looting, and a lot of students were killed too. Anyone who was any leader, politically, was systematically executed and then dumped in mass graves. Even majoring in International Relations or Political Science was enough to put you on a list. Before the Chinese Nationalists fled to Taiwan, they had murdered 10 million Chinese civilians which is a large reason why the people of China kicked them out to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Then came the second longest period of martial law in world history, where people in Taiwan were executed or disappeared at whim. Cops were paid by the severity of the crimes they uncovered, so a lot of confessions through torture for very implausible crimes were created, many under the cover of &quot;communist infiltration&quot;. There was even a prominent Taiwanese American critic and university professor assassinated on US soil for speaking too openly about the plight of the Taiwanese people.</p>
<p>But the people of Taiwan had fought so long to becoming a democracy and succeeded. Chiang Kai Shek and his son were Christian Catholics and would not stop Christian gatherings, so pastors of the Presbyterian church would hold 'gatherings' that were actually protests. That didn't mean they wouldn't get killed occasionally.</p>
<p>Since 1997, Taiwan has been a full democracy. And the Chinese Nationalists, widely considered one of the richest parties in any democracy in the world (with more liquid assets than the DNC and RNC combined) managed to lose the legislative and the executive branch of the Taiwan government in this year's election against a party with a budget less than 1/50th of theirs. A new party founded by youth also become the third largest party in a single election in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The number of people in Taiwan that want to be annexed into China is about 7%, and these people are part of the 14% of the population had immigrated from China. About 99% of Taiwanese youth identify with being Taiwanese. Most Taiwanese have had long ancestries on the island going back 400 - 1,600 years. Since it is no longer punishable to not identify with being Chinese as the Chinese Nationalist regime is out of power, most Taiwanese identify as Taiwanese first.</p>
<p>Taiwan is also one of the USA's biggest customers for arms and food and other products - The USA is also Taiwan's second largest trading partners and much of the trade with China ends up on US soil anyway (laptops, phones, etc). Taiwan has one of the largest ports in the world and is a top 20 economy. The Taiwan Caucus in congress is the second largest caucus in the US government.</p>
<p>This is why sentiment in Washington DC has been changing behind the scenes. Taiwan is a full fledged democracy, throwing it under the bus for China makes us look bad.</p></div>		</li>
