			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the original commenter, but I think I know what they may be referring to.  There's a consistent trend world-wide and throughout history of women having higher rates of cavities than men, particularly following puberty.  This has been linked by some studies of modern populations to the production of estrogen, which has one effect of reducing the antimicrobial properties of saliva when in high concentrations in the body.  Many types of hormonal birth control supply estrogen to the body to prevent ovulation by simulating an active pregnancy, and the rise in consistency of their use has resulted in more women having elevated levels of estrogen more of the time.  Thus, more consistently compromised saliva and a higher frequency of cavities and other oral microbial diseases.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we see a similar shift around the time when societies transitioned to agriculture, with the standing theory being that the increased fertility of these periods is to blame.  Rather than spending more time with simulated pregnancies, women in that era spent more time being actually pregnant, but the effects are similar.</p></div>		</li>
