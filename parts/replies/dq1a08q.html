<p>As for the Great lakes they were blocks of ice first and fresh water fish populated it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the Wisconsinian deglaciation, the Champlain sea reached out all the way into the Ottawa valley. Fossil skeletons of several species of seals were found in the Ottawa area (see: <a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/gpq/1988-v42-n1-gpq1927/032708ar.pdf" target="_blank">Harington, C., &amp; Occhietti, S. (1988). Inventaire systématique et paléoécologie des mammifères marins de la Mer de Champlain (fin du Wisconsinien) et de ses voies d’accès. Géographie physique et Quaternaire, 42(1), 45-64.</a>). These guys were right within reach of lake Ontario (which was liquid during deglaciation, btw) ... way closer than Baikal to either the Pacific or the PaleoTethys. </p>
<p>So ... as far as I can tell ... everything was in place for a population of seals to establish itself in the great lakes at that point. Yet it did not happen. And on the other hand, I've got Baikal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely it is. An example could be a regional landform that creates strong in-lake currents at one of the lake's feeder rivers; those currents could keep the ice thin enough while being close enough to regional fish populations so a seal can both breathe and hunt through the winter.</p>
<p>Baikal has a reliable oily fish population, and that's a huge source of energy to keep a seal warm enough to survive. That could also have factored into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My laymen guess, lake baikal is massive compared to the great lakes, containing more fresh water than all of them combined. Add to the fact that the Laurentine escarpment is a natural barrier most prominently seen in Niagara falls </p>
<p>That would leave only Lake Ontario available for seals to stay behind after the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. Generally lake Ontario has a pretty low carrying capacity and likely couldn't maintain the minimum population of seals. Plus it would be pretty easy for them to leave as the glacial lake receded with the worst impediment being the rapids around Montreal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be bigger, but the great lakes still contain absolutely massive amounts of fish, and is thousands of square miles in surface area</p></div>		</li>
