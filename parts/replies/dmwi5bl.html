<p>Technically, no, but I can't see any situation in which Canada stops supplying the US with oil, and between Canada and the US itself, that's about 70% of US oil supplies. Cut off 30% of America's oil and it would dump shitloads of resources into expanding oil production in both the US and Canada, as well as push extra hard on renewables. Short term pain that in the end would probably only make the US <em>stronger</em>.</p></div>		</li>
