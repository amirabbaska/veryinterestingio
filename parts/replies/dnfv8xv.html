<p>I know sometimes when I have my phone I'll sit for 20 min or more. If I don't, it's usually less than 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add something for people who are sitting on their toilets for so long that their legs get numb (yâ€™know playing on your phone while you shit) .  </p>
<p>The shape of the toilet seat is meant to facilitate shitting by spreading your cheeks apart and putting a lot of pressure on your anal region.  This increased pressure can lead to hemorrhoids (actually an increase in hemorrhoid size, since everyone has hemorrhoids). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, hemorrhoids are just vascular cushions in your rectum that helps with holding in your shit.  There's normally 3 cushions -- left lateral, right anterior and right posterior.  </p>
<p>When you start to mess with them by doing things like straining, irritating them with rock-hard shit, etc.  It can make them grow and it can make them less-firm which can eventually lead to them prolapsing, bleeding etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing that's better is a fully adjustable hospital bed, in my experience. Put your butt as close to the end of the first side rail as possible, put the knees/ feet of the bed up until your knee is flexed, THEN raise the head of the bed up between 30 and 45 degrees (whatever is most comfortable). This allows the weight to be taken off the sacrum/ coccyx. If you don't have a hospital bed, try mimicking this with cushions, but I imagine it would work best on a couch or something where you already have a jump-start on the head being raised. If you can't do this or are not comfortable, try a comfortable side-lying position and have someone help you tuck a pillow under one half of your body to lift it and cushion it. Change sides every 2-4 hours </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High quality gel support cushion. Roho makes some of the best.  You can get them to fit any size chair/ wheel chair.  They're also full size gel overlays for mattresses as well as alternating pressure overlays that can be placed on mattresses to relieve pressure. </p>
<p>The alternating pressure overlays we use in hospice are so good that people do not have to be repositioned.</p></div>		</li>
