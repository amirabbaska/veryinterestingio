<p>However, even with the best possible telescope you wouldn't see much of Earth itself; so few photons make the trip that it's not enough for any useful image. You almost certainly wouldn't be able to see things like (say) your house.</p>
<p>If you think of standing in a regular mirror and looking at an object next to you through the mirror, its apparent size is as if you were looking at it a distance of twice as far as the distance between it and the mirror. That is if you're standing 10 meters away from a mirror and hold up a tennis ball, looking at the tennis ball in the mirror is like looking at a tennis ball that's 20 meters away. In the same way, the Earth would be virtually impossible to see; it's as if it were 8.7 ly away. Even a planet-sized mirror probably wouldn't be directly observable (though we could infer its position from things like change in light of the star as Earth Two passed in front of it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we do the same thing with reflectors on the moon to measure the distance from here to there.  It would be very difficult to do at the distance of AC though, without a huge perfect mirror and an extremely powerful laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing interesting to note is that due to the uncertainty principle, it's impossible to create a perfect laser. So you're still going to get an unavoidable, minimum amount of spread on your laser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most interesting part would be that if you were able to create an &quot;exact time&quot; agreement between the two (presumed) civilizations, a sort of intergalactic zulu time, if you will, and agreed with a friend on the other end to place the telescope and the mirror down at the same time, you would be able to look through the telescope and see your world reflected <em>before the telescope was placed.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you would surely still have to wait 4 years after placing the telescope for the first bit of light to get from the mirror to the telescope. Meaning you can only go back 4 years instead of 8 without moving it further away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd still be seeing events of 8.7 years ago.  Light has to travel from here to there and back again.  That takes  8.7 years however you arrange it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't see anything. Let's make a quick calculation:</p>
<p>Sunlight hits the Earth at the power of 1000/m^2 . Let's assume all this power gets reflected back into space (which it doesn't). Now we install a 10x10m mirror at the Alpha Centauri. This is a 100m^2 mirror that is 4x10^16 m away. The light from the Earth gets reflected evenly on entire hemisphere of a radius 4x10^16 m and area 10^34 m^2 . That means that a 100m^2 mirror will get a one 10^32 -th of all the light that comes from the earth. If we assume a blue or green photon with the energy of 4x10^-16 J, we can calculate, that the mirror would only get 10^-13 photons from each square meter of Earth per second.</p>
<p>In other words: If all the light that hits the USA got reflected into space, the 100m^2 mirror at Alpha Centauri would only get 1 photon of this light each second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mirrors have a resolution limit, so you'd never really be able to build a big enough mirror to really see anything in the past, but as the commenter pointed out below, the light that did bounce back would be 8.7 years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There's a fundamental quantum limit to how precisely you can see something, depending on its size, its distance, and the frequency of light you're looking at. No matter how smooth your mirror, it <em>has</em> to be big in order to get good resolution.</p>
<p>That said, you don't actually have to use a single giant mirror. Several smaller mirrors, placed far apart from each other and aimed at the same target, can also overcome this problem. You don't collect as much light as with a single big mirror (and thus you see a 'noisier' image), but you can still get good resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wavelength of light you're trying to reflect and the size of your mirror. Although manufacturing imperfections will make an image unfocused, there's a fundamental limit to how focussed something can be - look at pictures on the wikipedia article on Gaussian Beams.</p></div>		</li>
