			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m a fan of a sinus rinse/Neti pot when I have a cold - it was literally life changing. When I have a cold, my biggest issue is usually falling asleep, so I use that and get 10 beautiful, glorious minutes of being able to breathe. I hop immediately into bed and try to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned recently: if you have a stuffy nose/sinuses, instead of wiping Vicks vapor rub all over your chest (I hate the feelings especially if im sick and trying to get comfy) you can put a good amount on the bottoms of your feet, and then put on socks. Your body soaks it up and it actually clears your chest/sinus cavities out! I didn't believe it at first but I tried it and to my surprise, it worked!</p></div>		</li>
