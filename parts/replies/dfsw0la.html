			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm at the point where I have to verbally tell myself &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;. I often get stuck and start spiraling. If I am able to catch it and switch to a good memory then it helps ease the self hate. It's difficult to be kind to other people when you're not kind to yourself. Most people are also stuck on the terrible/embarrassing memories of themselves that they aren't concerned with what you did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me that usually makes it worse because now I'm focusing on not focusing on it, and constantly remember what I'm trying not to focus on. It's like trying not to yawn or breathe manually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and that's where I can occasionally feel &quot;stuck&quot;. I will say that I'm also always listening to music and if I get stuck in a thought loop I will do the verbal portion and change the song. Furthermore it has helped a lot that I've continued to set boundaries in my life from people that do not better me or try to take from me. I'm currently on a kick of acquiring as many hobbies as I can possibly afford. It's given me a sense of purpose that I can create art, dance, make pottery etc. It's a good feeling I can exude this sense of goodness and light in the world. I'm not taking away from anyone I'm just creating joy for myself and encouraging others to find theirs. I'm not my mistakes. I'm constantly growing and changing. You have to remember that who you were just six months ago may not be who you are now. &amp; overall what works for some people may not work for others and that's okay. The only difference between the master and the apprentice is that the master has failed more times than the apprentice has tried. Keep at it. You deserve peace. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alot of people will say &quot;acceptance&quot; and be done with it, others will let it build up or weigh them down over time. Even if a memory or event leaves you feeling negative. You'll always find something good in the world to bring you back to what's important. Your happiness. If you can't find it then make your own happiness. Whether that's helping others, creating, or living to the fullest. Those moments in life you're happiest, are the times you overcome the negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it was forgiving / accepting it for myself.</p>
<p>I went through a long time where I couldn't sleep and these things would haunt me at night. One day I realized that I'm the only one holding on to them and have to forgive my past self for my mistakes, realize the world doesn't hold them against me and that I won't repeat them.</p>
<p>Suddenly they were gone. Now when they creep back up, I can just deflect them very easily, somehow instead of getting wrapped up in them my mind feels this bored, disinterested state and just changes topics.</p>
<p>Was like a switch flipped. Idk. </p></div>		</li>
