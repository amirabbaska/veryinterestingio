			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 - When we throw our toys in the toy box, we're able to get them out again and play with them later. A firetruck is still a firetruck and your legos will still be there after dinner. But if you throw your toys in the black box you won't get them back out the same way. Your firetruck could come out like a toaster and your legos like a bowl of green macaroni! </p>
<p>Now when we throw our firetrucks into the black toy box, a little firetruck sticker shows up on the side of the box. &quot;Thanks for the firetruck!&quot; the black toy box says. &quot;Thanks for the legos!&quot; Even if we pull out a bowl of green macaroni, we can still remember when we had a firetruck by the sticker.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>like you said its just that, a theory, for now at least, which in small talk means it still has to be proved but i'm guessing you knew that. </p>
<p>I said something in this space but after thinking and re listening to the new theory i was wrong in my thinking and now i changed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well nothing is &quot;just a theory&quot; in science. This is going to stay a theory for a very long time even if it becomes the new standard model. Gravity is a theory, but I don't think you'd put a &quot;just&quot; in front of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The future state (wavefunction) of any quantum system is uniquely predictable from its current state, and so is its past (which you could recover even if you didn't observe it). It is in this sense that &quot;information is conserved&quot;. But</p>
<ol>
<li>Classically a black hole almost doesn't change at all in response to infalling matter (only outwardly observable changes are in angular momentum, energy, and charge and the resulting changes in geometry). Nothing else about the black hole changes, even subtly, based on the nature of what fell in.</li>
<li>Hawking's early calculation of black hole evaporation suggested that the released radiation was exactly thermal, i.e. literally random and totally unconnected to earlier information about how the black hole was formed.</li>
</ol>
<p>So if you fire a particle with some detailed quantum state into the black hole, what happens? Are the subtle differences in the quantum state reflected in subtle differences in the outgoing radiation later? How can this be, when the matter falls inward and the radiation is emitted much later from the surface? Where is this (apparent?) non-locality coming from? Or are the semiclassical calculations totally correct, and a fundamental tenet of QM really <em>does</em> need to be overthrown in quantum gravity, where information is lost after all? That's the 'paradox' in a nutshell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean by &quot;uniquely predictable&quot;?  I was under the impression that most interpretations of QM are truly random or indistinguishable from truly random.  Do you mean that they follow a strict probabilistic distribution or that you can actually know which side of the sheet a photon will end up in the single slit experiment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait wait wait... You're claiming that you can determine the future wavefunction of a system based on its current wavefunction? That is completely against the Copenhagen interpretation isn't it? Quantum states are supposed to be probabilistic, not deterministic.</p>
<p>This is entirely the opposite of everything I've learned in my undergrad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That the state of particles that get eaten also gets eaten by the black hole. The solution is simple. The black hole pukes up the state and some particles. But because it's vomit, it's all mixed up and you can't tell the ups from the downs. </p></div>		</li>
