			<div class="markdown"><p>I think cutting art funds would affect a large portion of students, but not all. Many students  (like myself) have a hard time socializing and interacting with the general public, and find it difficult  to effectively communicate their thoughts to the world in a way that will be effectively received and genuinely noted. I believe art is a medium in which children (and everyone!) can begin to learn how to show the world what they think in the way that THEY want to show it. The beautiful thing about art is there is no &quot;wrong&quot; move. It's just art.
To answer your question directly: yes.
I would feel isolated if I didn't learn how to sing and write music in school, and I know I'm not alone.
But that's just my perception</p></div>		</li>
