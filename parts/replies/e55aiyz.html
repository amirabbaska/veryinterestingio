			<div class="markdown"><p>If the batteries drained completely there is concern they will not be able to hold enough charge to continue any meaningful operation.  The reason to be hopeful however is that it likely wasn't cold enough for the battery heaters to turn on (the batteries need to be above a certain temperature to function properly) which would reduce battery drain for this long period of inactivity.</p>
<p>If it survived the upcoming test will be the martian winter where those heaters will be depleting the batteries frequently.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. The batteries don't have a temp limit to function (I mean they do but it's far below freezing). They do have a temp limit for charging though because you can't charge lithium batteries that are below freezing. The battery heaters shut off months ago when it went into sleep mode. In fact they shut off before a whole bunch of other systems did. Right now we are basically waiting for enough solar energy to get the batteries above freezing and the start charging them. As they charge up the computer will wake up and start figuring out a basic time from the day night cycle (since it's very likely the system clock died) and will start taking care of itself again by running heaters and checking systems. Then it will start listening / reaching out to communicate with us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda weird but I have an emotional attachment to those two rovers. I was like six when I watched their launches, and then their landings, and that was so cool! The fact that Opportunity is still running after over 14 years now is astonishing and makes me irrationally proud.</p></div>		</li>
