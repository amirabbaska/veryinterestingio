			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried it with a sugar cube and nothing happened. The glue was the goopy kind, thoughâ€”could this have been an issue? The label said it contained ethyl cyanoacrylate and hydroquinone, if that helps at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something also to be aware of (and concerned about!) is that the initial vapor or &quot;smoke&quot; seen coming off the reaction isn't actually smoke from smoldering cotton - it's volatizing cyanoacrylate. It is quite poisonous! Obviously with enough of the stuff, the heat can get high enough to cause combustion, but even if it doesn't do that it can generate some seriously toxic fumes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source? CA isn't terribly toxic but are the fumes worse due to the physical effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like every time I deal with the low viscosity CA for balsa wood it evaporates condenses and then solidifies.  If this is actually what is happening I could see it being really bad for lungs.  Also they sell this accelerator fluid that makes it react the same way as cotton which always seems to exacerbate the evaporation and deposition.  I use the stuff in very well ventilated environments...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally, the fumes are just an irritant, but some people will eventually develop a reaction to them. If you're just using it to fix the occasional thing around the house, go nuts, but if you're using it regularly<em>(It makes a great wood finish)</em>, get a respirator with an organic filter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When CA heats up, it isn't just pure CA that comes off of it. It begins undergoing thermal decomposition, and it starts releasing Hydrogen Cyanide at about half the temperature that your cotton will ignite. There was an article in the journal Forensic Science International in October 2011. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737219" target="_blank">full citation is available from NIH.</a></p></div>		</li>
