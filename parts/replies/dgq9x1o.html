			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get this all the time as a kid when I had a fever. The room would grow and shrink around me, and I would feel like I was holding something in my hand that was simultaneously enormous and smooth and tiny and sharp.</p>
<p>I'm 30 now and I still get this sometimes, even though I'm in reasonably good health.  My depth perception gets all funky (like things will start close to me and slowly drift away while my body feels like it's stretching and shrinking) and my hands clam up and feel tiny.  The weirdest part is I'll feel like I have a rock in my mouth which is simultaneously too big to possibly fit and almost too small to even perceive. There aren't really words for it, but it's pretty freaky.</p>
<p>Maybe I should say something to my doctor...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's really weird!  For me, it's more like I'm hypersensitive rubber.  </p>
<p>The size perception is definitely the strangest.  One second, you're so big you can barely fit in the room and the next it feels like the room stretches forever and you're just a tiny speck... and sometimes you feel both at the same time??!  Wtf, brain!</p></div>		</li>

<p>so I'm assuming an MRI.</p>

<p>That is unlikely. MRI's do not detect blow flow, only blood vessels. MRA's and fMRI's use mostly machinery but also do things like add contrast to your blood then take timed photos to see how it moves. Generally speaking that is difficult to do because of the blood brain barrier and because of the rapid circulation of through the brain, but a contrast that relies on the oxidation level of your blood was discovered, allowing for fMRI images. And fMRI and a regular MRI are not really the same thing though, just because they both use magnets to produce the image. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems to happen to children randomly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a fair amount of anecdotal evidence that it is hereditary, but no one seems to have done a study to confirm or refute this.</p>
<p>I think it hasn't been studied very much because it is (a) rare and (b) not dangerous or debilitating, at least by itself.</p></div>		</li>
