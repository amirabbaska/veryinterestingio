			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the person you responded to. The tides would still exist even if the moon was not orbiting earth, provided that the moon was still nearby of course. No one mentioned the earth spinning because that's not relevant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the case of a non rotating frame of reference, the double tide can be explained by a different fictitious force: the d'Alembert force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun creates it's own set of tides on Earth for the same reasons. </p>
<p>Since the Sun is a lot further away than the Moon the effect is much smaller, and so is mostly just perceived as larger or smaller tides depending on whether the two tides are in or out of phase with each other. </p>
<p>The Earth also causes tides on the Sun. Right now they're minor, but once the Sun grows to be a red giant at the end of its life, it's predicted this tide will be what pulls the Earth into the Sun, utterly destroying all evidence humanity ever existed if we don't become interplanetary before then. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We already have space probes on mars and at least one gas-giant's moon. Unless they're hit by an asteroid, won't they be evidence we existed? And the voyager and pioneer deep space probes, what about those?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this calculation once. The tides on Earth are about 1/3rd due to the sun. So smaller, but not by a lot.</p></div>		</li>
