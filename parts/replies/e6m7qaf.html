			<div class="markdown"><p>They're still basically dormant.  Trees are &quot;cold blooded&quot; too and their internal chemistry slows as the temperature falls.</p>
<p>They retain the needles year-to-year so they can re-start growth  immediately when the snow melts instead of waiting for leaves to develop, but the needles are much less efficient.</p>
<p>It's an adaptation to excel in places with short summers and frequent spring and fall freezing that would damage leaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so interesting, thank you! </p>
<p>Having grown up where it hardly ever snows, I never thought that freezing makes it difficult for an evergreen tree to have leaves year round. I have wondered before why “evergreen” almost always means a tree with needles, but I never asked anyone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Greenness has little to do with it. It has more to do with water availability. The rings are made from xylem (basically water chutes that run up and down the stem from the leaves to the roots), which retain their size after growing. The diameter of each chute is dependent on how much water there was when the plant needed that extra chute - more water means a wider chute.</p>
<p>A tree trunk is basically a bundle of drinking straws where the straws get thinner and thinner throughout the year as water becomes less available. It can go from &quot;McDonald's straw&quot; thick to &quot;Coffee stirrer at the bank&quot; thin over time as the tree grows. The darkest part of the ring is just a bunch of &quot;coffee stirrer&quot; xylem clumped together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your tree physiology is correct but water availability is not the deciding factor. If it were, the dormant cycle in the PNW would be the summer, because there is less water available compared to the perpetual rain of the winter. Sun and day length defines the rings. The thickness is defined by water availability during the growing season, to be more precise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, if you've ever seen the ground beneath a magnolia or, you know, pine straw, you'd realize they just don't dump all at once seasonally and that's why they're called that - they're always green, not that their leaves don't drop ever. Gradual shedding!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, not answering the question but I think this is pretty neat.</p>
<p>It's possible to track down a piece of timber to the specific time and place it was cut down. The species of wood is determined, which narrows down a location. The rings indicate environmental activity over time, which can be traced through recorded history on the outer rings. For example, there was a forest fire near this specific tree and one side of it is slightly scorched, then a couple of rings later it was cut down. We can use that information and stuff such as longer winters or summers to give us a ballpark guess of when it cut down. </p>
<p>This was used in figuring out a sunken ship in (I think) the English Channel. It was originally thought to be English in origin due to location, but the wood was native to somewhere in continental Europe or Scandinavia, and the dates matched such that it was traced back to 3 possible (I think Danish) war ships sunk in the area. They were later able to refine this down using more information and found which ship they were looking at.</p>
<p>Source: Attended a talk last year on tracing timber to regions and time periods. Am no expert, but had a read on it afterwards. Pretty cool stuff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have carbon dating to that cycle. A tree grows for 50 years. Is cut down then built into a house for 100 years. Then the house burns. Carbon date it and you'll get the age of the actually tree. </p>
<p>Come to think of it. Is that age you find in carbon dating the time the tree started first growing or the time the tree was cut down? Hmmmm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not an expert, but it should be the date the tree died, because that’s when it stopped pulling carbon from the atmosphere and what it had continued to decay without being refreshed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMHO carbon dating doesn't have a comparable accuracy - ring analysis can give you the exact year when that tree was cut down, carbon dating would have a much larger band of uncertainty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd guess it's the whole range.  Carbon in each ring should be dateable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who studies dendrochronology, lots of trees can have false, missing, or double rings. To the naked eye they can be hard to tell, but under the dissecting scope you can see the differences in the wood anatomy that can tell you if its a true ring or not. This can be pretty easy in ring porous species like oak and ash, but a total bitch is species like maple. In places that can get late spring frosts and/or flooding, false rings can be a real problem that makes counting and measuring rings a much more tedious job. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I've seen. There is so many factors contributing to competition in a forest that trees are just trying to reach any kind of light they can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really in the trunk itself. If you planted a tree completely alone, without the competition of other trees, and then gave it a HEAVY direction bias on its light source, you might be able to see reaction/tension wood form over the years. </p>
<p>Otherwise you might be able to deduce something like that from branch retention (but limb formation at the meristem is largely genetically based and you'd really only see this if the tree is prone to branch die off, and, again, if it's grown under an extreme directional bias)</p></div>		</li>
