			<div class="markdown"><p>This was pretty much my experience. I was still &quot;sad&quot; but motivated. I was suddenly eating right, I was exercising, I was doing well in school and my life felt like it was finally starting to come together, so naturally, I tried to kill myself. I don't know if it'll make sense to anyone who hasn't gone through it but I literally felt like I didn't have any energy to kill myself before and I didn't want to leave my life on a bad note. I think part of me was also scared of getting better. I'd been depressed for so long and through all of my teenage years that I didn't know who I was without depression. I'd never seen that side of me and I think it was too much to handle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mentioning that you weren't sure who you are without depression really resonated with me.</p>
<p>I've never had a &quot;safety net&quot; growing up, and that hard/cold truth became a harsh reality after failing/falling a few times than I'd like to admit. Depression has now become my safety net. It's why people help me out when I'm truly in need, especially when they see me attempting to fly then soar to the ground like a stone. Now I feel that this coping mechanism has now cursed me from ever breaking free of the depression at all. If I become successful, I'm now self-reliant, and responsibly taking care of myself. One this is the norm, no one will have a watchful eye out for me. Now if something happens, I'll melt my wax wings when I'm inches from the Sun, shoot to the Earth harder and faster than ever before, and I'll smash into the ground with momentum I've never had the displeasure of witnessing. The worst part? No one to intervene &quot;Oh Dusty has been fine for a couple years! He's got it together. He's just having a bit of a hiccup right now.&quot;. I'd have to go through the painstaking process of getting Dr's to truly listen and trust that I know myself well enough to say what I think is going on. I'd have to lie and make up excuses to everyone that didn't know I had depression. Make up excuses for all the general symptoms and the  quirky ones that actually don't help in proving my case of having major depression.</p>
<p>I'm stuck.</p>
<p>I'm ranting.</p>
<p>I also hate having to self medicate. It's just as much of a gamble as mental, pharmaceutical meds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was very poetic and honest; thank you. </p>
<p>Also resonates with a heavy dose of anxiety, it seems. One possible idea is forming a long term relationship with a therapist... someone more likely to trust your instincts, still be there if you have a relapse, and can help you parse out the fear that's prevents the progress. </p>
<p>Truly, best of luck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man sorry you're going through a very dark time. I hope that you can pull yourself out of this. Don't be ashamed to need meds! Anything that can help you out of this is at least worth a shot. If you need someone impartial to rant to feel free to PM me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most common theory. Another theory is that people who have suicidal thoughts triggered by antidepressants actually have a form of bipolar disorder and they are being switched into a phase of mixed mania and depression. This would explain why it is younger people who are more likely to have suicidal thoughts triggered by antidepressants. (I.e. young people coming for treatment with a first depression are less likely to have already been correctly diagnosed with bipolar disorder than older people). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what happened to me. I never actually went through with trying because I was just plain scared, but my ideations were at a peak when I was on antidepressants because they were the worst thing I could've been taking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, everyone who I have seen who has had antidepressant induced suicidality has turned out to have bipolar disorder and improves with mood stabilisers like lamotrigine or quetiapine. </p></div>		</li>
