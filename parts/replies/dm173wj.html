			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any references on hand, but you can use Hartree-Fock and various interactions optimized for slightly lighter nuclei to predict ground state binding energies of unknown nuclei. These calculations generally do a decent job.</p>
<p>You can apply structure models to try to come up with level schemes for these nuclei which can in principle be probed through alpha decay spectroscopy. Using models for alpha decay and spontaneous fission you can try to predict the lifetimes of these nuclei, but they vary over orders of magnitude, because these decays involve quantum tunneling. The probability of tunneling is exponentially sensitive to the height and width of the potential barrier.</p>
<p>Certain calculations would be more expected to be correct than others, but the only way to really know the properties of these nuclei is to measure them.</p></div>		</li>
