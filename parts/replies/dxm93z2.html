			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'll accept that microwaves are non-ionizing radiation, there are known hazards from exposure to microwaves that suggest they do have an effect on living things, including possible modification of organic compounds. As an example, one of the hazards from an improperly shielded microwave oven is an increased risk of eye cataracts, hence the caution that you shouldn't peer through the metal screen to watch your food heat for extended periods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwave radiation is potentially damaging, yes, to anything that contains water, in exactly the same way a fire is. </p>
<p>It heats stuff up, and pretty selectively does so by absorption of energy by water. However, it doesn't cook things from the inside, as &quot;common knowledge&quot; goes; all the energy gets soaked up by the water in the first few layers it touches. This can lead to burns on the skin if you get hit with a strong enough beam, since it basically boils the water, and similarly, getting microwaves directly in the eye will heat the water in the top layer significantly too. The proteins in the retina then basically get cooked, not unlike those in an egg white, and since your retina doesn't contain blood vessels, its difficult to repair that damage, leading to cataracts in the same way standing in front of a furnace can. UV light causes ionizing damage that attacks retinas chemically, but microwaves just cook them, and that metal screen perfectly shield you; if it didn't, you'd feel your face warm up significantly, since that's what microwaves are designed to do.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, one bloke (a harvard physicist) floated the concept of microwave heating in homes back in the 80s, but the idea of &quot;Microwave radiation heating&quot; wasn't exactly palatable during the cold war, and the invention of Wifi eventually put paid to that idea, since it's ubiquitous and operates on the same frequency but with much lower power. The whole concept of microwave radiation is exactly what kicked up the scary stink in the first place, since people don't like anything with that word in it, which is kinda funny, since the most dangerous thing in your house in that regard is specifically designed to keep you alive; the radioactive americium inside your smoke detector.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/info_microwaves/en/" target="_blank">WHO document</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave#Effects_on_health" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> both go into pretty extensive detail on the subject of microwaves and health and safety, but basically it boils down to, don't mess with the metal containment, which acts like a mirror to them, and they're no more dangerous than any other heating method. Far safer, actually, since they can't directly start a fire; They need a highly polar molecule for any heating to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I recall hearing about ultra efficient clothing dryers based on microwave heating in the 1990's that would cut the energy dryers used by 70%. Supposedly they were just around the corner. Whatever happened to those devices?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, indirectly. Free radicals are actually very common in biological reactions - your body generates superoxide as a way to defend against bacteria, and also at lower levels accidentally, as a byproduct of normal metabolism (all organisms that breath oxygen also have this problem). So there are free radicals in your body right now, even though you are not currently exposed to ionizing radiation. </p>
<p>Wikipedia lists all of these as possible ways of producing free radicals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>redox reactions, ionizing radiation, heat, electrical discharges, and electrolysis</p>
