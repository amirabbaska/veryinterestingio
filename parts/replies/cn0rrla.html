			<p>It also depends where you live. I'm in a major city. I'd need between 100-200k down payment for a place if it was in a safe neighborhood.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm within commuting distance of a major city and I own acreage and a decent sized house. I put 35% down and it was half of what you're talking about. </p>		</li>

			<p>Less than an hour from Austin. People say the cost of living here is cheap, but rent has gone up exponentially in the last 3 years. I have friends paying $1800+ a month for apartments in the city, and we don't have nearly the wages that other cities do to support that. It is very expensive here. </p>		</li>
