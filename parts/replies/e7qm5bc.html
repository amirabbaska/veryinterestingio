A cold water survival expert did an AMA not long ago really good read, lots of extra info and advice if you find yourself in cold water accidentally or on purpose.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your blood vessels automatically constrict in the cold in order to protect your brain and organs from a rush of cold blood coming to them to cool them down. The downside to this is your body immediately gives you the feeling like you can't breathe.</p>
<p>Why doesn't our body know that when the cold shock is due to water, the response is more likely to kill us than save us? Well simply because our bodies aren't clever enough to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it was probably not a big enough concern for our ancestors so that this never got corrected in evolution. Maybe some Inuit or people who historically lived in a colder climate dont have this cold shock response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't give a shit about productive. If it wasn't detrimental enough to clean out populations with that gene then it stays with you. To be honest this one happens to be very useful though, homeostasis is extremely important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gave a response to the <em>why</em> below. </p>
<p>People are all describing what happens, but you know that already.</p>
<p>Very few people are addressing why, especially in regards to the even though part of your question.</p>
<p>Evolution is not exact. Nor is it complete. We are a single point in time in the long-term, infinite timespan of our evolution.</p>
<p>This is one of things that just hasn't been corrected by evolution.</p>
<p>Evolutionary, having your muscles constrict when you're cold prevents more deaths than not. Or, maybe, the difference in mortality isn't enough to select against one or the other.</p>
<p>Remember, this isn't intelligent design. This is random iteration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I would dare say that those that were dropped into the water would have drowned very quickly.</p>
<p>There's a good reason that helicopter passengers/crew in cold climate dress in dry suits equipped with rebreathers.  The rebreather holds a lungful of air, ready for when that shock moment passes and you need to take that breath while still not quite functional.  I know this because I have undergone training in this kit for offshore work.</p></div>		</li>
