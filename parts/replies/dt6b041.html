			<div class="markdown"><p>Like how a wave in the ocean propagates, the individual water molecules aren't traveling as a wave, they're <em>bumped into</em> by the one behind them, transferring the energy into the one in front of them, and so on and so on. The individual molecules only move slightly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better analogy would be water in a pipe.  When you force water into one end, different water immediately comes out the other end, even if it takes a while for the water you just added to make it to the end.</p>
<p>Once you start talking about waves in either water or electricity, things get rather more complicated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure this analogy is difficult to understand. Most people can imagine a wave in water, and see how it crashes into the beach. It's the same concept as in your analogy of water column.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a drift velocity that electrons get under DC load, which is very slow.  Under AC they jiggle back and forth a bit.  Random diffusion would vastly overshadow both for an individual particle, but there is a velocity.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>~Well... it depends on the actual numbers involved, but for a 12 gauge wire with 10 amps the drift velocity is over 180 mph.  Slow compared to light, but not very slow compared to us.</del>~</p>
<p>Got my units wrong!  Should have said .0005 mph.  Significant difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have what is called a drift velocity which is very slow in copper. When you flip a switch and a light comes on it is the field that has traveled to carry the energy to the light not the individual electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A capacitor is not necessarily charged by absorbing electrons. It is not like filling a tank with gasoline until it is full.</p>
<p>The voltage, when applied to a capacitor, polarizes its internal materials, thus creating a chemical imbalance of positive ions and negative ions. This disassociation of matter into ions stores energy. Once you reconnect the capacitor into the electric circuit, the capacitor gets rid of the additional energy and electrical balance inside the capacitor is restored.</p></div>		</li>
