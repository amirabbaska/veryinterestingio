<p>I have read lots of resumes (less these days). FQ34 is right.</p>
<p>The point of the resume is to get you the interview. The person reading it probably doesn't know that much about the open job, is just looking for buzzwords, spelling, and overall appearance.</p>
<p>I work with a lot of vets (my company does direct recruiting) and they are almost all doing very well. I have coworkers from interrogators to airplane crew chiefs. </p>
<p>I work for a Fortune 500 IT company. Other ones also are directly going after vets, as they tend to do well in the work. </p></div>		</li>

Would it be possible to hand vets. a resume based on their history in the military ? Like &quot;here, this is what we can vouch for, edit as you see fit.&quot; I'm not from the US, not a programmer and a civilian so I may be painfully na√Øve, but it seems like something that could be achieved with a simple program and one's record ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do teach it, kind of, but honestly the classes they make you go to when you're getting out are painfully boring and most everyone is thinking more about their upcoming freedom than listening to the guy telling you how to write a resume.</p>
<p>As far as what you're asking, I guess it's possible but you'll have to populate all your experience into anyway so I don't think anybody would develop that.  You can easily pull awards and whatnot from other e-documents but you don't get awards for not breaking your truck and shit like that.</p>
<p>They could probably develop generic resumes based on rank fairly easily though I'm sure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be worried the recruiters would start to see too many identical resumes.</p>
<p>No, the education has to come on the Private Sector side, I think. Large companies that do a lot of recruiting should learn specific things to look for, in military terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the paper advice. We worried about &quot;the right paper&quot; for a resume when I was graduating college. Once out in &quot;the real world&quot;, I realized that the type of paper you're printing on doesn't matter to anyone who's making a decision. </p>
<p>Another thing to realize, the &quot;supervisor&quot; or &quot;manager&quot; who's supposedly hiring you, is often one level below the person who's ACTUALLY hiring you. Using military ranks....if you're applying for a job with a Captain...it's quite likely that its his Major who's actually making the final go/no go decision on your hiring. </p></div>		</li>
