			<div class="markdown"><p>The unique sensation from carbonated beverages has very little, if anything, to do with pH. Protons activate the TRPV1 receptor (the same receptor that capsaicin activates) while CO2, mustard, wasabi, pepper, radishes, etc all activate TRPA1. </p>
<p>Gatorade is as or more acidic than soda water (pH 2.9-3.3) but it doesn’t burn like soda water does. Both are sour, which is a result of acidity. But only one of the two really burns when you drink it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably right. I'm the head cellarman at a large brewery. pH drops once a beer is carbonated due to the carbonic acid. But it's negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I don't think they are correct. Coca-Cola has phosphoric acid in it. It is more acidic when it is flat. Adding CO2 actually increases the pH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The acid in the soda isn't what causes the burn. Saliva has an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase which converts H2O from the saliva and CO2 from the soda into H2CO3, which is carbonic acid. You're not drinking acid, you're making it yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really doubt that it's the acidity. I'm no expert in this, but AFAIK, acid's effect on our mouths is that we taste sourness. Fanta is more sour than cola, but Fanta doesn't &quot;hurt&quot; more than cola does. To further contrast this, there's also sparkling water, which does not taste anything else than just water but a little prickly.</p>
<p>The actual pain you could feel from (long exposure to) acidity is relatively worse but not immediate. Try eating plenty of pineapple slices - maybe even a whole pineapple. It tastes nice for a while but then your mouth would start to hurt and the pain will last for a whole day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found an article about exactly this while looking up what kind of gas was actually in 'nitro' drinks (I was thinking it might be nitrogen or nitrogen-dioxide).</p>
<p>Turns out Nitrogen is specifically used because it doesn't have the acidic taste, which isn't fitting for beers and coffee.</p>
<p>Acidity is caused by molecules that are very likely to 'lose' a hydrogen-atom. The positively charged H+ atom bonds with H2O (water) to form H3O+, this a very basic explanation of acidity.</p></div>		</li>
