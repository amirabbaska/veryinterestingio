			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction. While it is coloquially called that, bad and good cholesterol aren't actually cholesterol - they are its transporters, ldl and hdl, respectively. Cholesterol on its own is a substrate for steroid hormones. </p>
<p>Cholesterol is a chain of 5 different carbon rings, which all they do is they get made into sex, glico and mineralosteroids.</p>
<p>Hdl (smallest, most dense) lipid carrier takes fat feom arouns the body to the liver.</p>
<p>Ldl and vldl (biggest, least dense) lipid carriers take fat around, increasing risk of fatty buildup in the blood vessels, among others.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cholesterol drives around your body in cars. Some of the cars are really small and drive around your body really well. These are the good cholesterol. </p>
<p>Some of the cars are really big and sometimes crash and pile up on your body's streets, or arteries. This makes traffic in your body really slow which causes other problems. This is the bad cholesterol. </p>
<p>Remember, it's not the cholesterol that is bad or good, its what they use to get around your body. The cars. </p>
<p>edit: I'm just reinterpreting what the smart person up there said. I can't really elaborate. </p>
<p>Edit: gilded for piggybacking the work of others?? Only in America! Thank you kind stranger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he's saying is that when people say &quot;high cholesterol&quot; they're actually saying &quot;high concentration of cholesterol carriers&quot; and the &quot;LDL&quot; carrier moves things that are more dangerous to move around because they're big. Having more carriers means there are more spills, which builds up and creates blockages.</p>
<p>The good cholesterol carrier called &quot;HDL&quot; doesn't have that risk because it carries smaller things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exercise and diet will primarily boost HDL. Most of the cholesterol in our bodies is endogenously made- that is, the cholesterol is made in the body rather than sourced from our food. Most people with high cholesterol have familial or genetic causes of high cholesterol production in the liver. Statins are great drugs used to lower cholesterol levels and have shown benefit in reduced cardiovascular mortality overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While everything you said is correct, another very important function of cholesterol is that it is used to regulate cell membrane &quot;rigidness&quot;. Also, it is very energy intensive to make cholesterol (7 ATP's per molecule), so your body likes to not get rid of it when acquired from other sources, kind of like with fat.</p>
<p>Edit: Also just to clear things up, Hdl = High density lipoprotein, and the density that is high is the protein density relative to the other stuff, and that is why this is the 'good' one, even though there are defineitely situations where the other ones could be useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about not getting rid of acquired cholesterol. I believe this is a common misconception. Foods high in cholesterol are always also high in saturated fat, which when digested causes your liver to produce cholesterol. This makes it seem like you are storing the excess cholesterol and for a long time people thought this was the case but actually most of the cholesterol itself that you eat passes right through you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High LDL is not necessarily a bad thing. There's two sub-types (there's more, but we're being broad here). The large particle sized LDL that you're talking about (big and fluffy) is actually good for you. But there's also small particle sized LDL. This is the type that is associated with inflammation of the blood pathways. However, because the average blood work prescribed by doctors does not differentiate between particle size, the assumption is usually made that if you have high LDL, it's mostly associated with small particle size:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This myth that was being propagated is completely wrong. Particle size is a worthless indicator. What matters is the particle count, which increases when LDL levels rise. People with familiar hypocholesterolemia tend to have large particle sizes but can die of heart disease in their childhood if no managed properly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cool. Show us some evidence to back up that claim.</p>

<p>Which is wrong.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's because atheroslcerosis, caused by glycation of protein in the blood, is the actual cause.</p>
<p>I don't think you've got any idea what you're talking about. Probably best if you go do some research.</p></div>		</li>
