			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Snopes it is a folk etymology, but it might be a couple hundred years old. They say that in America, the spelling soph<em>omore</em> may have caught on because of the clever wordplay. It doesn't seem impossible, considering that those using the term at the time (university educated elite elites) would have had a pretty thorough knowledge of ancient Greek. </p>
<p>So it's basically a French word derived from ancient Greek used by English dons, mutated by the punning sensibilities of American students.</p></div>		</li>
