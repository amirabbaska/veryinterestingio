			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's highly dependent on mass. As a black hole gets smaller it releases exponentially more energy.</p>
<p>So a black hole the mass of our galaxy might output the total energy of a pocket calculator in a century, but a black hole with a mass of 100 tons would release the energy of a 5 kiloton nuclear bomb <em>each second</em>.</p>
<p>Edit: As spacex_fanny pointed out the number mentioned is off by 1 million, the difference between a kilogram, and a kiloton of TNT. Oops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fascinating.  So it's possible this particular &quot;death&quot; of a black hole (final stages of evaporation), might be distinguishable and might we have seen it happening somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, while small black holes are some of the most powerful objects for their mass making them very interesting for powering a starship up to a good percentage of the speed of light, releasing 5 kilotons of energy per second is very small compared to the vast distances of space. Our sun releases roughly 5 <em>quadrillion</em> kilotons of energy per second, while weighing a <em>quadrillion squared</em> times more than the black hole.</p>
<p>So our sun is a quadrillion times less powerful than a 100 ton black hole per unit of mass, but it's still a quadrillion times brighter in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do small black holes release more total energy. At first I would guess bigger release more energy because of bigger surface. Is it because the space is more curved near the horizon for smaller black holes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, no black hole that currently exists can lose net mass to Hawking radiation unless it has less mass than our Moon, and we have no reason to believe such small black holes exist. Anything more massive will gain more mass from its surroundings than it loses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Primordial black holes that formed in the earliest moments of the universe's existence could theoretically be less massive than the moon. Although as of yet we have no proof that these primordial black holes exist. But it seems like it could be possible, and might also explain some of the gravitational influence that is commonly referred to as dark matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is highly unlikely because the cosmic background radiation probably feeds more mass into the black hole than it can shed off with the Hawking radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes with a lifetime of 13 billion years are much hotter than the cosmic microwave background. They have an initial temperature of 7*10^11 K and they only get hotter over time.</p>
<p>The cosmic microwave background is hotter for stellar mass black holes, but not for black holes that might evaporate today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the size of the black hole. A small enough black hole could evaporate energy away faster than it's absorbing it from the CME. The issue is that it takes some pretty extreme circumstances to cause a black hole to form, and all of they ways that we think are possible involve huge amounts of gravity from really massive objects that crush themselves down small enough. All of the black holes from these processes would likely create black holes massiv enough that their evaporation rate would be very low. </p>
<p>But it's also possible that in the earliest moments of the universe, when all of space was filled with a ridiculously dense and hot energy soup, some quantum fluctuations happened to make areas dense enough that it's gravity could win out over the crazy fast inflation that was going on, and collapse into black holes. Theoretically, those primordial black holes could be much smaller than any solar black holes that we think are possible. Some of those could be small enough that they're emitting lots of energy, and some could have already evaporated themselves down to nothing. </p></div>		</li>
