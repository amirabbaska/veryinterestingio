			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a good way to go for subs not wanting to go dark/private. By disallowing submissions, and keeping a stickied announcement post, the subs can become effectively &quot;private read-only&quot; without disrupting what's already occurred or concealing any information about what's actively going on. I've noticed a lot of the &quot;rising&quot; posts in /r/all have people completely confused because their defaults are now private (which I personally think is the way to go for <em>some defaults</em> to make a statement) but if the more popular subs, that aren't directly tied in with the issue, decide nuke the ability to submit, it seems just as effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The subreddit is still able to be seen, browsed, and everything. But nobody aside from mods and approved submitters (a list that people must be added to <em>by</em> the mods) will be able to submit new links/selftexts. Basically it's in &quot;read only&quot; mode just like a Google Drive document.</p>
<p>So, if by your question you're thinking the point of going dark/private on defaults is to &quot;hurt&quot; Reddit's profit and traffic, yes, I suppose this would affect that. But this at least lets people who DO still come here know what is going on - which could be even more effective. Spreading information, <em>in my opinion</em> is better (in most cases) than going completely dark.</p>
<p>A good example is the SOPA/PIPA blackout - many websites participated but most had an excerpt about what was going on or linked to informative parts. The mod menu only allows 500 characters to be displayed for the sub (which is what shows up when you get the &quot;This Subreddit is private&quot; message), so that wouldn't be too informative.... unless they linked to the /r/outoftheloop post, which I suppose is effective (though a bit convoluted for people who are already confused and/or new)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is fine. It's a trade-off. By staying &quot;up&quot; but restricting submissions, you can do something like this thread by stickying a main post explaining the decision and upvoting it to the top of /r/all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm personally not a fan of that style. You're still showing a page with ads on it, thus not costing the admins anything, but you're still causing users plenty of grief. If you're going to bone everyday users in protest of admin actions, at least go all the way and make it so your sub can't show ads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this would be a more effective solution. Although complete private status of certain subs is likely to shock the admins into submission, it sort of works against the root aim of the concept in general. That concept being greater access and power not only to the mods, but users as well. By disallowing new posts you're essentially rendering a sub &quot;dead&quot;, yet allowing existing content to remain, thus proving your point and placating the people. </p></div>		</li>
