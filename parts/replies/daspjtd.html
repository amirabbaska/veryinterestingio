			<div class="markdown"><p>And to expound, once a circuit has electricity flowing through it, the electricity itself can hold together a shoddy contact point. Meaning the bang is like a jump start for the circuit which can sustain itself once current starts to flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe he just means that a current flowing through an inductor “wants” to keep flowing (it can’t change suddenly). If you cut the circuit it will arc over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that if it flows significant current the connection will poorly weld itself together, kind of like when you fuck up striking the arc with a stick welder and the stick gets stuck to the work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arc welding 101...  I dunno what the actual physics are, but I imagine it's matter of heat/gasses being created that allow an arc to self sustain.  Ozone maybe for small circuits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Aircraft technician here, There are a few computers where &quot;ground checking&quot; the part will fix it. One in particular has circuit cards that slide loose so just tapping it on the ground just right will reset the cards. You might also knock some others loose, but if you're at that point its going to get sent off for repairs anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other cases there are mechanical relay switches that can get stuck and a jiggle from a kick is enough to make them flip when the energy is almost, but not quite, enough to break the tension(and or dust/corrosion/etc).</p>
<p>Did a lot of that on some aging equipment in the Air Force.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ours was a huge wall of rack mount test equipment, the drawers with the relays was off to the side and just at the right level to flip your boot under and kick(just like toe popping a hackey sack) in the center of the bottom of the extended drawer, almost like the engineers knew</p></div>		</li>
