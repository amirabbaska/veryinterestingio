			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR&gt; Now: death, lots of death. A minor boon for future civilisations. </p>
<p>When mixing stops, bottom waters (abyssal plains and trenches) stop receiving oxygen, creating large anoxic zones. This wipes out animal life, but anoxic bacteria do fine. However, organic material is still falling down, so the ocean bottoms become seriously carbon rich, and carbon and other nutrients are captured and buried.</p>
<p>This will help reduce global atmospheric CO2 a bit, but not enough to stop global warming. It will also possibly help create new oil fields in a few million years if these sediments are capped appropriately.</p>
<p>However another result is that nutrients (nitrogen, various metals, sulphates, etc) are not recycled. Right now, almost all organic material that falls through the water column is ingested and therefore made available for other animals. This mechanism stops and it becomes devastating for a number of major fisheries (EDIT: Population size in the ocean is limited in the first instance by biologically available nitrogen and iron IIRC): for example the Artic and Antarctic krill, the eastern South-America. Krill-based fisheries are critical for many commercial fish, so say goodbye to cod, haddock, etc. Say goodbye to many of the whales. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the South American fisheries are harmed in El Niño years by a similar mechanism when warmer conditions stop the deep water upwelling, and this leads to famine across fishing communities. When the water column stratifies, it will be like El Niño <em>every year</em>. </p>
<p>At the top of the ocean, reduced mixing will increase top-water temperatures at most latitudes because mixing with cold deep waters stops. This will wipe out existing coral reefs (as we are seeing in Australia) but allow new coral reefs to grow in higher latitudes. Reef death will most probably causing mass extinctions of existing reef species and devastation to tropical fishing communities which depend on the reefs for food and protection from the sea. </p>
<p>Temperature-based stratification can be strengthened by fresh water inflow from rivers. Hot fresh water is a lot less dense than cold salty water, so it is likely that large areas of the continental shelves will stratify and develop anoxic sea floors. This wipes out reefs and also shellfish. Goodbye many salt-water staples like mussels, oysters, lobsters, crabs, etc.</p>
<p>Higher surface temperatures lead to more moisture in the atmosphere, which stops the Indian monsoon. India and South-East Asia starve. The change in rainfall continues the drying out of South Western USA, the Sahara and other deserts at similar latitudes. The USA will have another dust-bowl event which might create a desert. </p>
<p>Sea stratification events happen regularly in the fossil record. In fact anoxic bottom waters are really great for laying down fossils - dead animals are not consumed so they can actually fossilise. Anoxic events, where toxic bottom-waters well up (for example due to storms or bacterial blooms) can kill and preserve whole communities in-situ. This may be really helpful to future civilisations for the understanding of early anthopocene benthic communities. But not for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't have detailed records of the first few billion years, but there's been one recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum" target="_blank">period</a> of extremely warm temperatures. Based on what we know about that period, the answer to your questions is (to the best of my knowledge) &quot;yes, in some areas, but not everywhere.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anoxia
Main article: Anoxic event</p>
<p>In parts of the oceans, especially the north Atlantic Ocean, bioturbation is absent. This may be due to bottom-water anoxia, or by changing ocean circulation patterns changing the temperatures of the bottom water. However, many ocean basins remain bioturbated through the PETM.[29]</p>
<p>Ocean</p>
<p>The PETM is accompanied by a mass extinction of 35-50% of benthic foraminifera (especially in deeper waters) over the course of ~1,000 years – the group suffering more than during the dinosaur-slaying K-T extinction (e.g.,[35][36][37]). Contrarily, planktonic foraminifera diversified, and dinoflagellates bloomed. Success was also enjoyed by the mammals, who radiated extensively around this time.</p>
<p>The deep-sea extinctions are difficult to explain, because many species of benthic foraminifera in the deep-sea are cosmopolitan, and can find refugia against local extinction.[38] General hypotheses such as a temperature-related reduction in oxygen availability, or increased corrosion due to carbonate undersaturated deep waters, are insufficient as explanations. Acidification may also have played a role in the extinction of the calcifying foraminifera, and the higher temperatures would have increased metabolic rates, thus demanding a higher food supply. Such a higher food supply might not have materialized because warming and increased ocean stratification might have led to declining productivity [39] and/or increased remineralization of organic matter in the water column, before it reached the benthic foraminifera on the sea floor ([40]). The only factor global in extent was an increase in temperature. Regional extinctions in the North Atlantic can be attributed to increased deep-sea anoxia, which could be due to the slowdown of overturning ocean currents,[19] or the release and rapid oxidation of large amounts of methane. Oxygen minimum zones in the oceans may have expanded.[41]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the PETM is a great example to study. Though keep in mind the Isthmus of Panama wasn't around yet and the Tethys Sea was around, which, I would figure, gave the world very different currents than presently exist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer to any of your two questions. Other things like wind (under special conditions) and seismic/volcanic activity can help this exchange, so I'm not really sure what it would be like under such different geophysical situations. Would have to look it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please do not take this answer as anything other than speculation, but it's possible that the rate of melting is important here. If it takes thousands of years for the caps to melt instead of hundreds, then that might be enough time for mixing to occur, essentially eliminating the effect we're discussing here.</p></div>		</li>
