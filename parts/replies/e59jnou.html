<p>I've often wondered why potatoes don't bubble over with a lid, but pasta does. Different levels of starch I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but I don't mind the effect. It's way better having slightly oily pasta than trying to clean up a burnt-on layer of pasta starch from the stovetop ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. It only takes a little bit of oil and you should probably be adding even a tad more oil after the pasta is transferred to sauce. You may be forgetting to add a half cup of the starchy pasta water back into the pasta and sauce when mixing. Thats a pretty important part of getting the sauce to bind to the noodle. Having good quality pasta helps as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works great, but keep in mind that it still has to break the surface tension on each bubble, so if your stove top is cranked up to high, then it probably won't be able to keep up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alternatively, you can cook your pasta in a flat skillet in a small amount of cold water.  No oil, no straining, no wasted water.  Pasta absorbs the water, and any remaining when cooked is a good sauce base.</p></div>		</li>
