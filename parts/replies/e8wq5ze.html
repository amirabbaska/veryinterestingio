			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to the installation process of the graphics drivers by Geforce Experience.
The setup is usually extracted to multiple locations.
Asides from that, It's a laggy piece of software </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solidstate hardware degrade where electromigration of metal in conductor is a physical change and there is more. So you might get a bit warmer chip and it will not over clock to the same degree. The common effect of changes in integrated circuit is that the fail and you get crashes or no function at all.</p>
<p>The more likely physical change is that fans and heatsinks collect a lot of dust and the cooling is reduced. The result can be that the computer operate at a lower frequency because of thermal problem.</p>
<p>So the primary reason of slowdown if software changes. Cooling problem can be a huge effect on some computers but is is easy to fix on a desktop but a bit harder on a laptop. </p></div>		</li>
