<p>Holding your breath during a rapid decompression will kill you. If the air pressure around you suddenly drops by three-quarters as you hold your breath your lungs expand rapidly. You prevent this by exhaling. If you hold your breath your lungs will suffer trauma and you will drown in your own blood.</p>
<p>The very first thing we teach divers is <strong>NEVER HOLD YOUR BREATH.</strong> we maintain a constant, slow exhalation. This is for exactly the same reason - if the pressure around you drops (as a diver ascends) your lungs must release air. People have died due to holding their breath in the last 2-3 metres of ascent. If you are doing breath-hold diving, the opposite happens - your lungs compress as they descend. This starts to feel very, very odd about 10m as your lungs are half their original volume. Because a breath-hold diver returns to the surface with no more volume than they started with, they are in no danger of lung damage. If you have inhaled pressurized air at depth, you can easily rip your lungs apart.</p>
<p>Similarly, the occupant of a pressurised aircraft has lungs full of air at a greater pressure than the air outside the aircraft. If a decompression occurs, follow the instructions: mask on, breathe normally. DO NOT HOLD YOUR BREATH.</p>
<p>Truly rapid depressurisations are very, very rare.</p></div>		</li>
