			<div class="markdown"><p>The curve or lack depends on your fighting style and whether you will need to stab against armor.  Curved swords are less effective at stabbing. Stabbing is how you penetrate armor.</p>
<p>Curved swords are not significantly more effective for cutting.  There are plenty of cutting demonstrations on YT that show this.  Slashing with a curved sword might be easier with less training as the edge may align more naturally.  Swinging with a straight sword will have enough movement in the blade to cut also.  Both types of blades can cut through pig carcasses. Also neither can cut through armor.</p>
<p>The center of balance is based on the blade geometry.  A baseball bat has the center of mass closer to the tip for heavier hitting.  Straight swords usually have the center of mass closer to the handle to improve blade responsiveness.  As such you need to hit ideally at about 2/3 down the blade length (so towards the tip side) to have enough mass behind the hit.  But you can find examples of either extreme in both blade types.</p>
<p>-- Viking swords do not have much tapper (getting thinner towards the tip) and very short tips as they were not stabbing weapons but they also do not curve.</p>
<p>-- Falchion swords were likely used against unarmored opponents. They may be either straight or curved. They may have very short tips or longer stabbing tips. They do usually concentrate the center of mass closer to the tip though.</p>
<p>I've never tried drawing from horseback as I have never been on a horse.  I believe it can be done either way. But curved swords may make it easier.</p>
<p>Tl;dr Eastern armies trained to fight with slashes and did not generally run into armor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>YMMV for different types of armor.  A heavy slash from the saddle of a charging horse could cut through mail, sometimes.  Cloth armor was common for much of history, and a good slash could cut it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It comes from the German school of swordsmanship. Mordstreich translates to Death Strike. You hold the sword by the blade and wallop your opponent upside the head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Short-Sword or Halbschwert was when you grabbed your sword halfway down the blade to allow for precision strikes to joints, visors, and any unarmored spots.</p>
<p>Funny enough if you keep reading, it says that most of these armored on armored fights degenerate into a wrestling match, where the first poor bastard to fall loses by getting a sword through the visor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For bludgeoning with a long sword, it’s less of halfswording and more along the lines of what’s called a “murder strike” or something similarly named; you grab ahold of the blade, but you use the hand guard as a makeshift mace to smack the fuck out of whatever you’re wanting to damage — I’m on mobile, otherwise I’d link an external source on my information, :/. </p>
<p>For example, you use halfswording to precisely strike with the point of the blade and make thrusting attacks more accurate/effective, and Murder Strike opponents to dent their armor and cause blunt force trauma. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several ways. Half swording, as already mentioned, was frequently used to allow the wielder to more easily push the tip into gaps.</p>
<p>But the quillons (the bits at the end of the guard) and the pommel (large, heavy metal bit at the bottom of the hilt) were often used as impact weapons.</p></div>		</li>
