			<div class="markdown"><p>You can, in principle, do this with a backyard telescope set up.  You need to know the angles of the base of your triangle.  With Earth's rotation (on top of the change in position around the Sun), you'd need to either make sure you are measuring the position when we are facing the same way or account for it.  The mathematics are not all that difficult - the [Plimpton tablet] (<a href="https://www.livescience.com/60227-babylonian-clay-tablet-trigonometry.html" target="_blank">https://www.livescience.com/60227-babylonian-clay-tablet-trigonometry.html</a>) from 3,700 years ago has the basis of the trig.</p>
<p>So, the angle measurements are most important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One parsec is equal to the distance at which you see 1 arc second (1/3600 of a degree) of parallax, which turns out to be a little over 3 light years. Since every star is farther than that from the sun, you need equipment that can measure a fraction of an arc-second.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you can't, because you definitely can, but you need high-quality equipment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Til where the word parsec comes from. I aways thought it was a weird unit. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note: if you can measure angles precisely, but you don't know the diameter of the Earth's orbit, you can still use parsecs as a unit of measure. You won't know how far a parsec actually is, but at least you can measure things relative to each other. Later, once you know the Earth's orbit, you can go back and fill in all the distances.</p>
<p>Also, also note: I don't think measuring fractions of a second of arc is all that hard, really. Just measure how much a nearby object like a star shifts relative to really far away objects like galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the inability to detect parallax was one of the main reasons people didn't accept Copernicus's heliocentric model. I don't think they were successful until the 1800s or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: pet rats, especially albino rats have poor eyesight that translates into a difficulty to judge distances. So you'll often see them bob their heads back and forth as you approach their cage. They do this to use parallax to figure out how far you are.</p></div>		</li>
