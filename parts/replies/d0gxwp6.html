			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, vacuum can exhibit an intensity dependent nonlinear refractive index. I don't have a source on hand (I'm a PhD candidate in physics and optics), but I read a research paper last year for which it was important and mentioned. I will source when I get home onto my computer. It was a paper by Gerard Mourou</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understood that from a skim through, they are saying that high energy, 1 fs pulses generated using their proposed method would experience a non zero refractive index? Wouldn't that require the pulse to squeeze spatially as it travels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A visible frequency laser of high enough intensity to locally heat the air around it is also scattering its light everywhere - that's how it dumps heat to the air in the first place. You would need a laser at an invisible frequency, probably near infrared, for this to be noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe what he means is that you would see refractions of light, not shadows. Kind of like if you have a light bulb and put it inside a glass jar with a varied surface texture you could see the light refracting through the jar across the wall of the room you're in.</p></div>		</li>
