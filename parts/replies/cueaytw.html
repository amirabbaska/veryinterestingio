			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually helped rebuild one of the generators at the Ludington Pump Storage Power Plant, 5th largest plant according to the Wiki list . They rebuild them every ten years or so I think. I had a paper weight from one of the winding's we cut out for a few years.  It is basically just a big copper bar with tape of some sort.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a good visualisation of how it can work: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EEZJAmR.png" target="_blank">Energy consumption in Germany last week</a></p>
<p>The yellow stuff at the top is solar and the light gray green stuff is wind and the blue that is the third from the top is pumped storage.</p>
<p>You can see how it peeks in the early morning and late afternoon when people are awake and using power, but solar is not giving much electricity. the bumps can be much more dramatic later in the year when the sun is shining for less of the day.</p>

One of my physics professors and his brother are battery experts, one of them being the most world renowned in the field. Any time he does consulting work with companies on what kind of battery they should use to store energy he says the water kind. :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is certainly true that tidal effects are gravitational at their root, in practical terms I think they are different from what most people mean when they talk about gravity as a power source.  </p>
<p>I mean, in a sense, fossil fuels are solar power, a kind of stored sunshine, photosynthesized by plants a long time ago. So in the same way that one could make a kind of Dad-joke or party-trick by claiming to have a solar-powered car, one might refer to, say, a surfboard as some kind of &quot;gravitational-wave transporter&quot; or something, and elicit some groans and chuckles once you explain the joke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... Surfboards don't ride gravitational waves.</p>
<p>The mechanisms for tides and waves are almost separate.</p>
<p>Waves that you surf on are caused by the wind primarily, which is caused by the sun.</p>
<p>Tidal movements are primarily caused by the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably argue that tides are more like a flywheel than gravitational energy -- angular momentum of the Earth-moon system is being converted into gravitational potential energy (for the moon) and electricity (for us), with a lot of waste. Gravity is just our brake on the flywheel =D</p>
<p>Edit: Just to be clear, not saying you're wrong at all, just providing an alternative way to look at it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, tidal power is extremely difficult to extract because it's inconsistent and the environment is very damaging to anything man made. It will likely never be a viable power source except for very small communities. </p></div>		</li>
