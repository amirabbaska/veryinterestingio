			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is certainly true that tidal effects are gravitational at their root, in practical terms I think they are different from what most people mean when they talk about gravity as a power source.  </p>
<p>I mean, in a sense, fossil fuels are solar power, a kind of stored sunshine, photosynthesized by plants a long time ago. So in the same way that one could make a kind of Dad-joke or party-trick by claiming to have a solar-powered car, one might refer to, say, a surfboard as some kind of &quot;gravitational-wave transporter&quot; or something, and elicit some groans and chuckles once you explain the joke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... Surfboards don't ride gravitational waves.</p>
<p>The mechanisms for tides and waves are almost separate.</p>
<p>Waves that you surf on are caused by the wind primarily, which is caused by the sun.</p>
<p>Tidal movements are primarily caused by the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably argue that tides are more like a flywheel than gravitational energy -- angular momentum of the Earth-moon system is being converted into gravitational potential energy (for the moon) and electricity (for us), with a lot of waste. Gravity is just our brake on the flywheel =D</p>
<p>Edit: Just to be clear, not saying you're wrong at all, just providing an alternative way to look at it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, tidal power is extremely difficult to extract because it's inconsistent and the environment is very damaging to anything man made. It will likely never be a viable power source except for very small communities. </p></div>		</li>
