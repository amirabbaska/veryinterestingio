			<div class="markdown"><p>Love your enthusiasm. The answer is that it is  becoming possible. The science needed to make it happen is progressing at quite a pace, but it's not quite there yet. Two animals have been briefly de-extincted. The first, a type of extinct mountain goat called a bucardo, sadly died shortly after it was born. And then scientists have made gastric brooding frog embryos .... that they have yet to turn into frogs. Will we see fully de-extinct animals in the not too distant future? I think it's entirely possible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not for dinosaurs, or any well preserved DNA older than ~1.5 million years. As I'm sure you're aware, DNA has a half-life of 512 years. After 1.5 million the DNA is basically unreadable, and after 6.8 million years no DNA will remain intact, under perfect conditions. Not even sticking hermaphroditic frog DNA into the petri dish is going to save the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>edit: I see in other comments you note resurrecting dinosaurs is 'technically impossible'.</p>

<p>Under the conditions in a specific cave in New Zealand, IIRC. It will vary with temperature, water content and other environmental factors. This makes the situation a bit better for mammoths, as they are often found frozen, extending the life time of DNA. But dinosaurs are beyond salvation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there are animals descendent from dinosaurs it may be possible that the DNA is still there in the form of dormant genes, maybe a future supercomputer crossreferencing the full genome of all species related to dinosaurs can do something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If it's not possible, what kinds of barriers are standing in the way? (Legal, ethical, technological, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the above. People have various ethical concerns about de-extinction but one that crops up over and over is that we should be spending our money preserving the species we still have, not bringing back the dead. My answer to this is that it's not either / or. The techniques being developed to de-extinct animals can equally be applied to endangered living creatures. And sometimes living animals need de-extinction. There are just three northern white rhinos left. They can't breed naturally. Attempts to save them now count as de-extinction.
On the legal side, we don't know at present how de-extinct animals will be regulated or protected. People are talking about this. To qualify for legal protection under endangered species law, an animal must be listed as endangered, but for that, the animal has to live in the wild. The first few generations of any newly de-extincted animal would be kept in captivity whilst researchers check they are healthy and normal - so during this time their legal status is uncertain.
Regarding technology; we can do some amazing things. We can edits the genomes of animals with pinpoint accuracy, retrieve DNA from animals hundreds of thousands of years old, and make skin cells turn into sperm and egg. There is, of course, more to learn. One key thing is to fine-tune our understanding of how a single cell develops into an embryo and that's a biggy! Nail that and scientists will really start to make progress.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To revive extinct species we need a few things besides complete DNA sequence. Many I haven't seen any of yet (which maybe the book covers?) </p>
<ul>
<li>Epigenetic information (and the ability to encode it), including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting" target="_blank">genomic imprinting</a>. Simple ATCG sequence isn't enough because you also need things like correct methylation and andenalation, histones etc. that further modify how genes act. To my knowledge all attempts to revive species so far have gotten around this by using natural source DNA to create new embryos. They're basically cloning the animals instead of building the DNA from scratch.</li>
<li>DNA-complimentary mitochondria for the embryo. Most animals get some mitochondrial proteins from within the mitochondria, but many from the nucleic DNA. Which genes are in which place varies between species. If we want to revive an extinct species we need to determine which genes are in which location and create or locate mitochondria that have all the genes the nuclear DNA doesn't. Alternatively we could add some of the mitochondrial DNA to the nucleus--there are efforts to figure out how to do that in humans as part of an anti-aging strategy--but rebalancing that might make the project harder. To my knowledge again, all recent attempts to clone extinct species have side stepped this by using an embryo from a close relative of the species and just replacing the core DNA.</li>
<li>A suitable environment for embryonic development. This may be easier for mammals like Mammoths who have living cousins in elephants. If the relation is close enough it will probably work. It's going to be much harder for egg grown species that we'd need to grow vat-baby style like large dinosaurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it possible? If we can get all the information we need I don't see any reason that there can't be some future level of technology sufficient to do it. However that information is very very hard to get, and we're definitely lacking some of the core technologies. Jurassic Park is still at least a few decades away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm wondering is what do we do with the cloned animals without causing an invasive species-esque problem in environments that have not had that species in them for a long time?</p>
<p>Cuz that's my only concern,  otherwise, clone away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily a lot of the species people want to clone are long-lived, slow breeding species (Mammoths, Rhinos, stuff like that). So, it's a lot easier to keep an eye on their impact on the environment and step in, as compared to your usual invasive species like insects, or the classic, Cane toads. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't worry too much. Nature is more flexible than it seems, and creatures either find a niche or go extinct. </p>
<p>If they threaten the ecosystem significantly, I imagine they would be moved to a different ecosystem, moved to captivity and as a last resort re-extincted. </p>
<p>The most likely situation though, is that the creatures find a niche and survive without having too much of an impact on nature. If they thrive too well, controlled hunting could also offer a solution to keep their numbers stable.</p></div>		</li>
