<p>I see this quoted a lot but it makes no sense. Memories ARE thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a &quot;memory&quot; of my biological father eating Pringles. It's the only memory I have of him and it was 25 years ago. I can no longer bring the images up in my minds eye, but I remember telling people about the memory and thinking about it. It's a memory of a memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, when we create the memory we store our thoughts that we had in the moment. However, each time we think about the memory we are actually recalling the pervious time we recalled it, not the original thought itself. That is one reason it is easy to implant false memories/alter memories in yourself. You don't have an original back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why the 90's felt so nastalgic? We remember it so much that we remember the feeling of the memory but not the memory itself. Almost doing the pavlov experiment on humans, instead of fear its happy emotions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me rephrase, we are remembering the last thought of the memory every time we think of it, instead of the initial memory.It's strange to explain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's how I remember my birth. I don't actually remember being born, but I remember remembering about being born when I was a little kid. I constantly recalled my birth for a long time, so I never forgot. I also remember being able to recall the pain I felt after I was born, but I don't actually remember what that pain felt like. I don't remember all of the details because as a kid I only recalled the most striking details, and thus, I only recall the details that I last thought of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it had been shown that memories are &quot;pulled up&quot; then &quot;restored.&quot; That's why memories can be softened or even altered by careful psychology - by storing them under different circumstances. PTSD research has found the proteins involved in this, and there are currently drugs that can stop protein activity in the brain. So, in theory, you take a pill and a psychologist pulls up specific memories that can't be re-saved. If course it's not that simple, they can turn off brain proteins, but not the specific ones that we are targeting, so who knows what else is affected. Also, ANYTHING you thought of during the hypothetical drug session would permanently erased. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kept reading through the comments hoping to find something about PTSD. I have it and it's destroying my life right now. I finally have an appointment with a specialist next week and have hope, but it's awful how certain memories feel like they've blown holes in my brain and generally wreaking havoc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have multiple memories from when I was 3 or 4 years old, however many of these memories are also associated with a pictures. I don't know if seeing the pictures kept the memory alive, or if the memories were partly induced.</p>
<p>The memories are vague first-person images. In one, I just remember being next to a plush toy and I vaguely remember seeing the plush upclose and not liking its gray hair.</p></div>		</li>
