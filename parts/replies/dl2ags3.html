			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought a Linux host machine with a Windows virtual machine to create a Windows virus would be fairly well protected. Even if the virus was to &quot;leak out&quot; it would not be able to do anything for an operating system it was not designed for. I am not aware of any type of malware yet that is designed to infect Linux and windows environments. Obviously I could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it certainly could be possible if that's what it aims to do. Malware that breaks out of a virtual machine doesn't do it by accident; it's built to do so. There's nothing stopping some sort of malware from carrying a second payload and deploying it once its compromised the virtual machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When creating viruses designed to &quot;leak&quot;, the number one rule is always &quot;better safe than sorry.&quot; The people who create these sorts of things do so in safe environments with no outside connections and no wireless communication. If those are the types of equipment that need tested, then they're often faked. badBIOS is one such virus that got out of hand, but it's been isolated and contained. It can jump from Linux to OSX to Windows very easily, and can even be transmitted through speaker/microphone set ups. It can even jump air gaps. Reportedly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;He says also that he's found evidence that the malware is able to create mini-networks between infected machines using high frequency sound waves that are passed from a computer's microphone to another's speakers, and vice-versa.&quot;</p>
<p>That's pretty awesome and scary. Infect one of the most popular youtube videos, that's a potential billion person audience. <a href="https://memecrunch.com/image/52028577afa96f7933000014.jpg" target="_blank">I'm really interested in just how that works.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not quite what it was reported to do. It can use speakers / mics to communicate between two already infected machines (eg. to steal files from a non-networked computer) but it can't infect a computer via a microphone.</p></div>		</li>
