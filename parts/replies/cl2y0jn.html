			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a silly question. You can't make a truly &quot;white&quot; LED. An LED works by emitting light over a fairly narrow band of wavelength, which usually corresponds to a single color (red, green, blue, etc). In fact, &quot;white&quot; LED's are actually made by starting with a blue LED and encapsulating it with a phosphorescent coating, that will down convert the blue light into the multiple colors that make up &quot;white&quot; light.</p>
<p>The development of blue LEDs was so important because it paved the way for having &quot;white&quot; LED's. We couldn't have white light before they existed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a question though. I feel that the light my incandescent light bulbs make is &quot;warmer&quot; than what my LED &quot;bulbs&quot; produce. So much so that I prefer the old bulbs. Is this only imaginary or do they actually produce a &quot;better&quot; light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LEDs emit light at specific wavelengths, which we then see as colors. Which is to say, a blue LED emits only blue light. White light is actually a combination of colors, so you can't make an LED that emits &quot;white&quot; light and then filter out everything but blue light, because to have blue light as a part of your white light your white LED would need to be in part a blue LED.</p>
<p>White LEDs were actually invented after blue LEDs, because they're really blue LEDs with a bit of yellow phosphor mixed into the crystal to make a blue/yellow combination that looks white to our eyes, even though it's technically not &quot;white&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, though, purple plastic on a white LED is one of the ways that they currently make purple LEDs, since there isn't a &quot;purple&quot; LED crystal yet. The other ways are blue LED + red phosphate, or just a blue/red LED crystal combination in one light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best response here so far. I'm currently in a semiconductor processing class at Cal and might be able to shed a bit more light on this since we literally talked about the GaN problem yesterday. GaN is relatively easy to make n-type, the p-type doping was the primary issue. When trying to include acceptor dopants (p type) the GaN that was grown would form defects to compensate the charge imbalance instead of forming electron holes, which would effectively make the doping worthless. By including Mg that was &quot;non activated&quot; (with H if I remember correctly) they could grow crystals that had the Mg dopant in it, and then they could take advantage of thermodynamics/kinetics to heat treat the crystals and remove the H from the Mg. This  activates the dopant that is already inside the material and the GaN doesn't form compensating defects.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little more info.  Akasaki and Amano (Amano worked in Akasaki's lab at the time) pretty much accidentally discovered activation of p-GaN.  They exposed a p-GaN sample to an electron beam (in other words, they looked at it in an SEM, if you've cynical like me), then finrd out afterwards it was conductive, but they didn't know why.</p>
<p>Later, Shuji at Nichia figured out that it was the hydrogen compensating the magnesium preventing p-type conductivity, and that you could remove the H by simply annealing the sample in air.  </p>
<p>Shuji also made big gains in crystal quality with his MOCVD reactor and experience, which allowed him to make better optical devices once he had the conductive p-type GaN. </p>
<p>Regarding crystal quality/defects, GaN is actually remarkably tolerant of defects, far more so than other materials.  But you do have to get it to a certain level to get things to actually function well, a battle still going on somewhat today.</p>
<p>Akasaki/Amano did a lot of other things too, like buffer layers to improve crystal quality, since they were all growing heteroepitaxially on offer substrates, eg sapphire.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I appreciate you taking the time to find reference material to back up your statements. But as a PhD student, you should be <em>very</em> aware on what constitutes a source and what does not.

			<div class="markdown"><p>SiC was used to make the first blue LEDs <a href="http://www.sslighting.net/news/features/maruska_blue_led_history.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>, but it was incredibly inefficient as it was an indirect bandgap semiconductor so very few electrons can recombine with holes in the right way to emit light.</p>
<p>Zinc-selenide was also being used for blue LEDs, but the GaN LEDs turned out to be much more reliable and they totally took over.  But I'm not sure why the GaN ones turned out to be better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The GaN material system, particularly when you include indium, is magical.  I'm only partially kidding.</p>
<p>GaN is amazingly reliable, and emits light far better than it should, given the typical defect density present.  My personal opinion, given the evidence, goes to effects like carrier localization due to indium compositional fluctuations in the active region.  This localization, on a scale small enough we can't see it directly, lessens the effects of defects, increasing both efficiency and reliability, since these defects also serve as paths for degradation as well as non-radiative recombination centers.</p>
<p>At least that's the theory I like.  I've heard Shuji discuss this theory at least once, as well, but it's hard to observe, much less prove.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ZnSe blue LEDs and lasers had short lifetimes due to twinning defects.  If you look up papers on ZnSe as an emitting material, they tend to peter out after about 1994.  The problems with GaN growth were solved and the ZnSe growth issues were not, so people stopped working on ZnSe and started working with GaN.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or materials to make blue LEDs not so annoying bright.</p>
<p>There came a point after their invention that everything seemed to have blue LEDs. This was very bad with alarm clocks (media players, laptop chargers, etc.) as instead of a soft warm red glow as was once common, the devices started lighting up the whole room in a cold harsh uncomfortable manner.</p>
<p>I have come to think of devices with blue LEDs as cheap and nasty since they obviously didn't think about the night time effect.</p></div>		</li>
