			<p>Not a silly question. You can't make a truly &quot;white&quot; LED. An LED works by emitting light over a fairly narrow band of wavelength, which usually corresponds to a single color (red, green, blue, etc). In fact, &quot;white&quot; LED's are actually made by starting with a blue LED and encapsulating it with a phosphorescent coating, that will down convert the blue light into the multiple colors that make up &quot;white&quot; light.<br><br>The development of blue LEDs was so important because it paved the way for having &quot;white&quot; LED's. We couldn't have white light before they existed.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dtfgator" target="_blank">dtfgator</a>
			<p>Yes and no.  <br><br>Technically yes, the light emitted by many white LEDS (the ones based on a phosphor-coated InGaN LED, and not RGB or another solution) is blue until it hits the coating and is down-converted.   <br><br>However, the coating is usually applied directly to the die via sputtering or another deposition process, and any attempt to remove it would almost certainly destroy the LED.  Some (more rare) LEDs have phosphor films in the encapsulant, so you might have more luck there, but it'd still be extremely tricky.   </p>		</li>

			<p>So are they actually blue or UV? I was always under the impression that white LEDs (as in the expensive kind used for lighting) were UV and down converted using phosphors similar to fluorescents. </p>		</li>

			<p>Nope, they are typically blue.  UV ones could exist, but I've never personally seen them.  <br><br>The blue LED pump passes through a (typically yellow) phosphor in order to create a combined color of white or off white.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are two major problems with green:  efficiency (green is far, far far less efficient than blue and red, by a solid 40% or so), and phosphor requirements - Cerium (YAG), the major phosphor used in blue LEDs, is an extremely common rare-earth element and is thus very inexpensive.  </p>		</li>

			<p>LEDs today are all pretty standard, a variety of different chemistry options exist that all produce unique colors.  The addition of phosphor coatings allow us to slightly shift these colors.  Advances in efficiency, layout, die size and power handling have allowed us to make brighter and brighter units.  <br><br>Phillips Luxeon Rebel LEDs and Cree XLamp XML units are the gold-standard in terms of high-brightness color LEDs today, in case you're interested in tracking some down. <br><br>I'm actually in the process of launching a <a href="http://antumbra.io" target="_blank">product</a> right now, which makes use of a high brightness RGB LED to generate just about any color (brilliant or otherwise) possible.

			<p>Interesting! I just read on Ars about this years Nobel prize in physics going to the key inventors of the technology behind blue LEDs. <br><br>Article:<br><a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/10/blue-leds-given-nobel-prize-in-physics/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/10/blue-leds-given-nobel-prize-in-physics/</a><br><br>I have a question though. I feel that the light my incandescent light bulbs make is &quot;warmer&quot; than what my LED &quot;bulbs&quot; produce. So much so that I prefer the old bulbs. Is this only imaginary or do they actually produce a &quot;better&quot; light?</p>		</li>

			<p>You're not crazy. Regular bulbs produce a full spectrum of light, nearly every visible wavelength, which the sun does as well, so colors are more accurately reflected to your eye for all the objects being illuminated. This is known as CRI, color rendering index. LEDs are getting better, with high-CRI specific LEDs available, but they still don't match the full spectrum that a burning filament produces, because the wavelengths produced are still primarily blue and yellow.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/not-a-doctor-" target="_blank">not-a-doctor-</a>
			<p>In theory, yes, by converting blue to all of the lower-energy wavelengths to replicate a filament bulb. This is what high CRI LEDs attempt to accomplish, though technically they're not perfect yet, and quite expensive.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mastjaso" target="_blank">mastjaso</a>
			<p>Hang on I just want to provide a small clarification on this topic. <br><br>You're description of CRI is accurate, however, that is not necessarily the problem /u/dogememe is referring to. LED lights (similarly to fluorescent bulbs) used for general lighting will come with a rating for the CRI, however, they will also come with a rating for colour temperature measured in Kelvin. <br><br>It's the colour temperature that more accurately describes the overall &quot;blueness/coldness&quot; or &quot;redness/warmness&quot; of the light. If you find your LED lamps to be too blue then you should look for something &quot;warmer&quot; which counter intuitively means a colder temperature on the Kelvin scale (i.e. 3000K is a warm light, where as 4500K is getting pretty blue-white). <br><br>CRI is linked to colour temperature but not directly. You can get high CRI lamps at 3500K and above, though usually you seem them in the 4000-5000K+ range. But it sounds like /u/dogememe is really just bothered by the colour temperature and not by the CRI (how accurate colours appear in the light). Low colour temperature (warm) lamps shouldn't be any more expensive than the high colour temperature (cold) lamps. Just look for bulbs that say Warm White or are below 3500K. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>You can get warm white LEDs quite easily now. Most people know and understand that, but still feel that the light isn't the same quality as their old bulbs. I pegged the confusion here as CRI difference since OP was talking about whether the light was &quot;better,&quot; not specifically the color temperature. You're correct too, of course.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mastjaso" target="_blank">mastjaso</a>
			<p>Well I think OP was probably confusing / conflating the two since in the sentence before saying &quot;better&quot; he described them as &quot;warmer&quot;, I was mainly trying to point out that they're somewhat separate characteristics, though both will affect the aesthetics of lighting a room, it just depends on the application.  </p>		</li>

			<p>LEDs emit light at specific wavelengths, which we then see as colors. Which is to say, a blue LED emits only blue light. White light is actually a combination of colors, so you can't make an LED that emits &quot;white&quot; light and then filter out everything but blue light, because to have blue light as a part of your white light your white LED would need to be in part a blue LED.<br><br>White LEDs were actually invented after blue LEDs, because they're really blue LEDs with a bit of yellow phosphor mixed into the crystal to make a blue/yellow combination that looks white to our eyes, even though it's technically not &quot;white&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>Best response here so far. I'm currently in a semiconductor processing class at Cal and might be able to shed a bit more light on this since we literally talked about the GaN problem yesterday. GaN is relatively easy to make n-type, the p-type doping was the primary issue. When trying to include acceptor dopants (p type) the GaN that was grown would form defects to compensate the charge imbalance instead of forming electron holes, which would effectively make the doping worthless. By including Mg that was &quot;non activated&quot; (with H if I remember correctly) they could grow crystals that had the Mg dopant in it, and then they could take advantage of thermodynamics/kinetics to heat treat the crystals and remove the H from the Mg. This  activates the dopant that is already inside the material and the GaN doesn't form compensating defects.<br><br>Edit: lets include information: <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1347-4065/31/5R/1258" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1347-4065/28/12A/L2112" target="_blank">2</a><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>A little more info.  Akasaki and Amano (Amano worked in Akasaki's lab at the time) pretty much accidentally discovered activation of p-GaN.  They exposed a p-GaN sample to an electron beam (in other words, they looked at it in an SEM, if you've cynical like me), then finrd out afterwards it was conductive, but they didn't know why.<br><br>Later, Shuji at Nichia figured out that it was the hydrogen compensating the magnesium preventing p-type conductivity, and that you could remove the H by simply annealing the sample in air.  <br><br>Shuji also made big gains in crystal quality with his MOCVD reactor and experience, which allowed him to make better optical devices once he had the conductive p-type GaN. <br><br>Regarding crystal quality/defects, GaN is actually remarkably tolerant of defects, far more so than other materials.  But you do have to get it to a certain level to get things to actually function well, a battle still going on somewhat today.<br><br>Akasaki/Amano did a lot of other things too, like buffer layers to improve crystal quality, since they were all growing heteroepitaxially on offer substrates, eg sapphire.</p>		</li>

			<p>SiC was used to make the first blue LEDs <a href="http://www.sslighting.net/news/features/maruska_blue_led_history.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>, but it was incredibly inefficient as it was an indirect bandgap semiconductor so very few electrons can recombine with holes in the right way to emit light.<br><br>Zinc-selenide was also being used for blue LEDs, but the GaN LEDs turned out to be much more reliable and they totally took over.  But I'm not sure why the GaN ones turned out to be better.</p>		</li>

			<p>The GaN material system, particularly when you include indium, is magical.  I'm only partially kidding.<br><br>GaN is amazingly reliable, and emits light far better than it should, given the typical defect density present.  My personal opinion, given the evidence, goes to effects like carrier localization due to indium compositional fluctuations in the active region.  This localization, on a scale small enough we can't see it directly, lessens the effects of defects, increasing both efficiency and reliability, since these defects also serve as paths for degradation as well as non-radiative recombination centers.<br><br>At least that's the theory I like.  I've heard Shuji discuss this theory at least once, as well, but it's hard to observe, much less prove.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's the theory I've heard too for why InGaN works so well, though I'm not an optoelectronics guy so I'm not too familiar with the evidence for it.  These fluctuations which can be good for optoelectronics are mostly a problem for electronics because they tend to scatter electrons and form non-uniform barrier heights.</p>		</li>

			<p>ZnSe blue LEDs and lasers had short lifetimes due to twinning defects.  If you look up papers on ZnSe as an emitting material, they tend to peter out after about 1994.  The problems with GaN growth were solved and the ZnSe growth issues were not, so people stopped working on ZnSe and started working with GaN.</p>		</li>

			<p>Or materials to make blue LEDs not so annoying bright.<br><br>There came a point after their invention that everything seemed to have blue LEDs. This was very bad with alarm clocks (media players, laptop chargers, etc.) as instead of a soft warm red glow as was once common, the devices started lighting up the whole room in a cold harsh uncomfortable manner.<br><br>I have come to think of devices with blue LEDs as cheap and nasty since they obviously didn't think about the night time effect.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's easy enough to make them less bright, just put less current through them. Seems like some device designers like to use them at full brightness anyway. Must still be in &quot;OMG BLUE LEDS AMAZING&quot; mode.</p>		</li>

			<p>I didn't think LEDs could be effectively dimmed and this was instead achieved with LED driver quickly alternating them between on and off.<br><br><a href="http://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2010/apr/how-to-dim-an-led" target="_blank">It seems apparently they can be varied by current but there are complications mainly with the requirement of dissipating heat/excess energy.</a></p>		</li>

			<p>For small LEDs (i.e. not the ones used in LED bulbs or flashlights), the usual way they limit the current is to just use a resistor. Using a higher value resistor will reduce the current and brightness. The power dissipation is negliglble with low-current LEDs like that.</p>		</li>

			<p>Okay.<br><br>A problem I have with the switch from incandescent globes to florescent and mains power LEDs is that my dimmers no longer work, so it's seemed that LED dimming by current/voltage didn't apply the same way.</p>		</li>

			<p>Most LED bulbs are dimmable, though that doesn't happen inherently with the way the LEDs are driven (essentially a constant-current switching power supply) but requires they be designed to do this. Essentially the bulb circuitry detects the triac waveform and adjusts the LED current to approximate that level.</p>		</li>
