<p>ugh, I'm disgusted in myself. </p>
<p>What characteristic of the elements in that peak are important to this process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an offshoot question:</p>
<p>If you could make a celestial object out of a non-fissile material (say, U238) but small enough to not collapse into a neutron star, could you effectively end up with a fission &quot;star&quot;? I seem to vaguely recall that almost every isotope heavier than iron has a finite critical mass, but only certain ones have one small enough to be practical for fission reactions at human scales. This makes me wonder that if you had a large enough ball of stuff, any stray neutron will eventually collide with a nucleus before escaping into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neutron also has to have the right energy to work.</p>
<p>U-238 requires a fast neutron to produce fission and, when it undergoes fission, produces neutrons that are too slow to produce fission in another U-238 nucleus. So U-238 (barring odd density effects) doesn't have a critical mass.</p>
<p>It will, however, absorb a slower neutron, become U-239, decay to Np-239 which will decay to P-239, which is fissile (i.e. will split when hit by lower energy neutrons).</p></div>		</li>
