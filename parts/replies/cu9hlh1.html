			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be added that while the eye <em>does</em> work with this snapshot system and has a fairly low frame rate, the reason that we can differentiate between 10fps, 30fps and sometimes 60fps is that all information gained by the two visual systems is basically integrated into one information stream.</p>
<p>The information that we lack through the high quality snapshots is then extended with the help of low resolution information in our peripheral vision.</p>
<p>Talking about frame rates is also not quite right, there is no certain point at which the eye sends a complete &quot;frame&quot; to the brain it works a bit differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as long as by the frame you mean the snapshot from the central visual system, then yeah, such a point exists: it's when the saccadic blanking ends due to zero retinal slip. Of course these frames, or snapshots, are then integrated into the overall big picture, as you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well said. However, the human eye can differentiate between can tell the difference between a 60fps and a 120fps monitor. The human eye does not really take snapshots of our environment. It is more of a continuous feed of information. The brain filters the information, when we change our focal point (using the fast movement), it ignores the information while the eye is moving and only once focused again does it start to use the information.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure. That's what peripheral vision does for you. It's fast, and it can be sensitive to spatially separated flicker that's much faster. I can personally see 1kHz flicker with the eye held static (tried once with paralyzed eye muscles, just to be sure).</p>

<p>The central vision certainly does, and you can check it yourself. Such snapshots are integrated into a bigger picture, but not only are there snapshots, but their time of acquisition is very well defined and if you track the eye with a fundus tracker you can determine when they happen via post processing of the fundus image sequence.</p>

<p>First of all, you must distinguish between the peripheral and central vision, since they act differently. Peripheral vision is always on. Central vision takes snapshots: there is no filtering, and no turning on-and-off. The start of the saccade enables image acquisition: it's like if you pressed the &quot;enable&quot; button. The subsequent cessation of retinal slip triggers the acquisition: it's as if you pressed a camera shutter release. The shutter subsequently closes and essentially won't retrigger until a next saccade starts or a timeout elapses.</p>
<p>When the image is &quot;focused&quot; again the brain doesn't &quot;start&quot; to use the information: it takes a snapshot and promptly reverts to <strong>ignoring</strong> the information.</p></div>		</li>
