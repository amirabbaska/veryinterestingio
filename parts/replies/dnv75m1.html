<p>Apparently, not the best answer. When I responded, it was a dead thread and this was the answer that made the most sense to me. Thanks for telling me how wrong we all are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good explanation of the broader process (even though as far as I know seperate species can still sometimes successfully interbreed), but it doesn't really answer your question. It's difficult if not impossible to quantify the number of mutations required to officially create a new species. It's actually possible to measure the &quot;genetic distance&quot; between two species, but as far as I know there is no distance that automatically makes two organisms separate species. The other post using the color metaphor illustrates this concept well.</p>
<p>It's unlikely if not impossible for humans to evolve into different species unless we somehow get isolated on two different planets. While different populations can sometimes have a higher than expected occurrence of particular traits (like Sherpas being able to make better use of oxygen in low oxygen environments), there are no traits that are entirely unique to one population. Humans are nearly 99.9% genetically identical, and the genetic distance between humans is much smaller than the distance between subspecies. For that distance to grow, we would have to be isolated for a long time so that mutations could occur and persist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. This is an interesting question by the OP, but very tricky to answer. Like others have said, there are many different definitions of a species, and they are used in different cases amongst much debate. </p>
<p>An example for how tricky things can be: Coyotes (Canis latrans) and gray wolves (Canis lupus) can and often do successfully breed, even though they're different species. So oftentimes they're neither post- nor pre-zygotically separated. And in fact, many members of the canids can and do interbreed successfully. Does this make them the same species? Well, no, we don't really think so.</p>
<p>Alright, so dogs (Canis lupus familiars) are considered to be a subspecies of gray wolves (Canis lupus), and many dogs can breed with wolves to produce viable offspring. So are they the same species? Well again no, not really, that doesn't feel right, even if one is a subspecies of the other. They're so different, right? And maybe they're pre-zygotically separated by their different environments and mating rituals.</p>
<p>Now, consider different &quot;breeds&quot; of dogs. A Chihuahua has amassed so many mutations that it looks almost nothing like a Great Dane. But these are the exact same species according to many biologists. As far as I know, these two breeds cannot successfully breed. So shouldn't they be different species? But we don't consider them to be.</p>
<p>This is one of the problems with this definition of species (not that it isn't useful at times). Looking at evolutionary distance has similar problems, because it doesn't take into account actual behavior or ecology.</p>
<p>So really, it's our perception that's the problem. Organisms don't really reach a specific point at which BAM they're different species. It's a gradual, messy change with blurred lines. Not to get all zen, but the divisions between many things in life are nothing but illusions. We create these concepts so it's easier for us to understand, and also because it's very useful to be able to separate and classify things. But it's not entirely accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding your final point about it being impossible for humans to evolve into two different species; isn't that only true because of our interconnected, widespread populations? </p>
<p>If there was a worldwide catastrophe for example, and human populations were completely cut off from one another for a long time, wouldn't they begin developing differently again? And given enough time develop into separate species?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Best answer in here. Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree.  </p>
<p>They didn't  actually answer the question^1.  The question is really asking &quot;at what point are two different animals/groups different 'species' and how much mutation does it take before that happens.  They answer the when it's officially two different species (i.e. they can't produce offspring) and the circumstances under which this may occur. </p>
<hr />
<p>^1 Also this is ELI5 and it wasn't very simple (as someone who's done a ton of this, I understood, although I imagine there are a lot who may not) </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a great answer <em>when combined with</em> the biologist one. They both cover aspects and paint a much better picture - this one got into specifics of kinds of speciation, and serves as a good supplement behind the whys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then the real answer would be &quot;when we feel like it, as many as it takes for us to feel like it, because species aren't real, they are just classifications we use for convenience and there aren't hard and fast rules about it&quot;, right?</p>
<p>I dunno, his answer is at least more satisfying. It might not answer what the question actually asked, but I think it's closer to what it <em>meant</em> than the true answer I gave above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this is the answer:</p>
<p>We consider animals two different species when they can't produce viable offspring. Meaning the number of mutations requiered to consider specimens different species is &quot;enough to make the specimens unable to produce viable offspring&quot;, it may be one mutation that just changes mating call or multiple mutations.</p>
<p>And what do you mean by officially? Is there some unoficial taxonomy ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to expand on this. Yes a new species is created when mutations become prevalent enough in a specific organism's gene pool. But this doesn't happen until those organisms carrying the mutation become successful enough in their environments to reproduce over the span of many generations. </p>
<p>This implies that the genetic mutation so profoundly affected the survival chance of the species that it helped them be more likely to reproduce than the other members of the same species that didn't inherit the &quot;helpful&quot; mutation. That is moment that a new species is born. Because those without the mutation now have an inherently different rate of survival in the same environment, the one species has now diverged into two subspecies.</p>
<p>Generally, the mutation that leads to more effective farming of the environment's resources will equal a higher chance that the new gene will pass to offspring. Often the new subspecies is also competing with the old subspecies, which further lowers the old subspecies's chance of reproducing. The result compounds the likelihood of the old's demise and the new's dominance. Evolution of a species happens with time testing thousands of generations. Why doesn't the camelops exist anymore? Because the modern camel (and the mutations it took to get there) was much more well adapted to extracting resources from the environment it lives in. I'll even take a leap and say that humans followed the same concept.</p>
<p>The first post which features Darwin's finches is great for illustrating this point. Each finch started from the same species, and over the course of time they were scattered across each island. Since these islands have very different environments, specifically the food material that each island produces, it would be difficult for a short beaked finch to reach fruit that would be more effectively extracted by a long beak. Eventually, mutations in the gene pool led to the longer beaked finches being able to dominate the food supply and push the short beaks of that area to extinction. Conversely, if a long beaked finch lived in an area whose fruit only needed a short beak to harvest, the long beaked would be not as fast as the short beaked in getting the most food in the shortest amount of time. Over time, this would mean the gene pool of that island will retain short beaks since hey can dominate through sheer competition.</p>
<p>One more thing. Mutations are not necessarily breakthrough events. They can happen in slow level ups or giant leaps. They have respective probabilities of happening, but the probability that any helpful mutation happens is low as fuck. It's an even lower chance for a breakthrough mutation to end up completely dominating, but what's beautiful is that throughout history this has happened plenty of times. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Plenty of different species can produce viable hybrid offspring. Inability to produce viable offspring is a sufficient condition for speciation, but not a necessary one.</p></div>		</li>
