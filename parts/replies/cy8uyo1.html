<p>From what I've learned from taking psychology. We laugh from random/unexpected stimuli and this is our way of handling it. Usually when someone tells a joke we don't usually know the outcome.</p>

<p>The explanation I heard is that a chimp might start freaking out if he thinks he sees a snake, leading the rest of the troop to GTFO and live another day. But if it turned out it wasn't actually a snake, he'd react in a way similar to laughter, signalling to the troop that it was actually a false alarm. That's why the best jokes are the ones where you never see the punchline coming - it's like the snake in the grass that turns out not to be a snake in the grass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>V.S. Ramachandran (neuroscientist) presents this idea in &quot;A Brief Tour of the Human Conciousness&quot;:</p>
<p>“The common denominator of all jokes is a path of expectation that is diverted by an unexpected twist necessitating a complete reinterpretation of all the previous facts — the punch-line…Reinterpretation alone is insufficient. The new model must be inconsequential. For example, a portly gentleman walking toward his car slips on a banana peel and falls. If he breaks his head and blood spills out, obviously you are not going to laugh. You are going to rush to the telephone and call an ambulance. But if he simply wipes off the goo from his face, looks around him, and then gets up, you start laughing. The reason is, I suggest, because now you know it’s inconsequential, no real harm has been done. I would argue that laughter is nature’s way of signaling that &quot;it’s a false alarm.&quot; Why is this useful from an evolutionary standpoint? I suggest that the rhythmic staccato sound of laughter evolved to inform our kin who share our genes; don’t waste your precious resources on this situation; it’s a false alarm. Laughter is nature’s OK signal.”

<p>Genuinely curious. Your explanation makes perfect sense but then there's moments where it seems like this doesn't apply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't actually laugh at the joke itself. Laughing is a social activity. We either &quot;laugh with&quot; others or &quot;laugh at&quot; others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I made myself sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy it that laughter is purely social. When I see something that I think is funny, I laugh. How come I'm able to do that without other people around to mimick? And in a group, somebody must initiate the laughter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to me if it was genuily funny the first time then even though you expect it, it still comes off as being funny. Why we laugh is still a mystery itself but we do know we are more likely to laugh around others and it's also quite contagious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely that there's more than one explanation.  When something already serves an evolutionary purpose, it's often easier to apply it to a new purpose than to start from scratch.  I'm paraphrasing from a book I read very long ago so this may not be entirely accurate, but according to The Happiness Hypothesis by Jonathan Haidt, similar chemical mechanisms in the brain facilitate both post-coital bonding and infant-imprinting / post-natal bonding.  Basically when one system evolved for a reason, random chance caused certain people to exercise that system in other situations, and it turned out to be advantageous. </p>
<p>It's possible the same thing happened with laughter.  Maybe it originally started out as a way to identify humans who made better use of abstract neural pathways (the most common jokes relate distinct things in easily-understood but unexpected ways) by pumping you full of endorphins whenever you encounter humor.  Maybe it later became a way to encourage tribal camaraderie and differentiate outsiders.  This is all speculation, but I think it's totally possible that laughter had different purposes throughout our evolutionary history which is why it's now the complex and ill-understood thing that we have today.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I love lamp&quot; was meant to be a separate item from Ralf Wiggum's non-sequiturs, it was left unclear because I didn't know the name of Carrell's character so couldn't indicate the person who said the line.</p>
<p>Ralf would totally be like that guy when he grows up. </p></div>		</li>
