			<div class="markdown"><p>UV images show that, at least over the wavelength range of those images, the UV is reflected by the skin much more strongly than by the sunscreen.  The assumption that the skin absorbs all the UV is false, as demonstrated by the UV images of skin with and without sunscreen, such as the one linked from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/8mtl31/if_sunscreen_absorbs_uv_light_does_that_mean_that/dzq9w94/" target="_blank">this comment</a>  </p>
<p>It is true that some sunscreens work by reflecting some of the UV, so the analysis might be complicated, but we should not start it with a known-false assumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Picture is somewhat more complicated than I originally thought. I think broadly it's fair to say your temperature is unaffected because UV makes up such a small portion of sunlight, and even if some extra is absorbed by the sunscreen some of that is radiated outwards as other wavelengths anyway. But there may be some small heating effect depending on the exact absorption coefficients. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is correct.  In the case of organic chemical based sunscreens, the absorption of EM radiation results in electronic state transitions.  As the electrons move up to higher energy states then fall back down, a longer wavelength photon is emitted than what was absorbed.  Typically this is mostly IR radiation, or heat.  So the 'waste heat' can certainly heat up your skin.  Given that UV radiation is a small % of sunlight, it will likely be a small effect, but measurable nonetheless.</p>
<p>In the case of physical sunscreen blockers such as TiO2 and ZnO this would not be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the &quot;waste heat&quot; is absorbed by your skin, leading to the same outcome as if the UV radiation had been absorbed by your skin. It is fundamentally due to the amount of energy absorbed, whatever wavelength that energy comes in. In any case, not all of this &quot;waste heat&quot; is directed towards your skin. It would have been re-radiated in all directions, including outwards. </p>
<p>The full truth of the answer depends on exactly how much UV is absorbed/reflected by your skin vs how much IR is absorbed/radiated away instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right.  Discussing the electronic state transitions is a distraction from that fundamental question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might need to Google this further but your windshield already blocks all UV, and your side glass blocks some like UVA but not UVB. Besides isn't the heat from infrared mostly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need sunscreen that was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Broadband: not just UV but also visible and IR.  </p>
</li>
<li>Reflective, rather than absorbing.</li>
</ul>
<p>A thick layer of zinc oxide sunscreen, which looks like white paint, because white paint is often also based on zinc oxide, would meet both of these criteria.  When you get back to your car, just activate the windshield washer to wash it off so you see out again.</p></div>		</li>
