			<div class="markdown"><p>For some environmental problems technological advances are an easier route. For instance, society has addressed the problem of the hole in the ozone layer using technology and without much help from the public.</p>
<p>But climate change is a different problem that requires different solutions. For instance, we have to tackle emissions from aviation and from agriculture (among many other industries) to stop dangerous planetary warming. But for these industries in particular it's not so easy to find a techno-fix. Researchers have said that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1104-5" target="_blank">&quot;reduced ruminant meat and dairy consumption will be indispensable for reaching the 2°C target with a high probability, unless unprecedented advances in technology take place&quot;</a>. </p>
<p>Air travel is also difficult to improve on. There are a lot of upcoming improvements in technology for aircraft like biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells or batteries to power aircraft, but they all have major downsides (for instance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/27/easyjet-electric-planes-wright-electric-flights" target="_blank">electric planes aren't going to cover long-haul flights</a>). Authors of one study said that <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/014016/meta" target="_blank">&quot;for meat consumption and air travel, reducing GHG intensity in order to achieve the 2°C climate target is challenging, and therefore the promotion of changing consumption patterns in these categories might be required&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>In our view these different efforts to mitigate climate change are complementary. New technologies are helpful, but so is reduced demand for products and services that have a big footprint!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer to your question is the solution must be economic.  Economics <strong><em>always</em></strong> wins.<br />
Trying to convince everyone to stop eating meat will never work, and anyone who thinks it will is deluded in the extreme.  The correct solution is to perfect lab-grown meat.  Why?  Because it has the potential to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Massively reduce our climate footprint</li>
<li>Greatly reduce production costs and increase efficiency for meats (which means higher margins)</li>
<li>Alleviate the concerns of those sympathetic to livestock</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a win-win-win, and once developed, would <strong><em>very</em></strong> quickly come to dominate the market.  All of the effort being dumped into the hilariously futile effort to curb meat consumption should be directed towards developing lab-grown meat.</p>
<p>The air-travel industry is exactly the same.  People aren't going to stop flying - end of story.  If you <strong><em>actually</em></strong> want to beat Climate Change, you need to come up with a method that actually has a chance of succeeding.  In this case, that would be coming up with a solution that either severely reduces or eliminates the carbon footprint of airplanes.  That could be bio-fuels, it could be something else.  But it must be a solution that airlines are incentivized to adopt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely agree. I find it absurd that we have to resort to education and individual government initiatives to solve this pressing problem. If we care at all of the climate and world that our children grow up in, we need to press for a carbon emissions tax. </p>
<p>That would eliminate all the man-hours spent thinking about weighing the environmental impact of individual and corporate actions, and reduce it to a simple cost minimization and profit maximization problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taxing meat and flight more would also help, and unlike the technological solutions it could be done tomorrow. It would also automatically direct more resources towards developing the technological solutions.</p></div>		</li>
