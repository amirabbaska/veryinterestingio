			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you can't tell 5yo about cache and kernel. I know what those are but I just don't really understand how it all works in context of these new exploits. People need use parables. If there is context for parable one can put two and two together. </p>
<p>That's what happened now. Great parable to explain complicated stuff like to 5yo.</p></div>		</li>
