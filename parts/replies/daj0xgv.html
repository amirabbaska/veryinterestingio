We are nowhere near the theoretical limitations of what can be done with batteries, but we aren't progressing along that tech track as fast as we are along other tracks involved with computing and portable devices, so battery technology has become a bottleneck of sorts to development, and it may be a nasty one.  We may, as other posters have suggested, be near a breakthrough with other methods/designs, but it then remains to be seen how long it will take to go from that discovery to a reliable and affordable manufacturing process.</p></div>		</li>
