			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad to hear your dad is good now. Mine just started talking about what he saw in Vietnam this past year and how it impacted him. 40 plus years he never said a word about it to anyone, it was a forbidden topic. You give me hope that he'll be able to work through it in a few years. Freaked me out when the VA psychiatrist told my mom he was surprised my dad managed to hold a job his entire adult life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister is a nurse and we were talking about witnessing trauma yesterday and I was wondering if PTSD wasn't rampant amongst EMTs. The few times that I've happened upon gruesome accidents were enough to disrupt my sleep for days or weeks. I was hoping that maybe people who choose to be EMTs had a higher tolerance for witnessing violent accidents. I guess that doesn't really make sense; trauma is traumatic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just for you, but for others with the same problem: sometimes the dreams try to help us process what has happened to us, but with high emotional things is not really an efective way. If you want, you can ask for help, in the USA I think you'll have it easy to finding it, in the end that is were the therapy EMDR was created, and is really effective. You'll stil remember things, but with less emotional impact. </p>
<p>When we try to process really hard things, our brain gets kidnaped by our emotions and we can't process well, is like having a really messy room, you can't find anything on purpose and you keep stumbling with random painful things,... </p>
<p>Talking with others can help in mild trauma, but when things are to messy, therapy can be really helpful. The things are going to stay there, for sure, they are your memories, but they are going to be more organized, with less emotional impact, and the really emotional ones can still be hard, but you'll have more control, you'll choose when to revisit them, they won't only came by surprise. </p>
<p>I hope it make sense, I'm from mobile and English not my mothertongue, but as a therapist I just have to say something: there is another way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I both liked and disliked his book.  In the end his argument kind of seemed to peter out and never really solidify, don't you think?  Like, he never <em>actually</em> explained it, he just kind of hinted at something and hopes you'll get it too because it's not all that easy to say it directly...or something.</p></div>		</li>
