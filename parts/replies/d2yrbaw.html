<p>This is of consequence when you consider the search for extra solar planets thus far only looks for star systems where the orbits of planets around their host stars are edge-on when observed from Earth. ...Meaning planets with orbits not aligned for detection are out there and an order of magnitude more numerous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we're only really able to detect planets that are aligned edge-on from Earth's perspective?  That is indeed of consequence if we aren't able to detect 9/10 of the possible planets out there that could sustain life.  Is this the only reliable method of detection or are there other options?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  I claim no expertise in this subject area.  However, the most well known methods I know about, transit and radial velocity, only works when the orbital plane of a planet allows it to block its star's light to us or the rhythmic tug it exerts on the parent star produces slight shifts in its spectra as it moves toward and away from us.  These type of signals are just not possible if the planet's orbital plane is somewhat or wholly orthogonal to our line of sight.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets" target="_blank">other methods</a> that have been conceived.  But I think we are still waiting for the technology to catch up to the point where their effectiveness approaches that of currently established achievements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watching for periodic dims of stars as their exoplanets transit those stars is one way of detecting those exoplanets.  Another is to watch for 'wobble' in the star's position as it's influenced by the gravity of one or more planets that orbit it.  This is most easily detected when you have a very large planet orbiting very close to its parent star.  <a href="http://astro.unl.edu/naap/esp/detection.html" target="_blank">Here's a good demonstration of the effect</a>.  Alternatively, you could watch for subtle red and blue shifts of the star's light as it wobbles towards and away from us as we observe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Most of the ~2100 confirmed exoplanets have been discovered via transits, but a few hundred have been observed via other methods, in particular radial velocity measurements. Planets do not orbit their star - both planet and star orbit the common center of mass, so the star moves in a small circle as well. The radial component of that motion can be detected. It is maximal if we see the system edge-on, but it does not need to be aligned like that.</p></div>		</li>
