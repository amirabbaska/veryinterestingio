			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that I’ve always wondered though - how do they account for vehicles with three axles?  Not that there are tons of them on many roads, but if you’re in Texas where everyone likes their massive trucks for example...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d imagine it’s either:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The program reading the data is set up to ignore wheels that run over it with under 0.5 seconds between them effectively counting once for each car, truck, and 18 wheeler.</p>
</li>
<li>They just count all of them and ignore the fact that some may have 3 axles as they are in the minority and it doesn’t need to be accurate.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed measures the time between the first axle hitting each tube.</p>
<p>Axle count can usually be measured by the time between 2 axles hitting the same tube.</p>
<p>Doesn't always work, but you can a) increase certainty by measuring inter-axle length on both tubes and b) filter out the ones that are still uncertain.</p>
<p>I won't go into the maths, but by analysing a large enough data set, you can get a very good idea of whats happening with the data points that you initially can't tell, so over a large enough fldata set your uncertainty increases. It will plateau after a while when you approach/reach the inherent uncertainty, but you can at least minimise unnecessary uncertainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn’t the tire diameter affect the speed info? Ie a monster truck going 30 would hit both tubes at almost the same time due to the large tire size. A moped going 55 with tiny tires might hit those tubes at approx the same interval as the monster truck, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would be more difficult on a road with more than one lane, but I don't think I've ever seen these stretched across more than a single lane at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the diameter of a wheel, say a truck wheel vs a small hatchback wheel, throw off the speed measurement? I'm only guessing here but assuming both vehicles are moving at the same speed, wouldn't the larger wheel 'reach' the second tube faster than the smaller wheel? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>The leading edge is what causes the compression and registration of the hit... the leading edge of the tire is travelling the same speed in vehicles that are travelling the same speed no matter how big the wheel is.</p>
<p>(In fact, the entire tire is travelling the same speed, of course, and the whole &quot;leading edge&quot; bit was unnecessary to mention but I felt it might help you visualize it better).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Forget about the diameter of the wheel, think about the point of contact on the ground. A vehicle moving a 28m/s has a point of contact on the ground that will move at 28m/s regardless of tyre diameter.</p></div>		</li>
