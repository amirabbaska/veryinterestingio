			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mentioned elsewhere but it's primarily a question of quantity. The amount of nuclear material in a weapon is on the order of 10s of kg. The amount of nuclear material in a reactor is on the order of metric tons.</p>
<p>The amount of material is just massively greater. You could also argue that much more of it is also part of longer-lived decay chains (U238, for example, decays over a long, long time to Radium or Radon) but really it's the amount of initial material</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the amount of nuclear material in most warheads is far higher than that. Yes, the core is only on the order of 10s of kg. This initiates the fusion reaction. The trick here, though, is that the entire thing is then jacketed in a &quot;tamper&quot; made out of either Depleted or natural Uranium. This serves two purposes, first the sheer inertia of it helps to keep the weapon assembled for a few fractions of a second longer to improve yield, and then the fast neutrons from the fusion reaction cause fission in the U238, thus amplifying the force of the explosion.</p>
<p>This is basically the Fission-&gt;Fusion-&gt;Fission cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big reason Chernobyl is still dangerous is because there is still active radioactive material.  There is large amounts of plutonium in the reactors that broke with no shielding.  Most of the surrounding area isn't dangerous, and they have even put a giant shield over the plant to contain the radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even Chernobyl is not so bad. I visited and walked around very close to the sarcophagus, the Geiger counter around most of the area didn't show much above normal city background. It's a pretty popular tourist area. </p>
<p>The problem is that there's a lot of buried material in the ground, just everywhere. If you were to try to knock down any buildings or dig up any dirt for construction you'd quickly release a ton of nasty stuff and spread it all even further.</p>
<p>You can stay in a hotel inside the exclusion zone if you really want to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IKR. People thinking cell phone and wifi is dangerous because they EMIT waves. Whenever that happens I always have to explain the elecctro magnetic spectrum in full detail like according to their knowledge how visible light is more dangerous than cellphone radiation</p></div>		</li>
