			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but this is irrelevant. When a rider is on a bike, the main thing keeping it from falling over is the rider, not the bike's inherent self-correction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not irrelevant at all. It's actually the fundamentally correct answer. The human is a controller, but it has limited sensing/actuation capabilities and limited bandwidth. We're able to do cool things like stabilize an unstable system - you can balance a yardstick on your fingertip. You can even do a pretty good job of keeping the top of the yardstick in one location if you train a lot. If we made that system <em>stable</em> (turn the yardstick upside down, so it's a stable pendulum rather than inverted), then you can do a <em>great</em> job of keeping it in one location. You don't even have to think about it!</p>
<p>As we make that yardstick more and more unstable (changing the length/mass), you'll have more difficulty keeping it in one location... and more difficult even just keeping it inverted. Eventually, your bandwidth will run out, and you simply won't be able to control it no matter what.</p>
<p>So the answer to why it is <em>easier</em> to control a bike when it is going faster is because the system you're trying to control is more stable when you're going faster. It reduces the amount of active control you have to do to keep it stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite sure about that. Which would stay upright longer: a bike at rest with a rider on it, or a vacant bike traveling at ~30 mph? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah this is the best layman's explaination, I had to have it explained to me this way to learn how to &quot;track stand&quot; which is a technique on a fixed gear bicycle that allows you to balance while standing nearly still by turning the bars slightly and making tiny forward and backward movements to keep balanced.</p></div>		</li>
