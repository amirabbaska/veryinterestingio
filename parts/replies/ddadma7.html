<p>p&lt;0.05 is a joke, especially as &quot;local&quot; significance if you have multiple ways to study your data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the standard for medical research and a great deal of biology, not just the social sciences.</p>
<p>Most people working in them realize p&lt;0.05 is piss easy to get (especially when &quot;hacking&quot; it; a form of scientific fraud by any reasonable standard), but nobody seems to have come up with a good way to make more stringent standards viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess by that standard, mathematicians shouldn't accept any results from physics unless they're backed up by formal proof.</p>
<p>(&quot;in particle physics they have very high standards for accepting a theory, why can't anthropogenic climate change reach those standards?&quot; is a frequent denialist canard)</p></div>		</li>
