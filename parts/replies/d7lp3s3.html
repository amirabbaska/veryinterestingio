			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Epigenetics can show more easily-observed effects before and shortly after birth (because of physical development), but never goes away.  Basically epigentics is the idea that your genes always switch &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; based on different experiences.  These can affect your mood, memory, all kinds of things.  As long as you have different experiences, your genes will express differently, and nothing can guarantee two people have perfectly identical experiences (even in the womb; one side of the body might be warmer, receive nutrients faster, etc).  </p>
<p>It is even the case that ordinarily some genes switch &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; from morning to night, for emphasis.  Thus gene expression is dynamic.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cloning typically aims to just copy the DNA code and not necessarily the epigenetic coding. </p>
<p>I don't believe we currently have the technology for full, intentional, epigenetic replication. In fact, this inability to fully replicate epigenetic markers is one of the many huddles that will need to be jumped to increase cloning efficency (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11498580" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11498580</a>). </p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't find a more up update reference, I'm on mobile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parents can pass on some epigenetic modifications to offspring:
For example, during the Dutch Famine in WWII = starvation, thus your genes are epigenetically modified so that you conserve energy and different enzymes are activated more (for example)
This occurred in mothers who were pregnant during the famine and they past on these specific modifications to their offspring <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/44/17046.long" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/105/44/17046.long</a></p>
<p>However, yeah I don't know if you can clone an entire epigenome...another reason why we don't fully understand implications of IVF (embryos created in petri dish are epigenetically different than embryos that only developed in uterus)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but there's also built-in homeostatic regulation of these things. Over the course of organisms lifetime, most of these variations should be averaged out. </p>
<p>If the homeostatic regulation is consistently wrong, which likely is attributable to something different on the gene level, then this is effectively a phenotype attributed to a genotype.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stochastic noise in <em>early</em> development still has a fairly notable effect though as it can be a bit like the butterfly effect. On the larger scale, yes, you are right. Just pointing out that early stochastic noise has been demonstrated to be the cause of significant variability in a cell in just a short period of time.</p></div>		</li>
