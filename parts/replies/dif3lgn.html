			<div class="markdown"><p>I felt that the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1651062/" target="_blank">Christopher and His Kind</a> did a great job showing Germany and in particular the homosexual lifestyle during the rise of nazism. Like Cabaret it was inspired by Christopher Isherwood and his novel The Berlin Stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that before the Nazis took power, the police in Germany already had extensive lists of known or suspected homosexuals because homosexual acts were still a criminal offense.</p>
<p>So the Nazis didn't start from scratch but already had lists to start with.</p>
<p>And to OP /u/ntache7: Keep in mind that the Nazi prosecution against minorities already started years before the beginning of World War II.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some police forces set up undercover units. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Genuine question. Did they hire gay/closet men to work these undercover stings? Did they go through with it? Did the Germans ever turn on the gay cops?</p></div>		</li>
