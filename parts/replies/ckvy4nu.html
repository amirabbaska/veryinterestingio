			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.gfycat.com/GrippingEmbarrassedErin" target="_blank">I did a stabilization of a mountain scene from a vimeo video a while ago</a></p>
<p>Instead of having two separate cameras, a single camera moves around the scene quickly. Because of parallax and the changing angle you get a depth perception, similar to the scenes in matrix.</p>
<p>-- <a href="http://vimeo.com/63653873" target="_blank">Orginal vimeo video by Teehan+Lax Labs</a></p>
<p>Edit: For clarification I did not shoot or was involved in the vimeo video. I took one of the scenes from the vimeo video and tried to improve the stabilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I love your enthusiasm for clouds, but I just wanted you to know that the stratus you refer to are actually cirrus clouds. You can tell by their appearance. They seem wispy and are slightly transparent, meaning they are composed of mostly ice crystals. Stratus are much thicker and are not transparent at all.</p>
<p>Edit: clarification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For this stabilization I used mocha pro and After Effects. /u/kinyutaka describes the process pretty good. I used the mountain as a reference plane in mocha and then did some manual adjustments in After Effects.</p>
<p>Notice also that I only did the stabilization not the hyperlapse itself. The description of the original video I posted above explains how the hyperlapse was done.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are programs designed to stabilize shaky video. It works by moving all the frames after the current one to line up to a single place of reference, which is chosen based on common aspects of the film, and moving on to the next frame. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For the uninitiated: You need to cross your eyes to the point where the two pictures overlap perfectly, then try to get them in focus. That way you get true 3D. It's the same effect the comic describes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why cross? It's much easier to just relax your eyes/focus on &quot;far away&quot;. But the images are in the wrong order for that, so the things closer looks further away which looks really weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's the same as for /u/Homletmoo, I can cross my eyes and focus without any problems.</p>
<p>For large resolutions the focusing &quot;far away&quot; technique doesn't work anymore because your eyes have to point further outwards than the farthest point possible would need them to, so it also needs the same effort to overcome a natural eye positioning like cross viewing.</p>
<p>Either way, you should take a look at /r/ParallelView, it's not as active as /r/CrossView but I guess there are some nice pics for you ;)</p></div>		</li>
