			<div class="markdown"><p>The truth is, for the most part they <em>need</em> that much fat to not starve.</p>
<p>Your fat cells release lipids over time.  In-between meals, that's how your cells get energy. </p>
<p>If you've eaten a lot of sugar over your life, your body's cells will start to become insulin resistant.  Insulin tells all the cells in your body to eat sugar, and all your fat cells to hold in their lipids.  This makes your body burn sugar quickly.  Which is good because high blood sugar levels will start to kill you (ie, why a diabetic person might get their foot amputated).  So your body detects sugar and releases insulin to get the levels low.</p>
<p>If your cells become desensitized to insulin, then your pancreas has to produce more insulin for the same effect.  You end up with higher resting levels of insulin, and very high levels whenever you eat.</p>
<p>And insulin, recall, is telling your fat cells to not release any lipids.</p>
<p>So if you have high resting levels of insulin (ie, between meals) then the only source of food for your cells is the now meager amount of lipid being released from your fat cells.</p>
<p>At this point you are literally <em>starving</em>. You're <em>starving at the cellular level</em>.  The way you make your fat cells release lipids at a rate that can sustain you, is to make them bigger.  Just like with muscles, getting fatter doesn't mean you have more fat cells. It means your fat cells get bigger. And bigger fat cells release lipids at a higher rate.</p>
<p>So in order to not starve in between meals, your fat cells need to be large enough to release a constant, sufficient stream of lipids. And this rate is decreased by high insulin.  So in response to high insulin, you get fatter.  It's a well regulated control system.</p>
<p>There are other reasons people get fat, but this is the general mechanism behind the upsurge in obese people in the last 30 years.  Look up 'metabolic syndrome' for more information.</p>
<p>Point is, if you take all that fat away from the person via surgery... then you're just taking away their food source.  You're just starving them.  That's not going to fix much of anything.  The way to fix it is to make their body be able to subsist on a smaller amount of fat.  To do that their fat cells need to be less greedy, and to do <em>that</em> their resting insulin levels need to be brought down.  So they need to avoid dense, processed carbohydrates as much as possible.  </p>
<p>'Being fat' isn't a symptom of having too much fat.  Being fat is a symptom of your body not being able to feed itself on a small amount of fat. You need to make your body capable of that again first.</p>
<p><strong>Edit -</strong> as a side comment, that's why the idea of <em>'calories in vs calories out'</em> is a bad, or at least naive view.  If you want to burn off fat, you do need to run a calorie deficit, yes. And exercise and portion control can help with that.  But the problem is both of those values are moving targets, and you don't have that fine of control over either one.</p>
<p>You do not automatically metabolize every calorie you take in.  Whether you do or not depends on several hormones in your body - insulin being one of them - that tell your body to store energy or not.  If this wasn't the case, there'd never be a reason to ration food. Why risk letting it spoil if you'll get the same calories eating it today or tomorrow?  Meanwhile your <em>hunger</em> indication that drives you to eat more or less, is a signal from your body.  If you're cells are getting fed, you're typically sated. If you feel like you're starving, you'll be driven to eat more.</p>
<p>Incidentally, even in healthy people, insulin will quickly drive your blood sugar levels down, but then the insulin itself won't go away for another hour or so.  So after say, a large meal with lots of carbs, like a subway sandwich and a soda, you'll start to feel hungry again an hour or two later. Even if you know you ate a lot.  Because you're currently starving a little bit. Your body feels low on energy.</p>
<p>Snacking is a self-driving cycle with this.  What do we want in a snack?  Something easy, cold, dry, and ready to eat.  Ie pretzels, chips, cookies, etc. Processed sugar.  You eat some. You're sated for an hour. You get hungry an hour later. You snack more. Repeat until next meal.  In the last 30 years, most of the extra calories people consume on average is through snacking. It represents about 20% of our daily caloric intake now. And that's partially due to the rise in availability of easy processed snacks.</p>
<p>And the more difficult factor is calories out.  If your body feels like it's starving, it will start to consume fewer calories.  You'll feel tired. Sluggish. You'll sleep more.  Remember that subway sandwich I mentioned?  Who here feels a wave of exhaustion wash over them at around 2:00pm or 3:00pm at work?  High insulin and no blood sugar left to eat. You're starving.  Your body says to take a nap.  Try having a lunch with very little bread or crackers, and a water.  See if you still feel exhausted in the afternoon meeting.</p>
<p>Likewise if you're rich in energy, you'll be more energetic.  Small things.  You'll pace around, or even just fidget more while sitting. Your body can burn hundreds of calories from fidgeting during the day.</p>
<p>So calories in is easier to control, but you still don't have fine control over it. And your body's natural signal of hunger will tell you to consume more if your have a high-sugar diet.  Calories out is difficult because your body will make you more or less active and burn or conserve the calories on its own.  You can force yourself to work out, maybe.  But your body will retaliate by making you go to sleep earlier, and be less active while sitting still.</p>
<p>When your body is starving, it will do what it needs to do to not starve. It will change your mood and behavior and desires to conserve calories, and to fatten yourself up.  We have a problem with it today, because we have access to much more dense forms of sugar than our bodies ever evolved for.  Eat as many vegetables as you want - you literally can't eat them fast enough to spike your blood sugar.  But a candy bar or breakfast cereal or bread?  Hell, some of them will spike your blood sugar faster than just <em>eating raw sugar itself</em>.  So we can drive our insulin out of whack through excessive dietary choices, and that cascades into our bodies making us fatter to survive.</p>
<p>This isn't a simple physics problem with a balancing scale.  It's a complicated, dynamic, self-regulating control system that we're screwing with and fighting with.  The best way to go about it, is to let the system do the job, and stop screwing with it so much with all this sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound like you know what you're talking about, so here's a question which may help me a bit, if you don't mind me asking. I'm a fat guy currently losing weight. And the way I do it is by doing occasional exercise (8-10 km brisk walk about 3-4 times a week) and eating very little (try to eat fewer than 2000 calories a day, which for someone as large as me, is not a lot).</p>
<p>Assuming most of my calories come from fat/protein and not carbs, what is the best way to intake those calories? What I have been doing is eating one or two meals a day, usually one. And drinking a lot of water so I don't feel as hungry in between meals. Would it be better to spread those ~1500-2000 calories throughout the day?</p>
<p>Also, is there a difference among various carbs? You mention sugar a lot, but what about things like whole grains and rice? Are those any better than, say, white bread and chips? I ask because my absolute favorite food is rice, and I'm wondering where that stands in all this.</p>
<p>I've been seeing definite losses over the past few months, but I've still got a ways to go. So any help would be much appreciated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the gist of your argument is that people who are overweight are at risk of doing bodily or psychological harm by reducing calorie consumption without eating more healthy food at the same time.  You also say that calorie restriction is too difficult to be an effective way to lose weight for most people.</p>
<p>Assuming that's right, you would expect people (diabetic and otherwise) who sharply limit their calorie intake or stop eating entirely to experience negative health outcomes. Also, you would expect to see attempts at these diets to fail at a high rate. Scientific studies show neither of those things to happen. In fact, calorie restriction, fasting, or intermittent fasting have all been shown to be <em>incredibly fucking healthy</em>. Please read what I've posted of these studies:</p>
<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-90-481-3999-6_12" target="_blank">Biological Effects of Calorie Restriction: Implications for Modification of Human Aging</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In humans, CR [calorie restriction] appears to provide protection from type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases, immunological decline with age, malignancy, hepatotoxicity, liver fibrosis and failure, sarcopenia, systemic inflammation, and DNA damage. CR also reduces fat mass, including cardiovascular disease-related visceral fat mass, enhances muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, affords neuroprotection, and according to some retrospective epidemiological human studies, extends mean and maximum lifespan. Many of these benefits can be induced by relatively brief periods of CR in flies, rodents, monkeys and humans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After [fasting] therapy, body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin, fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR [a measure of insulin resistence -- high values are bad] were all significantly reduced. Compared to baseline, HOMA-IR decreased by 33% in all patients, by 38% in patients with type 2 diabetes, and by 23% in patients without diabetes.</p>
<p>No serious side effects were observed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We now know that fasting results in ketogenesis; promotes potent changes in metabolic pathways and cellular processes such as stress resistance, lipolysis, and autophagy; and can have medical applications that, in some cases, are as effective as those of approved drugs such as the dampening of seizures and seizure-associated brain damage and the amelioration of rheumatoid arthritis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ten subjects with BMI&gt;30 were maintained for 8 weeks on a dietary regimen in which they ate ad libitum every other day, while consuming less than 20% of their normal calorie intake on the intervening days</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with the ADCR diet was high</strong>, symptoms and pulmonary function improved, and oxidative stress and inflammation declined in response to the dietary intervention. These findings demonstrate rapid and sustained beneficial effects of ADCR on the underlying disease process in subjects with asthma, suggesting a novel approach for therapeutic intervention in this disorder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't cherry-picked by the way. These were the first four studies I found while googling this. One point I'd like to make is that in none of these studies were people starving. You can restrict calories without going into a starvation state, as long as you have a supply of fat in your body. The &quot;Fasting: ...&quot; article draws very distinction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doctors are, unfortunately, not withholding secrets about how to cure obesity without risk or discomfort to the patient. There is no shortcut, given our current technology, to removing the fat using surgical techniques. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Purely anecdotal story but I believe it to be true and from practical application of the technique can testify to the results. </p>
<p>Storytime:</p>
<p>Was watching a documentary on elite sumo wrestlers in Japan. These guys are massive and could be considered morbidly obese, but did not suffer from the traditional health set backs of others in similar weight circumstances. In the documentary Doctors tested them and found out one of the reasons for this was that they didn't have much intramuscular fat or fat around there organs and most of the fat was stored under the skin as subcutaneous fat. They believed this was for two reasons. Sumos need to generate alot of power, so strength in a short period of time, having intramuscular fat slows them down so their particular type of training was not conducive to storing fat this way. Additionally, their training schedule ment that every morning they would get up and train for three hours each day on an empty stomach, after training they would eat then have a nap. Because they trained on an empty stomach this did two things. It would put there body in a state of ketosis where they would be using fat as there primary energy source and it encouraged fat to be stored subcutaneously as this type of fat is more readily burned for energy. </p>
<p>Another anecdotal story. Read up on the ice man Wim Hoff and his method. It combines breathing techniques with the cold.  Start taking cold showers and genuinely being out in the cold and feeling cold. When this happens your body burns brown fat to keep you warm. This is the fat that is stored around your organs. </p>
<p>If you do these two techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>train for power and on an empty stomach in the morning. </li>
<li>Wim Hoff method of breathing techniques combined with cold training.
You should burn most of your intramuscular fat and fat stores around the organs whilst encouraging the remaining fat to be stored subcutaneously. </li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>*Edit. Wim Hoff method is not anecdotal they tested it at a university and found it to be 100% true. Also it was doctors in the documentary so maybe that could be considered true and not purely anecdotal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, but I had read that it takes an extended amount of time training on an empty stomach to produce any benefits. So the average person might as well have something small to eat before exercise to maintain enough energy to have a good training session as well as the psychological benefit that comes from not feeling hungry to really push hard. </p></div>		</li>
