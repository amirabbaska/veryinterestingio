			<div class="markdown"><p>If you put microphones underwater 4.3 times as far apart as your ears and listen with headphones, you'll be able to localize the sound just like you can above water.  That's because your ability to determine where a sound is coming is due to the sound reaching one ear with slight delay over the other.  Since sound travels 4.3 times faster underwater, this delay is too small for your brain to figure out where the sound is coming from so it seems to come from everywhere at once.  </p>
<p>Same idea applies to vision.  The moon looks flat but if you take <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/zki3a" target="_blank">photos of the moon 1000 miles apart</a> and merge them into a stereo image, it will have stereoscopic depth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. Even if you can ignore the sound you make as a (regular) scuba diver you will hear a lot of noise.</p>
<p>Story:
I was diving in Mozambique a few years ago and I'm not sure I will ever experience anything as magnificent as when I took a freediving course there. There I was completely relaxed, almost in a trance underwater and I started to hear the humpback whales sing to each other. Still gives me goose bumps when I think about it. </p>
<p>A few days later I was on a scuba dive when my buddy was low on air so we had to surface earlier than the others. Then two humpbacks circled around us during the safety stop for at least a minute. That made the mantas that played with our air bubbles pale in comparison.
Fuck... diving in Sweden after a month in Moz is like eating dry bread after being on a restaurant with three michelin stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atually that pop-rocks noise is probably snapping shrimp.  Sure, you can absolutely hear it when a parrot fish bites off a chunk of coral and munches it, but that tends to be a bit lower in register as I recall and sounds like chewing.  The constant static sound in the background on coral reefs is probably snapping shrimp.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's interesting to think about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the sound I am thinking of.  But certainly if sperm whales were making sounds in the vicinity, you'd hear it.  Dolphins are absolutely audible, and they sound sort of like a rusty hinge and their echolocation is clicky or buzzy,  at least from my personal experience.</p></div>		</li>
