			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of continuity, in Django Unchained <a href="https://youtu.be/lUmFB-ys8gA?t=4m51s" target="_blank">Leo smashes a glass that he wasn't supposed to with his hand, leaving it bloody.</a> He didn't break character and they ended up using that take in the final cut.</p>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting. In the scene that takes place after that one, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUVgnUOcza0" target="_blank">his hand is bandaged.</a> I don't know if it was just a matter of &quot;We're done with this scene, time to film the next one&quot; or if someone was actually paying attention to those details. Either way, it's nice to have it all line up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it was because Leo's hand was still bloody and cut, so he needed to have bandages on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would mean those scenes were filmed in succession which is rarely true. </p>
<p>Possible, but unlikely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a few camera cuts in-between those moments so its reasonable that they would reshoot the facewipe part with fake blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that even if the editer notices a goof but the actor had a better performance in the take with it, they'll let it slide provided it's small enough.</p></div>		</li>
