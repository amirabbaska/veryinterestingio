			<p>“we”, of course, meaning “Americans”. Over here in Europe, most languages’ standard frog sound is “quaaak” or a variation thereof.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, that's the beauty of it: &quot;we&quot; means &quot;we of the earth&quot; (everyone, everywhere watches Hollywood movies). And you're missing the point: even though we (europeans) are accustomed to this &quot;kwaaak&quot;, we also recognize &quot;ribbit&quot; as a valid frog call even though we never heard it in nature.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Ribbit&quot; is a very common onopatopeia, which designates this very particular frog call:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Gkn9hvejY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Gkn9hvejY</a><br><br>If you pronounce it the german way, it sure doesn't sound like a frog at all...<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; If you pronounce it the german way, it sure doesn't sound like a frog at all...<br><br>It does not sound like &quot;ribbit&quot; if you pronounce it English, too. But this is true for most animal sounds put into words. It does not sound like kwak, too.<br><br>The only thing this sound and &quot;ribbit&quot; have in common is that both have to syllables.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Ribbit&quot; is the name english speakers give to that particular sound. Who cares whether it sounds like the animal or not? I was not talking about the name itself, but about the actual sound. Here is an edited sentence for your better enjoyment:<br><br>Even though we (the Hollywood-consuming population, thx /u/fattythegreat) are accustomed to the single sound of frogs, we also recognize the double sound that is in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Gkn9hvejY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Gkn9hvejY</a> as a valid frog call even though we usually don't get to hear it in nature, because we heard it in numerous movies, tv shows, cartoons and so on.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, if it's from QI, &quot;we&quot; probably means &quot;people in the UK&quot;. Which, correct me if I'm wrong, is in Europe.</p>		</li>

			<p>Technically it's in Europe.<em><br><br>(</em>) Meaning: the UK has a habit of being culturally even closer to the US than the rest of Europe. Maybe partially because of history &amp; language.</p>		</li>

			<p>While it has a large American bias, Hollywood has been the international epitome of film for many decades and these tropes have been developed on an international basis, not just an American one.<br>I struggle to believe that Germans who consume Hollywood films are shocked by the tropes as they've been consuming them for a long long time.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are cultural differences, larger than those between the US and the UK, between the Anglo countries (UK/US/Australia/New Zealand/Canada) and other western countries. People joke about it and exaggerated it, but the UK is culturally different. Language barriers contribute.<br><br>Nobody is shocked by the tropes, but they mean different things to different audiences. Something like 'ribbit' everyone knows means frogs, but that doesn't mean their languages reflect that.<br><br>QI was commenting on the UK, which is part of Europe, but doesn't reflect <em>all</em> of Europe because whatever the UK might like to think they are only one part of Europe. Just because the UK does something doesn't make it inherently &quot;European&quot;. The UK have a different work culture to other western and northern European countries, so it would be stupid to point at the UK and say &quot;they are in Europe, the British way of doing things epitomises Europe&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>I completely agree with you, except for your evaluation of this thread.<br>No one claimed that the UK represents all of Europe. Rather, andres92 wanted to retort Dimwi's critique of WongoTheSane.<br>I'd say WongoTheSane's &quot;we&quot; is &quot;the entire Hollywood-consuming population&quot; and while all these cultural differences are important, hardly anyone actually hears frogs say ribbit aside from people actually in Hollywood</p>		</li>

			<p>You forget that &quot;quak&quot; was established way before movies were a thing (as was &quot;moo&quot;) and that movies in Germany are in German. Even the Hollywood ones, they rarely show the movies with original sound. So I can tell you, as a German, that &quot;ribbit&quot; is definitely not how a German would describe the sound a frog makes.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wait, in Germany, for a German-dubbed Hollywood film, would the sound effect for a frog be different?</p>		</li>

			<p>It would obviously make its sound in German, otherwise how would they know what it was saying. They just get a German frog to dub over the lines, so it would be das ribbit</p>		</li>

			<p>Fwiw: I have recorded frogs in Thailand that were making sounds like &quot;moo&quot;, a bit like cows or chanting monks. (Being European myself, I was indeed expecting some variant of &quot;quaak&quot;, and so was rather surprised at this.)</p>		</li>
