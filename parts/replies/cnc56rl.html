<p>found in, you guessed it, Hollywood hills </p>

<p>So, I moved to California when I was about 20 (I grew up in New York). And one of the things I just could not get over when I first got here was the wildlife. There are so many cartoon birds here! <em>And</em>, a lot of them 'really make that noise.' Which is fkn disconcerting. A red-tailed hawk lives near me (I guess) and <em>dude. It really makes that noise!</em> That high-plains-desolation noise. There are woodpeckers here (and they make that noise). Pelicans, just, hanging out at the beach (they really look that doofy). You go to the desert, and boom: roadrunners. Tumbleweeds. Friggin hawks. At one point I actually thought, '<em>ohhhh,</em> this is why old Warner Brothers cartoons looked like that: they were made in California.' </p>
<p>I dunno, I'm pretty well traveled, but somehow I wasn't prepared for any of that. So weird to go to a place you've never been and recognize stuff so deeply. Like, every time my hawk goes off, my body doesn't even know how to react. I'll be getting my mail and it's like TWEE^(caww)^^(ww…) and then suddenly I feel vaguely lonely and super thirsty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's the beauty of it: &quot;we&quot; means &quot;we of the earth&quot; (everyone, everywhere watches Hollywood movies). And you're missing the point: even though we (europeans) are accustomed to this &quot;kwaaak&quot;, we also recognize &quot;ribbit&quot; as a valid frog call even though we never heard it in nature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(*) Meaning: the UK has a habit of being culturally even closer to the US than the rest of Europe. Maybe partially because of history &amp; language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fwiw: I have recorded frogs in Thailand that were making sounds like &quot;moo&quot;, a bit like cows or chanting monks. (Being European myself, I was indeed expecting some variant of &quot;quaak&quot;, and so was rather surprised at this.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a variety of tree frog in Hawaii (imported, not native) called coquí because thats the sound they make. My husband calls them Bo-Peep frogs because thats (to him) the sound they make. Deafening little things, when several thousand are screaming from nearby the trees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the differing reactions to the coquí are fascinating. In their native Puerto Rico, they're beloved national symbols. But as far as I know, they're an invasive species in Hawaii and people HATE them.</p></div>		</li>
