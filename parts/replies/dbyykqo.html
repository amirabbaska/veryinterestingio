			<div class="markdown"><p>Green may be the color of the glass, but the amount of people commenting about how that is what causes the green affect is astonishing because they're all wrong. Mirrors reflect green because mirrors reflect the light with a certain wavelength better, and that wavelength is green. This is explained in the <a href="https://youtu.be/-yrZpTHBEss" target="_blank">Vsauce video linked higher up.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The irony!</p>
<p>It reflects the green wavelength better because of the float glass!</p>
<p>The mirror backing itself is aluminium in most cases and thus light grey. If you used a clear glass (not that you can get perfectly clear glass, but you can at least get glass that doesn't favour absorption of any particular part of the visible light spectrum), the mirror tunnel would get darker, but not greener.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Might also make the green effect even slightly greener to us humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that the colour of the glass though? With every pass through each mirror, more and more light except green gets absorbed, and therefore you get the greening effect.</p></div>		</li>
