			<div class="markdown"><p>The lengths of the day also change over time. Earth's days used to be shorter, about 22 hours long 650 million years ago for example. The Moon is chiefly responsible, with its gravity acting as a drag on our spin, but internal redistribution of mass can affect the day length.</p>
<p>I'm unsure if Mars' day length is changing and if so in what direction, I can't find anything on the subject. So it's possible that one day the day lengths will be exactly the same for a period of time depending on the direction of change and the rate of change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Day lengths are always changing for all satellites, specifically slowing. Orbiting planets always want to tidal lock with whatever they're orbiting. This means that only one side ever faces what it's orbiting. The moon, for example, is tidally locked with the Earth. Eventually the Earth and Mars will both be tidally locked with the Sun. Mercury is near tidal lock with the Sun already. Where the Earth rotates about 365 times per revolution, Mercury only rotates 1.5 times.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>But orbiting bodies with uniform distributions of mass are exempt, right? At least if they're completely solid?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there good example of bodies that are currently rotating too <em>slowly</em> to be tidally locked? And do these objects have their rotations speed up to achieve tidal locking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is independent of the units, the lengths of a day differ by just 3%. With 4 rocky planets, it is not too exotic, but it is still a coincidence.</p></div>		</li>
