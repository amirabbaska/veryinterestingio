<p>Eric Cantor was in a VA gerrymandered district that always went republican. He was the House Majority Leader at the time yet still lost in the primary. </p></div>		</li>

I think 8 years for a House member seems reasonable, but I teeter back and forth between 1 or 2 terms for a Senator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a huge fan of this. Being a good representative or senator is a difficult job. You have to have a broad base of knowledge, be a reasonable negotiator, understand the machinery of Washington, be familiar with all the other representatives and senators, etc. </p>
<p>I don't think we should be kicking out the people who have demonstrated that they're good at the job of legislative government. John McCain is a good example: if there had been a 1 or 2 term limit for senate seats, basically none of McCain's signature achievements would've been enacted. He's one of the best at working across the aisle, and it still took like 10 years to get McCain-Feingold passed.</p>
<p>It's maybe also worth mentioning that the founders considered this idea, but ultimately rejected it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the founders rejected this because they never imagined that Congress would be passing the kind of bills they pass now. The founders essentially only wanted a central government that would defend the country in case of attack (not go around supporting regime change in states on the other side of the globe) and provide minimal oversight on interstate commerce. They didn't want some idiots in Massachusetts seizing goods shipped from Georgia that were bought and paid for by someone in New Hampshire. That's what the central government's responsibility is according to the constitution. Many people today don't understand the beauty of federalism. If Bernie Sanders wants a socialist paradise, Vermont can choose that for themselves. That shouldn't be forced on the other states. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Term limits have a bunch of unhappy consequences. If you're a new Member of Congress, no matter how savvy you are, you'll need someone to show you the ropes and pass on institutional knowledge. When there's a constant churn of seasoned politicians, that institutional knowledge is instead kept by lobbyists &amp; unelected staffers. </p>
<p>Basically, it can have a &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot; effect-- yeah, some shitty politicians will get kicked out, but so will smart, effective legislators (whose successors are practically guaranteed to not be as productive, at least in the beginning).</p>
<p>In theory, we have term limits that kick out ineffective, obstinate politicians-- they're called elections. We should focus on fixing some of the flaws with that system (voter turnout issues, information bias, etc.) rather than imposing term limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see working in the legislature as a service one does for his fellow citizens, to the point where anyone who actually <em>wants</em> the job probably shouldn't have it.<br />
Ideally, I'd have it be seen as a 'someone's gotta do it, and we can trust this guy to make good decisions for us'.<br />
They don't just go away when they leave government. They stick around, able to comment and advise their successors, or seek other elected positions. But the longer an individual keeps the same job, I feel the more likely they are to succumb to donor pressure instead of actually representing their constituency.  </p>
<p>And what about the courts? Lifetime appointments for judges seem entirely too long to me </p></div>		</li>
