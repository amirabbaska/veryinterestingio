			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more efficient but that is not necessary relevant for speed.</p>
<p>For speed you need to power. Four legs give more power that can be used to accelerate.</p>
<p>Efficiency is needed for endurance. We are one of the fastest animals on a long distance where it is endurance and efficiency that you need not top speed.</p></div>		</li>
