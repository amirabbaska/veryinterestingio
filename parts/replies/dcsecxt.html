			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh I used to think that was just clumsy manufacturers. Fairly enough, this only seems to happen with more flimsy bottles, since I guess it is related with the squeezing necessary to grip to the bottle while opening it. When I get bottles made with a thicker plastic, they never spill.</p></div>		</li>

In fact now water bottles are often nitrogen dosed because the bottles are so flimsy so that they can make it into the packaging of cases. </p></div>		</li>
