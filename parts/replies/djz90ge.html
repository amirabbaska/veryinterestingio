<p>Wasn't it the <em>absence</em> of certain decomposers for a long time which led to terrestrial organic deposits being buried without being broken down, and eventually transformed into coal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. As the previous commenter suggested, fungi had not yet evolved the ability to consume lignin and cellulose.</p>
<p>Trees just stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p>This combined with the extraordinary levels of OÂ² made for an environment that would have been ripe for CONTINENT WIDE forest fires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comedy show futurama did a holiday short sketch about this where pine trees are genetically mutated to rapidly grow and cover the whole planet, creating a massive 0^^2 concentration. Then the whole planet burns down. It's quite interesting that in theory something similar could have happened in real life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had referenced the link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_forest" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_forest</a> for that. From what I gather, the massive deposits arose from 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A large initial surplus of dead, undecayed trees. This could potentially burn to produce charcoal as Fitzydog says, but being rainforests, I don't think the conditions are right.</li>
<li>The massive scale of the rainforests which will produce lots of dead trees</li>
<li>Decomposers (coming slightly later) to break this down to simple carbons, which forms peat that is compressed into coal</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think those requirements are a little muddled in terms of what happens to the trees and I'm not sure where the decomposer narrative is coming from. Peat formation relies on the preservation or at least incomplete breakdown of carbon compounds in the organic material before burial. </p>
<p>Aside from the huge swathes of forest across Carboniferous landmasses, the other factor in creating such significant coal deposits was the absence of wood eating bacteria, specifically anything that could break down lignin or suberin. Bacteria with the relevant enzymes did not appear until right at the end of the Carboniferous period, so there was a good 60 million years of great initial conditions for coal formation. </p>
<p>Coal deposits have formed before and since the Carboniferous, although it has never been such a global phenomenon. Despite this, significant coal deposits were formed in the Jurassic and especially Cretaceous, the latter creating what is now the Northern Alaska-Slope Coal Province with billions of tonnes of low-ash, low-sulfur coal. </p>
<p>This represents an extremely effective carbon sequestering system despite the presence of decomposers, due chiefly to the fact that the Cretaceous saw extensive forests in polar regions. Virtually wholesale deciduousness or winter die-back of vegetation, coupled with winter temperatures low enough to limit decay (no sunlight for weeks on end), high precipitation and delta sediment compaction all led to preservation of large amounts of terrestrial organic matter. </p>
<p>I know I've gone on a bit, I'm just trying to stress the importance of preservation rather than decay in the coal forming process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's a question: how did the decomposers evolve? If there was such a major gap between the development of lignin and the development of the ability for organisms to break it down, why did this ever even occur? What caused this major shift in the ecosystem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were already various decomposers which were adapted to break down the simply constructed &quot;early&quot; plants. Lignin, however, is an extremely complicated polymer that is extensively cross-linked, so for quite a while decomposers just couldn't break it down. Compare <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Lignin_structure.svg/1024px-Lignin_structure.svg.png" target="_blank">lignin</a> with the more linear <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Cellulose_Sessel.svg/385px-Cellulose_Sessel.svg.png" target="_blank">cellulose</a>, which was more dominant before then. Very few lineages of fungi managed to evolve the complex enzymatic machinery needed to tear apart lignin; once they appeared, we see a rather sensible decrease in coal production <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6089/1715" target="_blank">[1]</a>.</p></div>		</li>
