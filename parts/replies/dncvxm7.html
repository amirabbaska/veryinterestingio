			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the OP...I get what you're saying. But it is just so damn frustrating to watch someone die of something and be helpless to get them into one of the drug trials. And logically, I get why they may not have been identified for such a trial, if 1 were going on...they need specific patients...and some of them would be taking placebo anyway...</p>
<p>But it sucks to watch someone die from cancer while all around me I keep seeing reports of new discoveries...but they seem out of reach to the people who need them the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a misconception for oncology trials.  There is no placebo.  'Placebo' would be the 'standard of care'.  </p>
<p>Clinical trials are pretty damn accessible if you live near major hospitals.  <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</a> and then search your particular situation.</p>
<p>As to the new discovery part, those are simply nowhere near a clinical trial yet.  But at least you'll get access to trials covering discoveries you read about 7 years ago.</p></div>		</li>
