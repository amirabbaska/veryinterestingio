			<div class="markdown"><p>One small nit to pick. The cells don't turn into fat on the outer surface. The cells that make up the epidermis (keratinocytes) are rich in a waxy substance called keratin. When the cells die at the outer surface, the leftover keratin forms a barrier (stratum corneum) that keeps water in or out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one part of it, I was referring to the lamellar bodies. There are a lot of lipids there. Although they are secreted as well as being in the lamellar bodies. The Stratum corneum is actually outside the tight junctions, so it's not really the waterproof barrier. </p>
<p>One nice way to think of it is to see the keratinised layer as a framework for the lipids, <a href="http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v121/n2/full/5601872a.html" target="_blank">here</a> is a nice review on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right you are! That will teach me to argue with a biochemist...</p>
<p>I guess I was mostly objecting to use of the term fat because it doesn't make sense in a histopathologic context. Calling them lipids makes way more sense to me. From a biochemical standpoint, what is the difference between fat and lipid?</p></div>		</li>
