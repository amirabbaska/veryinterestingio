			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the easy to read and informative response. This is sort of a side question not totally related to my post, but as someone who has only taken concerta/Ritalin as a treatment for ADHD, I'm interested in knowing the differences between the aforementioned meds and Adderrall. Not so much the chemical difference but whether there are any notable differences in how you feel/perform on them, different side effects and what may warrant you prescribing one versus another to someone who has ADHD. Appreciate your time </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know anything about the chemical differences, but as a person who's tried both, Adderall lasted way longer, gave me a great high and made me generally feel like I could do whatever I wanted to set my mind to. While the high didn't last for more than maybe 6 hours, I was able to maintain my mindset of working on a task to completion for maybe an extra day or so. Ritalin was like a short burst of energy and a great high but then the comedown was terrible for me. I think because the high was so short it always had me craving for another one to keep the high going. Also exaggerated my tics, made my nose feel stuffy and made me feel depressed after it wore off. </p>
<p>Also just wondering, are you currently high on Ritalin/Adderall right now? I remember also going through a phase while being high on it just trying to learn more about the drug and how it causes the high haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I am currently on Concerta XR 36mg x2 usually take it in the mornings whenever I have to do productive things during the day, such as work or study. If I don't have to do one of those two things I usually don't like to take it. I was diagnosed at 15yo, but started taking it a year ago when I was 18yo and found that while it did assist me tremendously with being productive and staying on task with things, that I didn't really like how it affected me in social situations i.e &quot;kicking it with the boys&quot;. In that regard I found that I wasn't quite who I usually am, less spontaneous (impulsive), my sense of humour died and generally just found it difficult to kick back and relax. </p>
<p>Lets put it this way, if I didn't have methylphenidate coursing through my veins right now, a post about a thought about a conversation that I had with my GP 10 days ago about the effects of my medication would not be on reddit right now. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the other side of this question is how it affects those who don't get high. Adderall is a downer for me mentally, but does raise my pulse. I almost feel depressed on Adderall, and it used to make me want to sleep for 15 hours every day. It raising my pulse is a relatively recent development, it used to lower it when I was younger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going off old memories from about 9 years ago when I was diagnosed ADD, and me starting to get back onto it today at the age of 21. I feel like I am responding much better to it this time at 20mg 2x a day than I did when I was younger with the 20mg time release that's maybe do the the fact my mom insisted on having me under dosed or that my biology changed somewhat. Before I would skip days, because I hated the side effects of the drug, and felt like it didn't help at all (but in retrospect those were actually of the best years of school for me performance wise.), but now I have had one of the most relaxing days of my life using Adderall! I actually sat down and talked to my mom for hours without getting frustrated or angry, I actually planned something out in detail and actually drew it out (I couldn't stand drawing! I would mess-up and get angry, and frustrated.), and I found myself stuttering way less today and I was more able to express myself because of it. I also didn't feel the desire to be on my computer as much as I am usually to satisfy the ball of anxiety and frustration inside me demanding that I needed to be taking in information, or playing a game.</p>
<p>Of course this is only the first day, so I may have the effects drastically change over the course of the coming months. I had a few side effects I wasn't a big fan of, Jittering, tangling in my limbs, and the spin down as the drug wears off, which I found can be somewhat tuned down if you drink a soda or something. I am greatly hoping that the other days are like today, because it made me realize how much this thing I just treated as an oddball portion of me has negatively affected my quality of life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add as an anecdote. My husband (who has not been diagnosed with ADHD nor has the symptoms) told his colleagues at work that he wanted to spend the weekend cleaning his house but also was worried that he might get distracted and not get it done.</p>
<p>One of his colleagues gave him an Adderal and told him it would help. I asked him later if he thought it helped. The way he described it was &quot;super-focused but inefficient.&quot; He took about 45 minutes detailing the spice rack and spice bottles in the kitchen before snapping out of it and telling himself he'll never finish the house at that rate.</p>
<p>So, if I can just take that example, I can imagine that drugs that help ADHD help people &quot;zoom in&quot; on things that they normally wouldn't &quot;zoom in&quot; on (or focus on). So, if a &quot;normal&quot; person were to take the drugs, it probably would make them super-concentrate on things that don't necessarily need concentrating on (like cleaning a spice rack for 45 minutes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also anecdotal as I'm not a doctor but I do have ADHD and take Ritalin for it, and this makes sense with my experience. Generally it helps me &quot;zoom in&quot;  on tasks that otherwise I wouldn't be able to. However, if I take it at work and then go check my email, I risk spending the next 30 minutes deleting old emails and cleaning up my inbox. It helps you maintain focus, but isn't able to point you in the right direction of what to focus ON.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD (was diagnosed as a child) and I had to stop taking it as a teenager for the exact reasons your husband described. Specifically, when I started driving, I got so hyper-focused that it was actually dangerous. I'd be all into the person driving in front of me; &quot;Oh, hey that's a nice car,&quot; &quot;Nice hairstyle,&quot; &quot;Wonder where they're going?&quot; and so on. And I'd completely not notice the red light up ahead or that my light turned green, whatever. I would get home and have no recollection of how I got there. It got to be pretty scary and I weaned myself off. </p>
<p>I'd also do school work and start writing a paper, for example, and I'd have all of this brilliant spark of inspiration and the paper would be absolute crap because it was written in such a dry, super exact manner.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say that I don't &quot;zoom in&quot; now on certain tasks, but I feel a lot more comfortable doing it to myself versus letting a medication do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is I consider what your husband does a normal day for me and my dad who both have adhd.

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has been diagnosed with adult ADD, I always tell people Adderall is like the adage, &quot;you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink&quot;. Adderall will take me to the water but what I do while I'm there is where the therapy portion for ADD comes in. Without the tools they teach you to pull in your focus, god knows what I'd get up to after I take my ADD meds. Get distracted by the way my nails look? The next 3 hours are now devoted to perfecting them.  See an email about a sale? Time to outfit my whole family. Adderall aims the laser beam of your mind but you have to provide the focus. This was the hardest thing to explain to people who think ADD meds will solve all their problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another aspect of ADHD not many people know about is hyper focus. Even without the Adderall, if something fully captures the attention of someone with ADHD, they will ignore everything else until their attention wanes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how many times I would take adderall to do something like clean or study and I would end up playing video games  or something else because fun things are more fun when on amphetamines. So I certainly agree with what you're saying. It still takes discipline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD. I never liked the &quot;amped&quot; feeling of stimulants. I take modafinil and it's changed my life. It keeps me focused and smooth without telling jittery. Also, I fall asleep very easily, in fact too easily. I've had multiple incidents regarding falling asleep while driving. Modafinil, a drug originally made for narcoleptics, keeps me awake. </p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this drug and it's use for ADHD treatment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever tried to pair your ADD meds with the amino acid 'L-THEININE'? It works very well in conjunction with caffeine to reduce the &quot;amp&quot; you mention but I haven't been able to test it properly due to an underlying issue which skewed my results while I had the prescription. It is about $5 on Wal-Mart website for 100mg capsules and is extracted from green tea as a &quot;calming&quot; supplement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD by my Psychotherapist just over a year ago. I'm on Vyvanse 70mg and Lexapro 10mg, and the difference is night and day. If you consciously eat right and drink water all day, there's minimal negative side effects. I mean prep and force myself to eat 3x a day, even if I'm not all that hungry. Vitamin deficiency is no joke, so just be smart about what you eat and how much amphetamines are flowing through your bloodstream. </p></div>		</li>
