			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not to defend athletics:</p>
<p>In this comment chain there is a lot of anecdotal evidence from people about their own city/school. What most people fail to realize about school budgets is that schools that are given local/state/federal funding must follow specific laws about how that money is spent. </p>
<p>If a school passes a major bond for $100 million dollars, that money isn't just a grant to the school to spend however they want. Money allocated for facilities (buildings, gyms, stadiums) can't be used to pay for things like teacher salaries, supplies, other clubs, etc. and vice versa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is, it essentially will be used that way. </p>
<p>The money will always be shuffled around. </p>
<p>Let's say for example they get a $2m grant to improve the school's buildings. But that school already had a $2m budget to improve their buildings. So you're thinking great, now they have $4m to make an even better building. Right? Wrong. The new budget to improve the building is now $0 because they got a $2m grant. That $2m originally budgeted will go somewhere else. They will now use that $2m grant to improve the building and not touch a penny of the original budget money to improve the building. End result, grant money paid for something not intended. </p>
<p>This is not even getting into remotely serious corruption either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago our school district put a bond to the voters to pay for school upgrades.  Never mind you go to the school and can't really see what the problem is.  But if you look at the financials you really see that teacher pension costs are rising rapidly.  That must be the culprit, but good luck passing a bond for that.  But it didn't matter, voters rejected the proposal 2:1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The number of people on here talking about sports and finances is crazy. OP is talking about high schools, correct? How did college football get wrapped into this?</p>
<p>Very few, and id say almost zero public schools invest in their sports programs because they think they will generate money. Source: I manage state and federal funds as they apply to district budgets, particularly afterschool programs.</p>
<p>Sports are an easy way of building a sense of accomplishment and community throughout the district and the families / students. It was also mentioned by someone else, but having sports programs A.) Keeps kids out of trouble by giving them something to do after school and B.) Encourages academic achievement, usually by requiring players to maintain a certain gpa.</p>
<p>Arts and music are important, but sports programs cost more to run (stadium, transportation for competition, coaching, equipment, etc) and generally attract more student participation. Also, in case you hadn't heard, the US has a severe obesity problem, increasingly amongst youth. Investing in school athletics may not make sense if you dont have much interest in sports, but its worth the investment. School Boards, which have enormous say in district spending, are usually comprised of parents and community leaders. Spending on sports is never controversial, and anyone that thinks it comes at the cost of other programs doesnt understand how the different funding streams that support a school work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Donations are a huge part of the focus on sports, especially in the south with things like Football.</p>
<p>Someone with a lot of money will pay a lot to their old local high school to get them a new stadium because that is personally what they care about.</p>
<p>Wealthy alumni can go and watch the sports or even be honored by them in some way which feeds back to themselves in some ways. Buying a bunch of books however doesn't do much for them personally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck look at the name of the stadiums.  Texas' memorial stadium as more letters in It's acronym than most federal agencies'.</p>
<p>Our stadium is still Kyle Field, but every bit of the stands is sold and named after boosters.  My HS stadium was the same.  </p>
<p>The reverse applies for academics as well though.  You donate for a new library, it is named after you.  Do throw 7+ digits at the liberal arts school, it gets named after you.  This goes for private and public institutions</p>
<p>For the OP though, look at LSU.  If it wasn't for the football program, the university would have had to go bankrupt the last two years.  They borrowed from the football team/athletic department to float the costs and keep the doors open.  This is at the flagship school in the state, it's not an academic powerhouse, but it is where a vast majority of Louisianans' wish to go.  They don't have attendance problems, but the tuition is pretty low, in respect to most state institutions.</p>
<p>Sports im the US at HS and College level are important for two major reasons, revenue and exposure.  College sports is a trillion dollar industry, and in Texas, HS sports are a billion dollar industry.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely will name academic things after you, but there is more kickback for athletics donations and that is what gets significantly more outside funding.</p></div>		</li>
