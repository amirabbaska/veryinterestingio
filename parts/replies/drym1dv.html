Obviously, not all elements are in equal abundance; For instance gold (Au) is much less abundant on Earth than Oxygen (O), Silicon (Si), Iron (Fe), or Magnesium (Mg). Like Karbon was saying, these elements arrange themselves from the core to the crust based on their densities, but density doesn't really describe whats going on.</p>
<p>Now hold onto yer' butts. (Sorry if this isn't worded very eloquently).</p>
<p>To understand why minerals tend to form together, it's also important to understand the variables that define the formation of their solid, crystalline structure. Pressure (P), temperature (T), atomic composition, pH, and Eh all contribute to the formation of a mineral.
For example, if a high temperature iron and magnesium rich lava cools outside of a Hawaiian volcano, it likely will form minerals such as Olivine or pyroxene. These two minerals are very stable in the high p-t environments that a magma, or the mantle provide. Because P, T, and composition should be relatively the same around the small area of a Hawaiian island, the entire locality will generally have the same minerals in a local spot.</p>
<p>Look up &quot;andalusite, kyanite, sillimanite phase diagram&quot; if you are still interested (its the same idea, just with different minerals).</p>
<p>Now imagine that time moves foreword a few thousand years. By processes of weathering like rain, wind, and biological weathering, the minerals within the original lava will begin to break down. Olivine and pyroxene will not have been exposed to the high pressure-temp. environments they preferred in the lava, and eventually begin to erode away.
Say that one side of the island is more exposed to human-made CO2, and this makes rain on one side more acidic (lower pH) than on the other side of the island.
The lower pH will break down minerals like olivine on one side if the island, but not the other. The broken down minerals will have their elements washed away, which may re-organize themselves into a different mineral (like calcite) given the right conditions. Now if you looked at the island, you would see a lot of calcite on one side, and a lot of olivine on the other.</p>
<p>In short, where minerals are can tell you A LOT about where they came from, the history of the land, pollutants, the weather, etc...</p>
<p>Gold is a bit of a different story. If you are talking about veins, those usually form from tectonic processes that cause voids or slight cracks deep within the Earth to slightly open up. Geothermal fluid (usually a silica-rich fluid) will flow through these cracks, accumulating minute amounts of gold, silver and sulfides along the way. Eventually, the fluid becomes very rich with gold and cools due to a lack of geothermal heat - then voilá! You have a gold vein!</p>
<p>Hope this helps! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just densities but melting/cooling temperatures as well. From a primary melt which is high in Fe and Mg first olivine will form, then as it continues to cool next will be pyroxenes then amphiboles, biotite, orthoclase, etc. There is a very predictable order they form both based off temperature which causes depletion certain elements from the melt. If the temp stays high enough long enough all the ultramafic minerals will form depleting the melt of Mg, but if it cools first then some Mg will be residual in the mafics. </p>
<p>Now if the amphibolite phase remelts it may produce a tiny bit of olivine but since it is relatively depleted in Mg a lot smaller proportion of the product will be olivine compared to the original melt. Repeat this process hundreds of times and the composition of the rocks migrate toward felsic compositions by default. Granites (quartz and feldspars plus all kinds of random residuals) are so common as a crustal rock since they are the residual materials that don’t make it into the first crystallized minerals. Peridotite (dominantly olivine with some pyroxenes) on the other hand is quite rare since any remelting process it experienced essentially naturally refined it increasing its purity but decreasing its volume with every remelt.</p>
<p>The basics of this process is known as the Bowen’s Reaction Series.</p></div>		</li>
