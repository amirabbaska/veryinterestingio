			<div class="markdown"><p>This is when you need to do your due diligence and search tech sites to know what VPNs flush the data very often from those who don't do it often enough. </p>
<p>In a way, they need some form of tracking to avoid being flooded by bots and viruses. On the other hand, keeping IP numbers could put you at risk. </p>
<p>Like at the restaurant. You want the receipt showing you did pull the money to pay a tab. But this also means the bank has to know you spent money there. No one wants a statement bill with just money being pulled but no names on who got what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting though that even with a VPN your ISP can still figure out some rather key things. Even if it's a &quot;Secret VPN&quot; and it's not publicly advertised as a VPN.</p>
<p>They can for instance use analytics on the amount of traffic you (and others) are sending to this &quot;Mystery IP&quot; and reasonably conclude that it's being used as a VPN.</p>
<p>If Net Neutrality gets killed, then your ISP could do a number of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>They could block access to VPNs that they deem &quot;shady&quot; (whatever shady means. This might just be all VPNs in their mind)</li>
<li>They could throttle access to VPNs they don't want you using.</li>
<li>They could charge you for the privilege to use a VPN that they approve of.</li>
</ol>
<p>And here's the kicker on all this. They could say to the VPN, &quot;You won't go on our trusted VPN list unless you are willing to provide us with X, Y, Z logs or credentials&quot;. Effectively making any VPN that is a &quot;trusted&quot; VPN completely useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VPNs aren't some mythical beast that require you to be a level 90 SysAdmin to tackle. Anyone who can follow step by step instructions in a linux terminal can have their very own reliable VPN at AWS or Google or rackspace or digital ocean or azure or [insert your favorite hosting provider here] for about $5/month with no tracking, or limited tracking. Hosting providers are most interested in how much bandwidth you use, not where you are using it. Though, they may step in if you're trying to do nefarious things. General traffic should be good.</p>
<p>If you are looking to do this for yourself, try to find hosting close to you. Latency starts to really hurt if you're in Colorado and your VPN is in Oregon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually answered this exact question a while ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/63ffej/eli5_pornhub_and_youporn_have_both_pledged_to_use/dftr8pm/" target="_blank">here</a>, I'll reproduce it below. TLDR; if the connection is HTTPS they likely know the domain name you connected to, but not the full URL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you go to a website, your computer first asks your DNS server (likely ran by your ISP) to translate the domain name into an IP address, eg pornhub.com to 31.192.120.36. Your computer then connects to the server at that IP address, and asks that computer &quot;Send me pornhub.com/kinkyvideo&quot;.</p>
<p>You never asked your ISP for the URL. You asked your DNS server (again, likely ran by your ISP unless you changed it) to translate the domain name to an IP address, then all of the rest of the communication was between you and the pornhub server, your ISP isn't involved past being the carrier of the data.</p>
<p>Now, if your connection is not encrypted, anyone between you an the remote server (such as your ISP) can see the contents of your communications. They can see &quot;oh hey, clevertoucan just requested pornhub.com/kinkyvideo'. However, if the connection is encrypted, all that your ISP knows is &quot;clevertoucan just looked up the address for pornhub.com, then there was a stream of encrypted communication between the them.&quot; They have no knowledge of what is within that communication, including no knowledge of the specific URLs you visited.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot something crucial.  Even if the ISP couldn't see the DNS request all secure servers use something called SNI.  Which means the first letter* you send to the server contains the website's name right there in clear text.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where cross-referencing (&quot;big data&quot;) gets interesting. If your same ISP account also accesses etcy and pintrest, we can infer that you have a wife/gf, and you probably only visit pornhub when she's not around (we also infer you're a guy).</p>
<p>Often WHEN is actually more interesting than WHAT. By comparing when your account visits pintrest vs pornhub over a few months, we can map out schedules for both of you. Then we only show makeup ads when she's likely to be viewing, only bother with Call of Duty ads when you're likely watching, and toss in some Kay Jeweler ads if both of you are home.</p>
<p>A better example would be visiting LendingTree or Quicken Loans, which strongly suggests you're looking for a mortgage. Visiting both Sprint and Verizon on the same day would suggest you're looking for a new phone plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something IMPORTANT often overlooked:</p>
<p>By the fact that the postman is carrying all your packages, he can also observe their weight, their shape, the frequency with which you send them, if you get any reply, how quickly you provide replies, who is the sender and recipient, and who else you write to in relation to when your packages are sent or received.</p>
<p>There's a good chance a smart postman can accurately guess what you are doing. He won't be able to see your credit card number in an envelope, but he'll be able to guess that you are applying for a loan by the precise weight and amount of papers you are exchanging with your bank. And if you are exchanging letters and packages with a realtor at the same time, or a title company, he'll be able to guess you are likely buying a house.
By correlating addresses, if you are contacting inspectors or other agencies, he may even be able to narrow down where your perspective house is - and surely know who to ask to.</p>
<p>HTTPs (and TLS) do very little to hide those details, and it is often possible for someone observing all your traffic to guess what you are doing online, down to the exact URL visited, even when encryption is used.</p>
<p>This is something generally believed to be hard to do, or within the reach of state actors only. I believe this is not the case anymore today. A few months ago, I put together a working proof of concept within a few days of work, with reasonable accuracy. You can read about it <a href="http://rabexc.org/posts/guessing-tls-pages" target="_blank">here</a>, where I also explain which &quot;information is visible to the postman&quot;, exactly, and how it can be used.</p>
<p>(Tl;Dr: crawl pages ahead of time - or as a reaction to observed traffic - to build a &quot;network of fingerprints&quot;, match &quot;traffic dumps/recordings of encrypted traffic&quot; to those fingerprints, and voila, you have a fairly accurate guess of what the user is doing - down to the exact URL. No more complex than what antivirus companies do day to day to run their businesses).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that one of the biggest tools that the ISPs have to track what you are doing is the DNS resolution framework.  If they know the sites + packet fingerprints they can work out what you are doing with HTTPS.  DNS over TLS would really put a dent in the ISPs ability to monitor what the users are doing.  IPs can and do change frequently and anything that is hosted in the cloud could be difficult to associate back to a domain without seeing the DNS exchange.  They might know its a video being streamed, but not be able to tell if it is Amazon Video or Netflix without seeing which domain you requested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that in TLS and HTTPs request the domain name you are connecting to is generally in cleartext within the first few bytes of your request - look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication" target="_blank">SNI extensions</a>.</p>
<p>This is used so that a web server on a single IP can serve via HTTPs hundreds of different domain names, with different certificates. All modern browsers provide SNI details by default at this point.</p></div>		</li>
