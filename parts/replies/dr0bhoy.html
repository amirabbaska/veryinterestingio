			<div class="markdown"><p>A cytokine storm is also what made the Spanish flu so deadly, and why the majority of the people who died were young adults (= strong immune system).</p>
<p>Silly cytokines, too few and the infection kills you, too many and your immune system kills you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ebola wouldn't be deadly, at least not immediately, but your body wouldn't be very effective at fighting viruses and infections.  You'd likely die from something mundane like a cold or flu as it destroys tissues simply by uninhibited replication</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your body wouldnt respond to cytokines it would be unable to recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Also the cells of surrounding tissues become less hospitable to microbes in response to cytokines. Cytokines play a role in the activation of the adaptive immune system which actively targets specific microbes (antigens). Connected to this is their role in a process called isotype switching which is the process where B-cells begin making specific antibodies </p>
<p>They obviously have many more functions and mechanisms but in short: you would have an insufficient immune response due to the lack of adaptive activation and innate leukocyte recruitment and chemotaxis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergic reactions are basically your body mistaking something as a dangerous foreign invader. It triggers the release of all associated immune responses, just not nearly on the same kind of scale as Ebola or other cytokine storm-inducing infections do.</p>
<p>Cytokines are basically responsible for regulating the production and distribution of certain kinds of cells. They're like tiny cellular shepherds made of proteins.</p>
<p>Essentially during a cytokine storm the immune system pulls out all the stops and basically dumps all available resources in to the body. It particularly creates a positive feedback loop in the production of white blood cells, but more than 150 different &quot;inflammatory mediators&quot; (chemicals that control inflammation levels in cells) are released as well, causing massive inflammation throughout the body with no way to inhibit the production or release. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm sure there is an obvious answer, but are we prolonging illness by taking fever reducing drugs, forcing fluids and food, and taking meds like DayQuil that reduce mucus production and coughing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is likely.</p>
<p>Generally, you should only take fever reducing drugs because you can't put up with the way you feel - not to reduce the fever.</p>
<p>Generally.</p>
<p>If the fever is high enough that it needs to be reduced for reasons other than discomfort you should be under medical care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My preferred method of treatment is an anti-inflammatory for the aches (and the bad knee and foot), decongestant without pain reliever when it really starts to hurt, Nyquil for sleeping and all the fluids I can stand.</p>
<p>Also, breathing exercises whenever I remember, because I've got asthma, a mom that's a nurse and I've avoided pneumonia so far and I'd like to keep it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The medicine for cold are decongestants and cough suppressant to relief symptoms. They potentially could make the cough and cold worse after the medicine wears off.
The common myth that people until now still believe is that these medicine cures cold. They don't. It's our immune system that is doing all the work. Eating med that relief symptoms is just hindering our immune system from doing what they do. </p>
<p>However, the immune system can overwork even after our body feels better, so that's what the antihistamine do. To stop immune system from producing all the mucus and inflammation. However t's hard to gauge when these antihistamine will work for your body instead of against cos we dunno when the cold virus has been eliminated fr our body </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. Thanks for the reference. I took a low level  combination orgo/biochem class and it covered prostaglandins and cox-1/2 inhibitors. It has completely changed how I think about balancing food intake for inflammation and tylenol/ibuprofen use.  This connection isn't one I had thought about. </p></div>		</li>
