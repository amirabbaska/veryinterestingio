<p>I was under the impression that there was. Like how most(all?) The rocks tested by the rovers have been sedimentary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And they were all created very early on in the planet's history. Since there are no tectonics on Mars, the crust doesn't get recycled the way it does on Earth. Wind has been the primary vehicle of geologic change on Mars for the better part of 2-3 billion years. Here's a pretty good timeline from Nature, the important part is the &quot;nature of aqueous environments&quot; row. Notice how the role of liquid water is essentially reduced to zero around 3 Ga. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpick: When you say &quot;Island chains&quot;, you're talking about hotspot volcanism like the hotspot type Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain, not arc-volcanism type archipelagos like the Aleutians, Japan, or New Zealand. While both types of island chains owe their existence to tectonic activities, it's the hot spot volcanism that's closer to the type of orogeny on Mars.</p>
<p>Other than that, your explanation is <em>spot</em> on.</p>
<p>As an aside, these mountains aren't tall angular cones like St Helens or Fuji: they're more gently sloping shield volcanoes like Hawaii.</p></div>		</li>
