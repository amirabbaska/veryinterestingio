			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this is why you can sometimes tell the difference between artificial flavors and natural flavors.</p>
<p>The artificial flavors are generally identical chemically to the natural ones - its just that they only contain a few of the primary sources of the natural food's flavor.</p>
<p>So while artificial apple flavor may contain 3 or 4 of the most flavorful chemicals you find in apples, it doesn't contain the dozens of minor chemicals that make up the apple's flavor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other factors that determine varying levels of physcoactive effects  are the THC vs THCA content
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), which occurs naturally in the plant. THCA needs to be heated so it changes into THC, the active form that gets you high. All cannabinoids occur naturally in their acid forms, that’s just how their enzymes make them. THCA turns into psychoactive THC when exposed to sufficient heat.
So if you were to eat raw or dried plant matter youd get more THCA, or tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, its a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that occurs naturally in cannabis plants.
If you were to smoke a strain thst is labeled to have 22% THCA and 3% THC, how much active THC will you get with each hit?
Heres the most recent formula to calculate total THC when you know the percentages for both THC and THCA.</p>
<p>THCtotal = (%THCA) x 0.877 + (%THC)
So, in our example:
THCtotal = 22% x 0.877 + 3%
That gives us a total THC level of about 22.3%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres just too many compounds to go over
The inactive compounds i believe defenitly contribute
The main psychoactive part of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) one of 483 known compounds in the plant,including at least 65 other cannabinoids.  Whos to say theres not more unknown as well.
Theres def. a lack of research
Its one of the safest so called &quot;drugs&quot; known to man   yet its still classified as schedule 1
Schedule I drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Some examples of Schedule I drugs are:</p>
<p>heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), marijuana (cannabis), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), methaqualone, and peyote</p>
<p>This is ridiculous and needs to be changed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The compounds mentioned are what delineate between indica/sativa and the affects of different strains thereof. </p>
<p>I believe it's the terpene Myrcene (among others, I'm sure) which is present in larger quantities in indica varietals that produces the typical stoney, couchlock effect </p></div>		</li>
