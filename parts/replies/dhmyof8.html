<p>It has been predicted that current generation of Auto-sales are going to take extremely deep slump in coming years and currently all companies have talked about how they have seen peak auto-sales and its just down hill from here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this doesn't account for the hundreds of millions of people that 1) do not buy into this trendy millenial shit, 2) live in a place outside of the downtown core, in the suburbs, or in rural areas , 3) aren't even close to having an electric charging grid. I was just in Montreal and saw a bunch of cars charging at a central station near a park I was at, we definitely do not have that shit out in Alberta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, living car-free is &quot;trendy millenial shit&quot;?  I guess most Europeans are trendy millenials, and have been for decades before the term was even coined?  European cities went down the whole &quot;humans suck cars rule&quot; thing decades ago, but they saw the harm they were causing to their cities and their quality of life and began reversing the changes, and embracing cities which prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users.  American cities are just starting to catch up, that's all.</p>
<p>And no, the fact that rural areas still exist, and some cities are further behind than others (both in Europe and North America) does not change the fact that American cities are starting to become more human-friendly overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Singapore for four years and didn't have a car, and absolutely loved being free of one. The metro (MRT) is unbelieveably efficient and ultra cheap, and cabs weren't half pricey considering how expensive the city is. It's similar to Europe or living downtown in a major US city.</p>
<p>Back in Canada, in the suburbs outside of a major city, it's simply not possible in any conceivable way to not own a car. People here don't just own cars, they own bigass trucks and AWD SUVs because for 6 months, we're driving on icy/snowy roads in the dark. </p>
<p>I've also come to realize that between payments, maintenance (oil changes, tires, seasonal service), insurance, it's about 10-20% of a person's income. That's unbelievable considering some carfree people can use that money traveling and enjoying themselves rather than just hauling themselves from point A to point B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's as much of an accident of history as it is of Europeans' choosing. European cities are much older than American ones. Los Angeles, for example, didn't become a major hub until well into the 20th century. Because of this it was built to reflect 20th century transportation, which meant cars, and lots of them. Post-WWII people wanted to have homes and yards which meant creating a commuter culture where people would live in the suburbs and drive to work. Americans were (and are) obsessed with cars and car culture. Young people could pick up a date, have dinner, watch a movie, and then go fool around without ever having to set foot on the pavement, and cities were built to accommodate this, with massive highways and low population density.</p>
<p>Contrast this with Paris, for instance, which has a population density of around 22,000 people per square kilometer. The city existed for hundreds of years when walking was the main method of transportation. Everything is much closer together with many more mixed-use buildings, well-defined city centers, and short travel distances. Also, Europe is nowhere near as large as North America. The cities are just closer together.</p>
<p>All of this means that it's much easier for European cities to set up modern means of public transportation than it is for Americans. It needs to happen, and I believe the US will get there eventually, but there will be some growing pains along the way as Americans struggle to adapt to a changing idea of how we should build our cities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>European cities are more densely packed and are designed around public transportation. If I were to take public transportation just to get downtown from where I live, that's a nearly two hour trip based on google maps, and that's clearly not factoring in traffic conditions. In Europe, a two hour trip could send you to another country or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a note regarding the &quot;hundreds of millions of people&quot;, cities tend to host a significant amount of the population.  To give you an idea, Alberta's population is about 4 million.  Montreal is roughly the same.  So already one city using public transit and electric cars is offsetting whatever is happening in an entire province.  And that's without getting into Toronto's 9 million people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right you have to separate &quot;business as usual&quot; from &quot;future growth&quot; when you're thinking about the stock price. Business as usual is the current stock price. How often do regular folks people buy new cars, and more expensive cars at that? Or decide they're okay with a much less expensive Kia that has the same standard features? Or how many people can afford a 70k high end truck? Ford's stock price already takes into account the regular sales they do. </p>
<p>It's the &quot;trendy millennial shit&quot; that's exciting to investors, because that's what gets people to ditch their trusty Nokia brick and get a neat iPhone, and generates future growth. In my opinion, Ford is basically where Nokia was when the iPhone came out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you figure that? Ford is pretty darn advanced when it comes to self driving and electric vehicle development. Not Tesla good, but on par with every other multinational corporation. Ford is more like LG when the iPhone released than Nokia. They don't get the trendy hip crowd per se, but they are in a good position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You can have a wonderful year but if investors think your industry is headed downwards in the mid-term to long-term your stock price is still going to suffer. The inverse is true as well (look at the tech growth and/or bubbles we've had).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you want to start the anti-capitalist, pro-environment drum circle or should I?</p>
<p>I love it when other generations try to justify our spending habits with the whole, &quot;Those millennials are such weirdos. They don't want cars, houses, families, marriage, or really anything that we wanted! Could it be that they're LAZY and against our TRADITIONS AND CULTURE!?!?!?&quot;</p>
<p>Uh, no, idiots. We're poor. Everything is more expensive, we're starting our lives in huge debt, and the barrier to entry for all of those things is now sky-high.</p>
<p>It shows a complete lack of awareness of how things actually are today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally the answer to, &quot;Why aren't Millennials doing this thing that's expected of them?&quot; is almost always that we can't afford it. Plenty of Millennials would be fine with buying the new Scion if we could afford it, but money issues are embarrassing and many of us try to obscure it with other reasoning. We have too much debt, all of the safety nets have been stripped away from us, and the barrier to entry for most traditional life/adult milestones is too high, financially. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You missed the biggest reason: millenials can't afford it given that they're graduating with student debt that is the equivalent of a vehicle lease and mortgage rolled into one. It isn't about being cool. It's about being completely unable to add more debt when making $7 an hour.</p></div>		</li>
