			<div class="markdown"><p>Different chemical technologies produce diffrrent voltages, and its a physical property that cant be changed. For example these are single cell voltages for different technologies</p>
<p>Lipo 3.7v
Lead acid 2v
Alkaline 1.5
Nimh 1.2 </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's referring to the fact that many devices have regulated power supplies. In these devices The voltage of the battery may be dropped or boosted depending on the device. In this scenario you will draw a wattage from the battery, meaning that as the voltage lowers, the required current increases to maintain the same regulated supply.</p>
<p>On simple devices however, you would be correct. In that case the performance would start to suffer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For linear devices, linear devices can easily be designed to draw constant power, as far as the battery will go anyways, so 1A @ 5V, 2A @ 2.5V, 5A @ 1V...and it catches fire because the parts are not rated for 5V. More realistically, 5A off 1V batteries can cause the batteries to fail in a bad way (venting gas, leaking toxic chemicals, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is wrong though since rechargeable batteries are rated by their nominal voltage while non rechargeable are rated by maximum. Both of those batteries will start out with 1.5v and drop to 0.9v as they get drained</p></div>		</li>
