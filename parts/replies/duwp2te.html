			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone, probably had to slow down a bit for down for something and that made a standing wave I traffic. They slowed down for a second, the person behind them did, and so on, and that makes a sort of standing wave in the traffic of people slowing down around the same spot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one other thing you missed is when the person in front slowed down the person behind them speeds up and changes lanes (regardless of whether the person in that lane had slowed down too)
So of course they have to slam on the brakes and the person behind them swerves into any other available lane and the circle begins anew. Repeat until all available lanes are full of stopped traffic and if you see this happening in front of you make sure you continue at 70mph towards the stopped traffic so you too can slam on the brakes at the last minute and perpetuate the standing wave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. Oh, my exit's coming up but I'm in the far lane? Let me speed up and cut someone else off or let me slow down until the car next to me passes and then I'll get over. Both situations are often the cause of slowdowns by major exits. You can pretty much tell this is the bullshit causing backups when you finally get up past the exit and traffic suddenly starts back up and there was nothing there like an accident, tow truck, or cops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that it's possible for one driver to massage an automotive trafficational standing wave out completely or ease by some amount. Now if more than one driver did this, the traffic would ease to minimum required slowing for density.</p>
<p>1:Maintain safe distance</p>
<p>2:observe for slowing as far ahead as possible. Make it possible to observe a quarter mile ahead.</p>
<p>3:when slowing ahead occurs, begin slowing at lowest Delta. When the cars in front brake for 5 seconds, stop for 5 seconds and take off, begin slowing early enough and at the appropriate rate to catch up to them just as they take off. (Given minimum safe distance is 4 seconds, you can only smooth a 4 second standing wave to zero stops in one pass. 10 seconds will take minimum 3 smoothings.)</p>
<p>5:on take off, observe ahead and begin take off maneuver cued from the brake lights of the car in front of the car in front of you. Ease to minimum safe distance AFTER take off.</p>
<p>All this happens with people zipping in and out of lanes. When a driver dips into your minimum safe distance zone, do not brake. Ease by 1 mph to new min safe distance. </p>
<p>An overall behavior is to find a way to brake easy and  +accelerate without delay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well no, there's also the fact that at higher speeds you need more distance between the cars, and there's finite road space, and once there are more cars than there is space you need to all drive 120 km/h, then things will start to slow down. When you're all going 10 km/h, you can really huddle up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.</p>
<p>That was always my rub when I had to commute.</p>
<p>I constantly felt boiling rage because I'd see someone do something dumb and mutter to myself: &quot;there's another 30 minutes for the people behind us. Nice job fuckwit.&quot;</p>
<p>The amount of utterly idiotic drivers in stop/go situational driving is insane in some of the major cities (I've driven through rush-hour in most: Chicago is particularly bad).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. And once even a bit of traffic starts all the people start changing lanes and cutting people off even more trying to find that optimal lane to keep moving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone else said. People who drive like shit. I work in a transportation company. I'm on the road in and out of the city for 8+ hours of a day. I see first hand the people who cause traffic when there's no actual cause like an accident. An example that happens more then it should is someone sitting casually on their phones while the light has been green for a bit. They create a heavy line of traffic behind them while all the other lanes are going. Then they look up and go like nothing happened. I hate those people so much. </p>
<p>Texting while driving has become a huge problem imo. Looking out the window on a big truck, it's about every second person on their phone while they drive. It makes things go way slower. They're the last to go at a green light. They drive 10-20 under the limit so they can look at their phones better. And it isnt just one person doing this, it's multiple around you, that's why it creates traffic. </p>
<p>I've seen people drive 40 below on a highway in the left lane so they can be on their phones. One guy was driving incredibly slow and swerving slightly while he talked on his phone (not bluetooth) I pointed to phone and shook my head and he gave me the dumbest look, he had no idea what I was trying to tell him. </p>
<p>There's been a couple times where I've gotten the attention of the driver to get off their phones and they just smile and shrug and go right back on it. Trust me you drive noticeably worse as soon as you start looking down at your phone, but alot of people do not care. Everyone does things for themselves and themselves first, doesn't matter if they're inconveniencing everyone around them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im the one who said its caused by people who drive like shit. Im in 200% agreement about everytbing you said. Fortunately my car is 100% hands free, so i never have to touch my phone. It should honestly be mandatory... not only is it unsafe but its inconsiderate. Causing traffic, causing accidents, two things that everyone hates. </p></div>		</li>
