			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with the fact very few people develop this specific software, and it's globally recognised standards so probably just a handful of people in north America actually worked on the code and all know each other (and can also be identified easily)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Software engineering is often covered by an NDA that is very broad.  Often unenforceabley broad, but why risk it for a Reddit comment?</p>
</li>
<li>If you have commit access to a valuable code base, or credentials for internal systems at a company dealing with any sort of infrastructure, it's best to not advertise that fact.  You will eventually be targeted by some adversary, and the more identifiable information you've put out there the more ammo they'll have.  Remember: they don't have to outsmart you (although they probably could), just anybody that has control over any of your accounts.</li>
