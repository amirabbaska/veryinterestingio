			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably lithium cobalt oxygen. That technology is chosen for this application because it has a high energy density which ensures that the phone marketer can claim a long battery life. The downside is that the higher energy content also brings more risk.</p>
<p>In the typical conditions (close to room temperature), the lithium ions move freely through the electrolyte and construct the expected molecules on both sides (LiCoO2 and LiC6). If the system's energy stays within bounds (temperature and voltage), then the expected (reversible) reactions dominate. If there is enough energy (overcharge- voltage too high, overheating- temperature too high) then there's enough energy to rip the cobalt and the oxygen apart, for example, which can result in the production of lithium oxide (LiO2). If the lithium oxide is produced, that releases a lot of excess energy with nowhere to go, and that is likely to create more lithium oxide generating reactions. This exothermic reaction creates the circumstances for even more exothermic reactions to occur. This positive feedback can result in thermal runaway, swelling, or even explosion. At best, it degrades the battery by tearing oxygen out of the electrolyte, making it less effective at transporting ions.</p></div>		</li>
