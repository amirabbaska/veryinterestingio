			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we really have &quot;the same initial system&quot; though? In every replicated system, at least some variables have to change, the simplest being space, time, or both, and going all the way to wherever we want to put the cutoff for defining &quot;sameness&quot;. In the case of coins or dice, that cutoff may throw out stuff like temperature distribution, the exact positions of atoms, air currents, and many more... and yet we call it the &quot;same&quot; initial conditions, and a repeatable experiment with a consistent outcome. Most of them don't apply to a simple quantum system, but on the other hand it's on the limit of what we can measure and control.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it would be more fair to say that &quot;as far as we can duplicate a simple quantum system in a meaningful way&quot;, the duplicated system can yield different outcomes than the original... but do we really know, or even can we know, whether any of the variables we decide to cut out from our definition of sameness might or might not influence the observed outcome? It seems like most of what we call &quot;randomness&quot; in complex systems, are just hidden variables; can we really say the same doesn't apply to simple quantum systems which we can barely observe?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is some technical reasons calling something the same system works, I'll try to explain it.  </p>
<blockquote>

<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Noether's theorem</a> for this. The laws of physics are unchanging to certain symmetries. If our universe, or at least part of it, obeys a symmetry, there is a corresponding conservation law. Here's two examples,  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Momentum is the corresponding conserved quantity when the physical laws are invariant to spatial translations.  </p>
</li>
<li>Energy is the corresponding conserved quantity when the physical laws are invariant to time translations.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In physics, the physical laws must describe all dynamics involved and if they obey these symmetries, then we know translations in time and space change nothing and we're safe to say &quot;same system.&quot; Even in situations where the symmetry is broken (if you drop an apple, its momentum is not conserved, but the apple-Earth system momentum is) we can show how big the break is and often can figure out how to make it small as possible.  </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>When I say same initial conditions, I mean literally the equations of motion written down and solved. There is only one solution possible because of the principle of least action. When you move to repeatability, you then have to show (numerically or painfully by hand) that the fluctuations you see will remain bounded near the same outcome such as coin trajectory. As a striking example of when outcomes are not bounded are weather patterns on Earth which are very sensitive to initial conditions, so even &quot;look-alike&quot; systems can have thousands of dramatically different outcomes.</p>
<p>But not all systems behave this way and we can even define the variance required (in an initial condition like air temperature) before the physics dynamics become unreliable if you had just assumed the average initial conditions. Check out chaos theory for more on this. Either way, we can indeed make a &quot;sameness&quot; criteria mathematically.  </p>

<p>The Bell inequality experimentally rules out any locally hidden quantum variables. Either that variable doesn't exist (thus true randomness) or the variables are global (and propagate faster than light). Most physicists dislike the second option. There are a handful of ways out of the first option, but none of them offer a way to physically do anything about it, from your POV, it's true randomness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's exactly the same starting system, and OP says &quot;and I mean every possible thing is the same&quot; then we are creating an artificial thought experiment where we can also say all the quantum states are the same including mass, direction, charge, position, etc. Even if it's impossible for us to actually know all of those things, we can still posit that they are the same. So the outcome will be identical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, that's it's impossible to ever exactly reproduce initial conditions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm <em>really good</em> at my job.</p>
<p>Serious answer though, I try to justify this by stating physical systems are invariant to time translation. You can check out Noether's theorem or notice that quantum mechanics lacks a time-operator.  </p>
