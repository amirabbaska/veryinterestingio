			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree.</p>
<p>I would add that leading questions are generally allowed  at trial, emphasis at trial,when asking the basic things that lay a foundation for later questions. Once you cross the line from foundation into substantive questions is when you begin to hear objections.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that the tings you hear on TV are written by screenwriters for dramatic effect and which need to be compressed into a short period of time. Actual trials are not like that. They are closer to slogging, tedious, nit picking. It takes a substantial amount of training, skill and experience to be able to reframe questions after an objection in order to elicit the desired information in an acceptable format.</p>
<p>Investigators are not bound by those rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite rule-breaking is when the prosecution gets to close last, just because the show wants the viewer to empathize with the prosecution more than the defense.</p>
<p>Edit: Different places have different laws on order of closing arguments. Usually in the US it's Plaintiff -&gt; Defense -&gt; Plaintiff rebuttal. Still, shows simply cherry-pick the side that goes last.</p></div>		</li>

<p>During a witness examination, it's the witness who is supposed to tell the story. You don't want a lawyer to narrate what happened when he called his own witness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're not allowed to lead, but I don't think there's any rules against &quot;musing outloud&quot;. For instance</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does this shoe fit your foot?</p>
<p>No sir it does not.</p>
<p><strong>So the shoe the prosecution claims the murderer was wearing does not even fit Mr. Johnson's foot...</strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, that's very, very much against the rules on direct examination. You can sort of get away with it on cross, but it has to be a question directed at a witness. But you're almost never going to get a witness to directly contradict himself on the stand. The opposing lawyer will prep them specifically against that and a witness usually will have a smart answer that will completely ruin your cross.</p>
<p>The witnesses are for establishing evidence. You don't weave your case during the examinations. That's what opening statements (sort of) and closing arguments (super definitely) are for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, because I'm a competitive debater and this is a common problem we face too. We have cross, though we call it CX usually, and a lot of novices try to &quot;weave their case&quot; like you mentioned. I have to drill it the fuck out of them and force them to broaden their perspective to the rest of the debate. We call evidence &quot;cards.&quot; My coaches and I (captain) try to teach them to make cards in CX that they need for the rest of the debate. When they're asking in CX, they should think about their final speech.</p>
<p>Interesting to hear the lawyer side.</p></div>		</li>
