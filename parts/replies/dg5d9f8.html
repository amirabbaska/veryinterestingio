			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation. The kidney is an amazing organ. When my liver was in trouble (with a very rare disease that I had no control over), I noticed the changes in urine color to a very dark amber. Since the liver works as a blood filter like the kidney, when it starts to shut down, the kidneys usually follow since they are trying to to do their job and take up the slack from the damaged liver. When the doctors &quot;fixed&quot; the problem (with a new liver), the changes were huge. My kidneys went back to normal and all the colors were the best I've seen in years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to needing to pee more whilst drinking alcohol, is there any safe way of reducing the &quot;confusion&quot; aspect to your body? As in, is there a way to correct your body so it doesn't pee so much when drinking? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A common method of reducing the confusion (not fixing the problem) is to actually give it lots of extra water (by drinking water in between drinks) so you still urinate a lot, but you're not getting nearly as dehydrated.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I do. It also helps tremendously in preventing hangovers. I'm no doctor and I'm not 100% but I believe a large reason for hangovers is due to the lack of hydration in the body. Practice seems to prove the logic at least. I never get hangovers if I drink water throughout the night or at least 2-3 cups before bed. Hell, even if I don't drink water the night before and I do get a hangover I can usually quell it pretty quickly by hydrating in the morning.</p>
<p>Also ibuprofen doesn't hurt. As far as I understand acetaminophen (tylenol) is processed by your liver which is already taxed by the alcohol so it doesn't really do any good but ibuprofen is processed differently and can help.</p>
<p>Again, not a doctor. I could be wrong.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>You could maybe do it by taking an antidiuretic, which has the opposite effect of alcohol. This would be pretty easy to overdo, and you might not be able to pee, which could have some adverse consequences. I wouldn't recommend it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I don't think so, but you can help make up for it by drinking a glass of water for each alcoholic drink.</p></div>		</li>
