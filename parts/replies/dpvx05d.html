			<div class="markdown"><p>Green and hazel are a result of extra fat, yes. Light green eyes are actually blue pigment-wise, dark green are grey, and hazel are brown. My family has strong genes for fatty eyes - we're all some form of green or hazel. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, blue eyes are blue not because of pigment, but for the same reason the sky is blue! It's due to a particular kind of light scattering called Rayleigh scattering. In general blue pigments are rare in nature so  when you see blue, it's usually due to some kind of physical light interaction rather than chemical as in pigments. </p>

<p>It's not very big, maybe two inches tall and a bit less than an inch wide. It'll only grow a bit past my chin, while the rest of my hair is to my mid to low back.</p></div>		</li>
