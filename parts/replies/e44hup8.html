			<div class="markdown"><p>You touched on something here that doesn't seem to be discussed in other upper comments: international investment. There have been smatterings of comments over the last year about wealthy overseas investors buying up property here in the US at above asking prices, but no comprehensive reporting about it (that I've seen, anyway). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that's not really the same thing. Maybe in very narrow markets is it actually impactful, but foreign investment in residential property is pretty negligible (at least in proportion to the amount of whining about it). The above is talking about foreign investment in financial institutions and instruments on a large scale, not rich individuals parking their money somewhere safe (and safely away from their own lack of the rule-of-law).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, just like with the coming Student Loan crash, it all starts with people taking out a loan that they can't pay back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, but that's the problem in my opinion. All of that money that would have before been going to housing, stocks, businesses, etc is not going to pay back the student loans. All of that income not creating anything. That's a big chunk of the economy that's going to be just debt repayment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know student loans represent more debt than mortgages but my question is what is the trigger for the house of cards to collapse? In the housing market it was the variable interest rates going up and grace periods ending which revealed that many of the loans couldn't be paid, but what's the equivalent in the student loan universe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there's one trigger like the housing market that will bring down the house, but I do think Student Loans will be a much bigger drag on the economy for a much longer time.  </p>
<p>All of the statistics focus on college grads but I think it's grad school loans that are going to drag the economy to a halt. </p>
<p>Basically, like a quarter (a fifth, or whatever you call it, it's a lot more than even 10 years ago and just getting worse) of the good careers (Drs, Lawyers, etc) are now leaving school with the burden of paying off a house before they even start life. </p>
<p>That's going to have them putting a lot less money into housing, cars, businesses, stocks, etc in the very near future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed. The China factor in all of this is huge. I would add, since a lot of these comments are referencing The Big Short, if you want a movie that is a good representation of what went on at this time within the banks and the MBS market, watch Margin Call. There is a comment that Paul Bettany's character makes about the situation that I love, when someone says to him on the eve of the crisis that many, many people are going to be hurt by what is about to unfold, let me see if I can find it on the web....here it is. The character, Will, is a mid-level guy in the MBS market at a big bank:</p>
<p>&quot;Will Emerson: Jesus, Seth. Listen, if you really wanna do this with your life you have to believe you're necessary and you are. People wanna live like this in their cars and big fuckin' houses they can't even pay for, then you're necessary. The only reason that they all get to continue living like kings is cause we got our fingers on the scales in their favor. I take my hand off and then the whole world gets really fuckin' fair really fuckin' quickly and nobody actually wants that. They say they do but they don't. They want what we have to give them but they also wanna, you know, play innocent and pretend they have no idea where it came from. Well, thats more hypocrisy than I'm willing to swallow, so fuck em. Fuck normal people. You know, the funny thing is, tomorrow if all of this goes tits up they're gonna crucify us for being too reckless but if we're wrong, and everything gets back on track? Well then, the same people are gonna laugh till they piss their pants cause we're gonna all look like the biggest pussies God ever let through the door.
Seth Bregman: Do you think we're gonna be wrong?
Will Emerson: [long pause] No, they're all fucked.&quot;
So he was partially right. Had the government not stepped in and encouraged the banks to get their fingers back on the scales, it would have been the meltdown that it perhaps should have been. Now things are just winding back up to the next inevitable meltdown, which of course will be much bigger.</p></div>		</li>
