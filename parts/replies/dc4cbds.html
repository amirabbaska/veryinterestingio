			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a sufficient answer.  Different drugs have different half lives, are quicker acting, have different side effects, follow a little bit of a different pathway, might interact with another medication or the patient themselves, etc.  </p>
<p>There are all sorts of reasons for the use of a variety of opioids  and other drugs that seem to do the same thing.  And /u/tweedledeedoolee is correct in saying that good old fashion morphine will generally work in a pinch, like field dressing, etc, but in a clinical setting you have more options to dictate a specific drug course for a patient based on their needs.  </p>
<p>Changing the chemical structure of morphine to heroin changes very little to the chemical structure, but heroin is able to act quicker than morphine.  </p>
<p>Other analogs to the opioids would be certain classes of antibiotics.  penicillin based antibiotics are plentiful as penicillin itself is largely inate at this point in treating infection, but also has a high risk of immune reaction, so you see all sorts of isomers like omoxacyllin. </p>
<p>Also, I'm a scientist dammit, not a spellicist.  </p></div>		</li>
