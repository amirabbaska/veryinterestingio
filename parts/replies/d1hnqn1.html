<p>Also healthcare in Indonesia isn't amazing, so many people with cancer are simply not diagnosed before they die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lung cancer rate in Japan is very low among smokers and they live forever. Perhaps there's genetic component that means Asians don't get lung cancer from smoking as often.

			<div class="markdown"><p>When this was brought up at our med school, they quoted the last sentence of that abstract, &quot;Possible explanations for this difference in risk include a more toxic cigarette formulation of American manufactured cigarettes as evidenced by higher concentrations of tobacco-specific nitrosamines in both tobacco and mainstream smoke, the much wider use of activated charcoal in the filters of Japanese than in American cigarettes, as well as documented differences in genetic susceptibility and lifestyle factors other than smoking.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading about the Japanese &quot;problem&quot; as it piqued my interest, currently working for a research contractor for a NIH tobacco study.  There are many factors to consider in the Japanese problem, a few that I recall are diet and the degree to which Japanese &quot;smoke&quot; a cigarette.  I think it was found that most Japanese smoke less deeply and rarely &quot;finish&quot; a cigarette.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I think modern cancer rates are so much higher than even 50 years ago. </p>
<p>Most people who died were not really diagnosed as to why they died. </p>
<p>For example, GI cancers present as massive weight loss then death. So I am thinking most of those were listed for cause of death as &quot;Starvation&quot; or maybe Consumption.  </p>
<p>Even 4 years ago, my father's death was listed as such even though he spent 12 years fighting cancer. He decided enough was enough and didn't want more chemo, surgeries and such, so just gave in. Two weeks and he was gone, but on his terms. As it should be, but his death was not listed as by cancer. It VERY rarely is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this might contribute it's fairly speculative. There are mechanisms in your cells that inhibit cancers (the cells commit suicide if they become cancerous). These systems are governed by your genetics. Since populations often share many similar genetic traits, then some populations will be naturally more or less susceptible to diseases, including cancers. </p>
<p>A interesting example of this is that people with downs syndrome generally are protected form cancer. Downs is caused by having three chromosome 21 instead of two. One study showed that they die at 1/10 the rate of the rest of the population from cancer. This has been associated with a third copy of cancer protective gene that is on the extra chromosome.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iamasecretthrowaway" target="_blank">iamasecretthrowaway</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much. The average life span for someone with Downs is 60, and they're at a markedly increased risk for some cancers, like childhood leukemia (as well as blood disorders in general, I believe, and a whole pile of other health problems), and low risk for other types of cancer. While many cancers are typically old age cancers that you wouldn't expect to see in someone with a shorter life span, a lot of cancers are not, and you would expect to see them at similar rates but don't.</p></div>		</li>
