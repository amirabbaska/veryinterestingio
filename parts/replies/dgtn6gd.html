			<div class="markdown"><p>£10 a month for me with Three. Unlimited Data and Texts, 500 minutes.</p>
<p>Key point is I actually cancelled my rolling month sim only contact since I wanted to move to Giffgaff and they called up the next day and offered me this deal (plus a free Alcatel phone worth like £40). I didn't hesitate to take up the offer</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember this from the 90s when U.S. Robotics (?) sold a product with two 56 kbps modems that would use two phone lines to get 112 kbps! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That technology only switches from Wifi to Cellular (if the user enables it and if the wifi is lousy) it doesn't do the 50/50 split like OP is dreaming of (which is hard to implement for several other reasons)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, &quot;download booster&quot; is still available but it only works on single file downloads over 30mb, by simply requesting half of the file through each of the two connection types (when a &gt;30mb file is detected).  Im looking at that setting right now on my phone.  Its a samsung thing, i think, i havent heard of the same sort of feature working on any other handsets besides the S5/6/7/note4/5/7 (havent seen it on S8 since i dont have one)</p></div>		</li>
