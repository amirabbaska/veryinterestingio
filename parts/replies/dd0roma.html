			<div class="markdown"><p>I might have been two years ago, but not anymore! One thing you'll learn about federal employees is that they are often hired to be &quot;generalists&quot; which means it's the skills they have, and less the specific in-depth knowledge they have, which makes them valuable for an office.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the specific knowledge is irrelevant; my biology background has proved very useful in my current position, but we've also had chemists, physicists, and others work on our biosecurity team. What's neat is the respect that these departments and agencies have for technical expertise, and that scientists most certainly have a place in the federal government!</p></div>		</li>
