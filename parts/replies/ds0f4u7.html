			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify #1 the US does foreign aid different than other countries. For various reasons Americans give a lot of money to foreign aid through private charities. 3-4% of the US GDP comes from private foreign aid. </p>
<p>Also, like it or not military spending is also considered foreign aid. There's two sides to every battle and our military spending is supporting one of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big issue with this, every other country gives aid through charities too, that spending is not counted in comparisons like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_development_aid_country_donors" target="_blank">this</a> either. So to say count individual donations for the US and not for anyone else is disingenuous.</p>
<p>As a percentage of gross national income (the measure that is used by the OCED) the United States gives roughly 0.17% and is ranked 10th in in the world in development aid.</p>
<p>The only countries that exceed the 1% figure are Norway and Sweden.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not saying don't count it just that Americans tend to prefer giving through private charities rather than government so comparing governmental giving doesn't give the entire picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual answer explaining that America does actually do a lot of good in the world. I'm sick of people hating on America for the shitty things they do (which are in fact shitty) and not giving them credit for essentially funding pseudo forms of protection for a large portion of the world. </p>
<p>Not saying America is perfect by a long shot but when compared to China, France, UK, Russia, etc we are doing pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I see it, one government will always be the strongest and want to influence the world. So if it's going to happen, which it will. The USA is the best choice. We all know how China and Russia are and they're the only other alternative. Maybe I'm wrong and someone can change my opinion</p></div>		</li>

<p>Separately, I'm dubious that our big mistake with North Korea was not giving them enough free stuff.</p></div>		</li>
