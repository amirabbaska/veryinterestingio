			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. There are a ton of joke comments above you and the person you responded to, but prenatal conditions would be huge.</p>
<p>Hell, just look at children gestated during Ramadan, if mother fasted, the kids have noticeable deficiencies compared to peers. At least for a while. Now add in a true scarcity like a long winter and the kid could have some serious issues. Or any of the many things expecting women are told to avoid out if fear of damage to baby/womb. 10000 years might not have an issue with FAS, but I'm sure there's others we don't think about now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/5x54rx/what_evidence_supports_the_concept_of/" target="_blank">a similar question</a> about a year ago. There's no real evidence to suggest a &quot;modern behavior&quot; human as distinct from anatomically modern. Meaning that, so far as anyone knows, human beings have been &quot;us&quot; for the entire time we've been &quot;us&quot; - all 300,000-ish years of modern humans. </p>
<p>There's no &quot;they&quot; here, so when we say ancient humans were as smart and strong as we are today, we're just talking about ourselves. </p></div>		</li>
