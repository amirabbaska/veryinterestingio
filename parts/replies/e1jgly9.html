			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the time of day, tbh. If you’re driving in the middle of the day and you’re sleepy, it’s a MUCH better idea to roll down the windows (if the weather’s chilly) and blast the stereo than it is to crank the heat. Your body expects and reacts differently at different times. Plus, the cooling down for sleep is subtle. Driving down the highway with the windows down when it’s 20 degrees is not. :)</p></div>		</li>
