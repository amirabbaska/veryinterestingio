			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: The reason salt on roads stops working at approximately 0 degrees Fahrenheit is because Daniel Fahrenheit, the scientist who developed the scale, designated 0 degrees to be the temperature at which salt water freezes. <del>100 was meant to be human body temperature but has since been adjusted to the well known 98.6.</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit" target="_blank">wiki for reference</a></p>
<p>If only he had set 0 to be the temperature at which water freezes, then we could salt to well below 0 and it would still be effective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fun, but not all fact, if you read the article. He set body temperature at 96 and the melting point of ice at 32. This gives you 64 intervals between the two points, and 64 is an easily divisible number.</p>
<p>A 100-point scale is very difficult to divide evenly without modern methods, because half of 100 is 50, half of 50 is 25, but then you have to evenly divide up the 25 degrees, which is no trivial matter.</p>
<p>On a 64 point scale, half of 64 is 32, half of that is 16...8...4...2...1, so you can easily get to individual degrees through simple division (you could take, for instance, a piece of string to measure the distance and fold it in half for each successive measure).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like how your statement implies the method at which we assign temperature a number determines how physics works.  &quot;It's gotta be at least 100 degrees out, why can't have a temperature scale where 100 is nice weather.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>(so the ice cream freezes fast enough to freeze the air bubbles into the mix which is why ice cream has such great texture). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other big reason ice cream is so smooth is because the ice crystals are very small, which is also because its frozen very quickly and agitated while freezing.</p></div>		</li>
