I realize this gets down to information/computation theory but I can only imagine performing these calculations either halts or runs forever. </p>
<p>Even if scaling a complete quantum model upwards into a macro system takes 4 trillion years, that's as far from infinity as 1 year. I just want to know if there's a <strong>principle</strong> that forbids that scaling. Like Heisenburgs, something inherently preventative by natural laws</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it like a P vs. NP problem though? </p>
<p>Yes. Probably. </p>
<p>It's not known whether BQP=NP (as in, whether a quantum system can efficiently act as an oracle for all NP complete problems) and it is suspected not to be the case. However, an efficient quantum emulator could solve at least one problem that is in NP in polynomial time (factoring). That implies that either factoring is really in P or that a quantum simulator is NOT in P.</p>
<p>All our current algorithms for classical quantum simulation run in exponential time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gonna nitpick this. &quot;One problem in NP that is suspected not to be in P.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intel doesn't transistor-level simulate its complete processors and they have the order of 1e9 - 10e9 transistors...because it's, practically speaking, computationally useless (run a simulation for a month to get information that does nothing to change the course of the design).  For reference, Intel's R&amp;D budget is 2/3 of NASA's entire budget.</p>
<p>So that's 1e9.  It doesn't matter if it scales as N or N^2, you've got another 1e14 factor to get to 1e23 scale (which still is &lt; 1 mol, which isn't that big).  </p>
<p>What would be interesting would be to see what bit system (it's going to be well past 64 ;) you'd need to hold the simulation data.  You would need a completely custom built computer to do the calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only principles I know of that limit scaling are in some sense practical. First, you have precision issues whenever you deal with large numbers of interacting particles interacting through energy fields. At 64 bit precision, you get divergence in trajectories after just a couple of dozen femto seconds in a classical simulation. That's without accounting for error in the field calculations themselves due to limited precision. Then you have physical limitations - it takes a certain minimum number of atoms to build a transistor, and certain minimum numbers of those to represent the coordinates of a given system. Those numbers combined are always much larger than the number of physical objects that are represented in the system. So any machine you would use to simulate macro-scale systems would have to be much larger (physically, in terms of number of atoms) than the system itself. Finally, there are time constraints. It takes a certain minimum number of operations to compute gradients in fields and to move the system along them. Macro systems simulated down to the fundamental particle level would take such a large number that even with billion or trillion fold improvements in computational speed, it would still take much too long for the simulation itself to be worth anything.</p>
<p>So I guess one way to describe it is that there is nothing that theoretically says you can't write a set of equations that would describe the evolution of a macroscopic system in terms of its fundamental particles as a function of time. However, if you want to try to <em>solve</em> those equations, or even represent that system in some sort of simulation, you quickly run into physical and theoretical limits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But like. Doesn't that then just become normal Newtonian/Einsteinian(?) physics? Or are you talking about the particles amongst themselves instead of the system as a whole.</p></div>		</li>
