			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar situation is a deck of cards. Once you shuffle the deck, there is a certain card on top, and the cards dealt in say a game of poker are already determined. But since no one has looked at the order of the cards in the deck, effectively the cards dealt out are random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not effectively random. They <em>are</em> random. Ignoring that shuffling arguably isn't necessarily actually properly random, if shuffling is ever random then those cards <em>are</em> random. They are random because Bayesian probability is a valid interpretation of probability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a question: Even if the shuffled deck were to happen to be shuffled into numerical &amp; suit order by complete (albeit extremely unlikely) circumstance, it would still be considered random right?</p>
<p>And if so is there a special term for that or...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW: In 1992, Bayer and Diaconis showed that after seven random riffle shuffles of a deck of 52 cards, every configuration is nearly equally likely. Shuffling more than this does not significantly increase the &quot;randomness&quot;; shuffle less than this and the deck is &quot;far&quot; from random.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You misunderstood what this guy meant when he said &quot;effectively random&quot;. After shuffling, the cards are in one specific order. You don't know what that order is, but there is one order to them, so you cannot describe their physical order as a probability distribution. But you can describe your knowledge of the order as a probability distribution. And that means that the physical order might as well be random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To summarize: statistics isn't just about math, it's about <em>information</em>.</p>
<p>This is what makes stuff like the Monty Hall problem so hard to understand for people.  We're taught lots about the math part, and very little about the concept of information as it pertains to statistics.</p>
<p>Another great example is that well known XKCD comic about the p-value and it's commentary on science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You choose a door.  You have no infomation about which is the prize, so it's a 1/3 chance (ie random) you picked the right door.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monty reveals a dud.  It's always a dud, and he knows it - <em>he has information</em>.  He can't reveal the prize.  There's no probability here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of Monty, the chooser now has additional information as well.  If you were choosing now with no information, it would be 1/2.  But that's not the case - you now know what's behind one of the doors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's go back to the original choice.  There was a 1/3 chance you picked the prize.  There was a 2/3 chance the prize is behind one of the other two doors.  This is the key.  <strong>Those initial odds haven't changed, but Monty revealed information</strong>.  There is still a 1/3 chance you picked the prize, and a 2/3 chance the prize is behind one of the unpicked doors.  However, <em>you now have information about what's behind one of the unpicked doors</em>.  There's still a 2/3 chance the other unpicked door has the prize.</p>
</li>
<li>Because of this, it's always better to switch.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good way of putting it. Another way could be that there is still a 2/3 chance that the winning door is in the other group containing 2/3 doors, and together with the host you get to open both of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it is not. The first is probability of an event that has not happened and the second is of an event that has happened. Freq and Bayes have to do with whether you are willing to put an initial view of the probabilities of the 0.5 parameter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair it's a bit of a mix of all of the above. The original OP does talk about frequentist aproach and prioris but does <em>not</em> mention posterioris. </p>
<p>Also it depends on how you define the events. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Statistics is all about <em>inference</em> from a necessarily finite sample, so  speaking of solutions is not not quite the right way to think about it. Perhaps a better way to phrase is to ask under which conditions do frequentist and Bayesian approaches arrive at different conclusions. For example, relevant XKCD:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1132/" target="_blank">Relevant xkcd.</a> Although technically the frequentist is giving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function" target="_blank">likelihood</a> of the sun having exploded, which is distinct from the probability. The problem is more that a frequentist can't even give a probability without something having a known rate to begin with.</p></div>		</li>
