			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Cave_lion_range.png" target="_blank">This image</a> shows the European Lion's range, in orange, as covering most of England. Although it is obviously not very much to read. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_lions_in_Europe" target="_blank">The Wikipedia page</a> is also quite barren, it doesn't seem like there is much knowledge on the subject, at least none that is accessible through wikipedia.</p>
<p>I would imagine that even if there were a lion population in Britain that humans would have killed them seeing as there isn't much room to co-exist.</p></div>		</li>
