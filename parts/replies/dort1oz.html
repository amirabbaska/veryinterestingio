			<div class="markdown"><p>As for the curly thing and the shape of a follicle, your explanation made me think of how we curl ribbons by running a pair of scissors down them. Is the oblong follicle sort of creating the same effect when the hair pushes through it? I know nothing about this, but that visual popped into my head and I want to know if it's close enough or wildly incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colour for hair is due to little pigmentation nodules in your hair. There are 2 types but not everyone has both, and not in the same amounts. One is a redish/orange pigment and one is a black pigmentation. If you have neither you have white hair. Little or no black and only a little red=blonds, no black and lots of red=red, lots of black regardless of red=black, mix of both=various shades of brown</p></div>		</li>
