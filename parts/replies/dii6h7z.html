			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you're an opera singer, I'm going to take this opportunity to voice my recent blindside by your art. I had heard some opera before, you know in movies and what it, no big deal I thought. It's people singing. However, a couple of months ago I saw Diana Damrau on YouTube singing Queen of the Night from Die Zaubefl√∂te. Changed my whole perspective on the artform. That woman is possibly from another planet. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/dpVV9jShEzU" target="_blank">The video</a> for those interested.</p>
<p>Also she's not gigantically fat either and that is the most amazing singing I've ever heard, the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, she's an absolute goddess in a lot of the stuff she sings (Queen of the Night being one of them). </p>
<p>Honestly, I think opera is a largely misunderstood art form, plagued by unfortunate stereotypes. And I totally understand why, too. When I was young I used to laugh and make fun of it (&quot;fat people singing in Italian, 'I'm fatter than youuuu!'&quot; Is how I referred to it). </p>
<p>Most people who actually SEE an opera, understand why they have survived as long as they have, and why it is such an amazing art form. I've laughed harder and cried harder watching/singing opera more than I have any other time in my life. There's a reason Wagner called it &quot;gesamtwerk&quot; or &quot;complete-work&quot;, because it can be the ultimate combination of music and acting all rolled into one. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, most people have the misconception it's just fat people singing in different languages, though most have probably been exposed to more opera than they realize (thanks to Bugs Bunny). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me it can be a bit hard to link the music with what's going on, especially if it's in another language. Like, in that video linked above, I was amazed by the singer's skill, and the music was beautiful, but I had some difficulty linking what I was hearing with what I thought the music was trying to evoke...Like, she was threatening to cast her daughter out of her family if she didn't kill a guy! But the music was still very smooth and beautiful. So it was difficult for me to link what seemed like a bit of an ugly idea with a beautiful sound. </p>
<p>Maybe that's what makes it hard for some people to relate to music of that sort? I dunno. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think of greenday's American idiot being classified as an opera? I'm a big fan of the storyline, but as a professional, do you think this cheapens the art form or complements it? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember reading about research indicating that sleep deprivation contributes to weight gain. Apparently losing sleep stimulates appetite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Base metabolic rate goes down when you are asleep. So naturally the more hours awake you are the more energy you are using. Even if not proportional, this can trick your body into thinking you need an entirely new 4th meal rather than just a tiny extra snack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW actors and actresses we usually see on stage and on the screen--particularly those who have the leading man/leading lady type roles--are highly selected based on physical good looks and so represent a very, very small portion of the full range of human body shapes.</p>
<p>Whereas singers tend to be highly selected based on their singing ability and so represent far more closely the full range of human body shapes as seen in the general population.</p>
<p>I'm never really sure whether opera singers are supposed to be fat in comparison to other non-opera stars of stage and screen or in comparison with normal people.</p>
<p>In comparison with movie stars, surely they are &quot;fat&quot;.  In comparison with the full range of normal people, I would guess they represent more a random sampling.  </p>
<p>But, we are not used to seeing &quot;normal&quot; people up on the stage or the screen acting like movie stars or actors.  They &quot;look wrong&quot;.  This is more a problem of us &amp; our expectations than of the singers &amp; their body types. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to do an actual study of singers vs. the general population based on BMI or whatever.  I'm guessing opera singers would come out looking very normal--but then again I live in a state where somewhere north of 30% of the adult population is in the actual &quot;obese&quot; range.  If anything, the opera singers I see on stage look thinner on average than our general population . . .</p>
<p>TL;DR: Opera singers tend to look more like a cross-section of the normal population than a cross section of young, thin movie stars.  Maybe thinking of them as &quot;fat&quot; is more our problem than theirs . . . </p></div>		</li>
