			<div class="markdown"><p>The question of alive or dead is a lot more complicated than people often give credit.</p>
<p>My work involves returning function to dissected organs.</p>
<p>Are the hearts still alive after I remove them? The cells are still alive and functioning. The heart still beats.</p>
<p>Is the animal still alive after I remove the heart? If I didn't actively euthanize, the brain would still work. The foot would still move. All of those cells individually are still functional and &quot;alive&quot;, but is the whole?</p>
<p>This is a question for which, as things currently stand, we don't have an answer.</p>
<p>The current legal definition for vertebrates is cardiac arrest with no brain activity and twice a year I take a shit on that definition by decapitating the euthanized animals used to teach my class and keeping the hearts going for another 4-5 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the apple is fresh looking it is alive. All cells are doing their thing. When it starts to spoil, that is a sign that this specific patch has died and is being eaten by microorganisms. But the fresh part on the other side is still alive.</p>
<p>Plants are freaky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the difference between animals and plants?</p>
<p>Say I accidentally carve a slice of skin off my finger. How long before all the cells in that slice die? Seconds? Minutes? What if I lost a whole finger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The apple is meant to be eaten. After the seeds and basic structure of the fruit are mature, it goes through a period called the Climacteric. There is a burst of respiratory activity when the fruit is burning more calories than before. This process results in the partial breakdown in cell ways and the synthesis of flavor and scent molecules that produces the taste, smell, and texture of the ripe fruit.</p>
<p>Once this happens, it becomes essentially inert, biologically. It just sits there and chills until it’s time to fall off and get ate. </p>
<p>Mushrooms don’t do this. They’re very calorically demanding organs as long as they are sporulating. They carry on their work like this until they’re done or violently separated from the mycelium. They don’t become quiescent like many fruits do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be obvious given the above explanation, but many people don't realize that scattered mushrooms of the same species in an area are (likely) the same individual. </p></div>		</li>
