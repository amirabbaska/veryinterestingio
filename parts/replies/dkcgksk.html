<p>What &quot;growing % of the population avoiding meat consumption&quot; ?</p>

<p>I assuming the OP is being US centric there.</p>
<p>US Vegetarians by % of population:</p>

<li>1971 1%</li>
<li>2008 3.7%</li>
<li>2013 13%</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The apparent difference is in how the questions were asked. The post above yours is about people who self-describe as vegetarians, while your link asks which of the following foods you eat.</p>
<p>Apparently a lot of people who eat meat rarely will call themselves vegetarians on surveys, so I think your data is more convincing for &quot;doesn't eat meat&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is slightly nitpicky, but your links actually say that in 2013, 6% are vegetarians and 7% are vegans (13% one or the other). So the increase for vegetarians is not as dramatic, but what is dramatic is the increase of vegans: 0.5% in 2008 to 7% in 2013. I find these numbers a little dubious, especially since they don't come with any kind of uncertainty estimates, but I guess it's the best we got for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be slightly more nitpicky:</p>
<p>All vegans are vegetarians. They're just more restrictive in addition to traditional vegetarian rules. </p>
<p>It's like, all of the players on the Dallas Cowboys would be in the demographic of &quot;professional football players&quot;. But not all football players are Dallas Cowboys. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a distinction between meat eating between vegetarians and vegans?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find those numbers difficult to believe.  I live in southern CA where I would expect to see a significantly higher percent than the national average ... Anecdotally, I would guess closer to 5% in my neck of the woods </p>
<p>I seriously doubt the studies findings.</p>
<p>To add to purely anecdotes ... A Yale study finding that in 2005 only less than 0.1% of the us was a strict vegetarian which contradicts the numbers in the above study</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to draw any conclusions from people's self-reported dietary identity though. For example I'm neither a vegetarian nor a vegan, but I know someone who is an occasional vegetarian (for religious reasons) but only during certain times of year. He eats significantly more meat than me on a daily basis - maybe up to a pound per day. I eat maybe a pound per week.</p>
<p>He might answer &quot;yes&quot; to the vegetarian question depending on how it's phrased. I probably would not, even though by some definitions you could say I am &quot;avoiding meat consumption&quot; (really I just find it annoying to deal with cross-contamination issues at home, and also I only buy fairly expensive meat and I can't afford to eat $35/lb meat for every meal).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely complicated, as it seems the US is eating more meat:</p>
<p>And according to this pew research study only 3% of people are <em>strict</em> vegetarians/vegans.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a bizarre number of people think vegetarians can eat fish. Including some people who call themselves vegetarian. If it's got eyes and a brain, vegetarians can't eat it. </p>
<p>Also stuff like gelatine (which is obviously non-vegetarian) and other non-vegetarian ingredients. Animal rennet in cheese. Isinglass in booze, if you're strict.</p>
<p>One would need to be very careful in the wording, and fundamentally, most people don't know enough about what they consume to give the correct answer.</p></div>		</li>
