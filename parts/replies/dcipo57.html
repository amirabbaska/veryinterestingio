			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a dirt simple method that may or may not work for ya. Get some sort of white noise and a very uniform environment, I recommend a shower or something. Hang out in there, find a comfy position where your whole body feels pretty same-y. Then, just focus on the sound and feel of the water. </p>
<p>By focusing on something that truly doesn't matter to the fullest extent that you can manage you allow the rest of the world and your worries to fade into the background. And since the water doesn't matter, when your attention starts to slip you're under no pressure or obligation to snap that attention back. So over a long enough period of time, you just gradually give less and less of a shit about the water and lapse into zen. </p>
<p>TLDR: Think about water've done. </p></div>		</li>

Helps if your super tired or sad. Source: student who spaces out good 60% of lectures</p></div>		</li>
