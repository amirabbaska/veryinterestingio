			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, your DM makes stuff fall off?! What a monster! Ours would only do that if we're carrying something too large to strap to one's self. Usually we have to leave our rolling cart behind and come back for it later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, if we've made a foul up of something - otherwise you're basically just letting people have two rolls for the same attempt. It encourages players to stretch beyond their skill level, which takes away from the point of having party members who are crap at something things. </p>
<p>The joy for us is seeing each other fail horribly. It's comedy gold! </p>
<p>Maybe we're just not nice people :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Verily much so!
But only the cruelest DMs don't allow a second roll on something that was missed just by so much.
But the DM would be absolutly in his right as DM to say &quot;You failed your throw, your fingertips just barely touch the ledge as your plummet down the dark chasm&quot;
If you're really lucky the DM might roll the damage the fall and landing brought uppon you and you might walk away from that, but what happens next, none knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool. My only real exposure to D&amp;D is through games like Baldur's Gate, where things like that are determined based on character stats and equipment.... and luck I suppose has a play in saving throw chances?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DCs can be set to whatever the DM feels appropriate based on circumstances. However, and this is important, there a pretty thorough guidelines on the bulk majority of actions a player will take. As the players get more experienced they will become familiar with these guidelines. So the player may know that the rulebook suggests a DC of 10 for climbing a rope, and if you decide to alter that you better be able to explain to the player why! Maybe the rope has been greased, or it is very windy, or you are getting arrows shot at you. Maybe all of the above!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DM determines the difficulty class (DC) based on how difficult the action should be, or if you're using a premade quest sometimes they'll have the DC laid out for you for specific tasks. As a general rule, the DM decides between the DC being 5, 10, or 15. 5 being relatively easy, 10 being more difficult that may require some knowledge or skill, and 15 or higher being something that takes a miraculous feat or lots of training to know how to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually long jump up to your strength score (if you get a 10 ft running start) so if you have over 15 strength you can jump across that pit with no check.</p>
<p>Edit: and since your hypothetical character has a +3 bonus to his check, that means he has 16 strength which means HE DIDN'T HAVE TO ROLL IN THE FIRST PLACE</p></div>		</li>
