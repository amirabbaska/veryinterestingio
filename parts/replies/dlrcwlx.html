			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to mention that, generally speaking, this is <em>not</em> how most glitches like the one OP mentioned are discovered. Most of them are discovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler" target="_blank">disassembling</a> the game's binary to figure out how it's interacting with the hardware, and inspecting that code to find exploits. Often times games, especially older ones, would have to use various &quot;tricks&quot; to workaround the severely constrained hardware they were working with, and a side-effect of these tricks was that certain sequences of inputs could end up essentially corrupting the intended state of the hardware/memory, and in some cases allow user input to control the content of certain special segments of memory that control game behavior in specific, intentional ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was another couple of guys who manipulated the code of a Mario World save file in just the right way that it would allow them to load custom code with just standard controller presses, which they used to load a custom hex editor to basically let them do anything wanted to the game. Game genie like codes, rearranging level elements, you name it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's any Halo 2 players out there, you might remember both the BXR and the double shot (RRX YY RRX) with the Battle Rifle. Both of these were exploits of the game which are similar to the pump action glitch mentioned above and when mastered, it could grant you a major advantage boost. A lot of the pros on the pro circuit back in the day utilized these and the glitches were a major part of competitive play, especially the BXR. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention super jump glitches.  On xbox, it was generally easy to find where you had to jump, just go to friends menu, and come back.  The map would be loaded in as a bare bones, and pretty much texture less version.  Jumping into the edge between two conflicting  planes is usually what got you air.</p></div>		</li>
