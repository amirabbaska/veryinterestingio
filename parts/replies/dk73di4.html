<p>Post a random obscure question that only an extremely select few people would even know about, with everyone else just giving educated guesses.  Out comes THE DAMN GUY (OR GAL) WHO DESIGNED THE DAMN THING, and explains in detail how it works.</p>
<p>Thank you random redditor who thought &quot;hey, my buddy worked on this. let me forward this post to them&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries, this is a forum where experts dumb down difficult concepts for the layman. Difficult topics are hard to simplify, but I think you had a pretty good and comprehensive explanation. </p>
<p>One question I had, and maybe not the most sophisticated, but what is the coolest thing you know about the ISS? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 means &quot;Explain Like I'm 5&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, they are looking for a more simplified explanation but it doesn't literally have to able to be understood by a 5 year old, although it's nice when that happens too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar panels generate electricity. Batteries store energy and keep the system topped off.  Systems have many redundancies to make them more resilient and voila, you have a space station. </p>
<p>Also tiny gun that shoots molecules of a noble gas. Mr. Noble gas grabs a bunch of electrons on his way out the door keeping the overall ambient stored energy low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrical things can build up a spare electrons. Once there are enough of them they can create a spark which can short out electrical equipment or worse. So they put a gas on the space station that sucks up the spare electrons. After the gas sucks up the spare electrons it is farted out of the ISS.</p>
