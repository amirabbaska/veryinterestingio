<p>The driver of a rocket engine is Mass Flow of propellants into the combustion chamber. It's mass, velocity and pressure help determine
the exhaust velocity along with the natural chemistry.</p>
<p>We get this high pressure and flow with turbomachinery, specifically turbo pumps.  We are pushing the propellants with the pump side and getting work off the turbine side.  When we dump the burnt propellants we call that a Gas Generator or tap-off engine, when we re-inject the exhaust into the chamber we call that a staged-combustor.</p>
<p>the problem is that the burnt propellants run above the melting point of the turbines.  So in a gas generator we run fuel rich to drop the combustion temperature and we dump the exhaust overboard.  In a tapoff, we add a little fuel as a dilutent, and dump the exhaust.</p>
<p>In a staged combustor,  we have to run that exhaust back into the chamber, so it's much hotter, and higher pressure,  if you run fuel rich, there is soot, strange molecules, etc in there. The carbon wants to form tars, benzenes, mixed organics, etc  and it clogs stuff up.</p>
<p>So you run Ox Rich with a hydrocarbon fuel.  Then it's a clean exhaust of CO2, H2O, and some hot free oxygen...</p>
<p>Oh yeah, hot free oxygen...  That stuff acts like an oxy-acetylene torch and tears up metal.</p>
<p>So the russians figured out the metallurgy to keep the metal together.</p>
<p>Smart guys, those russkies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>well, it's not so simple... In the hellacious fires that happen in a rocket engine, you get all sorts of strange species. Even in just a Hydrogen/Oxygen engine, your exhaust is going to contain O2, O+, H+, H2O2, OH+, O3, and whatever combination of the propellants you can think up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but that's because you run fuel rich in the ssme</p>
<p>Those species are unstable and burn down to water</p>
<p>In fuel rich hydrocarbon the scatter products are stablish unless you run excess oxygen then it burns away but it attacks the metal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of helpful links : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a Youtube channel with archives from the soviet era : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrQCvH6ykN590j3giSzjDQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrQCvH6ykN590j3giSzjDQ</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>www.russianspaceweb.com is a great site, with a lot of information about russian aerospace technology. It is a biased site though, very pro-russian, but still excellent.</p>
</li>
<li>follow Anatoly Zak on Twitter (the guy behind RussianSpaceWeb) for current spatial affairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, r/spacex is full of very knowledgeable people willing to answer questions regarding aerospace technology.</p>
<p>Same for Youtube, with the right key words you can find many documentaries about their shuttle Buran, their moon rocket N1 or the Glushko/Korolev fascinating rivalry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More from the fact that it burned hydrogen. And the choice of hydrogen had more to do with just getting the best specific impulse.</p>
<p>SpaceX is using RP-1 for their reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, so it's not like you can't go that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Some of the competitors to the engine chosen for Space Shuttle were combined cycle. They went with a more conservative design so for servicability and reliability. Between flights the SSME's were overhauled and worn parts like the injector heads were regularly replaced.  It was a state of the art engine, but it was created with reusability in mind.  </p></div>		</li>
