			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you thank you thank you, this is what i had an issue with but couldn't put into words. I felt the abiguity in the question lied in what 99% accuracy <em>means</em> - and you're saying they usually indicate what it means in terms of positive and negative tests. </p>
<p>Thanks for that. And that's a good system for probabilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to add in that part of what might be adding to the confusion is the word problem itself. It just doesn't make sense. In this scenario you are being tested for the disease <em>because you suspect you have it,</em> but then the word problem assumes that all 10,000 people in the population pool would also be tested. Those two things don't jive with each other and that isn't how real life works. I found it confusing, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah yes, I'm still trying to find the guy who buys 105 watermelons from the grocery store from that math problem I read 3 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the media will often report these things as '98% accurate', which is often simplified from the formally specified 'specificity' and 'sensitivity'. Often they will just use the sensitivity (how good it is at detecting the disease) and ignore the very important specificity (how well it detects not having the disease, which is 1 - the false positive rate).</p>
<p>In this case, we should assume sensitivity == specificity == 99%; because otherwize the answer is 'no information given, so the results are meaningless', which is often the case in the real world!</p>

<p>This is something that needs to be part of basic maths, because we all make live decisions based on this sort of understanding of probabilities, and most people, even highly trained people, have no idea about it. The human brain is really bad at comprehending probabilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right (though 99% accuracy means that it's right 99% of the time. What they're not saying is which way the 1% is wrong.)  </p>
<p>My first thought was that maybe the false positives and false negative wash each other out, but that's obviously not what they were going for.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but it is easy to think that they were giving you a false negative rate and the test had a 0% rate of false positives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this actually standard? I always assume a symmetric confusion matrix if I'm not given explicit FP and FN rates but rather just an &quot;accuracy&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what are the chances that a test to find a certain gene or protein or whatever would just-so-happen to have exactly the same rate of FP and FN?  I'm not sure whether you're saying that you've done a lot of homework problems where they use that convention (which some textbooks might use, I don't know), or you are in a field where you work with a lot of tests like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Logically/Grammatically the question is correct, the test is accurate 99% of the time. If you have the condition it'll be correct 99% of the time, if you don't have it it'll be correct 99% of the time.</p>
<p>It's correct it's just not written helpfully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. It's like saying &quot;I've always called my mother 'Mom' and my grandmother at least once a month.&quot;  It's not like it is an ambiguous sentence, but it's not a good way to teach English to foreigners.</p></div>		</li>
