<p>A power lifter has no requirement to keep his weight down, it is all just a matter of how much power he can supply, how muscular he can become</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to note, for most Olympic weightlifters, which is what OP asked about (albeit using the non-Olympic squat as an example), this is definitely <em>not</em> true because weightlifting is done in weight classes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but athletes in lower weight classes typically lift less, whereas record-setting lifts are typically done by the heaviest lifters.  So in that sense, the spirit of what u/picksandchooses said holds true.</p>
<p>Also, there's a school of thought that weight lifters should <em>not</em> try to cut weight, but should gain weight so they won't compete against lifters who are the same weight but shorter. <a href="https://www.strongerbyscience.com/which-weight-class-is-best-for-you/" target="_blank">Here is a piece describing the idea of &quot;height classes&quot;.</a>  Arguably, this could hold true in wrestling, as well, though my intuition says it would probably not be as true in boxing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anything, I'd expect weight to be more useful in wrestling and height to be more useful in boxing.  Wrestling you're grappling with people and having more weight to throw around seems like it'd be more useful than a little bit of leverage.  But in boxing your height translates to arm length which translates to being able to keep your opponent away from you; I expect that the extra reach is worth more than a tiny bit of extra force in a punch from having more weight.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true for competing in Olympic competitions, but not true of lifting things in general, which is what the question was about.  OP wasn't actually asking about weightlifting in the Olympics, he was asking about weightlifting versus running with Olympic weightlifting just being an example.  </p>
<p>In fact, the existence of weight classes in competitions further reinforces the idea that &quot;bigger is better&quot; in terms of lifting things.  If that wasn't the case, there wouldn't be a need for weight classes.</p></div>		</li>
