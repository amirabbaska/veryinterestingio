			<div class="markdown"><p>Heating the food will kill most bacteria yes. However toxins produced by the bacteria while it was alive are not necessarily inactivated by heating; this is primarily why reheating rice can be problematic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who is ServSafe certified, let me expand on this. Here are the true minimum cook temps. The specified food must reach this internal temp for at least 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Most seafood 135</p>
<p>Beef 145</p>
<p>Pork 155</p>
<p>Poultry 165</p>
<p>Any ground or stuffed food 165</p>
<p>When reheating anything it must reach 165</p>
<p>Now in regards to cooling food. There are two tempts you need to know.  70 and 41. When cooling the food must reach 70 or less with in the first two hours or it must be tossed. And it must reach 41 or less with in 6 hours of starting to cool it.</p>
<p>In regards to hot holding (keeping food warm for serving) it should be kept at 140.</p>
<p>EDIT: all temps are Fahrenheit because America. (Sorry)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is way oversimplified, BTW. The government, fit dinner reason, focuses only on near-instantaneous pasteurization temperatures. If you're willing to hold food at lower temps for longer periods of time, though, you can pasteurize it to safe levels at much lower than 140F. Most things can't survive long over 120F.</p>
<p>OP's gf is definitely wrong, but the fridge manufacturers will tell you not to put hot food in the fridge either because it can drag the temp of everything else into the danger zone for awhile. Best is to cool cooked food rapidly before putting it in the fridge (though not practical for most people).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, found on the 'net: &quot;It's fine to place hot food directly in the refrigerator. Don't worry about overheating the fridge — as the U.S. Department of Agriculture points out, the refrigerator's thermostat will keep it running to maintain a safe temperature of 40° F or below.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only time you need to worry about overheating the fridge to the point it cannot cool itself fast enough to not cause the food inside to spoil, is when you're dealing with gigantic vats of soup and other large things like that. For normal meals, even big ones, there is no need to worry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention a big pot of soup that was boiling with the lid is sterile inside. If the lid it tight it will keep good for days at room temperature. Certainly let it cool before putting it in the fridge or don't even bother. Just recoil it next time you open the lid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And my fridge, and probably many others nowadays, even have a nice feature such that if you put a large mass of not-cold stuff in the fridge, you can hit a button and it will 'turbo cool' the contents to get them down to a safe temperature much more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with placing hot food directly into the fridge (with a lid) is that the food may not properly cool. I used to be a food safety auditor - we would recommend that restaurants store food in the fridge with the lid loosely covering the container, since dripping condensation is another risk.</p></div>		</li>
