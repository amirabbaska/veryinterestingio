			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me add to that that Supersymmetry (SUSY), Supergravity (SUGRA) and String Theory are all somehow related. </p>
<p>Supersymmetry theories are contained in Supergravity theories (In technical terms: 'Supergravity is just gauged supersymmetry'). </p>
<p>On the other hand, certain Supergravity theories arise at a low energy limit of String Theory. If you take a limit in String Theory where your string length goes to zero, you arrive at Supergravity theories.</p>
<p>So in the end these theories are all not 'different', rather hierarchical: SUSY &lt; SUGRA &lt; String Theory</p></div>		</li>

<p>it's our simplest approach at a unifying theory. I'd say there's still a 50% chance that it's entirely wrong</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What measurements (experiments &amp; range of values) could be made that would invalidate current string theories? My understanding is that our current particle accelerators are getting to the ability to probe Susy, but Strings are still way beyond those. So these would presumably be theoretical (or maybe cosmological?) experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. I don't know. I was closer to a mathematician than an experimentalist. I'm a sufferer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_effect" target="_blank">Pauli effect</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum field theory. Master it. In tiers of difficulty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Klauber &amp; Mandl/Shaw</li>
<li>Schwartz &amp; Maggiore</li>
<li>Srednicki</li>
<li>Weinberg</li>
</ul>
<p>Peskin and Schroeder is a phenomenologist or experimentalists' book, I wouldn't suggest reading it if you are interested in theory. </p>
<p>Also differential geometry a la &quot;Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity&quot; or Nakahara is a necessity. And last, any of the millions of group theory books out there. I haven't read much of it yet, but Zee's &quot;Group Theory in a Nutshell&quot; looks fascinating. </p>
<p>West or Becker/Becker/Swartz seem to be the new standard introductory string theory books. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks very much. I did my BSc at a fairly shit uni which had fairly limited theoretical possibilities (the only guy who knew anything about GR was a violent alcoholic so I'm basically self taught courtesy of Dirac), and I've had a PhD thesis I've wanted to do since first year. I'll let you know if and when I get anywhere. </p></div>		</li>
