			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay thank you for the reply. So we do include them, they just happen to cancel out.
Where as the neutrons did not, which is why they had an affect on the calculation. I understand now, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>no, the system was defined in such a way that they are already a part of the calculation, and as such have no need to be explicitly included.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Electronic binding energies are very small on nuclear physics scales, so they're often neglected when they show up explicitly in calculations.</p>

<p>This. A photon at ~1.4 eV can pop an electron out of a PV panel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the energy needed to promote an electron from the conduction band to the valence band, not the energy needed to take an electron from the material to the vacuum. For that, you need about 3 to 7 eV for most materials.</p></div>		</li>
