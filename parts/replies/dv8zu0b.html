			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't PET the one that's more commonly used in water bottles? That's a different polymer than PE. Admittedly my knowledge on polymers is limited as the courses I took in college weren't focused on the chemistry of polymers, but from what I can recall there is a  certain amount of the polymer and some impurities (byproducts of the synthesis) that come off as the bottle is used and time goes by. I'd imagine there is also a mechanical wear caused by constant use of the bottle that could potentially cause some of the plastic to be within the matrix of the water (not necessarily dissolved in it).</p></div>		</li>
