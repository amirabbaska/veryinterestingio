			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to this one since it was the first answer.</p>
<p>This wasn't necessarily as big of a problem in WW2, since they just moved the guns to fire outside of the propeller arc on many plane designs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In WWI the pilot was required to manually operate the gun so it had to be near him; there could only be one gun and it had to fire through the propeller.  In WWII fighters the pilots just pushed a button to fire so there was some electrically operated automatic mechanism for firing the guns.  This meant they could have multiple guns and mount them in the wings, angled in to converge some distance ahead.  Firing through the propeller was no longer an issue.  I'm pretty sure that if there were any WWII single-seat, single-engine fighters that fired through the propeller, they would have been obsolete types.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the A6M Zero had 2 machine guns that fired thru the propeller.   and killed many Americans.  hardly obsolete.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't that the pilot had to manually operate the gun, many WW1 planes had a button on the stick to operate the trigger. It was that with the handling of WW1 planes, it was far easier to aim straight ahead of the plane rather than try and worry about aiming guns outside the propeller. Also the machine guns of the time need to be manually reloaded so keeping the gun close to the pilot made reloading easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love how the entire engine rotated. Always wondered if the cylinder bores wore unevenly due to centrifugal force slinging more lubrication to one side of the cylinder wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um. Which aircraft?  There <em>were</em> planes with rotating engines, although I seem to recall that these were mainly from WWI, and there weren't that many of them.  I think most of these were radials, so the centrifugal force would have forced lubrication towards the cylinder head, not the side of the cylinder.  </p>
<p>One problem with these rotating engines was that they sprayed castor oil <em>everywhere</em> -- those goggles you see on WWI pilots were coated in engine lubricant throughout the flight.  Along with their faces and clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, talking about the rotating LeRohne engines. Centrifugal force on a rotating cylinder had to yield some uneven lubrication on those cylinder bores.</p></div>		</li>
