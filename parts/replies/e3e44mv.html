<p>Wood burning releases volatile phenols that are (wonderfully) part of the main components of what we smell in smoking things like meat or oak treating beverages.</p>
<p>My guess is that they're adhering to the grapes and just adding the sensory effect on top of any oak treatment the wine would get. You don't necessarily want strong oak flavors in <em>all</em> of your wine. In addition, you don't want toast like whiskey...maybe...in your Pinot grigio.</p></div>		</li>
