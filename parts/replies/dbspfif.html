If that's the case, you need the same number of panels just angled more steeply and spread over a larger area. As there's plenty of spare land at the poles, shouldn't we be able to generate electricity at the same cost as on the equator? Now if we just built long distance transmission lines from both poles, we've got cheap energy 24/7.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, for the most part. What you are describing is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#Projection_effect" target="_blank">projection effect</a>. This effect basically says that the irradiation of a beam decreases as the angle to the surface becomes shallower, since its projected area becomes larger <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Seasons.too.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. This is the main effect that reduces the insolation at the poles. On top of that, the effective optical path of the light is longer and so more of it is lost to atmospheric scattering and absorption. Both of these effects serve to reduce how much energy you can collect with say a 1m x 1m solar panel. Now of course you could compensate for this reduction by building more solar panels, but the same argument works everywhere on Earth. For economic reasons, it seems more practical to place such large installations in deserts closer to populated regions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some brief googling shows that solar installations commonly use tracking. Wouldn't this erase most of the difference?</p>
<p>You still lose due to atmospheric depth and probably need bigger spaces between panels in order to avoid shadowing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's your problem.  It's brutally expensive to maintain infrastructure in the high Arctic.  For one thing, there's rarely land access via road or rail, so all maintenance is done via helicopter fly-ins.  And this isn't even considering the incredible engineering and logistical challenges that would have to be overcome during construction.</p>
<p>Second, even if you got over the insane costs of maintaining a transmission line from the pole, you'd have to have some pretty sophisticated technology to transmit the electricity over thousands of kilometres.  Ordinary high-voltage AC transmission lines that you commonly see here in the south are only designed to run tens of kilometres, or perhaps hundreds at the extremes.  High voltage DC is a possibility, but even then it's not really designed for more than a thousand kilometres.</p>
<p>Far from being cheap energy, it would end up being one of the most absurdly expensive sources you could come up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absurd if you intended polar solar power to be used far away, but perfectly usable if you're using it there. The whole point behind solar is that it's fairly easily deployable in a distributed power topology, and it excels where the only other way to get power to a remote location is by flying in fuel for generators.</p></div>		</li>
