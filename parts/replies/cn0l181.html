			<p>Well, wasn't it around 2007 when the financial meltdown started that taught a lot of people the hard way that hard work and dedication don't mean jack?  It's not simply that people abandoned the idea of hard work.  A contributing factor in that attitude was a painful demonstration that hard work isn't enough, that stable employment and loyalty the company you work for aren't things you can depend on.  </p>		</li>
