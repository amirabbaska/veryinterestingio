			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean how many bacteria they are usually in the 1.0x10*9 Cells before it gets too crowded.</p>
<p>If you mean what nutrients are in them.</p>
<p>Nutrient agar contains 0.5 percent peptone, which is an enzymatic digest of animal protein. Peptone is the principal source of organic nitrogen for the growing bacteria. Nutrient agar also contains 0.3 percent beef extract, which contains water-soluble substances which aid in bacterial growth, such as vitamins, carbohydrates, organic nitrogen compounds and salts. The last component of nutrient agar is 1.5 percent agar, which is the solidifying agent. Is the standard composition.</p>
<p>There are then other things added to make the agar's selective for growing a certain type of bacteria, such as Human blood agar, Skim milk agar etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the bacteria change the nutrient composition in a significant way?
My question was a bit unclear, this was actually planned to be about a cup filled to the brim with bacteria and the broth.</p>
<p>I imagine it strongly depends on what kind of bacteria, as some do produce quiet harmful, and in general very different, substances during their metabolic process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the broth itself is quite nutritious usually, made of a gel that is rich in protein/amino acids and other important nutrients. You an often eat it, but I wouldn't unless it's classified as food grade and prepared with clean lab equipment.</p>
<p>Now, the bacteria... well some types of bacteria can make you sick, but others are fine (probiotic yogurt is full of bacteria).</p>
<p>If you grow some edible bacteria on food grade agarose gel... it might make a surprisingly healthy breakfast. May not taste so good, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was mentioned as a reply to another thread, but there are things in the broth that would make you very ill/kill you in those quantities. As for the virus/bacteria itself, it is very dependent on what it is. It could range from slow painful death to mild discomfort (ignoring the broth problem for now).</p></div>		</li>
