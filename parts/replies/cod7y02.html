<p>I am aware that that isn't actually how temperature is defined, but I've never understood the more technical definition.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>More precisely, it's related to their average kinetic energy. The distinction is that there is no limit on how much kinetic energy a particle can have (if it has mass). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the answer to his question is yes, the maximum possible temperature is when all particles are going at c. But particles with mass cannot ever reach c (only approach it infinitely), so there is no upper bound on temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually, at high enough energies, the idea of well-defined, single particles that move at a certain speed no longer makes sense. I could go into detail about certain examples of this if you like, but the issue is that before you reach the point where &quot;all particles are moving at c,&quot; such a description would no longer even make sense. So this is why you don't reach a fundamental maximum temperature that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does a sufficiently high energy means that the particle actually warps spacetime as it goes and causes gravitational waves? (Thus shedding energy.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, for much the same reason that if you supply enough thermal energy to an ice cube it will eventually &quot;decay&quot; into liquid water. The transition from protons and neutrons etc. to the quark-gluon plasma is much like melting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard in undergrad that the binding energy of quarks is higher than the energy to create more quarks. So if you try to pull a quark out of a proton, you'll actually just create a quark anti-quark pair and the proton will stay a proton. Am I misremembering? It seems you could define a maximum possible temperature (roughly) as the point at which new particles are spontaneously being generated so fast that the temperature stops increasing no matter how much energy you put into the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How? If you just increase kinetic energy by accelerating it in a big fancy loop, then how the insides gain more and more energy to break apart?</p>
<p>Or if you just radiate a chunk of matter with higher and higher energy photons, won't that just simply tear up the nuclei without as much as asking oh are you a bit cold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're raising a philosophical point here more than a scientific one. What is the difference between those two alternatives? What we call &quot;physics&quot; basically consists of the laws we can write down, and if those laws stop working we say that the physics breaks down. It's not that reality suddenly stops functioning (as far as we know), but it is the case that our &quot;physics&quot; stops functioning in a well-defined way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semantically he has a point though.  We don't have separate terms in common parlance to separate &quot;our known physics&quot; from &quot;the fundamental physics&quot; we're trying to describe with that math.</p>
<p>In theory we could have a word for the physics of reality and a separate word for the accumulation of models we've built to represent it, but we don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is worth mentioning that we actually have no clue if our theories even do &quot;break down&quot; at these scales - were just stuck in the less than satisfactory situation of having two incompatible theories that appear to simultaneously be of relevance at these scales. Basically we found the scales by just shoving together some numbers that pop up in the theories and (drum roll) out comes some ridiculously large (or small) numbers. </p>
<p>It seems to me that there's little reason to believe that a complete breakdown of the physical reality is possible - it hasn't so far, right? Seriously though, from the point of view of natural science there's not much of a point in discussing the possiblity of a completely breakdown of reality, i.e. a crash in physical laws (because what would cause them - what governs the crash? Which interaction has occured that caused it to happen? and so on. Also, we can't really establish an empirical measurement proving that a complete break in the laws of physics will happen.).</p></div>		</li>
