			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrode insertion during deep brain stimulation does actually injure the brain, but it's a very small injury since the electrode is very small. For example, when we do DBS surgery for Parkinson's disease, it's common for the micro-injury to produce a temporary improvement in the patient's disease symptoms, before we even turn on the stimulator (this is known as post-thalamotomy effect). </p>
<p>Our understanding of memory is terribly incomplete, but you are generally correct, there isn't a single place where all the memories are &quot;stored,&quot; so the idea of &quot;downloading someone's memories&quot; with a static electrode is probably pure science fiction.</p></div>		</li>
