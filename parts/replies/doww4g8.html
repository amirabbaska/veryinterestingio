			<div class="markdown"><p>I find there absolutely is.  Higher is only better to a certain point, and then it's not.  Materials get thicker and they sure get <em>hotter</em>.  As someone who wants to be cool when sleeping, I went through lots of testing with expensive cotton sheets in varying thread counts and then discovered bamboo and have never looked back.  Pure bliss.  Better than any high thread count I'd ever tried.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, as threads go up in count they also become thinner and finer.  This results in a very thin weaker fabric after a point though.  Really depends on what's the limit diameter wise of your starting materials.</p>
<p>Now, if you're using the same size threads for different thread counts?  Yes, stuffing more threads into the same size space will result in stiffer fabric all other things being equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that the whole issue has become much more complicated than that.  If you look on Amazon, many sheet sets are claiming a 1000-1500 thread count.  If you look at some of the incredibly expensive sheet sets, their TC is much lower, like even 200.  </p>
<p>I researched this matter a while back and I can't say I remember the particulars, but it had something to do with weaving loose fibers into the sheet and counting those as threads.  There is a real, practical limit as to how many threads woven from cotton can physically be woven into (in this case) a square inch.  The article I read basically said that 1000-1500 TC is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The prices on Amazon reflect this argument.</p>
<p>Also, IIRC, there is a difference in the feel and durability of a bed sheet based on how it was woven (percale, sateen?).  Again, I'm drawing on something I read quite a few years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wouldn't be surprised if those numbers are completely made up. No loose fibers counted as threads, just bullshit.</p>
<p>Amazon has great customer service and you're unlikely to get brand-name &quot;counterfeits&quot;, or you'll get your money back if you do. If it says it's an Apple computer, it is. For this reason people seem to think Amazon is a reliable/honest place to shop.</p>
<p>But other types of advertising are blatantly false and Amazon never does anything about them. One I'm familiar with is &quot;5000mah&quot; 18650 size batteries. They aren't &quot;counterfeits&quot; because they're not pretending to be a Panasonic battery, nor does Panasonic even make a battery of those specifications, nobody does. They are instead &quot;fakes&quot;, pretending to be something they aren't, but not violating any brand's intellectual property. It seems like this would break some sort of false advertising law, but sellers can get away with this on Amazon. </p>
<p>So as long as those cheap Chinese sheets aren't claiming to be JC Penny brand when they aren't, Amazon will let them lie about any other aspect of their specifications. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not affiliated with that company in any way, besides having made several satisfactory purchases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The super high thread counts are for synthetic materials that use microfibers, so they get a lot more thread count. It's not a fair comparison and doesn't mean the same for the synthetic fibers compared to the non-synthetic fibers.</p></div>		</li>
