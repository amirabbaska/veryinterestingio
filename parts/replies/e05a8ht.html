			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation is good but I have to nitpick a little bit.</p>
<p>The red-shifting of the light is not caused by the Doppler effect. The biggest factor that is responsible for the red-shift is the expansion of the universe itself. Space itself is expanding which means that the wavelength of photons is stretching with it. The wavelength of a photon emitted billions of years ago experienced a lot of that stretching and is therefore in the microwave range.</p>
<p>The Doppler effect also changes the wavelength of photons that we perceive here on Earth (because distant galaxies are also &quot;regularily&quot; moving relative to ours) but the effect is very small compared to the increase of wavelength from the expanding universe (usually in the low single-digit percent range). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, how do we define bright?  Assuming we evolved mainly as surface creatures, one might expect our eyes to be optimized for a visible range of light intensities scaling roughly between the brightest natural lighting conditions (Earth day light) to the darkest conditions (night).  So it's natural that the gaps between stars would be near the bottom of our eye's detectable intensity ranges.  But how much visible light lies between the stars we see if we used a different scaling algorithm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Bright&quot; is essentially how much energy a given object sends us in the form of light (photons, electromagnetic radiation). If we have a device able to detect microwave light, then we can tell how bright an object is. </p>
<p>There is a lot of visible light in-between stars, indeed too faint for us to see it. You can already get an idea of it by looking at the night sky when in the middle of a large city and then very far away from any town. In a city, you see everything black. Far from a city, you see a sky <a href="https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/24/4ce53e48-3956-464e-9b97-411ac457d12f/resize/620x/f439cb43942f98040b902b1cb5771a91/great-basin-national-park-night-sky-b-620.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> by a clear night. If you're in a really dark place, you can set up a camera with a long exposure time and you'll see <a href="https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/assets/img/2017/07/12/cover-r4x3w1000-5965e80abcf43-054-novovlt0100174h.jpg" target="_blank">a much more crowded sky</a>.  At that point, you already have trouble pointing to an &quot;empty space between stars&quot;. Despite this picture being taken from the ground, where there is the atmosphere to block some light. </p>
<p>You can go further of course. With a space telescope and a very long exposure time, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/NASA-HS201427a-HubbleUltraDeepField2014-20140603.jpg" target="_blank">you might get the Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a>.  This was taken in a tiny empty space in the sky, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Csb0tNSWac" target="_blank">this video is a good representation of it</a>.  And you see that in-between two stars in our night sky, there are <em>thousands</em> of galaxies emitting in the visible or near-visible light. You can zoom-in on the Hubble picture to see that there are still very faint objects about everywhere. </p>
<p>So, to answer your question, there is a lot of very faint light between the stars in our sky, in the form of thousand of galaxies.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Going a bit further. It's however not completely homogeneous. There are areas in the sky where you'll see more objects and areas with fewer. At very, very, very large scale, clusters of galaxies are not spread around in the Universe but instead are distributed along &quot;filaments&quot;. <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Cosmic-void-1.jpg" target="_blank">Each dot in this (simulated) picture is a galaxy</a>. <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/815684/files/fig1.png" target="_blank">Another figure to show the scales I'm talking about</a>. What you see is that there are &quot;holes&quot; in this filaments structure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy\)" target="_blank">They are called a &quot;Void&quot;</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74IsySs3RGU" target="_blank">This video is a fantastic visualisation</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure how much I answered your question and how much I got carried away ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your reply somewhat misses the point /u/someotherdudethanyou was making. The question isn't about how we measure relative brightness, but about what current standard people have for saying something is &quot;bright&quot; in an absolute sense, or &quot;dim&quot;. </p>
<p>On a logarithmic scale there's infinite room on either end for brightness and dimness. The universe currently has particular brightness values, and we think as most of it (as seen in the night sky, the background in between the starts) as being dim. But the fact that we think of it as being dim is influenced by our evolution which is influenced by how much light are ancestors were exposed to. </p>
<p>Unless we had spent a lot of recent time evolving deep underwater or in a cave or something, it is inevitable that we would perceive the darkest parts of the night sky as being dim. There would be no value in having extra perception ability at the dim end of the scale.</p></div>		</li>
