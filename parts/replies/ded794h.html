			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The Latin V could be pronounced as either a V or a U. &quot;VENI VIDI VICI&quot; was most likely pronounced as &quot;Ueni Uidi Uici,&quot; but Venus (VENVS) did have both the V and U sounds. Whenever a U sound is followed by a long E or an I, it approximates a W sound, but technically isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;venus&quot; doesn't have both V and U sounds.
It has the W sound and the U sound.
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Venus#Latin" target="_blank">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Venus#Latin</a> says it's pronounced [ˈwɛ.nʊs], which most assuredly doesn't include the [v] sound.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that the v isn't pronounced as either /v/ or /u/, but as /w/ and /u/.</p>
<p>You seem to have mixed /v/ up with /w/.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure VENVS would have been pronounced like &quot;whey-noose&quot; or &quot;whey-nus&quot;, maybe &quot;when-us&quot; if you abide by classical pronunciation. </p>
<p>The church pronunciation that came later took the hard V, but we're not entirely sure when that trend began. </p>
<p>I could be wrong, but I've taken 5 years of Latin in Jesuit schools and this is how I was taught. All of my teachers were against the Church's pronunciation and advocated the classical.</p>
<p>Edit: The more I look at the word and the way it's used, the more I lean towards the long E pronunciation (way/whey). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia tells me that the 'UU' digraph stuck around in medieval Latin to represent the 'W' sound in German names. It was also still in use in Old High German. I believe the Norman's language was influenced by other local languages, including the Old High German, so they may have adopted its use from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't the French call it double-v though? </p>
<p>Also why was the UU digraph used originally? Was this essentially a random pick to represent the W sound or was there some reasoning here? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The W sound is pretty close to the 'oo' sound in food followed by a soft U like in fun. Both of these sounds can be represented by a U, so doubling it kinda makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
