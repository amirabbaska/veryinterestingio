			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, I think you made a layout mistake there, the -1 should be fullsized.  2^19937 -1</p>
<p>(the Mersenne method gets its name from Mersenne primes, which are primes that are in the form 2^k -1, where k is a positive odd integer.  Not all Mersenne numbers with odd k's are prime, but the method hits quite a few primes, more than random chance would suggest.  A Mersenne number with an even k is not prime, since it will have a not-necessarily-prime factorization of (2^m -1)*(2^m +1), where m=k/2. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries.  :D It's not like I was faultless--it's been pointed out to me that Mersenne numbers must have a prime k, not just an odd one.  Which in retrospect is obvious because 3 is prime at k=2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>there are plenty of other uses for PRNG, starting with pretty much any monte carlo method, which have application in statistics, machine learning, statistical physics, particle physics, biophysics, population genetics, etc... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, and encrypting a second thing under the key breaks it completely.  It's information theoretically secure, but not even IND-CPA^(1). For essentially all applications, there are <em>much</em> better encryption algorithms.</p>
<p>1 --- Encryption schemes that are IND-CPA secure essentially mean that if an adversary has access to some function f(m) = Enc_k(m), so some way of generating encryptions of whatever they want, it doesn't help them decrypt things.  So looking at how things change when they're encrypted doesn't really tell them any pattern.  This is essentially the weakest type of security that's used anywhere for encryption schemes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This contrast of &quot;real&quot; with &quot;computable phenomena&quot; is not something I'm familiar with in a computing context. If you're alluding to some physics material, please state so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only real use of PRNGs are either encryption (because they're completely predictable),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fundamental requirement for cryptographically secure PRNGs is the <em>next-bit test</em>: it should be computationally hard (read: not possible in polynomial time) to predict the (k+1)<em><em>th</em></em> bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 0.5,  given the first k bits of a random sequence. PRNGs that don't satisfy this requirement are not suitable for encryption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or a mechanism to generate random numbers faster (by continually re-seeding the PRNG with a lower-rate actual random source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two statements are completely incongruous. Seeding a PRNG is done when a different random sequence is desired. It has no effect on its performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like real (based on physical / hardware phenomena) vs abstract (calculated based on a preset seed value). </p>
<p>Good PRNGs are computationally difficult to predict, but it's hard to prove that a PRNG has no weakness that may increase its predictability. True RNGs are computationally impossible to predict.</p>
<p>The final quote you quoted I think you've misunderstood. Often true RNGs are slow. To generate numbers faster than the true RNG might allow directly, the PRNG is seeded with values from the true RNG.</p></div>		</li>
