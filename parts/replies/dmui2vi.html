			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotta say it certainly was inspiring, however it was a bit reductionist. While getting to Mars and colonizing it would be a HUGE deal, and people may not remember the specifics of the civil war in Syria, they'll definitely feel the impact of whoever wins decades from now. There's a sizable socialist faction in the north. For all we know, in twenty years there could be a large communist state in the Middle East. That's not something to scoff at. I get where he's coming from, but what's happening here on our planet still matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say he's trying to reduce the impact of what is going on in the Middle East, more trying to declare that on the scale of things, if we do colonize Mars then overall people are likely to feel this was a more momentous occurrence in history.</p>
<p>Now, this is of course adjusted by where the person in question grew up. If it was a Mars colonist then they are of course going to say that the Mars Landing was the biggest thing in a year that had both the landing and the creation of a socialist Middle East, because on a personal side of things the Landing is far more impactful to THEM. Meanwhile, for someone growing up in the socialist Middle East, they probably couldn't care less about the Mars Landing unless they happen to be a scientist, but even then they likely consider the creation of their nation to be more personally impactful.</p>
<p>The real question though is what will someone think that is largely unaffected by both of these events? Lets say someone in Argentina. They don't likely have much of a chance to get to Mars, they are in basically no way involved with or affected by events in the Middle East. Personally, I'd bet serious money that they are more likely to remember the Mars Landing.</p>
<p>The reason I'd argue this way is that something like the Mars Landing is fairly guaranteed to be watched the world over as it happens. It will probably be the most watched broadcast in history at the time it happens and then rebroadcast for days/weeks. Meanwhile, a new country being made....just isn't REALLY that big deal. In the last 17 years we've had 5 different countries come into formation, so it is not really a rare occurrence. Sure, if there was suddenly &quot;Peace in the Middle East&quot; then that might be significantly newsworthy, but I think it is fairly safe to say that even if all the governments of the Middle East swore to work together, you'd still have guerilla action and terrorist attacks for quite some time marring things.</p>
<p>Now of course, precisely which of those two events turns out to be more important 500 years later is dependent on far too many unknowns. Either one of the two entities could collapse within that time or rapidly rise to world/solar powers. The big reason why I'd imagine that Mars would be more memorable for that year is that it really ends up as a triumph of humanity, something people can take inspiration from no matter how disconnected they are from it. A country is....just a country. The vast majority of countries in the world don't REALLY have a huge impact on the day to day lives of the citizens of other countries. Remember, we've only had &lt;10 superpowers across history (depending on one's definition, nations like Rome count), so such entities are in the minority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's exactly what he meant.<br />
By listing all the major events that happened in 1942, which indeed still cast their influence on the modern world, and specifying that, outside of those interested in history, most people only remember Columbus' trip to the new world, he's just giving the same message as you.<br />
All events affect history, but only a few get remembered so strongly by the masses.<br />
Whatever the outcome of the current conflicts, setting up shop on Mars will be the event that people will remember in 5 centuries because, you know, it <strong>literally</strong> gave humanity new grounds to stand upon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers<br />
In the days when lands were few.<br />
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn.<br />
The sweetest sight ever seen.</p>
<p>And the night followed day<br />
And the story tellers say that the score brave souls inside<br />
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas<br />
Never looked back, never feared, never cried.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He's such an intense speaker. With every sentence can feel the conviction and nervous energy just straining to burst out of him, yet he maintains control of it and delivers something perfectly eloquent.</p></div>		</li>
