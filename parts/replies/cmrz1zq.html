<p>Google's search algorithms which use some sort of an eigenvalue problem (an eigenvalue problem is when you have a linear operator L, a vector v, and a number where Lv = av, the linear operator is just a scaling when applied to that particular vector).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a link to paper on it if anyone is interested; it's pretty fascinating. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.2306&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">The $25,000,000,000 Eigenvector: The Linear Algebra Behind Google</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: Anyone who has taken a regular linear algebra course should be able to follow it; it's pretty readable.</p></div>		</li>
