			<div class="markdown"><p>The UK isn't at all stringent on who can have something dot UK.  I have one.  There are only limits on certain third level ones like gov.uk ac.uk etc.</p>
<p>For a short time, co.uk and org.uk were supposed to be limited to appropriate groups, but it didn't much last.  Ltd.uk is still limited to registered limited companies, bit nobody wants it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you know how top level domains like .com and .org exist?  These describe the nature of the service you are connecting to - .com is commercial, and .org is generally for non-commercial organisations.</p>
<p>So, I guess the UK decided that this kind of thing was useful, but since their top-level domain was .uk, they decided to create these one level down.  As an example, educational organisations tend to use .ac (for academia), and so on.  I think it's a bit antiquated, but it's nice in some cases.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The .uk TLD was one of the first registered so it acts like a &quot;UK only&quot; version of the global TLDs like .net, .com, .edu and .org.   In the early days it was supposed that knowing whether you were dealing with a network provider, commercial, academic site or non-profit org. was of general importance.  </p>
<p>In time, there started to be a long list of international domains, like .museum, as well as regional TLDs such as .wales and .cymru.  In light of this, .uk ended up behind the times in not having second-level domains.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were stringent. The rules changed a couple of years ago. I think those with a .co.uk get first dibs on the .UK domain. </p></div>		</li>
