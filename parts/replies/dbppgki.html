			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the one I came for. It should just be automatically posted whenever this question gets asked. One of the best answers ever!</p>
<p>Edit: also the sub-reddit /r/f7u12 is just a compressed named version of the sub-reddit /r/ffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu . That's another very basic way of describing compression in 1 sentence to a redditor :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And from what I remember of the ZIP standard, the most correct for the specific question asked. ZIP doesn't play games with swapping Z's and TH's, and it doesn't (usually?) do anything with reading binary sequences. It simply builds an index of character sequences, and then in the compressed area it contains just the index numbers, as well as anything it didn't fit into an index.</p>
<p>Competing ZIP formats I think vary in how they generate the index, and the different compression levels come from how thoroughly the zipper scans the files beforehand/during compression, to maximize the efficiency of these indices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious, why did you do 1=hat and not 1=that? is it due to capitals making it less compressed (having 1=that and 2=That as 2 different values)</p>
<p>It seems like adding 1 letter to the first line and then removing it 3 times in the body would be better...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Because of the capitals not being the same letter.</p>
<p>In the first two sentences, the word is capitalized, in the third it is not. This would count as two different letters, meaning two separate indices.</p>
<p>Cheaper to use a subpattern and append. Especially when you can replace the &quot;hat&quot; in <em>what</em> or <em>hate</em> with the same index.</p>
<p>To continue, the Compression Level you choose when zipping a file is essentially how long the program takes to figure out many portion-of-data pieces it needs to maximize density and reduce index duplication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, remember that the compression can apply to itself in multiple passes. If ABCABCABC = DDD then DDD could be = E. </p>
<p>And you missed an opportunity with &quot;_them&quot; and inserting the space before &quot;green eggs and ham&quot;</p>
<p>1=hat</p>
<p>2=Sam-I-Am</p>
<p>3=I do not like</p>
<p>4=_green eggs and ham</p>
<p>5=you like</p>
<p>6=here or there</p>
<p>7=I would not like them</p>
<p>8=1 2!</p>
<p>9=_them</p>
<p>T8</p>
<p>T8</p>
<p>3 t8</p>
<p>Do 54?</p>
<p>34!</p>
<p>Would 59 6?</p>
<p>7 6.</p>
<p>7 anywhere.</p>
<p>34.</p>
<p>39, 2. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm struggling with 1=hat and not 1=That</p>
<p>Why write T1 in OPs example or T8 in yours instead of 1 or 8 if you just defined 1=That ?</p>
<p>[edit] ah! I figured it out.  It's an issue of upper and lower case letters...</p></div>		</li>
