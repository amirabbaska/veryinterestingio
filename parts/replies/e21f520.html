<p>I've never met a single person who prefers the massive dynamic range IRL. The responses in this thread suggest the majority of folks on reddit don't want dynamic range.</p>
<p>It feels like the people who are film school grads are making movies for other film school grads, and don't care at all about what the vast majority of consumers want. </p>
<p>Why isn't the default what the majority of consumers want, and let the audiophiles like yourself tinker in the setting to get the full theater experience if they want it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I don't have like a scientific study or anything if that's what you're after.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I preferred high dynamic range before realizing I even wanted to make movies, and all of my friends that I can think of that loved movies did too except for the one that lived with his parents still. I'm the only film student. The rest of those people are just regular people who love movies. </p>
<p>Another thing, it's pretty easy to decrease dynamic range using software. It's harder to do the reverse. (you still can, but you lose some information)</p>
<p>So, if we did it that way and shipped Blu-rays with low dynamic range audio, the people looking for a more pure cinematic experience still won't be happy.</p>
<p>It's the same thing with video compression. A highly compressed video is smaller and easier for a lot of people, but you can't go backwards from there and raise the quality. I don't want to buy a highly compressed Blu-ray. I bought a Blu-ray to get the highest quality possible.</p>
<p>I think a happy medium would be apply audio dynamic range compression to online streaming video, like iTunes or Google play and whatnot, and leave Blu-rays with high dynamic range because the whole point of Blu-rays is the quality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I won't pretend to understand how compression works in depth, but to my layman's perspective couldn't you just ship a disc with the same information on it, but set the compressed sound to default?</p>
<p>I guess I was being a little flippant asking for a source, but I am really curious what percentage of people want the cinema experience vs. just wanting to watch a movie without waking up their kids. To me the latter group seems far larger but that might be my own sample bias. For all I know I could be in the minority. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anybody with a sound system wants high dynamic range. The option is always there to turn it off for those that don’t. Things are good as is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer in the thread. Correct on all counts. The problem is with how people don’t understand dynamic range combined with how shitty these little built in TV speakers are now. Built in speakers are trash. Nobody should be using them. Sound bar at a minimum. </p></div>		</li>
