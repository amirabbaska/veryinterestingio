			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;as much&quot; though, it's little changes.</p>
<p>Plus, it's not like evolution has some end goal where &quot;intelligence&quot; is better than, say &quot;strong stomach acid that lets you eat carrion&quot; or &quot;the ability to climb well&quot;</p>
<p>It's a question of which mutations survived and improved survivability given natural selection.</p>
<p>That other apes are here suggests their adaptations from whatever our common ancestors were worked too. Same as the fact that some species have existed, largely unchanged, for millions of years - because they survive and pass on their genes.</p>
<p>I guess it's our ability to step back, look at it all and wonder about it that seems a huge conceptual leap. e.g An animal building a shelter or a crow using a tool still doesn't seem to demonstrate the self awareness of its existence and place not only on the Earth, but in a huge universe that we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did evolve but just kept evolving as we did, to adapt for purposes of survival and that's what they did. You don't adapt in a jungle of lions necessarily to be stronger than them because they may have a monopoly on that role so perhaps you evolve into a small mammalian species like a mouse to be able to still survive and thrive. That role is still just as evolutionarily valid as the role of lions, perhaps moreso, you could argue, because there's plenty of mice in the world. </p>
<p>There's more to surviving than being stronger, multiplying more (quality over quantity), being more intelligent, etc. There's many niches in the system and perhaps one day if the world fails humans by way of climate, meteorite, etc, other animals will survive because they happened to be in a role that suited it. Surviving in this world and universe is a lot more complicated than trying to go for the intelligence or strength niche. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intelligence doesn't evolve in a void. A trait only makes it through natural selection if it is immediately useful. Human (and prehistoric humanoids) have one key physiological advantage to any other primate: We only need two limbs for movement. As a result it comes natural to us to carry stuff. Casually bringing a thing from one place to another is a big deal. Another thing is that since we don't walk on them our hands don't need to be build to withstand a lot of pressure and can be much more delicate than primate hands to allow for more intricate interaction.</p>
<p>Thing is, a brain alone doesn't give you an idea. Opportunity does. The brain gives you the power to recognise a possibility. Why would using a stick as a weapon be a common idea among monkeys when they would never even think of walking around with a stick because it makes walking a hassle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posed this question yesterday but didn't get any response, but how much did dexterous hands also play a part in our rise? I think in a way it's just as important as a big brain. Dolphins have huge brains but their lack of hands keeps them from ever developing technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our body shape being bipedal-- er, walking on two legs (explaining this like you're five, after all) and having two dexterous hands likely played into our intelligence quite a bit. Before we had discovered fossils to verify what our ancestors actually looked like, the assumption was we would find something that looked like an ape with a big brain. The line of thought being, what truly separated us from the animals was our brain, so that came first and then we evolved this dexterous, tool-using body as a result, so we could take advantage of our big brains.</p>
<p>This was held in such firm belief, that a famous hoax, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown_Man" target="_blank">Piltdown Man</a> was designed to look just like that. They gathered pieces of orangutan and human skulls and buried them in such a way that it looked like the remains of an ape with a large brain.</p>
<p>Later, when we began to find and identify actual skeletons of or our early ancestors, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithecus_africanus" target="_blank">Australopithecus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus" target="_blank">Homo Erectus</a> we found the opposite of what was expected. It seems that humans developed the human-like body first and then later developed the large brains and intelligence that we have today. So, our bigger brains likely became an advantage when you have two free dexterous hands able to use tools, because bigger brains means better tools and the ability to learn from other tool-makers. This is of course in addition to other benefits that intelligence and a big brain confers, like being better at identifying things to eat and how to obtain them and outsmarting prey and living in large groups where you can divide labor and help one another, but I'm just focusing on the hands part, since that's what you were asking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kinda make sense that we developed better hands first then bigger brains. If a species developed bigger brains first, they might adapt in other ways that might not be conducive to making tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, bipedalism was a result of our unusually large heads. Among mammals, we have the largest cranium at birth. If we weren't bipedal, the female birth canal wouldn't be able to squeeze out a baby. </p>
<p>There was another theory if I remember correctly that bipedalism gave us an advantage over 4 legged animals in the Savannah as we could see predators lurking in the tall grass. Not sure if that's been discredited though.</p>
<p>Another interesting element about our evolution is that we're likely not done evolving our hips to accommodate childbirth. Babies skulls are made of three plates which don't solidify into solid plate until after birth, so in a case with narrow hips, babies come out looking like coneheads. </p>
<p>Ohhhh one last thing, we're actually one the few (if not only mammals) born premature. Almost all mammals are born with the ability to walk and kinda defend themselves within hours of being born. We can't walk for a good couple of months or defend ourselves and its debated that if we delayed birth until we were able to do so we'd never fit through the birth canal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting theory is the discovery of fire and, subsequently, cooking allowed our brains to develop. The brain is by far the biggest energy hog in the human body. By cooking food, humans were able to begin the digestion of the food before ingesting it and this led to more efficient absorption of nutrients. Also, if you have the ability to cook you gain access to other food sources that are usually tough and inedible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, those hands are pretty important. Human dominance comes from specialization. Without it, even with intelligence AND hands (=tool usage), we would not be able to produce much beyond our immediate needs. In production, there is a rule of thumb: Every time you double your output, you achieve a potential 20-30% gain in productivity. This is only meaningful if people specialize themselves. In a primitive tribe that would be e.g. hunters, gatherers, cookers, weapon-makers, children-raisers, tent-builders, fire-makers, medicine men, and so on...</p>
<p>imagine if you had to produce EVERYTHING that you own right now yourself! You would need years just to learn farming, building ovens, making fire etc - <strong>Just for a loaf of bread. We humans are more one collective intelligence than individual intelligences, at least if you ask why we dominate this planet.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if there is evidence to support your idea of specialized roles like you describe in hunter gatherer communities. Of course you are correct that we did do this and it's hugely important to the development of the modern human world, but I <em>think</em> specializations like tool makers etc are post agriculture and therefore not much to do with our evolution - we're talking only 20-30 thousand years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The human hand is one of the most insanely fine tuned pieces of organic machinery on the planet. It contains an absurdly dense amount of nerve cells and special nerve adjustments that make it incredibly sensitive to extremely small signals. Because of this, and the insane art that is the natural craftsmanship of our hands, the human hand has a dexterity for precision that other apes do not have, let alone the rest of the barbaric in comparison animals. </p>
