			<div class="markdown"><p>Most diplomats do that routinely, so being uprooted isn't too disastrous. </p>
<p>Source: parents are diplomats. I've lived in Moscow as an American diplomat's kid, so I can confidently state that most of them are bummed about losing their sweet digs in Georgetown more than anything else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's embarrassing as hell to be PNG'd but the diplomats at least know it's nothing they did themselves. Unlike their colleagues at the UN that get kicked out after their fourth DUI in Manhattan or getting caught smuggling drugs like the consulates down in South America. They're all going off to other embassies or to MFA jobs in Moscow, so it's far from the end of the world for them, professionally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone else pointed out that it’s not much of an inconvenience, but it makes the job less appealing to quality applicants in Russia. Why take a diplomat job to go to the US if you may get kicked out when you can take a private sector or other type of job that might get you there longer. </p></div>		</li>
