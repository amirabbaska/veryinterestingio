<p>Any two frames traveling at nonzero relative velocity experience time dilation. That is a relativistic effect, and so it exists across neutron starts, black holes, the earth, and a spinning plate. </p>
<p>What does that mean? Not much. With some pretty crude assumptions, you can claim that the earths core is about 2.5 years younger than its crust. That doesn't mean anything particularly interesting. It's not as if there's some fundamental &quot;time gradient&quot; causing weird effects between layers of the earth (or neutron star).</p>
<p>The most pronounced effect would be that an observer at the core would measure the frequency of an incoming photon as different than the frequency measured by an observer at the crust. </p>
<p>So do these relativistic effects show a difference in age between the core and crust of a given rotating body? Yes. In the spirit of your question, is that particularly meaningful? No. </p></div>		</li>
