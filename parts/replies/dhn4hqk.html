<p>Same logic with removing traffic lights after all the cars are driverless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to decentralize operations to some degree is expressly a goal of ADS-B. There's no radar coverage over the oceans and planes already handle route changes in a semi p2p fashion in order to get better ground speed. Much more can be done and is under investigation. If more high stakes automation comes it could appear in over ocean/polar routes first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, conflict resolution, the classic problem of determining when two planes might be in a position to hit each other soon and deciding what to do about it, and then issuing relevant orders to the planes.</p>

<p>Isn't that exactly what ACAS does?  I mean,  I get that it's not &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; but the outcome is the same.</p>

<p>Yea..  is that what we're bad at,  though?  1/6 of all roadway fatalities are pedestrians..  another 1/6 is young men under the age of 24 doing stupid things,  and another 1/6 is elderly people who aren't physically capable of handling damage from a minor accident.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik ACAS sucks. To take controllers out of the loop there needs to be something way better. But I've not looked at this issue in a few years so maybe some things suck less now? idk. Still there are lots of other issues as I mentioned.</p>
<p>As for the driverless there's still a lot of safety to be gained. Many of the cases you mentioned could still be improved by AI, especially the stupid. Plus there's systemic safety effects when every car is AI. Still I do think it's hard to estimate exactly what the benefits will be.</p>
<p>But there is some promising real-world data showing that even today's sorry excuses for AI drivers do save lives. In fact, such weakass data were enough to convince NHTSA to let Tesla continue its practice of using its own customers to beta-test fun new AI features. They figured that if it saves more lives than it costs, is ultimately a good thing in the end. They...... Do have a point.....</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry..  TCAS is what I was thinking of,  I just couldn't find the acronym.  That system seems like it's going to be the backbone of our future automation efforts.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We're missing a lot of steps in between where we are now and that particular point,  design,  standardization,  regulation and end-user financing are just a few.  Let alone,  plenty of drivers may simply not want it..  the real-world behavioral data isn't really available yet.</p>

<p>What data would that be,  I wonder.  How do you even draw up a study for that?  Is it fair to compare the safety of a self-driving car with a 13&quot; entertainment system in the center console to any other commuter?  A car that advertises it's performance with a &quot;ludicrous mode?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea ... once Deep Learning hits the point where 25% of the existing workforce can be replaced, it is going to be interesting. That is when the real robot wars will start.<br />
Driverless Vehicles is the first wave of this kind of redundancy, and I would not be surprised if all the trucking companies start fighting it.  </p></div>		</li>
