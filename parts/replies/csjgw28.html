			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question, I am guessing they could, but that is just a guess.</p>
<p>However, even if one state did that, federal law requires them to recognize marriages from all other states, so it would not be terribly effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can quite happily say to your religious freedom exemption hypothetical that they will be hypothetically told to go fuck themselves. If your religious beliefs interfere with your legally mandated duties, you can go find new work or rework your religious beliefs. This issue has come up with people such as Jahovah's Witnesses who want to be EMTs and with the exception of Indiana, thanks to their new law, the general rule is that you can believe whatever you want but if your beliefs interfere with your work obligations, especially in the public sector, you don't have the right to practice those beliefs at the expense of your occupational obligations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The eventual outcome is likely as you describe, but I would not be surprised if some lower court in Texas plays ball, and buys gay marriage foes a few months as it works its way back through the courts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it is very unlikely such a suit would prevail, but it could make for another few months of foot dragging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The government <em>must</em> issue a marriage certificate to all legally-qualified couples (that's not new!). Even if individual clerks are accommodated by being permitted to not issue, the government has to figure out some way to make sure that they meet the legal duty.</p>
<p>There have been a ton of court cases where individual government employees have tried to claim that their rights were infringed by being required to do a particular job, and they've all eventually ended the same way: the government has to make &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; for a belief, but creating a situation where a citizen can't receive a mandatory service is not a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p>Hobby Lobby is a private organization though; it's a different debate and a different standard.</p></div>		</li>
