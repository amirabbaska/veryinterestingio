			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pratical example, red is a pretty special colour in terms of animal research. </p>
<p>Lab rats and mice can't see through red transparent objects. We can give them red cages and/or hiding places and they will feel safer and experience less stress than standard hiding places and due to the transparency, researchers can look in and still observe their health/behaviour/other experimental outcomes. Quite literally a 'I can't see them so they mustn't be able to see me' scenario for the animal.</p>
<p>Nice cheap, easy method of refining your animals experience all because animals perceive different colours in various ways.</p></div>		</li>
