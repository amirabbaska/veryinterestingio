			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to point out a few things to supplement this info about AC for the grid and some things that point to a future of only DC.</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't use super high voltage in your house because the higher the voltage, the more likely it is to arc and at very high voltage, it will arc through insulation. To keep home wiring inexpensive, the voltage must be limited.</li>
<li>It is the power that kills. If you're hit with 10,000 volts at 0.01 amps (100 watts), it is basically the same as 100 volts at 1 amp (also 100 watts). Both probably wouldn't hurt you, but you wouldn't like it. Voltage does help the power penetrate your insulating skin and get into your more conductive juicy bits to cause more damage though.</li>
<li>Rectifying AC to DC is super easy and cheap. This can be used to create DC power from a spinning generator. There are also ways to generate DC directly and photovoltaic solar cells already produce DC (and are currently converted to AC through IGBT circuits for use on the grid).</li>
<li>Modern IGBT circuits to convert DC to AC are also pretty top notch and can produce super high frequency AC for more efficient transformer voltage changes.</li>
<li>DC to DC voltage converters are also becoming cheap and efficient. For lower current levels (tens of amps), DC to DC is just as efficient as the equivalent AC transformer.</li>
<li>Superconductors do not have transmission losses, so superconducting DC trunk lines are a thing now. As superconductor research improves, it should be possible to make all long distance lines superconducting.</li>
<li>Very few modern devices use the AC power directly, they all convert to DC via a rectifier. Only heating elements and some things with motors use the AC (toaster, hair dryer, vacuum, lower end cooling devices, etc). Even motorized devices have started creating their own DC bus to use with a DC motor (newer shavers and the like) or to turn int AC for a variable speed ac motor (high end fridges, newer HVAC systems, etc.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

<p>Will it really? I mean, it could, but it's extremely speculative. You'd either need to develop a higher-than-room-temperature superconductor (not sure if that is possible), or start cooling enormous chunks of wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that in your daily life, few modern devices use AC power directly, but behind the scenes, in factories and industrial plants, a very high percentage of motors use AC directly, and I would say that this represents a large percentage of the total power used from the generating plant. </p>
<p>But like you say, it's not rare to have a large DC bus at an industrial plant and run a set of VFD inverters off of it for variable speed motors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please note that this might change in the future. AC was chosen in the past because it was easy to transform to higher voltages. </p>
<p>DC has some advantages nowadays. Mostly because solar panels are DC and almost all of household devices are DC. DC to DC transformers are much simpler and efficient than AC-DC. </p>
<p>Also when using underground cables instead of above ground lines DC is more efficient for high voltages over long distances. This is because the cable starts to work as a capacitor that gets charged and discharged constantly. There are powerlines going over the see floor from the Netherlands to the UK and Norway both are DC and more than 400kV, which would have been impossible with AC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, and we're getting good at &quot;transforming&quot; DC to higher voltages with electronics, but still, nothing beats a real transformer for a cheap and robust way to convert voltages at very high power levels. </p>
<p>DC transmission is the best way to move lots of power over a long distance, and being underground is not really a consideration-- it could be overhead just as well. The disadvantage is that you have to convert it back to a lower voltage (at least, and currently convert it back to AC), which is expensive with specialized power electronics. So DC transmission, at the moment, is only ideal for a small set of situations. Another advantage of DC distribution is that it is immune to problems that AC has, such as power factor and frequency sag. And harmonics are easier to get rid of in a DC system (but more likely to occur because of all the switching power supplies converting voltages).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a question for the ages:  How much power is saved by avoiding the DC-&gt;AC &amp; AC-&gt;DC conversion?  What if I were to change some of my AC consumer devices (computer &amp; TV, and possibly going as far as electric range and refrigerator, and HVAC) to DC operation, what kind of energy savings would I see from a solar generating point of view?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, transmission voltages here in the states is 500kV. Some stations are at 765kV, while the, while outside of the US, a 1.15MV transmission station is active. So I wouldn't say we transform up to millions of volts to tranmit, but everything else sounded good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can't keep stepping voltage up forever because you run into another problem, dielectric breakdown of the air between your conductors, and must physically separate the conductors by about 10 meters or more at potential differences in the MV</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it depends.  If you break it down by mile of cable then that's probably more accurate.  If you break it down by MWhs transferred across then 500kv is probably up there.  It's also going to vary by region.  In the West there are a lot of 500kv lines.</p></div>		</li>
