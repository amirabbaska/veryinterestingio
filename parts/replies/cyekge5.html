			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia checking in, we say both, but &quot;Zed&quot; is the generally accepted pronunciation here. I actually often say either, depending on when it feels right to say one or the other. I constantly get chipped for saying &quot;Zee&quot; same with &quot;Zero&quot;, which is usually pronounced here as &quot;ohh&quot; or &quot;Naught&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NZ says both, and has accepted both British and American spellings of words being correct in its schools. This was useful for me, as I learnt a lot of my information online and on the early net most stuff I had access to was only produced by Americans. </p></div>		</li>
