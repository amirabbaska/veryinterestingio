			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer OP's question, are you saying that orthodontic braces are titanium?</p>
<p>EDIT: And stainless steel is usually not magnetic, so it won't be a safety issue?</p>
<p>This feels like Twenty Questions.</p>
<p>EDIT: It feels like a happy coincidence that stainless steel is not magnetic, would that be fair to say? It wasn't chosen to lessen the risk of teeth being ripped out during an MRI scan, for example.</p>
<p>And if braces happened to be strongly ferromagnetic, <em>would that be a safety concern?</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Years ago when I had braces, and after the fact when a dentist gave me a handful of the brace wire, it was made of a Shape Memory Alloy, which I believe was Nickel-Titanium alloy.  I was trying to make small robotic actuators out of the stuff.  </p>
<p>Have they changed the material braces are made from in the last 15 years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had braces as an adult.  In my case, the upper brackets were tooth-colored ceramic, lower brackets were titanium, and the archwires were both stainless.</p>
<p>My first round with braces as a pre-teen in the stone age had stainless everything.  There were definitely improvements and changes over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most stainless steels that we encounter in the run of a day are 300 series, either 304 or 316.  These are not magnetic.  400 series are magnetic, but have inferior corrosion resistance.  316 is implantable, 440 and 420 are used for surgical instruments. </p>

<p>So chances are nothing magnetic is going to be permanently or semi-permanently put inside of a person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry there's no such thing as an emergency MRI. MRI scans take a long time so they'd do X-rays and CT scans and possibly ultrasounds in emergency situations. MRI's need several steps of checks by staff to ensure there is no risk to the patient, hence aren't done in an emergency</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As already has been answered, indeed I don't believe it's something that's often done in an in emergency (of course depending on the hospital). </p>
<p>To answer more specifically, although I can NOT give a blanket answer that applies to all hearing aids and all hospitals (there are widely varying safety regulations), we used to be able to make MRI scans of most people with hearing aids, as long as the external part was removed first. But it all depends on the specific make and model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer. The magnetic part is actually fused to the bone under the skin behind his ear, so it is not visible externally, and would require surgery to remove. It's amazing technology that has allowed him to hear clearly for the first time ever, but along with that comes some risk..</p></div>		</li>
