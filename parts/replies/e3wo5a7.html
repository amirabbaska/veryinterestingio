			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, let me clarify, I didn’t mean cold rooms help with productivity, I mean cold rooms are used to “keep people awake”, like a classroom or office building. No evidence of it I guess, just what I’ve always heard growing up. One of those things I thought everyone kinda knew or went with, if that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always took it as a cold shock will keep people awake.  Like if you're falling asleep at the wheel then stick your head out the window or blast cold air on yourself.  But you can still fall asleep rather easy when you're cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to that. Work keeps it freezing and I doze off. But when I'm comfortable I stay awake...</p>
<p>The people who control the weather all wear jackets so idk why they keep it that cold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean, and I have never understood it. Teachers would say that and I'd be screaming internally because I knew the cold just makes me want to put my head down and sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I was cold in the classroom you best believe I was asleep until the bell went off. Then it was the awkward task of trying to hide my boner between classes. Oh how I don't miss those odd adolescent years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mm, I guess it could be in a warm enough climate! My area gets 12-37°F in winter (often lower or higher, but that's a good average) and 87-97 in summer. My house stays about 63F, but I keep my studio room warmer so I can be more productive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally fall asleep when it's cold. I get sluggish. I start yawning, and all of that yawning makes my eyes water incessantly... Needless to say, I cannot concentrate beyond that point and I will start to doze off. I HATED school because I was always freezing. Church? Same way, plus the added embarrassment of people assuming you're tearing up because you're &quot;just so moved&quot; by the music/service/prayer. No bitches, I'm fucking MISERABLE here just like I am for the other five days of the week for 8 hours per day in child prison/school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold tends to do that to me too, so back in school (especially high school, when I was a doofus and stayed up too late) I'd have trouble nearly or completely falling asleep! Church too, at my old church where for whatever reason they kept it freezing. </p>
<p>I can kind of sympathize with the blinky watery eyes part, too. I get all kinds of blurred vision when yawny-groggy, it's awful (especially since I don't see well to begin with...)</p></div>		</li>
