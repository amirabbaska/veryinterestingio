			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty close. We also purchase the oil at least a month ahead of time. So by the time a purchase gets to my refinery to be processed its been at last year's prices at this point. Currently we may be running a pretty sour crude so that means we're getting less lighter ends like butane and more heavy like asphalt. Say we bought expensive barrels with a crack spread of lotsa asphalt at an expensive rate. Then barrel prices drop, suddenly we have a barrel that didn't produce as much gas in the first place and won't have as high of a turn around because of it. We can run different processes to refine more of one product or another in house but this takes moves in how we operate which takes time and everybody knows that equals money. It is very complex what drives cost at the pump and every oil company operates slightly different, they all have different profit models and all gas stations get fuel from random providers. Im on mobile and providing my opinion in a pinch sorry for typos or disorganized thought output.</p></div>		</li>
