			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to point out that you can have wet and dry growth. Sometimes you have direct vapor deposition without liquid water. For instance when you look at a cross-section of a hail stone you can see clear and opaque rings. The opaque rings indicate air bubbles have been trapped (dry growth) and clear rings indicate solid water melted, filled in the air pockets, and froze (wet growth)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I always assumed that hail stones was just rain water frozen and collected together, never realised that looking at a cross-section would show the layers built up during formation. Fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Frozen rain is Sleet.  It's from falling through a warm layer then a thick cold layer above the ground.  Sleet tends to be more from stratiform systems and hail from convective systems.  There's also Grapuel, known as soft hail or snow pellets.  Here the snow melts slightly and gets mixed with enough water to make pellets.  There's enough vertical mixing to blend the snow and water, but not enough for thunderstormy  type weather. (Edit - spelling)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hi, hopefully this is allowed but I couldn't figure out if hypotheticals are ok as follow up questions but I only saw the rule related to posts</p>
<p>what would be required for an hour long (I've never seen hail last longer than five minutes) or a day or even week long hail storm to happen?</p>
<p>is it even possible on Earth? or is it something that's only possible on some other planet with a totally alien atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conditions required to form hail usually occur over small areas, but there are circumstances that can allow hail to persist for longer then a few minutes over the same place. Thunderstorm updrafts can become organized such that new cells continuously form over the same location for many minutes, though this usually does not last for more than an hour or two except in the most extreme cases.</p>
<p>In order for a hailstorm to last a week would require strong vertical motion to be anchored over the same location for days, while thr strong convection needed to generate this motion rarely persists at the same place for more then a few hours. </p>
<p>It is completely possible that something like hail could form from either water or an exotic chemical precipitate in another world (like ammonia compounds in a gas giant), and given the correct conditions could persisit longer then your typical Earth hail storm.</p></div>		</li>
