			<div class="markdown"><p>So I need to receive IVs on a pretty regular basis (chemotherapy) and always got a bit nervous when I saw a little air bubble travel in... I mean, I rationally knew it probably wasn't an issue because there'd be some means of preventing it from happening otherwise, but it's still good to read this. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are air bubble alarms on all modern IV pumps, they will alarm is the line has air in it as it passes the pump. Often they alarm when the bubbles are very small and irrelevant, maybe that will help with some of the anxiety too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some providers actually prefer to have some air in the srynge for IM injections to give the medication a pnumatic boost into the tissue. No harm done at all. For Sub Q, no benifit to have air in the srynge, but no harm either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SC air is used in competitive livestock shows to sculpt animals. Pump the animal to the shape you want and it turns to gristle, supposedly. I've never done it nor touched the spots it's been done to, but I know a few people that do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never heard of this but I'm a commercial producer and have no interest in showing. All I know is that we avoid doing any injections in valuable parts of the carcass to avoid scarring and damage to the meat, which can get a carcass downgraded.</p>
<p>If this is true it's yet another reason to look at the show guys with raised eyebrows, if they are intentionally damaging their animals just for looks.</p>
<p>When I have to do SQ fluid though it always makes an unnatural looking bulge, so I'd be kind of surprised if this works?</p></div>		</li>
