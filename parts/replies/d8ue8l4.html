			<div class="markdown"><p>I did click on it but as a layman, &quot;6.4*10^11 times the age of the universe&quot; means nothing to me.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that, like me, they were asking for a more generic unit of measurement that your everyday Joe will understand. Someone below translated it as 9.5 sextillion years, which is something I understand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the only number I can begin to comprehend. I was going to see how many millennia that was and then I realized that that would only lower the number on the exponent by 3, and still wouldn't help.</p>
<p>As opposed to &quot;640 billion times the long as the universe has existed.&quot; Which might as well be forever. Hell, one billion years is already forever from a human perspective.</p></div>		</li>
