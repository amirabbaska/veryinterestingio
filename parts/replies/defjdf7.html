			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember growing up and realizing that my favorite pros weren't always the best skaters - they were the ones who, through whatever combination of luck, smarts and talent, had been selected by the industry to be promoted broadly. I realized that, just like everything else, it's all politics and who you know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, that's so true they even made it a part of the story of the Underground series. The Main Character you play gets the choice to screw over other skaters, make an image for himself, and gets screwed over just like it was a soap opera. There is some awkwardly telling stuff in those games about the life of a pro skater. </p></div>		</li>
