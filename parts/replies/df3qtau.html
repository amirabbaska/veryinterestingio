			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well explained. Just to add to this, evidence suggests the human ear is actually the result of a mutation of fish gills, moving up and round the head over many generations. The theory goes on to suggest that fish were beginning to evolve ears even before leaving the water, which also supports the notion that fish became less reliant on gills as they moved to more stagnant waters and developed another method (as your post details) for breathing. Evolution really is an amazing feat.</p></div>		</li>
