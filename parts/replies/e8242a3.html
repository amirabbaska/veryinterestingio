<p>This is the basis for the theory of the absence of free will. A person will choose option A over option B based on all the events leading up to that decision. If you were to turn back time and give them the choice again they would always choose option A because nothing else before the choice has been altered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this theory, essentially if you think that there are actual laws of the universe and EVERYTHING follows those rules, then me typing this on Reddit while sitting on the pot at work was destined to happen since the start of the universe. Every single thing including the mongol invasions and that butterfly that just died in Canada lead me to this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Determinism 101 man. What's even weirder to think about is if that is true everything that is &quot;going to happen&quot; from our perspective has already happened, or rather is happening right now. Same with the past. We just don't perceive it that way because our experience is of a linear progression through time. But in theory you could be said to be being born, dying, having not existed yet, and have already finished existing simultaneously. Time is a flat circle and all that.</p>
<p>In determinism your conciousness is literally just the experience of the choices you have made. For example there's evidence that when you're sitting there and experience &quot;making the choice&quot; to get up and get food your brain sent the chemical signals to start moving fractions of a second before you perceive &quot;choosing&quot; to get up. You are literally just experiencing the consequences of your body's actions in a frame that makes sense to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I typically argue (open to criticism) that humans don’t have free will because we have no choice over the genes we were born with and the environment we were born into, therefore who we are (nature vs nurture) was never our choice, therefore every decision we make is somewhat predetermined because we have no control over what choices we’ve always been inclined to make</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really more deep than that.</p>
<p>The fact is, we live in a deterministic universe. A system wherein there are set rules (physics etc) and the initial starting conditions dictate the outcome. We are merely the latest in a chain of cause and effect and although it's easy to ascribe some supernatural soul being the cause it's becoming very clear through experimentation now that free will is almost certainly not an actual thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that is more true for other animals than humans. Our intelligence is fascinating in the different ways we make decisions:</p>
<p>We can follow our instincts entirely (not exercising free will).
We can analyze a situation using the knowledge we have gathered up until that point (free will. I’ll get back to this)
We can analyze a situation and make a decision, but right before we act someone gives us new information. Based on this new information, we can reevaluate and make a different decision from the one we already decided on.
We can even analyze a situation and make a <em>totally irrational</em> that others might not predict. </p>
<p>I think that it is hard to argue we don’t have free will in the sense that an observer with perfect information may not always predict someone’s choices, which are assumed to be optimal conclusions based on our experiences up until that point. I understand this doesn’t outright refute the idea, but I think it adds another layer of complexity. It’s that extra layer that makes human intelligence even more intriguing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is tough though. Your example is hard to argue against for reasons like why you and I both read and write in english, we did not make that choice. If we had been born in France, we would be francophones. Same for religion, we are most likely JudeoChristrian in our morals, born in India we would have a different base of our morals (yes sorry American atheist, I'm one of you, but we do have those morals as our foundation).</p>
<p>Yet at the same time it's very easy to argue against this by looking at innovation. That comes from curiosity and solving problems that essentially every other human didn't know was a problem. Why did some cultures choose to sail across vast seas, while others were completely content to stay where they were? Sure, you could say there was some sort of environmental pressure that pushed people out of their parent groups - but there is nothing in our evolution that says get in a boat and risk your life in pursuit of something you have no idea about. </p>
<p>Likewise there's nothing in our evolution that stated this crazy black shit coming out of the ground could be used in almost infinite arrangements. Any other species would have done nothing with that. We know this because no other species did anything with that.</p>
<p>To me that's the strongest argument that we are at the very least <em>different</em> from all other species because we solve problems that really weren't even problems to begin with. We innovate, we do things that nothing else does. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is like a paradox. In my mind, it makes perfect sense that we're just responding to stimuli and we don't actually make choices. But having thought this, I am now aware of it. Is it possible for an animal that only responds to stimuli to understand that it's just an animal that only responds to stimuli? Does my awareness make me something more than just a thing that responds, or is the awareness just another complex response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't. We're no different then the ants, our illusion is merely so persuasive we bend over backwards to explain the obvious reality which is that the we love in a deterministic universe who's outcome is dictated by the initial starting conditions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We can even program those extremely complex rules of behavior into a computer and get a program that some cant tell if its human or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One is deterministic. </p>
<p>We assume we have a choice in our actions. When faced with the universe our minds produce various emotional states which we interpret as &quot;thought&quot; and the rational ability to choose between different &quot;thoughts.&quot; </p>
<p>But this is an assumption. I do not know from whence the real motivation for commenting here comes, for example. Sure I had the thought &quot;how do we distinguish?&quot; when reading dsf90's answer to OP. But what caused me to have that thought? And how do I prove that I had the freedom to either comment or not comment, when I don't even know were the &quot;idea&quot; to make a comment actually comes from?</p>
<p>Even if I have the freedom to choose between alternative &quot;thoughts&quot; and their corresponding actions, I have no understanding of how my mind selected those &quot;thoughts.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
