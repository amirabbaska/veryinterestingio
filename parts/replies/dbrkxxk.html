<p>I want to add, too, that when you start doing origami you may notice that there are certain folds which are repeated in different pieces. Some of the same folds often form &quot;hearts&quot; of many different pieces. I could imagine, given time and experimentation, an origami artist could begin to &quot;See&quot; and plan recombination of different techniques to produce a new end, or even invent new folds to get to a specific end, in gestalt style</p></div>		</li>
