			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure this is the right answer. But I think the bead metaphor is incomplete. If you push the bead everything is fine. But if you start and accidentally push down on the bead instead of behind it, you might hurt your fingers or the tube (your throat).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely incomplete because it didn't refer to the scenario of the smooth muscles contracting out of sync. It only talked about pneumointerference and not synchronization issues.  The original description was more about using both hands to move the bead through the toothpaste tube.  The focus of the original comparison is actually the hands (or the esophageal SM in this case).  The description only slightly alluded to the possibility of the muscles being out of sync without actually stating it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I know immediately if it's a &quot;bad swallow.&quot; I feel it in the back of throat, radiates to my chest, vision starts to go, and wake up sweating. It happens when I get an IV or try to give blood as well. I don't know many who have a vasovagal response. Do you have that same response when you eat certain foods, for me it's anything like a tootsie roll or starburst. Not a full vasovagal response, but close. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So everyone (excepting people with certain types of nerve damage) has a vasovagal response, it's just not necessarily as sensitive as yours. It sounds like you likely have vasovagal syncope, which is actually a disorder of the normal vasovagal response. You can be tested for this (usually by a cardiologist at a university teaching hospital) with a TTT (head-up tilt table test). But if it's not happening routinely enough to bother you, it's probably not worth further investigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A nerve that controls the heart runs alongside your oesophagus. I sometimes have an issue where a bolus of food or drink gets &quot;stuck&quot; and pushes against it. If it stays stuck for long enough it can make me pass out. </p>
<p>It is rare for it to happen, but it has happened a few times in my life.</p></div>		</li>
