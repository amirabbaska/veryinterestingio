			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, great questions. I'm a personal fan of Nick's, but not perhaps for the reason he would prefer. I love his logic, but sometimes his ideas and theories are based on questionable assumptions, and this is a classic example. </p>
<p>We're not in any danger of &quot;runaway&quot; intelligence. There's no compelling evidence that we're on such a path, this is a flight of fancy. it's fun to talk about, though. </p>
<p>The basic problem is with the idea that intelligence is an objective, measurable quantity, and that we can rank people, animals, and machines on some sort of linear intelligence scale. There's not enough time/space here to explain in detail, but it's all laid out in simple language in my book, AI: What Everyone Needs to Know (sorry, I'm going to be plugging this throughout the AMA)!  </p>
<p>How can you &quot;measure&quot; machine intelligence? I claim this is not meaningful. The sorry fact is that just because we can build machines that solve problems that people use using their native intelligence, that doesn't mean the machines are intelligent, or heading for sentience or anything. The problem starts with the name of the field: AI is an &quot;aspirational&quot; name, not a descriptive one. We're just developing powerful and valuable technology for automating certain kinds of tasks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a followup, what would be the first evidence to look for that would indicate the possibility of a runaway AI? </p></div>		</li>
