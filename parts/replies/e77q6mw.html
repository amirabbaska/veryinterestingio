			<div class="markdown"><p>Broodwar got a HUGE revival recently with the &quot;starcraft remastered patch&quot;, but it was only a cosmetic patch and no gameplay was actually changed. The game hasn't been [EDIT: balance] patched in like 15-20 years and we're still seeing new strategies emerging all the time. </p>
<p>In fact, two days ago was one of the best days in SCBW in many years; starting with Flash vs JD and just getting better and better. <a href="http://vod.afreecatv.com/PLAYER/STATION/37472710" target="_blank">http://vod.afreecatv.com/PLAYER/STATION/37472710</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to play Starcraft exclusively for 8 years... and watched the heck out of the pro scene. I ejoyed SC2, but Brood War was always my jam.</p>
<p>Have not watched a quality game in awhile!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And on that topic, sports do change sometimes. 3 point shots didn't used to exist in the NBA, but they do now and are partially credited with saving the league. Rules change to make things more interesting, even in traditional sports. It's just that those sports are more static compared to esport. I believe the reason for that is they lack as much depth, and so are inherently more balanced from the start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say Puyo Puyo, since the modern games play pretty much the same as Puyo Puyo 2 from 1994.  Tetris actually still gets balance patches and gameplay changes as new games come out, and some games even get balance patches during their lifespan, like PuyoPuyo Tetris.</p>
<p>Classic Tetris is exactly like you said though, since they still play NES Tetris, which obviously hasn't been changed since it's initial release.</p></div>		</li>
