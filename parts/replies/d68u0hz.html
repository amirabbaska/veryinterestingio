			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I'm not really well versed in the history or origin of these arts except for BJJ and a little bit of judo history. I'm much more knowledgeable on the effectiveness. If there's one unique thing I've learned from all of my training, don't fight Russian wrestlers. I don't know what it is, but when I visited Russia those dudes would NOT go down. Like fuckin rocks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ninjitsu, is sadly, a lost art. No one can truly replicate ninjitsu because it was such a broad combat style, and ninjas were secretive. As well as being secretive, they were also often poor and weren't the most well documented bunch. Ninjitsu included stealth, deception, using tools, weapons, assassination, hand to hand combat designed to quickly incapacitate foes, infiltration, etc. If you see anywhere offering to teach ninjitsu its 100% crap. The ninjas are long gone and ninjitsu with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in learning &quot;Ninjitsu&quot; the best I can recommend would be some special forces training from the military. Mind you Ninjas weren't what they are depicted nowadays. They were assassins and not some super highly training martial artists. They were especially good at infiltration, information gathering and assassinations. Basically covert ops in the military we have nowadays.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BJJ is arguably the most effective form of hand to hand self defense,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As long as you only have to defend against one person. Against multiple opponents you'll be at an even bigger disadvantage due to going to the ground. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>and literally every MMA fighter has to know at least some BJJ to not be beaten by it. It is the premiere ground fighting martial art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Almost impossible to not get recked (except maybe if you go Holms style how she wente against Rousey). But otherwise I totally agree with you. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>and kill me with a touch to the forehead.</p>

<p>What are you talking touch to the forehead. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOOh2J1b3lQ" target="_blank">No physical contact needed</a></p>
<p>Nice take on the whole thing especially since you have a bit a different view than others. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My rule when it comes to multiple opponents and any weapons is my calling to be an NFL running back. I haul ass out of there haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hilarious video I saw on Facebook of a BJJ black belt teaching people what to do if their opponent has a knife.  His partner pulls out the knife and assumes a fighting stance.  The BJJ black belt turned around and hauled ass away.  Perfect example of a guy who knows fighting knowing the situations you should run the fuck away from.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Like another person here mentioned. The best defense is being able to run faster and longer than your opponent. </p>
<p>But for the sake of the topic. In case you cannot run it is still very handy to be able to deal with someone punching you without having to commit to a take-down. And if you are skilled in a striking art you can do some serious damage which might potentially be deterrent or at least reduce the number of opponents. </p>
<p>But yeah like every real martial artist would agree. Running is always the best option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised I had to scroll this far down to find your perspective. You're spot on. Martial arts can be a lot like religion, in the sense that people are convinced their art is the only correct one. If the rise of MMA has taught us anything, it is that you can't just rely on one aspect of fighting - just grappling or striking. </p>
<p>BJJ is the best bet for self defense training. It has a long recorded history of proving its effectiveness over other art forms. Any decent modern BJJ school won't teach this art form in a vacuum however. Modern BJJ is in itself a mixed art incorporating Judo, wrestling, and even some striking. </p>
<p>One can't just learn only BJJ if they want to truly be effective (especially in MMA). I always put my money on the grappler, but there is never any guarantees. I really only train BJJ/Judo, but I know that all it could take is one good punch/kick from someone that knows what they are doing to fuck my shit up.</p>
<p>You can tell which &quot;religion&quot; is mine. Most Aikido, Kung Fu, or even Krav Maga schools in US won't really help folks when it comes to self defense. I always thought Ninjitsu was compete make believe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowdays in MMA a wrestler with good striking seems to be overtaking most BJJ. Essentially they use the wrestling takedown defense to avoid ending up in the floor and strike their way into a TKO. </p>
<p>It'll be fun to see how MMA evolves to counter good takedown defense + striking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree, but also don't think you are wrong. A strong wrestling base or experience only makes one that much more efficient at BJJ and MMA in general. Tons of MMA greats were wrestlers before they started training. Folks that come into our BJJ school with a background in wrestling have a real advantage on the mat when they start out. However, it isn't fair to say that wrestling beats BJJ flat out. </p>
<p>That being said, like I pointed out in my last comment, BJJ doesn't exist in a vacuum. Modern BJJ is a mixed art in itself. Elements of what we learn in my school are wrestling or Judo in origin. If anything, BJJ just helps me learn to tie all this stuff together (and counter it, and counter the counter, etc.). </p>
<p>How a person &quot;rolls&quot; is very much tied to their personality and experience. Some of my training partners actually did Aikido before coming to our school. They laugh off 95% of it, but on occasion they really do apply some techniques that actually work - I've seen some nasty wrist locks for example.</p></div>		</li>
