			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly can't remember how many witnesses we had. There was one plaintiff and something like 16 defendants, all insurance companies with teams of lawyers. The small courtroom we were in was sometimes filled with just lawyers. I definitely remember that some of the testimony was so dry and boring it was hard to stay awake. </p>
<p>Deliberations were actually pretty tough going. I think we spent 10 or 12 full days just deliberating, and they let us take over an empty courtroom because we had about 90 binders full of evidence and documents to use as reference so we couldn't fit in the jury room. We had one juror removed just before deliberations (for reasons that were not shared with us) so an alternate took over.</p>
<p>We had 28 verdicts to render and we had to have 9 of 12 jurors agree for a verdict to count. There was crying, yelling, alot of math and searching through huge binders, and we sent several questions back to the judge for clarification. </p>
<p>In the end I think we did alright. I only really disagreed with 3 of our verdicts, but the other opinion had enough votes to move forward so... yeah, that was that. After we delivered our verdict, we got to shake hands with all the lawyers and if we chose to talk to them about our decisions/views we could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response! By any chance do you recall the parties' names, or the case caption? I'd love to see if any of the MSJ opinion(s) were published and see what kind of facts come to together to create a case that lasts 6 months in the trial phase. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In total I think I earned $25 a day (after bus fare was paid for by the court) and we were in court for 8 hours a day during the trial... so that's about $3 per hour? something like that... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there were payments that had already been made of about 28 million. One side wanted the other side to share in those known already paid costs. More importantly, though, were future costs that both sides seemed to agree were going to be in the several hundred million dollar range and ongoing. </p>
<p>The money was for ongoing costs of enviornmental clean up and several federal superfund sites. So, it was pretty high stakes but nothing large enough for media or anything but local news to really care about. </p></div>		</li>
