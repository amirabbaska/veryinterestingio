			<div class="markdown"><p>In my mid teens, I was diagnosed with a mild case of ADD, then recently proved through a ton of testing that I was able to function normally without meds. So I suppose you should take this with a grain of salt as these things are case by case.</p>
<p>Something that helped for me was getting another hobby. Then another hobby. Then another. It started with reading books. Then I moved to video games. Then I moved to airsoft. Then I moved to buying and working on cars. Now I'm a full time student and I feel like I'm doing great. I just found things that I was able to absolutely engulf myself in, and I made it a goal to do them in person. After learning how to engage myself, I feel like I'm able to have the self control to apply that dedication to whatever I need to, like classwork and studying.</p>
<p>With that being said, I still struggle quite a bit. If I have a class that I'm not interested in, it could take me 3 or 4 hours to do an assignment that should take me 10 or 15 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever wonder/ hear any supporting research about as a child taking the adhd meds helped &quot;rewire&quot;, for lack of a better term, your adhd brain into a less-adhd brain? </p>
<p>In other words, is there a chance that young people that take adhd meds while their brain is still developing benefit from these meds not only in the short-term, but also in the long-term? Even if they have stopped taking them into adulthood? Is it possible that the meds helped the child &quot;learn new ways of channeling their attention/focus?&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, yeah thanks for the help.</p>
<p>The only problem is that my parents don't support me playing video games / using it as an outlet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya, I wished this was a long term solution.  I've gone through Trombone, Trumpet, guitar, sax, drums, PC building, gaming, Pokemon Go, Meme'ing, Meteorology, music production, gardening, classic car restoration, chess, muscle building, Psychedelics, traveling, etc. etc...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Video games are great for that because of the instant gratification.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to try as many thing as possible to find other thing that bring that for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can change this, but it will take effort and most importantly, time. Your brain is very used to games, which are already heavily designed to give you a direct dopamine hit. That's great for business. The fun, rewarding parts of games are heavily highlighted with big, flashing lights and bells and whistles. Literally.</p>
<p>But the rewards are there with other activities, too. They're just not as obvious. Let's imagine drawing - If you spend an hour working on a sketch, you won't get an on-screen notification every time you level up a skill or get an achievement or unlock a new feature, but all of those things are still happening in the background. You just haven't ever been taught to notice them.</p>
<p>So you have to teach yourself. You're gonna have to make a conscious effort to look for the rewarding things in life. Look up mindfulness, and practice that every day, so you will notice when your shading is a little better than it was the day before. Write down a list every day of your accomplishments and struggles, so you start to see that fingers are a specific obstacle for you, and when you finally get good at them, it's essentially like defeating a boss, as well as unlocking a new skill.</p>
<p>Eventually, thinking like this will start to become more natural, but for now, you've been trained by games not to be able to do it on your own. You'll need to learn. It took me until I was about 30, and I'm still working on it, but the rewards are fantastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine isn’t the “happy” neurotransmitter—that’s serotonin. Dopamine is central to the brain’s reward/motivation center. It also has other functions in the brain—it’s a neurotransmitter, so it is used by neurons to communicate. </p></div>		</li>
