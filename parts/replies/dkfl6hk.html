<p>Would such a ring appear only in certain orbits? For example, if Sol had a ring would it necessarily be in close orbits like Mars or Venus, or distant orbits like Saturn? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the mass of the star. The Roche Limit is directly proportional to the mass of the star. </p>
<p>But, if there are planets in the star system as well, I doubt the ring would last long.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What's the difference between a planet-ring-moon system and a star-ring-planet system that means the former would be stable but the latter wouldn't be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just an assumption, but I would think that most rings on stars would be stretched so thin that they are hardly visible in any case.</p>
<p>Could another star become a ring or enough other celestial bodies that it actually is visible (or would be if we were close enough)?  Do we know of any of these?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we use our sun as an example, the ring material would be found inwards of Mercury's orbit. The ring may be scorching hot, but I doubt it would be vaporized. Heat transfer in a vacuum (via radiation) is quite inefficient when compared to convection and conduction.
Unless the ring hits the corona of the sun, it won't be vaporized.</p></div>		</li>
