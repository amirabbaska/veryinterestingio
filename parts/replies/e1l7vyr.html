			<div class="markdown"><p>We work with some rescues and some dogs obviously come in with some bad problems. We've seen dogs go from miserable and wanting to be alone to happy and super social almost immediately after a bad eye was removed. I figured it was painful but I didn't even think of the whole idea of migraine-like pain. So, do you run into situations where you can save the eye, or do you most often lean towards eye removal? I would guess a lot of it relies on owners who freak out over the idea of Fluffy losing an eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on whether or not the eye is still visual. In dogs with primary glaucoma, like mine, pressures can be so severe (50-80mmHg, compared to normals of 10-20mmHg) that irreversible retinal damage happens in days. So if the eye is beyond saving then the top priority (for me at least) turns into eliminating that source of pain, which enucleation does wonders for. With primary glaucoma the second eye will fail at some point too, though prophylactic eye drops can help prolong the inevitable, but eventually even that won't be enough.</p>
<p>You've hit the nail on the head regarding owners and their own attachments to their pet's eyes though. When it comes down to it sight isn't as nearly as important for dogs as it is for people. It's a very emotional sense for us but dogs rely far more on scent and hearing.</p>
<p>Some people want to try and save the eye itself for cosmetic reasons though, which can be achieved via evisceration (basically sucking out the insides of the globe). You still have to deal with keeping the cornea healthy though and can run into issues that ultimately require enucleation in the long run anyway. </p>
<p>Enucleation can be made more cosmetic by implanting a prosthesis (half of a silicone ball) which eliminates the sunken eye appearance that weirds some people out. That's what I ended up doing with my dog and most people can't tell her eyes are gone since she's a basset with a little extra skin there anyway :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned that cats develop glaucoma more slowly and how dogs don't rely on vision as much-- so what do you do if a cat develops glaucoma? Do you give them a similar treatment to slow the process and try to keep the eyes for as long as possible (since they're more reliant on vision and don't develop to the point of pain as quickly)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This interests me, as a human who has had glaucoma since age 13 and migraines since age 9. I am on a variety of meds: Depakote, Keppra, Dilantin, Gabapentin. and Latanoprost eye drops for the glaucoma. from wikipedia: <em>&quot;prostaglandin analogue family of medication.[1] It works by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eyes through the uveoscleral tract&quot;</em>
Before they switched drops i took Timolol (beta blocker) Do they not make anything for animals like drops or even oral meds that would treat the condition not just treat the symptoms? I realize that drops would be difficult since even humans have a hard time applying them sometimes lol. Oral meds would be a pain in the butt, but obviously it is done for other conditions for animals. Another thing is  with humans obviously we can communicate we have pain where animals cannot as easily. Also screening for humans is obviously more widespread (screening during eye glass exams. etc.) I was wondering other than surgery or observed damage to the eye is there a way to test for eye pressure like in humans: the puff of air (which is still horribly inaccurate) or the tono-pen they use with numbing drops, or even the glow in the dark drops they put in your eye with the blue light/slit lamp?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The globe becomes enlarged and the increased pressure forces the pupil to remain more dilated than normal. It gives them a rather cartoonish appearance that's actually kinda cute. That said, primary glaucoma is much less common in cats than dogs, and they can tolerate it far better than dogs as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im just now reading this so I’m a bit late, but for cats it’s basically the same as dogs. </p>
<p>I have a cat with cataracts, so I know she’s at risk to get glaucoma. If the sclera is red, it’s also good to observe but doesn’t necessarily mean she will get it. My cat has had a red sclera for years and the vet says it’s okay. She also doesn’t seem to be in pain. </p>
<p>But glaucoma usually exhibits itself with inflammation of the eye. It gets larger and ends up looking a bit like a fish eye. </p>
<p>But if you’re concerned about your cat being at risk for glaucoma, you should ask you ver so you can start observing and taking the necessary measures to help your cats eyes. </p></div>		</li>
