<p>but the studies seem kinda all over the place.  it looks like sex with a real person can boost testosterone levels for a while.  short-term (a week) abstinence can raise them, but long-term (like 3 months) lower them.  masturbation has less effect than sex.  sexual exhaustion can reduce the ability of your body to use testosterone, but not the level in your blood.  </p>
<p>all that said i personally tend to get pretty mellow right after sex, but only for a short while.  this probably has more to do with dopamine/serotonin than testosterone.  </p></div>		</li>
