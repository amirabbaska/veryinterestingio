<p>Software receives updated, which will sometimes add more features to it, slowing down the program.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's the same with phones.</p>
<p>If you have an old iPhone and update to the lateste iOS, the thing will just feel slower, because there are more features built into the software core, usually relating to new hardware in newer phones(fingerprint/face recognition etc.) that still run, but don't function without the hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but this isn't exactly new - it's what power saving modes on laptops do, for example.</p>
<p>The Sony PSP console was intentionally underclocked for a similar reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently It underclocks phones that have old/weak batteries, preventing a peak voltage draw higher than the dilapidated battery can handle which would result in a sudden shutdown. Also helps battery life</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  If the phone detects that the battery is failing and can't handle peak voltage, then it underclocks the phone.</p>
<p>If they didn't, it could potentially result in random shutdowns of the phone.</p>
<p>The problem is:
(A) Apple didn't really disclose to the users that their battery was dying, so they didn't know why their phone was slowing down.
(B) The OS was pretty liberal about doing this if there was <em>any</em> risk, leaving to possibly some false positives.</p>
<p>That led to a &quot;Apple is slowing phones down on purpose!&quot; scandal and Apple put out an update to notify users when this is happening.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If there is an API for a finger print reader, and your device doesn't have a finger print reader, it won't ever use the API, and won't cause a performance hit on the device at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On my old (~2009) MacBook, the first OS upgrade (IIRC from Leopard to Snow Leopard) was a <em>huge</em> increase in performance.  Part of this was that they rewrote more of the OS to run natively on Intel chips instead of the dual/hybrid or emulated code they were still porting from Motorola.  </p>
<p>Much later, in 2014/2015, it was either Yosemite or El Capitan that ground the same machine to a halt, making it basically unusable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't experience that. To be honest, in 30 years, every time a new operating system is released I always hear the developers say stuff like &quot;faster than ever!&quot; while in reality that hardly ever is the case. I dare to say, if x version of a OS is faster than version x-1, then that's probably because they really really screwed up in x-1. Best example I can think of right now is Windows Vista.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple and basic method</p>
<p>CTRL-SHIFT-ESC</p>
<p>Look at what is on the start-up tab, do you really need to have the full compliment of your printer functions running? I have a fax component I've disabled, I don't even have a land line, why have it running?</p>
<p>Look at your processes and details tab. On mine Chrome and Firefox have taken over. It's no big deal since I'm not doing anything to intensive right now. Most of it are the extensions and add-ons that are running in each browser. If I were to have to do something more laborious, I'd close both browsers.</p>
<p>On the processes tab it's telling you what is running right, some are important, others not so much. If you can't tell exactly what it is Google is your friend. If it's not needed, kill it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting aspect regarding the chrome addons: as a security measure each addon is loaded in every tab separately. So when you have 12 tabs open, that neat screenshot tool is not loaded once for all of chrome, but 12 times. So its actually quite good to turn off addons you rarely use.
The reason why chrome works this way is because websites can interact with the addons and if the addons wouldnt be sandboxed to each tab it could be possible for a website to spy on another tab via an addon for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>IIRC the task manager (and what you can do there) is a little different in newer versions of windows (10-?)  But this is a necessity for someone chronically running older slower hardware. </p>
<p>Use software to block unnecessary start up applications, and task manager to monitor and kill anything else unnecessary.</p>
<p>Pro tip for the worst machines: Task Manager itself will eat some CPU and RAM. Only open when needed for best results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just use a separate SSD for your OS, and never install or store anything on that drive.  This includes remapping your &quot;personal&quot; folders to the other drive (pictures/video/music/whatever), manually changing the install path of everything to the other drive, and not using your desktop as a dumping ground for all your files.</p>
<p>When you're not manually adding folders and files to your OS drive, it stays pretty damn clean.  I used to religiously wipe my computers every year, but I've been running the same install of Win7 since 2011.  </p></div>		</li>

I totally wiped my laptop yesterday thinking, &quot;I'm totally fine with giving up all my stuff if it makes this thing faster.&quot; No luck - - it still <em>crawls.</em> I opened the wrong program by accident and ended up waiting a good five-plus minutes for it to open just so I could close it again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s less of an issue today, but spinning drives used to be highly affected by how much data was on them. As a drive fills up, it needs to find space to put everything, and sometimes it can’t find a place to put an entire file so it needed to “fragment” the file. </p>
<p>Imagine a house with a bookcase in each room. When you get your first book, you can place it anywhere. As you get more and more books, the book cases start to fill up. Eventually, there’s only a few small slots left for books. Now you get a large book, or perhaps a book series, but it can’t fit within one of those spaces. Instead or just reorganizing, you chop the book up into pieces that fit into those slots. Now, whenever you wish to read the book, you need to go to each different book case to retrieve each part of the book, which takes a lot more time, and is therefor slower. </p>
<p>Obviously books take hours to read so it wouldn’t be a huge deal, but when a computer needs to read that book 100 times in a day and usually could do it in fractions of a second, but now it takes several seconds as the disk needs to move around, it can be a dramatic slowdown. SSDs don’t suffer from this nearly as badly. And modern file systems are better at this than they have been in the past. </p></div>		</li>
