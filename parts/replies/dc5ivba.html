			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's 'clicking/crackling' your Eustachian tube.</p>
<p>'rumbling' your ears (Tensor tympani muscle) is kinda similar, and according the wiki page </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very small percentage of individuals can voluntarily produce this rumbling sound by contracting the tensor tympani muscle of the middle ear.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>/r/earrumblersassemble for your ear rumbling brethren (some ear cracklers too)<br />
/r/EustachianTubeClick for the clickers, but it's a very tiny subreddit in comparison to the rumblers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg I rumble! I seriously thought I was just a freak. I've asked people and they always have no clue what I'm talking about! </p>
<p>Although, I have clicks when I swallow and I can rumble at will, so am I just super weird or do most people who can do one do both?</p></div>		</li>

I suspect it's more common to be able to rumble than click, and even fewer who can do both but I've no data to support this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea that second part, &quot;rumbling&quot;, wasn't normal.  I can't do it all the time, but I'm pretty plugged up from a cold right now (and reading this post I'm trying all these things) I can pretty much just flex my ear/temple area and get a cracking, to the point I can more or less make a sweet beat out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then we are at least three. I found /u/antondlt here above who can do the same, and me. I've been able to do this for as long as I can remember but can't explain it to anyone properly and no one understands what I'm trying to explain :-) .
How much do you have to flex /u/durbee ? I hardly have to do anything at all, and my flexing is internal, inside, and not visible for anyone just looking at my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can actually pinpoint when my &quot;ability&quot; to do this began.  I can remember a life without the constant popping.</p>
<p>I'm like you; the flex is so subtle that nothing external moves.  I honestly couldn't even pinpoint what muscles are moving, just that they are all very internal and I can control them in a second nature sort of way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too! It started when I got off a plane when I was 7, they've popped ever since, and I can do it voluntarily :D </p>
<p>I literally thought I was the only person who had this - everyone I've ever asked about it have looked at me like I'm weird :( </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's weird, the same is true for me. I remember figuring out how to do it for the first time and not knowing if it was healthy to keep doing it. Then I couldn't stop doing it like a habit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too can do this, I always thought something was wrong with me! My wife can see or hear me doing anything but internally I barely flex and it crackles pretty loudly. Very rarely I can't hear anything, probably when there is no mucus in the tube?</p></div>		</li>
