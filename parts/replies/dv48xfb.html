<p>That said, just make sure you generally eat varied proteins? Chicken and beans are good sources if you want to avoid red meat.</p>
<p>e.g. when i make vegetarian chili, decent helpings of haricot and kidney beans do the trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A complete protein is a food that contains all 20 amino acids your body uses to construct proteins. Some AA's can be manufactured by your body, others (the &quot;essential&quot; ones) you have to get directly from food.

<p>If you're a vegetarian, beans, peanut butter, soy/tofu, nuts and seeds, eggs, cheese, and milk are good sources of proteins. Not all are complete proteins though, so you should try not to focus too much on any one source.</p>
<p>If you aren't, fish, poultry, and meats are all complete proteins by definition.</p>
