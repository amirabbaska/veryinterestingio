<p>Yes it would. A &quot;balloon&quot; would not work without any gas inside. You would need a rigid container strong enough not to implode. And that's the problem with this scenario. You need a strong material that weighs next to nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well...you can get a gas less-dense by increasing the temperature -- after all, that's what a hot air balloon does -- but you can't make it hot without limit or you destroy the container.</p>
<p>That's not a <em>true</em> vacuum, but it's moving along the line towards one.</p></div>		</li>
