			<div class="markdown"><p>The facts behind this are apparently still in dispute. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Glaspie" target="_blank">Some believe U.S. diplomat April Glaspie gave Saddam tacit approval to invade without interference by the U.S. military</a>. But what was actually said is unclear, and the intent of the U.S. is disputed. There is some reason to believe Saddam felt assured the U.S. would permit the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence to believe that <em>Saddam</em> believed this, largely on the strength of comments made to the effect of &quot;the US doesn't have an interest in Arab politics.&quot; Whether the intent of the message was misunderstood or not, there can be no arguments that Iraq badly miscalculated American reaction to the invasion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a widespread belief at the time of the war that Iraq had been given the nod to take the land with the naughty oil wells.
Glaspie is quoted as having said &quot;we didn't think he would go that far&quot; and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/02/AR2008040203485.html" target="_blank">&quot;Obviously, I didn't think, and nobody else did, that the Iraqis were going to take all of Kuwait.&quot;</a></p>
<p>The US intervention only really makes sense from the perspective of defending Saudi Arabia. Kuwait was lost, there was no ongoing conflict. However Saddam had gone on to verbally pick fights with the Saudis implying that they were next. The loss of Saudi Arabia would have been a significant issue for US influence in the region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Kuwaiti, I have looked this up thoroughly but could not find any evidence to support it other than Saddam's words. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but it sounds like a stupid and provocative move to slant drill into Iraq which was the largest military in the region and a serious threat to kuwait's sovereignty if discovered.</p>
<p>Kuwait was doing very well financially and this risk sounds a bit suicidal. On the other hand, Iraq has debts towards Kuwait which Iraq seemingly could not pay back without hurting their economy badly. This leads me to the belief that it was simply a &quot;kill your debts&quot; move. </p>
<p>Slant drilling could have been negotiated and examined if that were the case: Kuwait did not have the military power or political will (for good reason) to refuse an inspection if Saddam had asked for one. He didn't. He just decided to take.</p>
<p>Also seemingly unrelated but part of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi narrative: look up abd-alkarim Qasim. Saddam was not the first Iraqi leader to attempt this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, its the significance of the matter to the potentially interfering forces VS how scary their force looks.  </p>
<p>1) I don't think they fully understood how much weaker they were. As far as logistics go you have X amount of soldiers and Y amount of tanks etc. On paper, they were quite strong. Both parts know the equipment is a bit outdated, but how much impact that will have on the results is hard to predict.</p>
<p>2) You dont need to be the biggest. You just need to be big. Cause you dont need to win over all adversaries Although the US/UK side knew it would win, since they wont know how significant the newer equipment will be its also hard for the superior side to predict their losses. So it helps being strong on paper, cause that makes them POTENTIALLY strong. It could be enough to convince them that they MIGHT take a big financial and human loss and hope they don't think the matter is important enough to meddle. And the US/UK side did take a loss of almost 300 lives another almost 800 wounded(which can be costly for nations with welfare) and they probably lost more than 100 or so tanks, helicopters, planes and other military vehicles, many of them costing millions of dollars each. </p>
<p>Finally I'd like to point out that many other forces have been in comparable situations and has still decided to go to war:</p>
<p>-When Italy joined WWII they had a lot of troops and military equipment. Just like Iraq, they had good numbers. However, an entire nation with muskets and donkeys didn't provide much resistance against tanks and rifles. </p>
<p>-In WWII the allied forces had inferior equipment in the beginning, and arguable towards the end as well(they developed the first jet fighters etc). But the allied had a much higher production rates, with 10 inferior sherman tanks being built for every 1 superior tiger tank. The brits are proud of their spitfires, but the defense of British airspace before D-day was probably fought largely by inferior hawker hurricanes against superior messerschmitts fighters.</p>
<p>-When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014 they were probably a lot weaker than the US alone, not to mention a coalition of allied forces. Keep in mind that this is not yet another conflict in the middle east that Europeans usually dont give a flying fuck about like Kuwait was. This was free and democratic nation within Europe itself. And ever since the cold war, Russia has been testing their limits by trespassing with warplanes and submarines in Norwegian and Swedish waters and airspace, which has been causing a lot of outrage. I assume they've been doing this in other countries beyond my knowledge as well, seeing how they're currently in a dispute with Turkey right now about this exact thing, so an invasion of a single, weaker, European nation is a very relate-able scenario for other Europeans. Yet there has still not been any military repercussions cause no one wants to break up the NATO and start world war 3. </p>
<p>-Russia(soviet union) also invaded Finland in 1939 with similar results, although they didnt annex any/much land, they did force Finland to supply the Soviets for years to come as spoils of war. No military repercussions from outside of Finland. Also makes the point above more relate-able to nearby countries.   </p>
<p>-Both the Vietcong in the Vietnam war and the Al'Quida in the war in Afghanistan were severely under equipped and under numbered. They still decided to go to war and were both able to pull of a draining, grinding fatigue war through guerrilla tactics, because they were on home turf(like the Iraqis sort of were in the war of the gulf).  </p></div>		</li>

<p>However weakened Russia is, and it is very weakened. It is a country of 143 million people with nuclear weapons and the capability of delivering those weapons onto US soil. War with Russia is a very ugly world war three. </p>
<p>The US would go to war with Russia if it had to to protect a country they were obligated to defend. A NATO member for instance.

<p>Conversely Iraq annexed an oil rich region and was making indications that Saudi Arabia was next. That's economic interests and potential treaty obligations right there. Add in  the fact that fourth largest military in the world or not the Iraqi army was a joke and Iraq was not a nuclear power, let alone one that could actually threaten the US and you have a very different situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Putin couldn't afford a war with west over Ukraine, at all, from what I had read.  Conventional forces were poorly supplied, not even a fraction of what the look like on paper.  And nobody in their right mind would escalate Ukraine conflict into a nuclear release and Putin is in his right mind.  He may be a bully, but he is not suicidal.  </p>
<p>Ukraine sets some really bad precedents from a nuclear proliferation point of view.  Now, no regime or country in their right mind would ever give up their nuclear weapons again for peace assurances, esp with Russia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. That's exactly what I mean by the fact that you don't have to be the strongest, as long as you're strong enough to put a serious dent in your opponent. In this case a very serious one. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>And this shows that the conflict was not significant enough to take that damage, even if the side supporting Ukraine would be superior to Russia.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is very true from a US point of view. But as I explained, for other European countries, such as the UK which was also involved in Kuwait, it would feel very much like when Germany invaded Poland which is still very strong in peoples memories. Additionally, its been made very clear during the current Syria conflict that despite the fact there are large groups who oppose taking in refugees, there's also a very large, possibly making up the majority, who feel very obligated to help fellow Europeans way beyond the sense of obligation that has displayed towards helping refugees of African conflicts. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>It does score higher on potential threat and lower on significance to the supporting forces to such extents that it cant be compared to the Kuwait incident. But thats what makes it such a great example, cause it shows that if there is enough contrast between these two deciding factors then you can get away with something very drastic despite being an inferior force to the potential supporters of your victim. Thats exactly what Iraq was hoping for. But where exactly that line goes is hard to predict. This shows why Iraq would even consider attacking Kuwait despite the fact that Kuwait had supporters with a superior military force. They took a gamble and it turned out it was the wrong call. Its easy to analyse in the aftermatch and say that these were the reasons why it went down like that, but its harder to predict exactly how something WILL go down. And this decision was the careful consideration of the balance between these two factors. Moral obligations and aggravation from Russia overstepping other nations boundaries for so long are much harder to calculate than economical interests tho. Russia made an educated guess that they wouldnt be met with a military coalition. Like I said, its easy to say now in the aftermatch that it wouldnt have happened, but before launching the invasion there is no way they would have known for sure, and it could easily and unpredictably have gone the other way although the chance for that can be said to be much lower than with Iraq vs Kuwait. </p>
<p>And on that note things like this might be relevant: </p>

<p>I think they annexed quite enough: &quot; The area included Finland's second largest city of Viipuri, much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant parts still held by Finland's army—all in all, 11% of the territory and 30% of the economic assets of pre-war Finland. Twelve percent of Finland's population, some 422,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes.</p>
<p>Finland also had to cede a part of the region of Salla, the Kalastajansaarento peninsula in the Barents Sea, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. The Hanko Peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years. The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty.</p>
<p><strong>Finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded those demanded by the Soviets pre-war.</strong>&quot;</p>
