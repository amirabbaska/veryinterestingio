People bought Trump's book because his business successes gave him credibility in their eyes and because they wanted to see what this famous person thought. It wasn't just his &quot;brand&quot; that made the book popular, as with Tom Clancy books that aren't written by Tom Clancy or Drake songs that aren't written by Drake; it was content that only he could provide. (Or at least that's what the public thought.)</p></div>		</li>
