			<div class="markdown"><p>I always liked <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/SolarEclipse.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> image to really show how the shadow behaves. There's actually only a very small circle that gets no sunlight. Once you leave that circle, there's a much larger circle that gets varrying degrees of light (depending on how far they are from the inner circle). </p>
<p>The image itself may appear intuitive, but it could still benefit from a bit of explaining as to what all the lines mean. There are basically an infinite number of lines you can draw from the sun to represent a ray of light. It can go off in all directions. If we consider just the sunlight from the top of the sun (as drawn), it obviously can go off in any direction. It can go straight across, and hit the earth. This area would be in full light. </p>
<p>But once the lines you draw from the top of the sun finally touch the top of the moon, you begin the area that will not receive sunlight from the top of the sun. You can similarly draw a line from the bottom of the sun. Where those two lines meet on the earth marks the area of no sunlight. This is called the umbra. </p>
<p>However, there are still those areas outside that small circle that get SOME sunlight. Why?  If we consider the upper penumbra, we'll see why. What we can definitely see is that sunlight from the bottom of the sun cannot possibly enter the upper penumbra. The moon is in the way. However, sunlight from the TOP of the sun <strong>can</strong>. It's reversed for the lower penumbra:  sunlight from the top of the sun is blocked by the moon, but sunlight from the bottom of the sun has a direct straight-across path. </p>
<p>So what can we guess this would look like to an observer? Inside the umbra, light from the top and bottom of the sun are blocked. If you tried drawing lines from other parts of the sun, you'd see they're all blocked. So the user sees no sunlight (except the cornea). </p>
<p>Viewers in the penumbra, though, will see some of the sun. If they're in the upper penumbra (as drawn), they will see the upper part of the sun, but the lower part will be blocked. If you spend enough time drawing light rays, you'll see that the closer a viewer is to the  (totally dark) umbra, the less of the sun they will see. The further away from the umbra they go, the larger the amount of the sun's surface has an unblocked vector to the viewer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the video I posted, North is UP, and the satellite is over the equator.
In the first few frames, the Moon's shadow is just North of Australia. </p>
<p>By the 3rd frame, Australia dominates the bottom of the picture. Meanwhile the shadow is moving NE into the landless Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>In the later frames, if you look toward the left side of the Earth, you can see SE Asia, China, and India rotating into view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its over Scotland I think. That island visible on the far right is the Isle of Arran, I believe. </p>
<p>its facing south, so its pretty hard to get bearings on that</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I'm afraid the scale is much grander than that.  Australia rotates across the bottom of the picture throughout, while in the latter frames, SE Asia, China, the Himalayas, and ultimately India rotate into view from the middle left (west).</p></div>		</li>
