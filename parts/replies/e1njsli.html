			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description of a new family left me with a feeling of enthusiasm and wonder, not sadness. Very well put! And it really described it well considering it left me perplexed as to how that was a sad situation. Reading something with those all over the place would become tedious, as I would have to immerse myself into the author, and not the story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leaving your old family behind is a terribly sad event, isn't it? The last part of your childhood fleeting away in the dust of the road, your lifelong home disappearing. You'll never see them the same way again. The promise of a new life with your new family ahead, horizon climbing up to reach you, the hopes and dreams of what your unborn child might accomplish in life just storming around your mind. The uncertainty, the fear, the love. It'd all be a bit too much to describe, don't you agree?</p>
<p>I made the example emotionally complicated in order to illustrate the final point, which is the &quot;objective&quot; part of an objective correlative is nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from a divorced family and I've moved 14 times in my life. I live with my dad, and we're not exactly best pals. It's a bit sad, but the wonder of a new life on my own feet vastly outweighs that feeling for me. I'm moving out in 2 months. Guess I'll find out then</p></div>		</li>
