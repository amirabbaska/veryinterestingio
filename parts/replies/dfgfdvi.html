<p>It took many months after the declaration of war in WWI and WWII for the US to be fully ready for combat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In WWI at least, the US industry was not even ready when the troops were. The US troops used lots of French and British equipment for the first several months until their own gear finished production and shipping. Even in WWII a shit-ton of US industry had to be converted to a war-time footing.</p>
<p>When I was sent to Iraq a decade ago, the M-2 .50 cal machine gun at my guard post had a Craftsman logo stamped on it. I heard of one that was built by Mattel. Word is, the Army is contracting out for a new HMG to replace the M-2, but if another no-shit world war ever breaks out, you would probably find even those new models stamped with a tool or toy company's logo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well even if billions &quot;isn't much&quot;, relatively speaking we find the need to spend much more then even the next 10-15 countries COMBINED. Why is that necessary? The budget is likely increasing about 10% this year alone. 50 billion is no small chunk of change, why is that increase justified when much smaller but important government agencies are being cut drastically or eliminated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we have so much more to protect.  </p>
<p>The US  is its economy.  Without our trading partners and ability to trade throughout the world the US would be completely crippled.  The economy 2017 is global, not regional or local.</p>
<p>Lets imagine for a moment that the US decided that it was no longer going to maintain its extremely large and expensive navy.  They would no longer project power and recalled all its troops from its bases in Japan, Germany, turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Guam, Diego Garcia, UK, Greece, Honduras, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Djibouti, Bulgaria, Brazil, Belgium, Bahrain, Australia,and the UAE.</p>
<p>Would China, Russia, India or Iran decide to immediately cut off parts of the world to US shipping?  Probably not.  But could they?  Absolutely.  Not only could they stop us from trading out, but they could stop others from sending us the things we need.  Oil for instance.  Do you realize what would happen if China decided to mobilize a fleet of submarines and isolate the middle eastern oil fields from the rest of the world?  It would crush and cripple the entire world economy in a day.</p>
<p>The world economy is based on one thing.  Confidence.  Confidence that things may change, but will NOT change quickly.  The fact that the US is so determined to keep things as they are that they are willing to spend $600,000,000,000 makes people very willing to take risks and expand markets.  </p>
<p>The US Allies in Europe are the most vulnerable to attack.  Russia sits on a large military and animosity towards its former republics.  It has a dictator in power who has proven that he is willing to attack sovereign nations and take their territory.  Europe/NATO has shown that it will allow this in its back yard with no military action and just using sanctions.  you may agree or disagree with that, but what is indisputable is that when Russia flexes its muscles like that, it creates uncertainty in the world economy.  Too much uncertainty and people stop buying things.  People stop buying things and people lose jobs, people lose jobs and people stop buying even more things and more people lose jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I understand the big picture implications. Oil trade is a complicated issue in itself. It's like we are all playing a huge real life game of Settlers of Catan over the course of several hundred years. Everyone has their own supply of natural/manufactured resources, I just hope nobody &quot;cheats&quot; or bullies the weaker players and we can all &quot;play nice&quot;. </p>
<p>TIL Diego Garcia and Djibouti are a thing. We have military bases in a lot of places. Why do they allow this?</p></div>		</li>
