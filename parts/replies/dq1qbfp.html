			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely rags out the engine. The worst problem though is regulating how much you put through at once. A friend of mine put waaay too much in his Camaro and took it to a drag strip. He said he got to 3rd before he saw the most magnificent explosion of his life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear. When done properly, keeping the a/f ratio on point and not exceeding the internal stress limits of the internal components of the engine you can run an n2o setup for as long as you own the car without decreasing the life of the motor.</p>
<p>Saying it rags out the engine is not really a fair statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't allow the engine to &quot;handle&quot; anything more than it normally would. Nitrous is a power adder and nothing more. If you use too much, or use it too often you will destroy your engine. The increased pressure can lead to catastrophic engine failure if the motor was not built to handle it. That's why you'll often see high performance engines built with forged internals and metal gaskets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,
If the wear components like piston rings or valve seats were not designed for those increased pressures they will have a significantly reduced life in the engine.  Bearings in the crankshaft will also see increased wear levels from the increased throw force during the NO combustion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit.  Nitrous Oxide, N2O, is stored as a liquid under pressure.  When you release the pressure by injecting it into your air intake, the liquid rapidly boils to a very cold gas.  This increases the density of the gas going into your air intake.</p>
<p>Once in the engine, the nitrous decomposes, 2 N2O -&gt; 2 N2 + O2 + heat.  This is the exothermic part.  Just freeing up the oxygen generates a non-trivial amount of power.  Also, note that in order to get 1 molecule of O2 in your car, the car had to suck in 2 molecules of N2O.  However, if you are breathing air, you have to suck in 5 molecules of air to get one of oxygen.  So for a given volume or weight of gas taken into the engine you get more oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
