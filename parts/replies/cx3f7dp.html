			<div class="markdown"><p>It might, but sometimes the noise is airborne as the wires in the walls of your home also work as 50/60 Hz antennas.
You would typically experience this if you have a set of active speakers for your PC with a long AUX cable.<br />
Unplug the AUX cable in the PC and leave it on the floor, then turn on your active speakers. If they hum, they're most likely picking up a grid frequency signal and amplifying it to audible levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't think so - your laptop doesn't require an earth ground (otherwise it wouldn't work on battery). I'd think unplugging would make a ground loop worse since your grounds are now all floating, rather than being strongly pulled down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some laptop power supplies have a grounded plug, others don't.  </p>
<p>The grounded designs should always be plugged into a grounded outlet, since the line and neutral are capacitively coupled to the ground wire in order to reduce electrical interference. If the ground prong isn't actually connected to the ground, the filter capacitors form a voltage divider that causes the power supply &quot;ground&quot; to float at half of line voltage. Since the low voltage output of the power supply is usually tied to the power supply ground, this causes the entire laptop to float at half of line voltage. If you have your headphones plugged in and you are somewhat grounded trough the floor or something you touch you are likely to hear some mains hum from the headphones due to interference.  </p>
<p>Power supplies without a grounded plug use a fully isolated topology (with nothing connecting the low voltage side to the AC input side) and thus do not suffer from this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some Samson SR850s I just got. If the volume is fairly high with nothing playing I hear a good amount of noise. A dac/amp would fix this? Is that all it would do besides make it louder? My mobo has a Realtec ALC892 sound chipset. Is a dac/amp worth it? The cans are 32 ohm impedance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Check the cable path between the front-panel header (if that's where you're plugging in your headphones) and the appropriate plug on the motherboard.  Often, the thin cabling has to travel right beside the very loud, possibly very-RF-noisy graphics card.</p>
<p>Finding an alternate cabling route may help, as would twisting the cable (loosely) if untwisted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh of course, an external DAC and amp. I'll pick one of each up when I pop round the chemist's for a packet of crisps and milk of magnesia.</p></div>		</li>

You can get a USB-based one at just about any halfway decent computer shop, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16829102069&amp;cm_re=usb_dac-_-29-102-069-_-Product" target="_blank">Here's one for 50 bucks on Newegg</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>An amplifier is usually only necessary to drive higher-end headphones correctly and at louder volumes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a nightmare to some extent.  I used to setup AV equipment at conventions and people almost never realize that all the AV equipment needs to be on the same loop.  This is why we use power drops.  I remember once a group of people getting mad about a buzzing in their audio.  Tried to say we hooked up the equipment wrong.  Turns out the playback computer was plugged into a wall outlet where all the equipment was on the drop.  </p>
<p>Course the thing that pisses me off the most are people who plug in or unplug audio jacks with the audio switch still energized.  Sure let's just blow those nice fancy speakers for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you're working with high powered amps and such plugging in mics or other devices there's a high chance you'll get a voltage spike that causes a loud boom or buzz sound.  Loud enough that it can permanently damage speakers.  There's always the very rare chance there's a short/fault in the system and you can get shocked as well.</p></div>		</li>
