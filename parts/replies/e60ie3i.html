			<div class="markdown"><p>One of Google's ranking factors is the &quot;bounce rate&quot;, which means, if a high percentage of people click on a link in Google's search results page, and then quickly return back to Google, Google thinks it probably must have been a bad search result (because if people had found what they were looking for, they would have stayed longer and not immediately went back to Google).</p>
<p>This leads to a worse ranking position for that particular site in the future, because Google tries to deliver good/relevant search results.</p>
<p>So in order to keep the bounce rate low, some (shady) website owners prevent you from going back to Google to keep that metric low.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can click and hold the back button of your browser to go more than 1 step back, so you can get back to Google this way, though. </p></div>		</li>

Please disable the back button.&quot; There are obviously better solutions, but sometimes in a large company the wrong choice is made for you.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real problem is the backspace being used by most browsers as a back button, which is infuriating in and of itself. Like that needs to cease being a thing. Then we wouldn't be getting the management asking web devs to &quot;disable the back button&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 90's I made several websites using HTML. You better believe they were user friendly. You could easily go back and forth between all the pages and back out, so I think folks are paying numbnuts for shitty graphic only websites that are not user friendly and contain the least amount of information as possible so they will keep clicking to the next page to obtain that. It's as evil as having no contact information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can think of three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>most web developers are experienced and competent navigators of web pages, and deal with this sort of behaviour as a minor irritation, not even realising how confusing it can be for other users.</li>
<li>many web developers are less skilled practitioners, and use the tool they know (eg JavaScript redirects, which clutter up the browser history) rather than the right tool (301/302 redirect messages, which don’t), not knowing or not caring that they’re making everyone’s lives a little harder.</li>
<li>unscrupulous web developers will do anything they can to keep you on their site, generating views and clicks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some combination of those three will probably explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that leaves the same trail in the browser history as the JS approach. If you have access to the web-server, google for “server-side redirects” - that will explain the 301 redirect approach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends, do you use them correctly? Javascript and refresh <meta> tags are generally bad, while HTTP status code use is correct.</p>
<p>301 means &quot;page moved permanently&quot; and browsers and web crawlers may take this to mean that bookmarks and links should be updated automatically. Some browsers will cache the redirect and not attempt to load the page from the original URL, even if you directly type it. This makes testing 301 redirects a bitch.</p>
<p>302 is actually deprecated. Use 303 or 307 instead. Browsers usually interpret this as 303.</p>
<p>303 means &quot;see other&quot; and is usually sent in response to a form being submitted. It means that the server has received the request but doesn't want to send a response directly; instead the user should send a new GET request (even if the original request was POST) for the specified page.</p>
<p>307 means &quot;temporary redirect&quot;, and instructs the browser to re-issue the same request again, with the same method using the specified URL. Existing links and bookmarks must not be updated, and future requests to the original URL should not be sent to the new URL. Note that this is different to 303 in that form data will be re-sent.</p>
<p>None of these pollute the browser history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am a developer (not web) and yeah plenty of devs are just not that good or are completely retarded when it comes to usability. Often the person paying your wages asks for something dumb and can’t be educated out of it and you have no choice. </p>
<p>So my main point was going to be that I am confident enough with web browsing and still despise sites that do this, it’s not just a mild annoyance - it’s the principle of it. Once I learn a site does it I avoid it because fuck them. </p></div>		</li>
