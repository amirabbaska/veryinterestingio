			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a dream come true for me. I dont have any of the muscle issues but I am also an extremely light sleeper. Do you still have muscle pain? Do you feel that the magnesium helped your pain therefore helping you sleep; or that the magnesium directly helped you sleep? Id try pretty much anything to not be such a light sleeper! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the severe muscle cramping at night anymore, and I'm not sure if the absence of the cramping or the magnesium directly is what is helping me sleep, but for me all I know is that it works. With that said, there has been much written about the affect of magnesium on sleep, such as the following:

<p>Give it a try. I was in desperate need of sleep for 17 years (when I had my first child) and I tried everything. I was resorting to taking Lunesta every three days to get some sleep as I would spend two nights of getting poor sleep and then capitulating to Lunesta out of sheer desperation every third day. I didn't take it every night because I was so fearful of addiction. Taking magenisum for sleep has been a miracle for me, and I hope you will be able to get some benefits too. I'm not a doctor so I don't know how it all works but I would give it 3-5 days of taking the supplement to see if it has any affect. One other great tip for falling back asleep is Dr. Weil's sleep 4-7-8 sleep technique. Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>
