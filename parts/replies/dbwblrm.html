			<div class="markdown"><p>Some tribes are base 12 and use the sections of your fingers (not thumb) on the hand to count.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I thought it was base ten, 0-9 in each place as binary is 0-1 in each place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The argument for using base 12 is unexpectedly strong. It's divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6, making simple fractions really easy to represent and calculate. A lot of ancient civilizations used base 12 or base 60 (see: modern timekeeping) for presumably this reason while mercantilism was still maturing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know, but why wouldn't you, so that you could count higher?</p>
<p>And I would strongly disagree that &quot;your hands ARE base 11&quot;, the whole point of that paragraph is there are a dozen &quot;natural&quot; bases to your hand. Even though I agree that particular one doesn't actually strictly require the foot to be base 11, neither do the other ones mentioned require other body parts either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but your hands have 11 obvious states. No fingers up (0), or 1 through 10 fingers up. That equals 11. There's no easy or obvious way to claim your hands are base 10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>base ten is only 0-9. Ten is a combination of 1 and 0.</p>
<p>10 = (0 <em> 10^0) + (1 </em> 10^1) = 10. </p></div>		</li>
