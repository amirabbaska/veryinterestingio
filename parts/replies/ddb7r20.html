<p>I suppose that is the wisdom behind lifetime service for judges - so they can long outlive any elected representative's term... although Congress have no re-election limits so it's still pretty sketchy right? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd argue that the real answer to your question is that most of these things can be overridden by Congress one way or another if Congress has the votes. So saying &quot;what happens if Congress does what they want and the party in control gets everything they want&quot; is only something that happens when a very large amount of Congress agrees. They are all elected. So it's right that they should get their way, the people want that. Of course if they do something other than what the people want they'll all get voted out next election and they won't have people in the government to do what you say.</p></div>		</li>

<p>yes that seems the best check there is, although the legislature also gets to draw voting lines and pass voting bills to affect this right? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wish that happened, but they won't. People don't actually pay attention to what their representatives do, and if they vote at all it's always along party lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Judges get lifetime appointments so that their term ending can't be turned into a political platform.</p>
<p>The reason they are appointed is so that they don't have to deal with with pressure from their constituents to stay in office. This allows them to vote for what they think is best for the country. </p>
<p>The other branches have to do what their constituents want or they will be replaced.</p>
<p>Recent events have shown us that we need to refine how we make judicial appointments. The constitution should be amended to say that the president that is in office at the time a judicial is vacated is the person who shall make the appointment.</p>
<p>The way it is now we can have the legislative branch decide that a president no longer gets to exercise their appointment powers. </p>
<p>This means that Obama only got to use his appointment powers for 3 years in his second term. While Trump gets to use his appointment powers for 5 years in his 4 year term.</p>
<p>What's worse is several senators have stated that they would not have allowed Clinton to make her appointments for her entire term. This level of obstruction should not be allowed. Its very hard for the country to move forward when one of the parties refuses to do its job.</p>
<p>This election had the supreme court as a political issue and the supreme court should never be voted on, even indirectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The judicial branch has a party affiliation because the supreme court justices have minds of their own and have their own beliefs and values, which can be party biased. Also justices are appointed and approved by the other two branches of the government, so it is entirely possible to stack the supreme court with partisan judges. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each has a jurisprudence far more complicated than that.  And the trouble is party's change, but SCOTUS is for life. Sandra Day was a Republican when appointed, but the party passed her by.  Scalia was a Republican that opposed broad LEO powers under the 4th amendment. Kennedy can't make up his mind.</p>
<p>It's more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
