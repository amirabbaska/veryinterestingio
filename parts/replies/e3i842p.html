			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of using a hex editor to modify save game states. Have 5 lives?  Save the game.  Open that save game in a hex editor and find every attribute set to 5.  Go back to the game, lose a life, save, and open in hex, search for 4.</p>
<p>Doing this a few times, you can find the attribute location for lives (in this example), which you can then modify.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It basically was, they just encoded the numbers as different letters.  Instead of 0-F they had 16 different letters.  There was some bit-shifting involved, but it boils down to an address and a single value to return whenever that address is read.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Game Genies were pretty much just hex editors. I remember my brother-in-law got a Game Shark for his PlayStation back in the day and I remember us trying to change his car's horsepower in some Gran Turismo game. The PS Game sharks were pretty advanced as compared to the NES/Sega ones. You could actually scan all memory looking for a specific value. (As opposed to blindly guessing like on the original Game Genie) So, scan looking for the car's horsepower, change it, then scan again for the new value. The game will show you every address where the first value changed to the second. Then you could put in a code to modify the value how you wanted.  Unfortunately, the only thing we did was change the HP displayed on the car status screen. It didn't change the HP of the car itself.  So the status screen SHOWED him having a 20,000 horsepower engine, but it still actually had 300 or whatever.</p>
<p>Still, it was really fun to screw around with it.</p></div>		</li>
