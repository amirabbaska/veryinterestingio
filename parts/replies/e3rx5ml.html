<p>Perennial ryegrass does not have rhizomes or stolons. Though recently a rhizomatous perennial ryegrass has been bred.</p></div>		</li>

<p>stolons</p>

<p>I had to look up the pronunciation of that. I wanted to bring this interesting difference to a colleague of mine, but when I tried the word out loud I was stick between messing it up as &quot;Stallone&quot; or messing it up as &quot;Stalin&quot; .</p>
<p>So I'll save everyone the etymological trouble and sum some things up:</p>
<p>ˈstōlən : is the phonetic spelling and sounds like the word stolen but with a kind of subtle short 'eh' sound or soft &amp; very short 'o' instead of the e rolling into the n sound at the end like in stolen or pen.</p>
<p>The term is Latin derived from : stolo , or stolon which can mean a few different things, 1. Shoot as in a literal shoot of a plant or a figurative mean of parent. 2. Scion as in a small branch or to be descended from something or someone more significant.</p>
<p>The word is also used in talking about a separate piece of an extending or 'connecting' part of some fungi, or other mycological organisms. The term is also used in zoology for the external skeletal part that connect egg in sperm during the mating process of bryozoans or moss animals (a common one being the tapeworm.) The biological use of stolon structures first appeared in the fossil record somewhere around 540-650 million years ago, but I am unsure of which kind of the three different types this refers and couldn't find a good source to confirm that specific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood how science classifies something as a single organism vs a colony of individuals.  I get that still attached plants such as a new bush growing as a sucker of the parent plant or still attached rhizomes might be a single organism. </p>
<p>Cut that rhizome and is it still a single organism? Or two separate clones? Same with situations where someone cuts a branch and makes or grow roots, like how roses are proprogated. Same with the massive fungal colonies that they occasionally find and are somehow consider to be one organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in social behavior of eusocial taxa, and this has been one of the most intriguing questions that routinely comes up, and is a matter of intense debate amongst biologists and philosophers of science. For a great read on the subject, check out Pradeau's 2016 treatment of the matter.</p>
<p>The idea of individuality is a very human notion, and we use it because it is helpful to provide a frame of reference at various levels of scope. In reality, there is no good definition of &quot;an individual&quot; because <em>there is no such thing</em> as a cohesive individual. All multicellular life is effectively a colony of highly-specialized or highly-derived microorganisms. This is particularly true when considered on a temporal axis as even your own body is subject to a sort of Ship of Theseus paradox as parts of you are continuously replaced. We see this leitmotif repeated in eusocial organisms, as a given bee in the hive functions more akin to a cell in your body than a distinct organism, echoing the emergence of multicellular life.  Things become even stranger at the unicellular level, where the delineations of &quot;self&quot; are very fluid. Hell, there's some odd examples like biofilm consortia where parts of &quot;an individual&quot; aren't even the same <em>species</em> (eg Ereshefsky &amp; Pedroso 2015).</p>
<p>In truth, the only way to conceptualize &quot;an individual&quot; is to pick a functional definition that works for your field. In most cases, that's going to be a definition based on physiology-- namely a functional integration of disparate parts with a shared metabolism. This is probably what most people think of when they think of &quot;an individual&quot;, but it can be a useless definition in a lot of cases like with grass or jellyfish. Someone more focused on evolution will forego that in favor of an evolutionary definition-- an individual is one unit upon which natural selection can act, whether this is a lizard, a person, or an entire beehive. As an ethologist, I use a functional definition centered on the idea of a shared identity unique to the parts of the individual, discernible by those parts, and disparate from other closely-related individuals. Your immune system is a good example of this-- it is an identity shared with all of your cells even across time that allows your body to distinguish self from non-self. Bees use a similar method of shared odor markers that lets them tell nestmate from non-nestmate. This isn't remotely perfect, but it is entirely functional.</p>
<p>In short, there's no such thing as an individual except where it's useful for humans to categorize things in such a manner.</p></div>		</li>
