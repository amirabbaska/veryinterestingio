<p>Bigger houses, but efficiency methods have improved immensely. Argon filled partitioned window panes, geothermal heat pumps, improvements in insulation technologies, increased efficiency in heat pumps (eg A/C)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cars. Cars in the 50s were hand made. You had to pay immense wages compared to what you pay a robot to do. Manufacturing has streamlined and logic says that costs should go down (pretty shitty that isn't the case). They've gotten fancy as shit, but unit output has increased, quality is more readily attainable, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electricity. Yeah there was less devices to be powered, but how much did electricity cost, comparatively? Improvements in step-up/down transformers for long range power transfer has reduced the losses immensely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes. Yeahhh...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food. Crop yields have increased, how else can we get foods out of season? Surplus of stock is frozen and preserved. Shouldn't supply and demand dictate price should go? Complex situation this is though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yeah, you're right, that wasn't a very good example. Prosperity due to WWII victory fueled increased spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical care. What's the point of insurance then?</p>
</li>

<p>Bigger hole in the ground for the foundation, lots of shingles for the roof.  More and bigger windows all means more $ for construction and later maintenance.   More heating ducts, wiring, fasteners, dry wall, baseboard, switches, outlets, etc.  Air conditioning?  In your house?  That was for rich people, regular folks would sit on the porch, go to the mall (which was A/C'd) or see a movie.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Like I said, for what you get, cars are cheap.  But take away all of the extra stuff (robot installed or otherwise) and have it assembled by robots and it would be cheaper yet.  No A/C (in the south, no heater...), no electric windows, cheap seats, manual transmission, no safety glass or collapsible steering column, no radial / bias ply tires, crappy suspension. Also, your chances of death would be much higher.  I'm happier paying the extra $ for the safety, it's hard to buy a &quot;basic&quot; car w/o the electric everything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electricity. Yeah there was less devices to be powered,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cost of electricity varied greatly depending on where you lived (in the country, in the us, the electric company was commonly a quasi-governmental company).  The point was, even though there were few electric devices, the cost was high enough that people cared to economize.  Where I lived, we weren't the only electric/utility misers. It wasn't uncommon for parts of a house be left unheated in the winter (or, as we would say, shut), even if the house itself was small.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Food. Crop yields have increased, how else can we get foods out of season? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crop yields and seasonality are orthogonal with respect to fresh produce.  A strawberry can't be raised in MN in January, but it can be raised in June/July, in abundance.  Once picked, it needs to be to the market and purchased in a few days before it rots.  Fresh, out of season fruits exist because of shipping and willingness to pay.  Purchasing fresh produce also means paying for the transportation and waste produce as well (this is hard for people to grasp...).  Canning and freezing (and other preservation methods) work to keep the cost of food down, but once preserved, the food is no longer &quot;fresh&quot; produce, but would be much cheaper because the high crop yields were also preserved. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Medical care</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's like a car.  The medical care product isn't like the Ford Falcon of the 1960's, it's a quantum leap better, at a correspodingly higher price.  For many illnesses, the patent and family accepted death was the outcome, if not the best outcome.  Insurance is a way of spreading cost across a group of people, the cost of medical care has greatly increased because we're able to treat diseases that before would have been treated by making the patient comfortable before death.  With more cost to share, each sharing the cost pays more.  I prefer paying more and getting the top technology we have today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points. Everyone could scale back to a 1950's style lifestyle, so that the mega wealthy can continue to monopolize resources. Or we could somewhat reduce wage disparity.</p>
<p>There's still so many cool technological advanced on the horizon. I think it's unreasonable to expect that the masses live with 1950's expectations so that the very few can horde the benefits of humanity's accomplishments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you for being one of the only commenters here to talk about how much more we spend (or waste) now compared to 40 years ago. our more complicated lifestyles and the need to keep up have gone up way faster than normal inflation type costs that were always common. there so much more emphasis on what past generations would consider excess being considered as normal now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is so true.  That means customer pay for the product they purchase, and all of the waste that goes into the display.  Then the food waste once it gets home is something north of 30%.  </p></div>		</li>
