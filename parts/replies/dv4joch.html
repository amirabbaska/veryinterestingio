			<div class="markdown"><p>This is rambly and not complete, but I think it helps.</p>
<p>Pathology between people varies.  Some people see imagined things as brightly as real life, and some cannot visualize imagined things at all.  That same variation can happen anywhere in the brain.</p>
<p>This can be a direct connection having more connections, or a connection going somewhere else.  We even have crosstalk between adjacent regions, which why areas can get remapped to other functions.</p>
<p>The most drastic of changes happens at the earliest ages.  The neurons are still multiplying, and building support structures, astrocytes, etc, but it never stops, just slows and spreads out.</p>
<p>In some people, there may be particularly strong reactivity.  This may be to structural errors, structural damage, or incorrect network training.  Perhaps signalt are propagated with too many neurotransmitter molecules, or too many synapses.  Perhaps the neurotransmitters are not properly broken down, and leak out of the synapse to adjacent synapses.  Perhapse inhibitory neurons did not grow completely.  Perhapse trauma, physical or mental, caused incorrect connections into one of the places signals get amplified and sent back out.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to get there, but ultimately, a seizure is a feedback loop.  Think of a microphone too close to its speaker.</p>
<p>A complicating factor is, the most used pathways get strengthened and reinforced.  Unless you completely burn out the nerves somewhere in the loop, it may reinforce itself over time.  </p>
<p>Sometimes it is a thin pathway that does burn itself out, and the seizures go away.  Sometimes it is an area of damage that self repairs enough to reconnect where it belongs, and the seizures go away.  Sometimes it is a major pathway that never goes away by itself.</p>
<p>As to flashing lights, or any trigger, consider the brain is always firing neurons.  The brain is architecturally two balloons that were deflated and stuffed in your head.  The skin of the balloon is where the actual processing occurs.  The “air” part are longer wires connecting to the other side, or to the body.  The neurons connect on a mesh, outward.  If you had one input on each side, the whole brain would signal related to that one input.</p>
<p>A thought is when the pattern loops around enough to resonate.  Each bump, dip, etc can trigger a thought spuriously, but mostly it comes from somewhere else.  Usually, that input is converted from a complex signal, but if it is simple, intense, and very similar to the natural frequency of that part of the mesh, it will ring, echo, oscillate, etc.  This concept is used in hypnosis sometimes.</p>
<p>If there is a propagation error in the signals, the resonance may override signals in other areas of the brain.  That is a seizure.  They can be n “absence seizure” where the person zones out, or a “mal” seizure where motor neurons are affected, or anything you can think of.  Any error in any part of the brain that leads to an feedback loop will be a seizure.</p>
<p>When the neurons get tired, the seizure stops.</p></div>		</li>

Are you saying: processing is only near the surface of the brain?<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do these uninhibited feedback loops have potential to cause further damage? Something like overheating or electrical burns? Is there a limit on how much activity can be produced? Or is it like the feedback loop of a diesel runaway, where it'll eat as fast as you can feed it, until the metal breaks down and finally fails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, the inhibitory neurons (often interneurons) die off. Or, there can be a loss of the excitatory fibers that synapse onto the interneurons, causing a reduction in inhibitory drive. Think of this as effectively taking the brakes off a car.      </p>
<p>In other cases the actual circuits are misformed, so that there can excitatory loops which form and drive uncontrolled spiking. Think of this as the accelerator getting pressed down and stuck in the down position. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, thank you very much!
I’m gonna make a wild guess here that the root cause(s) of such abnormalities is currently unknown, would that be correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost completely unknown, sadly. It's an extremely hard thing to do tests on because you'd want to start digging in at the nerve cell level whilst a seizure is occurring. Also whilst we are very good at seeing what's happening at a macro level (MRI scans) and a micro level (individual cells or small clusters), this sort of problem is occurring at the millions-of-neurons level in some specialised anatomical structures. Creating a model to experiment on is pretty much impossible at our current levels of technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a fun side note:</p>
<p>Synchronization in parts of the brain that process vision can be a very useful thing.  We can use steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) to allow people with severe disabilities to communicate, control computers, etc.  We put several options (like four blocks of letters) on the screen and flash each at a different frequency.  We observe a certain frequency with electrodes placed on the scalp over the occipital lobe (EEG), and select the option that was flickering at that frequency.</p>
<p><strong>Photesensitve seizure warning:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZupEt1uvcls" target="_blank">Here is a video of this process</a></p>
<p>Of course, if this synchronization is so strong that it stands out from all of the other activity that we can record from your scalp, you can see how it would get out of control in a person prone to seizures.</p></div>		</li>
