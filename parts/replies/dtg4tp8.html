<p>I used to work for an aluminum smelter. The process uses a significant amount of electricity. The company had a contract to buy low-cost power, and a contract to do voluntary outages to sell power back to the grid in times of high demand. Outages wreaked havoc with the potline, so it wasnâ€™t without risks, but it always seemed like the ultimate screw job that we got the power at a super cheap rate, then sold it back at a premium.</p></div>		</li>
