			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: It's just the name of a place in the brain that is roughly the size of a walnut.</p>
<p><strong>Hippocampus</strong> is the Latin version of the Greek name for <strong>seahorse</strong>. When surgeons take the brain apart in big visible chunks, the structure resembles a seahorse.</p>
<p>Just looking at the big chunks of the brain is &quot;gross anatomy&quot;, but in fact, the hippocampus consists of multiple smaller areas. To study these smaller areas would require surgeons to make many small cuts to the hippocampus itself and to use a microscope. This is what we call &quot;microanatomy&quot;.</p>
<p>We actually have two of these &quot;hippocampi&quot;, one to the left and one to the right of the brain.</p>
