			<div class="markdown"><p>The two times I took acid with a friend in college by the end of the night he was freaking out/needed to lay down so I ended up laying on his couch staring at the ceiling above me. The popcorn texture looked like a ceiling of squirming maggots both times. Pretty strange. I also felt like my emotions were plugged into his. If he was happy, I was, when he got paranoid, I freaked out. Had some good times, saw some cool shit, flew RC helicopters with crazy lights on them in the dark, used laundry detergent to create galaxies on his ceiling by dipping our fingers in it and flicking at the ceiling under black lights. Overall, it was fun. I was convinced I had to poop for like an hour though, and couldnâ€™t. Worst part. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I was looking at this piece of plywood that was also made into a sort of door, and then the L kicked in and the individual knobs/brown circles in the plywood began shifting as you would expect. </p>
<p>As it began to shift up and down more and more, they took the shape of a Native American man's face, complete with hair, laugh lines, and a completely real face for a moment and a tear ran down his cheek before disappearing back into nonsensical patterns of the woodwork.</p>
<p>To this day, it is one of the most beautiful touching things I've ever seen. I really began to think about how little we know of where so much we take for granted comes from. Like the tree that plywood was made of and all its history, only for me to see it all these years later and witness that in its frame all trippy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my first Electric Forest, our vet friend gave us the pro-tip to take a day completely to ourselves in the forest. Each of us picked a day, broke off from the group and experienced the forest alone for a night. Naturally i picked acid night to be my day alone. 4 tabs and wandering the woods alone with no watch or cellphone, no idea who was playing at what times or at which stages, or what time it was at any given moment. One of the most freeing experiences I've ever had. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did mushrooms at my first EF this year. At the end of the night I couldn't find my campsite for the life of me. The entire experience was freeing. I can't even imagine going off by myself on acid. I'll add it to my checklist for EF2018.</p></div>		</li>
