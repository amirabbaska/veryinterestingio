<p>Just remember to count calories as well as fasting, you won't lose weight if you're still eating more than your tdee</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This. Most people interested in weight loss need to just focus on counting calories versus trying to find some fad (and I don't mean that in a negative way) diet without keeping track of energy input versus output. Intermittent fasting can be great but its main benefit to weight loss is that it's much more difficult to consume a day's worth of calories in 8 hours than it is 16 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I weighed 93.6 kg a month ago.
I started walking about 8-9 km per day and basically gave up breakfast and lunch (maybe 1 or 2 pieces of fruit instead).
Now I weigh 88 kg. That's almost 12lb in a month through fasting.</p>
<p>And chicken salad is filling and great for dinner and has very few calorinos.</p></div>		</li>
