			<div class="markdown"><p>That...doesn't make a lot of sense given that the air has 20x more oxygen than water. <a href="https://dnr.mo.gov/env/esp/wqm/DOSaturationTable.htm" target="_blank">There is only about ~14mg of O2 per liter of freshwater, maximum (at 0 &deg;C)</a>. This compares to about 270 mg O2/liter of air at sea level.  And goldfish, at least, can live for literally hours out of water already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually how respiration works. In order for gas oxygen to get into the liquid blood, there needs to be a layer of water in contact of the exchange area. This is the case for gills of course, as they are always surrounded by water, but also in lungs, where <em>each</em> alveola is covered by a thin layer of water. </p>
<p>The problem with gills not being stiff <del>about</del> enough and collapsing is that it reduces the total exchange area by a lot, preventing the crab from breathing if the gills are not &quot;floating&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what I could find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most fish would actually be able to breathe air if it weren't for the fact that their gills collapse when not supported by water. The gills of some crab species are much more stiff and thus can retain their surface area outside water, allowing them to breathe air.</p>

<p>Some 2 stroke diesels need forced induction though, usually a supercharger.</p></div>		</li>
