			<div class="markdown"><p>Different frequencies/wavelengths pass through or absorbed by different materials. So glass doesn't necessarily let through eg. far infrared or much UV.</p>
<p>One thing light is particularly bad at is passing through a hole smaller than the wavelength. Microwave ovens have a metal grill on the door with holes much smaller than the wavelength (which is about a centimeter) so very little of the light can get through this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The door has a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Fzitx0Z.jpg" target="_blank">metal mesh</a> over it.  This is sufficient to reflect the waves inwards again and prevent their escape.</p>
<p>For more on how this works look up the Faraday cage effect:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The metal cage around the oven (including the mesh over the glass on the door) reflects the radio waves inwards and that internal reflection is what keeps them at a concentrated high level on the inside.  If the door was to come off but the microwave oven still operate (which the microwave has safety features to prevent) then it will struggle to build up enough focused waves to make anything significantly hot in any one place.  And the mere waves themselves are not any of the cancer-causing variety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! So the waves are only dangerous when they create a vibration or heat because they're non-ionizing rays?</p></div>		</li>
