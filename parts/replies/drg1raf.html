<p>edit: they usually do that on a hook hanging on the wall. In the latest video they use a machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JkQWhScF4-0?t=97" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/JkQWhScF4-0?t=97</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold the heck up I just realized I live right by this place and even been there a few times. Its a really cool place with all kinds of boardgames and toys they even have a yo-yo workshop but I didn't know they made candy live. Also it seems like they not only use Victorian era machines but they harvest their sugar cane from an old 1800's farm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The white parts and the opaque colors have holes. The translucent parts do not. Usually, it's white and red (or any) colored stripes over an uncolored core. </p>
<p>So the white stripes on a candy cane do, the color stripes don't, and the core usually doesn't, but can if they used white candy for the core.</p></div>		</li>
