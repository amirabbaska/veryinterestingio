			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue regarding the length of a nozzle is that it has to be adapted to the maximum ambiant pressure it will be exposed when the engine is running. For example, if the presssure near the exit of the nozzle drops below ambiant it could be crushed by pressure forces if it's not strong enough (but strong = weight). Several solutions exist, like sacrifying efficiency at high altitude with a shorter nozzle, using adaptative length nozzle etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. You cleared it up for me. I’m interested in how the nozzle exactly does this and I will look more into it. I noticed a lot of people saying the whole throwing a bowling ball away from you example and of course I’ve already heard that but fuel is not as compact as a bowling ball. That’s what made me confused. If you throw air away from you, the air won’t be expelled in a straight line away from you like a bowling ball would. Air would travel in all directions. But now that you have explained this, I understand that the nozzle helps direct the fuel in a certain path with a low enough <em>pressure</em> to “counteract the spread” of the fuel. </p>
<p>P.S. I understand what high pressure to low pressure is, I just wanted to put it into simpler terms </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it traveled in all directions, it can't travel in one: towards the rocket. The net effect will still push the rocket. Also the velocity of the air molecules when they exit is high, thrust is related to mass and velocity; faster you get them to exit, the less mass you need. The moment the air molecule exits the nozzle, it has expelled all the energy it had and travels at constant speed. Same happens in air, the push against the air molecules is minimal, it is the velocity of gas molecules when they exit that creates the thrust. As long as we have less molecules going to one direction, we will start to move towards that direction.</p>
<p>We can make a grain of sand to have same mass as a bowling ball, we just need to accelerate it to astronomical speeds. So expelling one grain of sands worth of material with high enough velocity the effect is same as expelling a bowling ball that has less velocity.</p>
<p>So it is not low enough velocity, it is the high velocity that matters. The nozzle speeds it up while also directing it more or less to one direction but it's main job really is about speed, not so much direction..</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is technically correct, but misleading. What actually matters is the momentum (mass times velocity). You don't have to hit relativistic velocity for your sand to be as effective as a slower bowling ball. Based on a couple of google searches, a bowling ball has a mass of about 5 kg, and a grain of sand has a mass of about 0.000666 kg. The bowling ball has 7500 times as much mass, so the sand needs to go about 7500 times faster to have the same momentum. A good cutoff for &quot;relativistic velocity&quot; is one tenth the speed of light. Dividing that amount by 7500, we find that if you are launching your bowling balls slower than around 4000 m/s, a comparable grain of sand will still be going slower than relativistic speeds and the effect on its actual mass will be negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind, a rocket is really an incredibly elaborate pumping system. This is the data for the Saturn V fuel pumps:</p>
<p>The fuel pump delivered 15,471 US gallons (58,560 litres) of RP-1 per minute while the oxidizer pump delivered 24,811 US gal (93,920 l) of liquid oxygen per minute. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you consider the combustion chamber in the engine, it is basically just a tube that is open in one end. When you ignite the fuel on the inside, the pressure inside increases, and it pushes on all the walls of the chamber equally - only, at one end, the wall isn't as big - it has the opening. This means that the fuel that would have pushed the rocket downwards instead escapes the engine, leaving only the parts of the fuel that pushes upwards and outwards, giving the thrust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the diagram is only valid for supersonic flow. The diffuser increases velocity in this case, however for subsonic flow (below speed of sound) the diffuser would actually decrease velocity. </p></div>		</li>
