			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. Wicked v Filburn effectively created the judicial precedent that you need not actually engage in interstate commerce to be subjected to the laws regulating it. </p>
<p>The decision was effectively that, by growing wheat on his own land for his own consumption, the result of many others doing this would impact interstate commerce, despite not participating in it. Therefore, impact on, not participation in, interstate commerce became the new test by which activities could be regulated.</p>
<p>Taken to its unlimited interpretation, there's no commercial activity you can engage in that won't impact interstate commerce. Therefore, the federal government can now leverage this to regulate your activities even if they never leave the state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For my business law class (not law school, just a class) we had to do a case brief on US v. Lopez.  Basically this high school senior had brought a firearm on campus, they eventually brought federal charges against him under the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990.  The District Court found that the GFSZA was constitutional because it was within Congress's right to regulate activities affecting interstate commerce.  Lopez appealed, and the Supreme Court sided with him and found Congress was totally exceeding its authority.  </p>
<p>Chief Justice Rehnquist's argument was that if they accepted the Government's argument, Congress would have unlimited power.  Rehnquist even mentioned Wickard v Filburn as the most extreme case of activity affecting interstate commerce.  It was cool to see the checks and balances system working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I love this case in particular because it finally put to rest the overused nature of the Commerce Clause for the most ludicrous things. I also hate how during the Roosevelt Administration interstate commerce began to apply also to intrastate commerce as if they were synonymous. This is one of those few decisions that I totally agreed with during the early era of the Rehnquist Court. I mean, the legislative branch had been given so much power during the era of the New Deal and finally after nearly 60 years of unchecked power our legislative branch was finally thwarted in their attempt to label anything they desired as interstate commerce to increase the power of the federal government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't think 10 steps forward 1 step back qualifies as &quot;checks and balances working&quot;.  Federal prohibition on growing marijuana on your own property for personal use is still &quot;constitutional&quot; under the &quot;intestate&quot; commerce clause.

<p>...and regulate your <em>lack</em> of activities <em>cough</em>ACA<em>cough</em>.</p>
<p>Wickard's logic is technically, arguably sound... at least on a certain level. Of course it's also horrifying, because that logic (in theory) allows for the regulation of virtually <em>any human activity</em> across the entire country, by federal legislation (or even executive action, as that becomes ever more expansive) as long as the action is not invidiously applied to a group of people based on a preexisting protected status and as long as there is the slightest, most ephemeral (dare one say 'laughable') hint that the activities regulated affect 'interstate commerce' in even a ridiculously indirect form.</p>

<p>Only in the linguistic sense.  Sure, if enough people grew their own whatever, then it could affect interstate commerce.  Where it falls down, in my opinion, is where that is the invitation for the government to fix it.  </p>
<p>If enough people grew their own tomatoes at home, we'd have a lot of really awesome fucking tomatoes.  Tomato farmers would likely have to adapt and grow some different crop of some sort.  And... so what?  Where's the problem?  Why do owe tomato farmers so much that we can't compete with them in our own back yards?  </p>
<p>Here's a liberty cheat sheet: If the outcome of a legal case depends on whether or not I am a member of a lobbying organization, then it's very, very likely that the case was decided unjustly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Neither of those could plausibly be considered commercial activities - it's an extra step from &quot;commercial activities can affect interstate commerce&quot; to &quot;non-commercial activities can tangentially affect commerce, which can in turn affect interstate commerce.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a false historical narrative. You wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later, with Wickard v. Filburn along with other cases, the Supreme Court effectively wrote the &quot;interstate&quot; part of the clause out, arguing instead that Congress could regulate activity <strong>which merely affected interstate commerce.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in 1824, in <em>Gibbons  v. Ogden,</em> Justice John Marshall wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not intended to say that [the words &quot;among the several states&quot;] comprehend that commerce which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State, <strong>and</strong> which does not extend to <strong>or affect</strong> other States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clarify and break that down into bite sized chunks, Justice Marshall said that commerce which is:</p>
<p>1) <em>completely</em> internal to one state, <strong>and</strong></p>
<p>2) does not <strong>affect</strong> other states </p>
<p>falls outside the scope of the Commerce Clause. </p>
<p>From the very first Commerce Clause case, the Supreme Court has stated that Congress may permissibly regulate activities which merely &quot;affect&quot; interstate commerce.  </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the right's historical narrative: that we followed a &quot;strictly construed&quot; Constitution from the inception of the republic until the New Deal, approaches the exact opposite of historical reality. The New Deal was in reality a <em>return</em> to 19th century courts' deference to legislative will in assessing the scope of constitutional powers. </p>
<p>This return reversed a roughly 40 year period called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_era#cite_note-law.cornell.edu-1" target="_blank">Lochner era</a> in which extreme activists on the Supreme Court concentrated the power of constitutional interpretation almost entirely into their own hands to advance their preferred ideological agenda over a constitutional one (The opening sentence of the linked Wikipedia article states that in the Lochner era, the Supreme Court struck down state legislation seeking to regulate economic matters. To be clear, it struck down similar federal legislation too). </p>
<p>Let's return to Justice Marshall's 1824 opinion in <em>Gibbons v. Ogden</em> for evidence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This instrument contains an enumeration of powers expressly granted by the people to their government. It has been said that these powers ought to be construed strictly. But why ought they to be so construed? Is there one sentence in the Constitution which gives countenance to this rule? In the last of the enumerated powers, that which grants expressly the means for carrying all others into execution, Congress is authorized &quot;to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper&quot; for the purpose. But this limitation on the means which may be used is not extended to the powers which are conferred, nor is there one sentence in the Constitution which has been pointed out by the gentlemen of the bar or which we have been able to discern that prescribes this rule. <strong>We do not, therefore, think ourselves justified in adopting it</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Supreme Court rejected the idea from the very first case in which it directly confronted the right's notion of &quot;strict constructionism.&quot; </p>
<p>Now it is true that two preeminent constitutional framers, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, advocated some form of strict constructionism. But other framers advocated a different view, preferring a federal government active in regulating national economic matters. No less august a personage than George Washington himself was known to prefer Alexander Hamilton's Federalist Party approach to national economic matters. He even let Alexander Hamilton submit to Congress in 1792 his <em>Report on Manufactures,</em> which asked Congress to spend money to subsidize various parts of the economy. Wrote Hamilton of the spending clause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A question has been made concerning the constitutional right of the Government of the United States to apply this species of encouragement; but there is certainty no good foundation for such a question. The National Legislature has express authority “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence (1012) and general welfare&quot;[.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hamilton expounds a little on the meaning of &quot;general welfare,&quot; and then concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, therefore, of necessity, <strong>left to the discretion of the National Legislature</strong> to pronounce upon the objects which concern the general welfare, and for which, under that description, an appropriation of money is requisite and proper. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, Jefferson and Madison advocated one view of the Spending Power. But Washington and Hamilton advocated a different view. How should we as modern Americans resolve this difference? </p>
<p>Certainly relevant to that question must be that as presidents, both Jefferson and Madison set their strict constructionist views aside the moment they got in the way of advancing the national interest. Jefferson most notably when he authorized the Louisiana Purchase, even though the constitutional text speaks nowhere of a power to purchase land, and Madison most famously when he chartered a national bank even though the constitutional text speaks nowhere of a power to charter a bank.</p>
<p>So there is no constitutional tradition of strict constructionism, none, prior to the Lochner era, which started in roughly 1890, and lasted until only the New Deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same sort of goes for amendments and states. The Bill of Rights applied to the federal government. It wasn't until the 14th amendment that the Supreme Court started ruling that states had to follow along with the Bill of Rights in the federal constitution (took about a court case for each amendment though). To be fair, though, many states already had their own type of bill of rights that guaranteed the same (and sometimes more) rights than the federal Bill of Rights.</p></div>		</li>

All the states are bound by all of the Constitution, so regardless of whether a state ratifies an amendment, if the requisite 3/4 of states ratify it, the amendment is binding in the entire United States.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 14th Amendment does not incorporate the 13th Amendment the way it does with [most of] the substantive rights in the Bill of Rights - because it doesn't need to. The 13th Amendment simply states that  &quot;slavery . . . shall [not] exist within the United States&quot;. Once it was ratified by 3/4 of the states, it was binding on every state. Unlike the rights of the 1st Amendment (which specifically says, &quot;Congress shall make no law . . .&quot;) and the rest of the Bill of Rights (which are understood, in isolation, to only apply to the federal government as well), the 13th Amendment does not require the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause to be enforced against the states. By its very language, it already has legal effect against the state governments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: The latest amendment to be incoporated against the states has been the 2nd amendment.</p>
<p>Second fun fact:</p>
<p>The 8th amendment is only partially incorporated against the states. The 8th amendment is composed of three clauses:</p>
<p>-Protection against Excessive bails</p>
<p>Has technically been incorporated against the states, the court case that decided it is apparently vague. Another case,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago" target="_blank">McDonald vs Chicago</a> which incorporated the 2nd amendment against the states, cited the excessive bail clause as one of those clauses incorporated.</p>
<p>-Protection against Excessive fines</p>
<p>Has <em>not</em> been incorporated against the states.</p>
<p>-Protection against Cruel and unusual punishments.</p>
<p>Has been incorporated against the states.</p>
<p>The more you know!</p>
<p>Incorporation is one of the oddest things around, the US Constitution sets it as &quot;the supreme law of the land&quot; but hey, here we are with incorporation which has to explicitly say which parts of the US Constitution the States must not violate.</p></div>		</li>
