			<div class="markdown"><p>Do syllabaries activate the same part of the brain as alphabets? Written Japanese uses both logograms and a syllabary. (The syllabary inflects the logograms but can also be used on its own.) One would think, then, that there would be double the occurrence of dyslexia there, if reading interacts with two separate parts of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese is kind of interesting because one hand it has (what I'm assuming is) an alphabetic language (katakana) but also (what I'm assuming is) a logographic language (kanji). Does this mean that solely in Japanese, someone who is dyslexic when it comes to katakana could still be able to normally process kanji?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese has two &quot;alphabetic&quot; (more accurately moriac) syllabaries called hiragana and katakana. Be careful: they are NOT languages, they are syllabaries. They are equivalent in the same way that lowercase and upper case letters are in most cases. That is, each hiragana has an equivalent katakana pronounced the same way. The kanji then are morphosyllabic (they represent meaning and sound simultaneously). Kanji can be used to only represent meaning or only sound, but for simplicity's sake we can ignore that now.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that kanji reading, especially when the readings are not regular, can be influenced by dyslexia. But the type of dyslexia we are familiar with in English seems to have a greater effect on hiragana and katakana. One problem is that, as studies on this topic always complain, there has not been as much research on dsylexia in Asia as in other western countries. However, I can tell you personally I have seen elementary school students who have kanji reading difficulties. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese linguist here. Japanese kanji are not logographic, they are morphosyllabic. There is a lot of oversimplification of how they work in common literature, which is perhaps necessary, but calling them logographs is patently incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused. When I read the comment I thought u/Saint_JRPG was speaking of the various modifier symbols (ten-tens?) in Japanese hirigana which denote a change of sound (from'ha' to 'ba', or 'ka' to 'ga'), and asking about whether hirigana counted as a logographic or morphosyllabic in this instance. I don't think they meant kanji--which is clearly morphosyllabic--but rather hirigana. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm completely wrong and incredibly high, but, I thought that was the original question. </p></div>		</li>

<p>symbol languages, in linguistic terms, is called a logographic system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure who u/Saint_JRPG is, and maybe you replied to the wrong person? But spears6323 claimed &quot;symbol&quot; writing systems were logographic.</p>
<p>Kana are moraic syllabaries, they are neither logographic or morphosyllabic. </p>
<p>As for the ten-ten marks (that is a casual term for making the marks), the mark in がだば etc. is called dakuten (or dakuonpu), while the circle in ぱぴぷぺぽ is called handakuten (or handakuonpu). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what a logographic writing systems are in linguistic jargon, and I have seen kanji listed as logographs, but this is an outdated and overly broad, if not outright incorrect, description. As a researcher who specializes in Japanese writing, I can assure you that the definition of a logogram does not accurately describe how kanji represent language.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it would, but maybe not for the reasons he was describing. Language has really weird and fascinating fundamental impacts on the way we view the world. The other day I saw a study about how people who speak languages that don't distinguish between present and future tense are much more likely to support movements with results that will only provide benefits further down the line, like environmental protection.</p></div>		</li>
