			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, due to the enzymes which are added nowadays. They actually make washing at lower temperatures more effective in some cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>This is the correct answer. Using the newest detergents, we can wash our clothes in cold water and save a bundle on energy used for heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can be debated.  There are heat-loss reduction systems that can reclaim a lot of that energy.</p>
<p>It's like running an energy efficient fridge in the north.  You're just <em>moving</em> that energy consumption from the appliance to the furnace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many laundry detergents today also rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_brightener" target="_blank"> optical brighteners</a> to make whites look more white under indoor lighting.  It's less effective now as LED lighting becomes more popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago when I was studying chemistry one of our exercises was to make an optical brightener. At the end of the day they scanned us with a black light to see where we'd managed to get it that we shouldn't have. The lab and all of use lit up like Christmas trees, it was a very sobering lesson in handling chemicals safely. </p>
<p>I should point of that even the tiniest speck of optical brightener will glow strongly under UV. It's easy to spill a drop on your glove and then spread it all over the place. For the vast majority of chemicals this isn't a problem but there are a few that it would be and for those you use additional precautions like doing the work in a glove box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same reason why white shirts glow under UV. The optical brighteners in the washing detergent remain in the clothing and are highly excited by the UV making them appear to glow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close; white LEDs use a blue LED usually around 470nm, then have phosphor that gets excited and emits a broad peak in the upper visible range. The color temperature is determined by how much phosphor is present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the concentration. If the solution has a pH of 12 - meaning it's very basic - it will saponify triglycerides, including many common animal fats and plant oils, by splitting an ester bond. </p>
<p>This is more-or-less equivalent to a 1% solution of TSP. At that concentration, it's alkali enough to basically become a chemical stand-in for the lye that is incorporated into most commercial soaps and detergents.</p></div>		</li>
