			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to also mention that while that's how the nose of the board rises, the tail rises because you are stopping the rise of the board using your front foot and pivoting it around its center of gravity to become horizontal again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes an insane amount of factors and a healthy dose of luck for most of the pros to land some of their best tricks.You see a trick as one thing - but these guys see it as dozens of tiny steps packed into 3 seconds, almost like a math problem. It can take weeks for a professional to land some of the best tricks in their part. You need to approach the obstacle at the perfect speed and angle, with the perfect body and foot positioning, you need to have the perfect pop force (back foot) and flick force (front foot), the perfect weight distribution while on the object (a handrail for example). You need to commit and it's 99 percent muscle memory with 1 percent luck. This recent video part with <a href="http://theberrics.com/push-luan-oliveira-episode-1/" target="_blank">luan de olivera, in my opinion the greatest street skater of our generation</a> he talks about dreaming a trick and he can normally land it. It's a total visualization process .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's part of the ollie anyway, but its only half the story, because it is definitely possible to bring the tail up higher than the center of gravity of the board. Just watch any skate video and you can see an ollie that is higher than that. For instance if you just kick the tail down without even having the front foot on the board and it'll pop into the air. When you pop the board right, it sort of works like the game &quot;Tiddlywinks&quot; if you know that. </p></div>		</li>
