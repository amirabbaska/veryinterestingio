			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the theory of prenatal testosterone exposure and autism, that autism may be an extreme male cognitive phenotype related to androgen exposure e.g.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Also, the observed gender ratio is 2 to 5 males to 1 female in studies that that try to identify hidden difficult to diagnose cases in girls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In brief, the 4–5:1 male bias may be partly due to the underrecognition of females (particularly higher-functioning), ascertainment bias, and issues of diagnostic instruments. Nevertheless, even studies that better account for these issues still show a 2–5:1 male predominance, which has important etiological and developmental implications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the observed gender ratio is real, and is not due to diagnostic bias.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is really interesting. I had not come accross this research before this. Thank you for posting. I am not overly surprised that there was other epigenetic factors involved but it is interesting to read the research about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might find this paper interesting... </p>
<p>Baron-Cohen, S., et al., 2015. Elevated fetal steroidogenic activity in autism. Molecular psychiatry, 20(3), pp.369-376.</p>
<p>Baron-Cohen and colleagues recently examined the hormone levels in preserved amniotic fluid relating to 17000 Dutch children and found support for their theory. It was published in a Nature journal so that might indicate the importance or robustness of the findings.</p>
<p>Simon Barron-Cohen's theory is not as popular in the US, perhaps because of cultural reasons. It involves wider implications on nature v's nurture, gender and society, which is controversial in the US more so than the UK e.g. you would not see articles like this as often in the US that implies autistic people gravitate towards computers... </p>

<p>There's currently a lot of controversy over the lack of women in computer science, it would be unpopular to suggest that this disparity has anything to to with biology, hormones and prenatal development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the EMB hypothesis is fairly controversial, even though someone as respected as Baron-Cohen espouses it (although I'm not sure if he still does). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, an interesting side-note is that transmen (Female-to-Male transpeople) tend to have a higher chance of being on the Autism spectrum, suggesting that Karyotype may not be the only cause. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely research that seems to suggest that women suffer fewer symptoms partly because of the sexual difference in socialization skills saying that women with ASD do show a decrease in skills compared to other women but end up roughly equivalent to similar ages boys while as boys with ASD end up less able than women or men of their age group. I ended up not citing that article because it didnt have information I needed unfortunately enough. I am sure a google scholar search on the topic will be fruitful though.</p></div>		</li>
