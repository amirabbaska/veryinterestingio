<p>It had UN backing, but if you're not American, Korean, or Chinese, then your county probably didn't contribute much to the war effort.</p>

<p>There were 13 nations besides the US that were involved in the UN effort: UK, Canada, Turkey, Australia, Ethiopia, Philippines, New Zealand, Thailand, Greece, France, Colombia, Belgium, South Africa, Netherlands, Luxembourg. For many of those, it was their first interaction with South Korea, and formed the basis of close ties that the Koreans never forgot. The problem was that South Korea wasn't really important until the late 90s/early 00s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent answer. I'd add that technically the war isn't over, but the military action has ceased since the armistice agreement in 1953. For the Americans, there's still a sizable presence on the peninsula, including helping maintaining the DMZ.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in my opinion it is still a hot war. I was stationed on the DMZ in the 80's and we were in firefights at least weekly with DPRK forces.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole Soviet block knew about it, also France was there too. But yes it is called the Forgotten War mainly by America since till that, they had the attitude that &quot;They haven't lost a single war&quot; there was a huge backlash as well in the US, lots of anti-war movements. The USA was intrested in stoping the communism yes, but they already had a deal with Stalin that South and North Korea remain separated, and they would have to deal with China if they wanted to continue the war... which would lead to nuclear warfare..
