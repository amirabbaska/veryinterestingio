<p>The way you melt sugar for candy making is you add some water (it does not have to be enough to dissolve, although that's easier) and then heat it. The water boils off and you're left with melted sugar that is definitely not brown (although is usually a little yellow). If you try to melt sugar straight up, it will caramelize.</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: There are several ways to do it without burning, you can use water for example to even out the temperature and then slowly evaporate the water to get melted sugar. Or melt it slowly at a lower temperature.</p></div>		</li>
