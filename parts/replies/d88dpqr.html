			<div class="markdown"><p>tldr: Because moonlets don't spontaneously explode when they reach a certain size.</p>
<p>This arrangement would require a single ginormous body in the center, and several large bodies in the &quot;planets&quot;. But the problem is, at that scale, when things accrete to a particular mass, they aren't inert(ish) clumps of rock; they're stars whose lifetimes get shorter if they have more mass (because fusion happens faster). So, if mass starts to accrete into a supermassive star, it goes kablooie - instead of continuing to get bigger, it scatters itself.</p>
<p>And it can't be &quot;clumps&quot; of stars either, because planetary accretion depends on collision. If two planetesimals cross paths, they collide and form a larger one; if two globular clusters cross paths, they'll pass right through each other.</p>
<p>Combining these two problems reveals a third problem. The only celestial bodies that can have mass above a certain amount aren't stars, but black holes. And black holes have a much smaller likelihood to collide than planetesimals or even stars. A black hole's event horizon is MUCH smaller relative to its mass than the surface of a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent points!  I have follow-on questions, if you'll be so kind.  When a star &quot;goes kablooie&quot;, what percentage of its mass is expelled and how much collapses into a high density neutron star or black hole?  If a significant percentage remains behind, wouldn't these eventually (really really long time frame) coalesce in a mode similar to planets and rings?  Does planetary accretion depend on collision because of inelasticity of those collisions? Is there a neutron star equivalent of electrostatic charge that might cause them to clump like dust motes?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Whatever remains is likely a smallish black hole, where you run into the third-paragraph problem. It might be a neutron star, which has similar issues. Even if it's not one of those, it'll invariably be smaller than the original star, so it represents a step backward for planetary accretion - if it accrues more mass, it'll just kablooie again.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Think of it this way: If you approach a celestial body and don't collide with it (or its atmosphere, if it has one), you pass right by it, and lose no relative velocity. If you collide, some of your kinetic energy is transferred to the body and vice versa, so you both (sometimes) reach velocities that are closer to each other.</p>

<p>Seems unlikely that a force like this could exist in a strong enough way to overcome the natural momentum something would have when it's flying in near to the neutron star. Though TBF, this question is getting above my pay grade (which is nothing) ;)</p></div>		</li>
