			<div class="markdown"><p>No</p>
<p>This is not possible quantum mechanically because of Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties of position and momentum must be larger than a positve constant. If an atom completely froze, then the uncertainty in velocity would be zero (because you know that it is not moving) and so Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle would not be satisfied.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you assume that the particles are moving, then they are not classically &quot;frozen&quot;. </p>
<p>Edit: As pointed out by /u/Sparkybear, I should answer your question with</p>
<p>Yes, it is impossible</p>
<p>Edit2: As pointed out by /u/onacloverifalive, this answer is only valid if our Quantum theory naturally extends to zero kelvin. If it doesn't, this answer does not answer your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it priori to assume Heisenberg's principle would be true at absolute zero?  Yes to test it you would have to add energy and to take it out of that state, so since the premise may be untestable, why to we assume the typical results of that test apply? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. A Fermi gas is a gas entirely composed of fermions. It will become degenerate at low temperatures. </p>
<p>It's a venn diagram situation as degenerate matter isn't necessarily exclusively fermions (it can contain other matter too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Degenerate matter&quot; can refer to degenerate Fermi gases. For example white dwarves, neutron stars, and conduction electrons in metals at &quot;low temperature&quot; (low compared to the degeneracy temperature, so still pretty high).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stumbled in here on a random. I have a very rudimentary knowledge at best of thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and what have you, as none of that really made it into my Poli Sci / Geography degree. Yet, from your explanations and the links provided, I think I got the very basics of what you were getting at, and because of that, I learned something today. Thanks for being technical enough to paint the whole picture intelligently yet simple enough for a layman to grasp.</p></div>		</li>
