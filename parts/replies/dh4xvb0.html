			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a myth that is still propagating! Microwaves work by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_heating" target="_blank">dielectric heating</a>. Any molecule with a dipole moment will rotate/vibrate in the presence of a strong, oscillating electric field (which microwaves are caused by).   Water has no monopoly on microwaves! Hope this clears some things up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. The outside of soup got really hot absorbing energy as post stated. Center stayed cold because outside can absorb lots of energy first. Center has more mass, so overall soup is cold, but outside conducted enough heat to bowl.</p></div>		</li>
