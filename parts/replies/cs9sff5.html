			<div class="markdown"><p>The crowds usually aren't that large, either.  They have everybody corralled into a small triangular area directly in front of the camera to give the appearance of a crowd several rows deep, when in actuality there might not even be enough people to line the perimeter of the filming area. Once on an early morning stroll I stopped to spectate the NBC crowd and was harassed by NBC security because I <em>didn't</em> want to be in the filming area. Despite an abundance of empty sidewalk, I was told that if I wanted to watch I had to squeeze into this barely 150 sq ft area with 30 other people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed- this is the same tactic politicians use to make their crowd of dozens seem like hundreds in a tight shot ( with people in the background that look like they're on a choir platform.</p>
<p>It's probably an agreement with the city as well, to keep the sidewalk mostly clear for people going to work or for emergency purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were intimidating enough that I wasn't going to get into an ego battle with them at 6am, but I suppose if I wanted to be <em>that guy</em> I could have gone full-Libertarian and started citing the constitution or some shit. I walked across the street and got an egg mcmuffin instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these people plan on doing this, so they'll probably let their friends know ahead of time &quot;hey we're going to NY and we're gonna go to GMA on Thursday, look for us!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
