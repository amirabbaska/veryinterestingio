			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this might answer the question that has been haunting me for such a long time: why does the statistical and thermal physic 'feels' so different from other areas of physics. Their geometrical notions are not as explicit as those in other areas to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot if geometric notions in thermal physics as well. For example to get a thermal QFT system you compactify time on a circle.</p>
<p>The above answer is kinda nonsensical though. You might just as well claim that algebra, arithmetic, or calculus are fundamental for physics. You're confusing the model with the thing itself.</p></div>		</li>
