<p>I read this as arachnid hemorrhoids. What a way to die, with spiders coming out of your ass. But also somehow biblical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers. 19 He said to his father, “My head! My head!”</p>
<p>His father told a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 20 After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died. 21 She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out. ...
When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch. 33 He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord. 34 Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out on him, the boy’s body grew warm. 35 Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out on him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I hadn't looked it up recently, and totally forgot about Elisha reviving him. Maybe the retrospectoscope is picking the wrong diagnosis with Sub Arachnoid, or maybe he was like the Galvani frog experiment and twitched for a while. Or there was a deity involved, but that feels like cheating.</p></div>		</li>
