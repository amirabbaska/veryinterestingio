<p><a href="https://youtu.be/QtP_bh2lMXc?t=24" target="_blank">Without Spin.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/QtP_bh2lMXc?t=57" target="_blank">With Spin.</a></p>
<p>Edit: Warning, redditors with severe vertigo need not watch.</p>
<p>TL;DW: Spinning ball travels much further horizontally when dropped with spin compared to a ball dropped without it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same principle as a baseball. If you can manage to throw a baseball without it spinning at all (knuckle ball), it will wobble around in random directions which makes it very hard to predict. Most baseball pitches involve a specific spin which affects which direction the ball will curve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no one knows where a knuckleball is going to end up. It's why knuckleballers have a lot of strikeouts and a lot of home runs: the hitter is just as likely to guess wrong as guess right and teeing off on a 55 mile per hour pitch is a lot of fun for a batter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it bears clarification or highlighting that this has to do with an object moving through air (or any fluid).</p>
<p>You cannot bend a shot in a vacuum, which is why space sports are not very popular.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, in the vein of ELI5, the Magnus effect has been explained as the surface of the spinning object 'grabbing' the air (or fluid) to influence its motion in the direction of the spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it only works in crosswinds, since it produces a force perpendicular to the fluid. So these kinds of boats still have normal engines, but the cylinders are used to save fuel. </p></div>		</li>
