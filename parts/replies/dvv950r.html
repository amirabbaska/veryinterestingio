			<div class="markdown"><p>Think it's due to the bone that gums grow on. Gum receding also means part of the bones the gums sit on recedes as well, that's how I understand it anyway.</p>
<p>It sucks. You can replace a tooth, but if you get bad gum disease, there's really no fix. You can't replace a tooth if there's no foundation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, to a certain extent. Depending on the type of periodontal disease, a good scaling and root planing + excellent oral hygiene can indeed allow for gingival tissue to grow back. If that fails, you might need to look into a gingival graft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They donâ€™t grow back on their own, but there are gum grafting procedures that can aid with this. Reestablishing soft tissue support is relatively simple, although reestablishing alveolar bony support can only be achieved to a degree of a few millimeters.</p>
<p>Gum recession CAN be treated in all but the most severe circumstances.</p></div>		</li>
