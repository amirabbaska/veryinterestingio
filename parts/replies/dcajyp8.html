			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like Deadwood is the one HBO show I missed out on (Oz too, but I was in Jr. High then and HBO was a luxury not many people had). Where does it fall within the spectrum of good HBO dramas? </p>
<p>edit: Over a dozen replies saying it a great show. No need to comment more, I'll put it on my binge list. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deadwood was fantastic. The first two seasons especially were just excellent, classic western tales in their own right. Al Swearingen is one of the most complex characters in HBO history. Amazing actor. </p>
<p>Having said all of that, I don't think Deadwood had the legs to carry on for several more seasons. It appeared to become &quot;self-aware&quot; by season 3, as many shows tend to do. I started to lose interest in it and might not have kept up with it after that. </p>
<p>I am a serial show-dropper though. I lose interest quite easily.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I once rewatched it for just Al Swearengen moments. He has some of funniest, most insulting, and beautiful lines. Amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw, man. I loved Carnivale and never understood why it was cancelled. It ended back in 2005 and I think shortly after that was when it seemed like everyone was constantly buying DVD TV series... just missed it by a couple years!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carnivale is one of my favorite TV shows, and I always feel like no one else has seen it. I think it was just a little early for how expensive and different it was. There weren't as many big budget, high concept tv shows at the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not at all. carnivale was canceled like 2 years before the writers strike even happened. </p>
<p>carnivale was just an expensive (period pieces tend to be) show that was a really slow burn. hard to gauge interest in a show that requires you to really catch every episode or be entirely lost. </p>
<p>viewership dropped in the second season, which was complicated by season two's weird pacing because they reduced it from a 16 episode run to 12 and it was clear from early on that the ratings just weren't enough for a 3 mill an episode show. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BBC pulling out is why Rome got cancelled? IIRC They only financed like 15-20% of the $100 million budget. That's just depressing if it's true. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a two-year contract and after that, the BBC couldn't commit to financing more due to the cost. However it's right that they provided much less than HBO.</p></div>		</li>
