			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, you can accelerate the initial offgassing to reduce emissions in the car by &quot;baking your car&quot; with the windows open and maybe a fan when you first get it.  Your car will continue to offgas but it's much less noticeable.  It has become a huge problem for automakers in china where people are much more sensitive to the smells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The offgass smell is at the very least not favored in China like it is in America.   There may be something genetic that makes it stand out more but I can't say for sure.  It is definitely a major issue though.</p>
