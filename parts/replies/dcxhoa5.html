			<div class="markdown"><p>A college course I took called organisational behaviour covered this. Using a questionaire,  the class was split into 3 groups.  Most people could identify primarily as a starter, a mover, or a finisher. </p>
<p>Starters would do just that. Start. Unlikely to finish, or move the project along they were great at starting a project.</p>
<p>Movers wouldn't start a project. Or finish it off, but we're great at inproving a project, advancing it significantly </p>
<p>Finishers didn't do to much starting, and might not do to much of the middle work, but shined at 'putting the finishing touches' on a project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 80/20 hits closest for me.  The projects that I do for work are almost all like this.</p>
<p>Getting the system up and running with basic features?  Not a problem.  That took no time.  Adding in a few features and making it work reasonably well for most users?  Great, it took a little more time, but still not that much.  Now we need to figure out the bugs and throw in a few minor-sounding requests...fuck this kill me now.</p></div>		</li>
