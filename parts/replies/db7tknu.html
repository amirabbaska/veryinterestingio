			<div class="markdown"><p>The US tried it out as rocket fuel and spilt 2,000 litres. It set fire to the concrete pad and a metre of gravel underneath the pad. The fire was impossible to extinguish. You can't deprive it of oxygen because it's not burning with oxygen. If you spray water on it you get an explosion and a wonderful hot fog of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid that will chew through anything organic (such as us) real quick. A chemist when once asked the appropriate equipment for dealing with a chlorine trifluoride spill responded &quot;A good pair of running shoes&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can get your hands on the book <em>Ignition</em> by John Drury Clark, it's a good read, if often hair-raising.  This is a guy who made rocket fuel for the early space program, which is something you need to be pretty fearless to do.  He's source of the &quot;good pair of running shoes&quot; comment about ClF3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water — with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals — steel, copper, aluminum, etc. — because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: Chlorine Trifluoride burns without Oxygen so one can't extinguish it via foam or CO2. Also adding water just makes it worse. So the best solution is simply to let it burn out. It's also extremely toxic when burning.</p>
<p>Bonus fun fact: The Nazis experimented with using Chlorine Trifluoride for artillery shells. However they never used them as it was to dangerous to transport the shells to where they had to be used.</p>
<p>I learnt these from the &quot;Today I Found Out&quot; YouTube channel. Worth checking out. </p></div>		</li>
