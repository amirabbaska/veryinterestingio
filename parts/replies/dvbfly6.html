			<div class="markdown"><p>people only posted links and articles, no one actually gave an explanation in the thread. So for people like me who can't be arsed to go to external links I made a short little explanation to the best of my memory from when something like this last was posted. I think 'too long didn't read' fits this scenario pretty good since the external links are too long if you're only scrolling through looking for a quick answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your nice concise answer got upvoted, though, it floated to the top for many people, since the default comment sort view is by &quot;best&quot;. For me, the TL;DR was really out of place because there were no answers above it! Thus, it is best used as a wrap-up summary to a long comment. </p></div>		</li>
