<p>this wouldn't be convenient for a game controller. You also care about missed inputs, having a two way connection instead of a one way connection like a TV remote means you need constant talk between the game controller and system. This means quite literally in-between all of your inputs on your game controller the system and controller are both communicating with &quot;hey I'm here &quot; and &quot; do you still see me signals&quot; on top of other things.</p>
