<p>&quot;Isotopes&quot; is also used as general name for &quot;some specific number of protons and neutrons&quot;, as in &quot;we have produced 3000 different isotopes so far&quot;. If you want to fix the number of protons, you have to say &quot;isotopes of helium&quot; or make it clear from the context that you only consider a single element.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a common shorthand, but it's really an abuse of terminology. The proper term in that case would be &quot;nuclides&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
