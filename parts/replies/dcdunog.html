			<div class="markdown"><p>A fantastic exercise for this, and it's something very few school curriculums actually do, is to assign sides to argue for or against a particular issue when writing essays/papers. Far too often when essay topics are assigned students will choose one they know a lot about or have a certain attachment to. The result is they don't look past self-confirming information and rarely if ever get to information that legitimately challenges their beliefs. And if they do, they generally don't care because it doesn't help them write their essay.</p>
<p>And that's the core issue. Most kids coming out of school don't know how to properly research topics and construct good arguments. It requires knowledge of your opposition and how you would respond to criticisms. The most fruitful exercises in this regard are to be forced to defend a position you disagree with. It makes you seek constructive information rather than just the same negative information you would normally be reading or hearing if you were to defend your own beliefs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was going through school I always took the view point I disagree'd with to argue in a paper.  I thought it was more fun that way.  It also sometimes carries over into real life and all of a sudden I'm arguing for something stupid I don't believe in.  Whoops.  </p></div>		</li>
