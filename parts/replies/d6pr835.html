<p>Friction welding is just hot enough to melt the ends of the two tubes so that they join, but joining tubes is its only use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this, you can use friction welding to weld many more shapes than tubes or cylinders. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction_stir_welding" target="_blank">Friction Stir Welding</a> a tool will rotate and ride between the two pieces you're trying to join. The friction from the tool rotating softens the metal (it does not melt), then mixes the metal from the two pieces together, and with pressure it welds them together. It's great because it doesn't produce the fumes or splatter, you don't have issues with weld pools, and the bit is the only consumable (it lasts a long time). The downsides are that it is slow, it requires pressure to form the weld so you need a lot of clamps, and there is an exit hole on the final material from the bit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not know of that technique.  Cool!</p>
<p>Another one, just to continue riffing on this topic:  two pieces of different metal sheets that cannot be welded together or alloyed with each other can be joined into a new material by laying the two sheets on top of each other in a hole in the ground and exploding something powerful on top of them.  The pressure fuses the sheets together.  Saw this in an abstract from the National Lab in Albuquerque, NM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I mentioned energy flow through the crystalline structure of the metal.  Energy flow (and the associated stress risers caused by discontinuities) is the reason we grind our welds flat on repairs or butt welds, or concave in the case of fillet welds joining two pieces at an angle to each other.  A jagged or abrupt change of cross section acts as a collector for the energy flowing through a piece.  The energy concentrates and your project breaks immediately next to the weld.  Very predictable failure.</p></div>		</li>
