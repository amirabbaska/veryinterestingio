			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, secondarily/similarly... if like Costco or Trader Joe's etc. simply have some distiller produce and blend custom products under the Kirkland brand. That way there is no real overhead for having to build ones own still, getting permits etc.. simply have the large producer make the economies of scale work for both parties. Will a producer want to produce bottle and sell 110K barrels worth of blended whiskey to costco and lose a bit on the in store sales.. or not sell that massive volume and still lose out...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, in fact in Oregon here, there are a few different &quot; whiskey&quot; distilleries but only two in fact are from &quot; Grain to Bottle&quot; one popular one called burnside bourbon in fact just buy vats from major distilleries and sells it as &quot;Portland&quot; and everyone around here thinks they are buying &quot;local&quot; Nope you are buying over price shit whiskey from who know where for 7 times its worth. After my boss wanted to get into this market I got to learn a lot more about it and damn if it isn't shady as shit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually there is one good whiskey made out at the coast by a very, very small distiller.</p></div>		</li>

Guh, I hate Burnside Brewing. We have so many good distilleries, but none for Bourbon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sort of. They would use the same equipment, and could use the same ingredients, but not typically identical. Gin can be thought of as a type of infused vodka (juniper berry), actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Unaged whiskey is white dog or moonshine (they're synonyms). It tastes nothing like gin. Gin is flavored with or distilled from botanicals (most notably juniper berries); whiskey is simply distilled grains.</p>
<p>Edit: They are both made through distillation though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically you can make vodka out of anything.</p>
<p>Gin is basically juniper flavoured vodka</p>
<p>Whisky can't be made out of anything, only cereals, but unaged whisky is yeah basically a type of vodka. Whisky then becomes whisky and gets its taste from ageing in wood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another thing not mentioned is small barrel aging. its not the most efficient way of doing it, but if you age in a smaller barrel, it takes less time to get the flavors out of the wood due to an increase in the surface area to volume ratios. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A nearby distillery also mentioned some research going into the construction of a honeycomb lattice inside the barrel which would provide additional surface area for the whiskey. </p></div>		</li>
