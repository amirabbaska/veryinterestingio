			<div class="markdown"><p>At 0K, atoms have the minimum amount of kinetic energy. If the potential energy of a flat sheet of atoms looked like an egg carton - a lattice or grid of wells - then imagine each atom is wobbling back and forth inside the well. However, because of &quot;quantum&quot;, the lowest possible energy state of each well, or simplified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator" target="_blank">quantum harmonic oscillator</a>, still requires that each atom is wobbling. </p>
<p>The most intuitive reason is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. If every atom were perfectly still, you'd know both its position and momentum exactly, which isn't possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Near the energy minimum, everything acts like a harmonic oscillator, analogous to a mass on a spring, since the potential energy looks parabolic near the minimum. The quantum harmonic oscillator has a nonzero energy ground state. Another way to look at it is through the uncertainty principle: if you know the potential energy is zero by knowing the exact position of a helium atom, then its kinetic energy is totally uncertain.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It is not, and never has been. Temperature is defined in classical thermodynamic terms by the relationship between changes in energy and entropy (dU/dS = 1/T) and in statistical thermodynamics it is effectively defined by the Boltzmann distribution.</p>
<p>Any system that has energy states, where the population of those states is Boltzmann-distributed, has a temperature. (and if not Boltzmann-distributed isn't in thermodynamic equilibrium yet) Those energy states may involve kinetic energy but there's nothing requiring that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but it is worth pointing out that temperature is often described as a measure of average kinetic energy in chemistry classes, and that it is a valid relationship for systems at equilibrium in the classical limit (i.e. if thermal energy is much greater than gaps between quantum energy levels, and the number of available states is large relative to the number of particles.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physics is similar in both scenarios. When pressure is increased, the atoms are pushed closer together so that the interaction energy between the particles increases. In the case of Helium, the atoms will have a weak Van der Waals force between each other. This energy can be approximately given as E = a/r‚Å∂, so by reducing r, E increases. When the interaction energy reaches a certain threshold, the molecules will become bound and condense into a lattice, forming a solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freezing in this instance is about getting a liquid to turn solid. Extra pressure is required to turn liquid Helium into a solid.</p>
<p>As with your example, water should turn to steam (a gas) as it is heated, but higher pressure keeps it as a liquid by increasing the boiling point.</p></div>		</li>
