			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the clothes they wear are usually very much western. There are some traditional clothes chinese will wear, typically during weddings or very special occasions, but mostly they'll wear western outfits. By the way, the Mao suit actually is copied from Lenin and Stalin, so not even that is Chinese. </p></div>		</li>
