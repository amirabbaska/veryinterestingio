			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a constant turnover ('fresh' Li being swapped for older Li-bearing carbonates), it's constantly being recharged with fresh water entering the system. The only way that components are leaving the system is through evaporation (water) and mining (minerals and brines). The economic components were consistently being built up over time until we arrived.  </p>
<p>If you wanted to estimate the amount of Li being added to this system over the span, of say, a year. You could very simply calculate it. I've pulled this number from the wiki page of Salar De Atacama ('Atacama salt flat'). The lithium concentration in the brines in the salt flat is 2,700 ppm (0.27% Li as a dissolved constituent). That concentration is much higher than the rivers and groundwater feeding the system. </p>
<p>You can calculate the total volume of water coming into the salt lake in a year using the discharge rate (the Salado river entering the salt flat has a discharge rate of 0.5m^3/second). So the total volume of water coming from that river in one year is the 15 770 000m^3 (I just multiplied the discharge rate by the number of seconds in a year). Now, assuming that the Li concentrations in the river and groundwatet is similar to seawater, you can calculate the amount of Li entering your system. I've pulled a value of 0.17  mg/litre of Li in seawater from Riley and Tongudai (1964). We've calculated that the total volume of water entering the system as 15 770 000m^3 or 15 770 000 000 litres. Multiply that by 0.17mg and you have 2 670 900 000 mg or 2670 kg of lithium entering the salt flats  from that one river over the course of one year. Now, repeat that process over thousands of years, depositing the lithium, concentrated in salts, and removing the diluting factor (water). You have an economic deposit of lithium.</p>
