			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you been tested for postural othrostatic hypertension? (Pots) or any other form of dysautonomia?</p>
<p>I get it from pretty everything you mentioned, even just stretching in bed and yawning can cause syncope or pre-syncope. Increasing salt and hydration helps me a little bit but not much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, POTS is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome - the two are related but not the same thing. POTS refers to an increase in heart rate that results from the drop in blood pressure.</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently it tends to be sustained, ie most people experience postural orthostatic hypotension from time to time due to the sudden change in BP, but not everyone's response is severe enough to be considered POTS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I know they are different. But much of his described symptoms are common in pots patients. </p>
<p>You don't have to have low bp to have pots. Just the sustained elevated heart rate. Its often caused by low bp but not always. My BP has actually improved slightly in the last year or so, yet my heart rate continues to elevate increasingly higher.  Low bp is required for a diganosis of orthostatic intolerance. But not for pots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've not had the tilt table test but my cardiologist has diagnosed me with dysautonomia, specifically OI. Even though my heart rate jumps from ~50 to ~100 within minutes of standing up, he says that since my heart rate is so low by default it doesn't push me into the treatable POTS territory (basically, can't do a beta blocker since my HR is so low normally).
I've had elements of this since I was 16ish (29 now), but it has gotten really bad in the last 2 years. It's completely changed my life and made it extremely difficult to get through regular days. I'm just trying to figure out what changed so I can undo it- working on yoga and de-stressing now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to give up all caffeine due to similar symptoms. It seems to have helped. It was like I suddenly became hypersensitive to coffee. </p></div>		</li>
