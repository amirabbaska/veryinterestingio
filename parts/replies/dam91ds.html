			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, signaling through cytokine and chemokine receptors triggers a cascade of events within the cell: recruitment of adaptor proteins to the intracellular domain of the receptor or plasma membrane, post-translational modifications of proteins (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, etc.), and eventually the activation/modification of a cytosolic transcription factor or factors that then translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of immune genes that enable the cell to mount an appropriate response. </p>
<p>If you want to get specific, we'd have to clarify what particular lymphocyte class we're talking about. For T cells, activation by a professional antigen-presenting cell (APC) by presentation of antigenic peptide in conjunction with an appropriate MHC molecule, as well as costimulatory ligands that stimulate receptors other than the T cell receptor, is more important than cytokine or chemokine signaling in mounting a response; chemokines can be thought of as communicating information about where a threat is and cytokines can be thought of as additional information that tunes the specificity of the response, mainly by dictating the differentiation program of a naive T cell. </p>
<p>If the threat is a worm, naive CD4+ T cells presented with helminth-derived antigen (that their T cell receptor can recognize) in conjunction with MHC II molecules and the costimulatory ligand B7 will initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the translocation of the transcription factors GATA-3 and STAT6 into the nucleus, where they transcribe, among other things, genes encoding the cytokines IL-13, IL-4, and IL-5, which orchestrate the responses of other immune players that can fight worms (like eosinophils). IL-13 promotes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_class_switching" target="_blank">class-switching</a> in B cells so that they make IgE antibodies, activates basophils, and promotes epithelial cell turnover in the intestine (shedding epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces so that helminths that are attached to them are expelled). It also promotes mucin secretion by goblet cells -- a strategy sometimes referred to as &quot;weep and sweep&quot;. IL-4 promotes class-switching as well but also blocks IFN-γ receptors. Altogether, this is called a Th2 biased response (IFN-γ promotes a Th1 response, which is ineffective against worms but excellent for killing intracellular bacteria and protozoa).</p>
<p>One fascinating aspect of our co-evolution with worms is that many species make immune modulating chemicals to inhibit Th2 responses and thereby tolerize the host to their presence. Some of these secretory products promote T cell differentiation into T regulatory cells (Tregs), which moderate immune responses. For this reason, many of these products are being investigated for therapeutic potential to treat Crohn's disease, IBD, and other conditions. Consistent with the <a href="http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0306-7" target="_blank">Hygiene Hypothesis</a>, many researchers suspect that the increased incidence of some autoimmune disorders in the developed world is due to the relatively sudden disappearance of our immune-modulating worm friends.</p>
<p>Sorry, I recognize I went far off-topic in answering your question but I figured if you are interested in this you might like to learn more and I'm obsessed with immunology. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was impressive. I came in this thread expecting to read a few interleukin and eosinophil sentences. Ended up reading what sounded like an off the cuff literature review. The success rate of helminth treatment made to crohns were insane, like near cure right? In the anti IBD arsenal are they still a non first line agent? I usually would google/emed/pubmed this, but since you're up there...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't follow how being &quot;too healthy&quot; would cause your immune system to malfunction causing auto-immune diseases.  This almost sounds like giving them something to fight (i.e. attenuated disease) on a regular basis would be the 'cure'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a chemical change in the cell, but it's a short-lived one.</p>
<p>Chemotaxis (the act of responding to chemokines) requires consistent signaling to promote action. </p>
<p>Where the signal is most potent is where the cell will move. In this sense, a cell will always move to the source of chemokines, which in typically the site of infection</p></div>		</li>

<p>i dont know, but i suspect that parasites that persists have mechanisms to hide themselves or prevent the release of the calling proteins at the breach. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There are immune cells in the intestinal lining residing in places like Peyer's Patch and Isolated Lymphoid Follicles, which are involved in defending against intestinal parasites like tapeworms and modulating intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms that are used to defend are primarily the innate immune responses such as complement.</p></div>		</li>

The human body is kind of like a very strangely shaped donut in that regard.  A parasite would still need to enter through the intestinal wall to make it into the sterile body.</p></div>		</li>
