			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is them taking the &quot;like I'm 5&quot; part too literal, but the &quot;explain&quot; part not literal enough. Fine, explain it as if to a literal five year old if you want. But you do need to explain it. Not just hand-wave it away as you might do to a five year old.</p>
<p>As the sidebar says: &quot;E is for Explain - merely answering a question is not enough.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>LI5 means friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.</p>

<p>Look at the rules, it's not a subreddit for explaining things to five year olds. </p>
