<p>I think this would be impossible to someone new to driving. Because someone is familiar with the process the brain doesn't need to focus on it as much and simply defaults to that process. </p>

<p>I'm assuming so as well. I mean, when we first learn to drive we have to think about every operation like finding the brake pedal or pushing the turn signal lever in the right direction. After we get used to operating the car, we do it without much conscious thought. I guess when we're comfortable with the route (such as a daily commute) we don't have to give much thought to anything involved in the process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you ELI5 your ELI5 explanation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a programmer but the way I understood it is that you basically figure something out once. And then after you realize you need to do it over and over and over again over the course of time. Then you just put that specific action into something smaller and easily accessible like what he called a function. Then do the equivalent of copy and paste said action (in this case it would be driving) and then BOOM. Your driving without really focusing. </p>
<p>Did I kinda get it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this whole analogy is not ELI5 at all. That's my point. Why explain a simple concept by explaining it through a vastly more complicated and esoteric field of knowledge? Not you, the other commenter. </p>
<p>Someone needs to check out Occams razor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the things your brain wants to do like they're in a queue. The brain spends time and effort on ordering the queue. Instead of the brain thinking &quot;I have to add this and this and this and then this etc.&quot; it instead thinks &quot;I'll add this preordered set of things&quot; thereby saving processing time and power. </p></div>		</li>
