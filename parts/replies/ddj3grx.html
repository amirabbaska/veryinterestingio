			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably the same reason why eating your favourite food makes you happy or seeing a girl/guy with that perfect type of face or that wonderful personality excites you. There are things that your brain likes and things it doesn't. Everybody has a different mind, and different sensory input yields different results.  </p>
<p>You could make the comparison that the brain is an equation. Sensory input is variables. Sometimes when the variables are put in the equation, it solves out as a gross fraction or something. Nobody likes that. But some variables solve out to nice pretty whole numbers and everybody likes those. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow... that is a really good analogy. Do you partner dance?? There are so many variables in having a &quot;good&quot; dance, when they all work it's like a nice whole number, it just feels right. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
