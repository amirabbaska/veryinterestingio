			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've been clinically depressed for about ten years and nothing has really helped. The only time I saw a positive change in myself was with sleep deprivation. I suppose I was just too tired to be depressed. I wasn't anxious either nor did I overthink things. I was much funnier, talkative and lighthearted with people. It was like a having a glimpse on what I could be like without the depression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is thought of as one of the reasons that being a night owl and having depression are strongly correlated.  People who suffer from chronic depression usually feel their best at the end of the day, and worst in the morning.  This subtle pressure then pushes them to stay awake as long as possible every night, seeking relief.</p></div>		</li>
