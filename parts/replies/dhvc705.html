			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong on this, because I know exactly 0 about US divorce rates, but that graph makes my manipulation sense tingle.</p>
<p>Why cut off the graph at 20 years ago? This graph does not give you basis to claim that the divorce rate has been in the decline ever since.
I'd also like to see more of the graph before 1950 to be able to compare the spike to other variance.</p>
<p>And it's too zoomed in on the y-axis, so it looks like the divorce rate increases 10fold or more, when in reality it &quot;only&quot; doubles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was just the first thing I found. You can find more recent data that shows rates dropping. Older rates were clearly lower because it wasn't even an option for most people.</p>
<p>The 70s changed the Dynamics of it significantly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This WashPost <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/23/144-years-of-marriage-and-divorce-in-the-united-states-in-one-chart/?utm_term=.f9c2bbc83bca" target="_blank">article</a> seems like a better graph*, and has the added benefit of pairing it with a graph of marriages.</p>
<p>Looks like the downward trend is pretty sound.</p>
<p>*It starts from 0, rather than having the y axis start at an arbitrary number. It shows a long range of time, up through the present day, rather than a narrow section to &quot;prove&quot; a point. One graph has it normalized as a rate (x per 1000 people) rather than absolute numbers (which would follow the chart for population growth as a whole). I don't see any signs of statistics-based dishonesty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The spike in divorce right after WW2 is really surprising.  I'm going to have to read about that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not when you think about women being in the workforce and not depending on men to survive... being in a marriage meant you were taken care off, and the men being sole breadwinner so not TOO surprising.</p></div>		</li>
