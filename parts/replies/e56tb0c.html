			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very simplified explanation.</p>
<p>Clay minerals can act as cation exchangers.</p>
<p>While the replacement of Aluminium cations with Magnesium for examples would leave a net negative charges that charge is balanced by Sodium, Potassium or Ammonia ions hanging around loosely bound close by.</p></div>		</li>
