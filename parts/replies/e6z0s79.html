			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo! After reading all the answers and doing a little research this one makes the most sense. This also fits my anecdotal experiences. </p>
<p>Thanks for posting that along with citations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned in the article, which heavily pushes their supplements, yohimbine can help with stubborn fat, if used properly. It is an antagonist for the alpha receptor, allowing you to use the fat in those stores, but only if you're in a fasted state, and in need of calories. So you have to workout before eating after taking it for it to do any good, and it does have some side effects that can be less than pleasant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for that explanation. As we lose most of our beta-sensitive cells, does our body increase the amount of catecholamines released to access alpha-receptor cells, or does the amount released remain constant and fat loss just slows markedly? Does this have any lasting impact on adrenal function or sensitivity of catecholamines in other cells like myocytes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check the podcast link &amp; see if it is discussed, article also.  Iâ€™m not a subject matter expert, but I did remember that reference when I read this post &amp; wanted to share it...because it explained it well to me when I was curious about it.</p></div>		</li>
