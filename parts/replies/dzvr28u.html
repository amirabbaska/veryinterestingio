			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse my ignorance, but suppose you were able to get a perfect pancreas and it was transplanted into a type 1 diabetic, would the insulin producing cells know how much insulin to produce to work alongside the constantly changing glucose levels in the recipient?</p>
<p>I suppose this is like asking would the heart of a transplant recipient know how many times to beat per minute, but I'm still curious since insulin to glucose ratios seem so complex. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's never easy no matter how 'perfect'... the cells will continue to produce insulin post transplant and the new host will eventually balance out the number of islet cells needed to support them however it's a balancing act- The endocrinologist will watch that like a hawk and will help balance the post transplant regime with what the pancreas produces, the effects of the drug regime, the patient's compliance, etc to get the best possible outcome... you see how many balls are in the air? That's why it's not a perfect science ... simply to get a recipient off insulin is an initial goal,  but it's not easy... ya'll need to stop with the processed sugars and overall glucose onslaught of heavy sugar- We humans are not ready for that on an evolutionary scale... thus diabetes - same for the chemicals in our food supply.. our bodies aren't prepared despite what the profit driven agency's say...  just because it doesn't kill us immediately, doesn't mean it will kill us eventually... jus' sayin'.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pancreas is attached to a blood supply during surgery. Tha pancreas would be able to sense the blood glucose level through that connection and produce the appropriate amount of insulin. Because the blood glucose level has to rise first there will be some delay in the transplanted pancreas' response. </p>
<p>People who do not have diabetes have their pancreases wired neurologically to their brain so there isn't that delay. They simply need to start thinking about food and they will already start producing a small of insulin preemptively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called xenotransplantation and is a consideration however not enough study has been done to satisfy the risk of cross species viral or bacterial or unknown transmission to be viable- De-cellularized (no 'live' cells) grafts have been used for years primarily from pigs (porcine) and cows (bovine) for some tissue grafting, but live cells are a whole different monster we just don't know enough about at the moment.. You'll likely see stem cell based therapies first that are more effective before the next level of technology comes along... </p></div>		</li>
