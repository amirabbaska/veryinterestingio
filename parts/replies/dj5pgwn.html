			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice addition, but not really ELI5. This is getting into third year developmental biology stuff. I'll make it easier to understand for people having trouble:</p>
<p>Genes are blue prints for multiple proteins depending on what parts of the gene are taken. Some proteins come in and write down the parts they want to make a certain protein. These are called transcripts, because they were the transcribed version of genes (these are mRNA). These are like the instruction manual for proteins. Special proteins build other proteins based on their instructions. Then these new proteins go on (obviously I'm skipping out on post-translational modifications) and do other stuff to keep the cell working fine or to stop bad stuff from happening or to control stuff. That's their purpose. </p>
<p>Proteins do stuff in our body. Proteins can keep our cells healthy and help us grow. </p>
<p>Proteins can help other proteins do their job or stop proteins from doing their jobs. </p>
<p>Proteins can also change how the protein-building instructions are made. This causes increase of certain protein instructions or decrease in other protein instructions. </p>
<p>In genes, there are the good parts of the instructions, and the less-helpful parts of instructions. When making transcripts, special proteins cut out this junk crap from the instructions so the builder proteins don't get confused. These junk DNA parts are useful for proteins to attach to. They can then control how much of one set of instructions gets made. They can also make it so certain parts of instructions are put together over other parts of instructions. </p>
<p>Hope I translated from science-5 year old well enough. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Genetic complexity is nearly impossible to &quot;dumb-down&quot; to someone that has very little background knowledge on the subject. </p>
<p>One thing a lot of people don't realize is that every cell in your body contains the same DNA. Different cells in your body express different areas of your DNA through a regulation mechanism of hiding (methylation) or exposing (acetylation) certain sections DNA on each chromosome. </p>
<p>Alternative splicing exposes a whole new dimension to biological and computational coding as well. </p>
<p>It seems as if it will be a long long time before we fully understand the coding mechanism of DNA; let alone decipher the code of every gene in our bodies. </p></div>		</li>
