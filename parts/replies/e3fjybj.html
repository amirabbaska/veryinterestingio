<p>I have never heard of 120 volt 3 phase.</p>

<p>We use it <em>all the time</em> in the event industry. Power distros for lighting, sound, video, and rigging motors all use 120v 3-phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, 120v 3-phase and 208V 3-phase are the same thing. </p>
<p>There are 5 wires. Three hot legs, a neutral, and a safety ground.</p>
<p>The 3 hot legs each peak at 120V relative to the neutral leg.</p>
<p>However the phase of each leg is offset by 120 degrees from each other, so they don't peak at the same time. </p>
<p>That means if you measure the voltage from hot to hot, the peak you'll get is 208V. </p>
<p>The wiring depends on the application. In a regular power distro, Edison outlets will be wired like normal with 1/3 of the outlets  wired from Leg A to neutral and ground, another 1/3 will be wired from Leg B to neutral and ground, and the last 1/3 will be wired from Leg C to neutral and ground.</p>
<p>For specialty distros that send 208V to high voltage devices (like robotic spot lights and large projectors) the circuit will be wired from Leg A to Leg B or Leg C and ground (the neutral is not used). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many different power system that exists. </p>
<p>The most common people see is 120/240V 1 phase 3 wires (2 inverted 120V live wires and a neutral wire), which is used for low power application such as powering a house.</p>
<p>There is 120/208V 3 phases 3 or 4 wires (3 sequenced 120V live wires and a neutral wire). This is used for low power application for more commercial needs since you can have more power to it and it can easily run motors.</p>
<p>Then there is 277/480V 3 phases 3 or 4 wires (same as before, but just more power). This is used for more powerful application for commercial needs. It's also quite good for things like lightings because you can connect more lights on the same circuits saving costs.</p>
<p>There are bigger systems that exists for industrial needs, but these are not that common compared to the 3 mentioned earlier.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 208V comes from the fact that if you were to use two hot legs for a circuit instead of a hot and neutral, then the voltage peaks at 208V instead of 120V. This is useful for high power devices that normally like to take 240V.  We use it in the live event industry for things like robotic spotlights and very big video projectors. The increase in voltage means we don't need to draw as much current to get the same amount of power. Less current means the cables don't have to be as thick and let me tell you copper cables add up fast. Using thinner cables costs less money to rent, less money for shipping from venue to venue, and it's less taxing on your setup crew (who are paid by the hour and will get tired faster hauling thicker cables around). </p></div>		</li>

<p>We have 208/240/480 in Central Florida. If you wire a pump incorrectly it will turn the motor in reverse. If you wire it correctly and it turns in reverse the power company will pretend it's your fault.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, sir! I was referring to the company worked on something in the box and switched phases upstream and almost cost us a replacement pump until I checked the wiring. (It worked perfectly and then all of a sudden wasnt pumping nearly enough and was first diagnosed as a bad pump.)</p></div>		</li>
