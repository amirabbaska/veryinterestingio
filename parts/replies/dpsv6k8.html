			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I have generalized anxiety disorder. Every morning I wake up in a panic attack before dawn and immediately need to evacuate my bowels and it ain't pretty. It's a fight to keep myself from puking every morning, one I don't always win, but after the fact i am certainly much more able to run away from lions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This used to happen to me in social situations. Vomiting/diarrhoea whenever presented in any situation my brain deemed scary (which was any time I went to school or hung out with friends).</p>
<p>Went to a doctor, got diagnosed with social anxiety and got put on medication. Was finally able to live a normal life without hiding in my room/cancelling every social engagement I was invited to/mentally noting every bathroom location at every place I went to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shits. Your gut clears out from both ends so it doesn’t have to spend energy on gut motility or digestion or anything else like that. It happened during the early stages I just had gotten to hospital went to loo in a large disabled toilet easy 6feet tobtge wall and kid you not my projected vomit hit it while I shat out everything else in my digestive tract. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, I would lose my appetite right before going into labor, so luckily got to skip the barfing part. Can confirm the gut flush, though! </p>
<p>Also, there will most likely be some poop that happens if you're doing a vaginal delivery. Every vag birth I've attended has involved some amount of it, and it makes sense when you consider that you have this big ol' mass passing through that area, and it squeezes your guts like a tube of toothpaste. It sounds nasty, but trust me, there's so much else going on that you may never find out whether or not it happened to you, and it's usually whisked away without comment.</p>
<p>The other thing that took me by surprise was the smell. There's a strong, earthy odor to the birthing process. I mean, everything about the birthing process is extremely visceral, but every time it's that scent that really grounds me and, at the risk of sounding loony, adds to the feeling of sacred energy to the event. </p>
<p>It is possible to experience back labor, where you feel labor pain in your back. If this happens early on, I strongly suggest getting an epidural. Back labor is worse than regular labor like burning your leg off with acid is worse than breaking a toe. This is not science, but I experience period cramps in my back, which I suspect is a clue to whether or not back labor will be a thing. I also have herniated discs, which may have been part of the issue. YMMV. </p>
<p>If you opt for an epidural, that shit will make you high as balls. Even a walking epidural, which I opted for with one of my kids, was kinda like being generously stoned. My mom thought it was fucking hilarious. In retrospect, talking to the trashcan for a half-hour in mangled Spanish <em>is</em> pretty fucking funny.</p>
<p>Delivering a baby feels like taking the biggest crap of your life and then some. If you've ever pooed and gotten that shiver of pleasure and relief as the pressure is relieved from the vagus nerve? That's like the moment of birth, only it feels thousands of times more profound and awesome, and that's even with an epidural. I will say that the feeling was much stronger with the walking epidural since there's more sensation left in the lower half of your body, so I can imagine that it's even stronger without medication, but even dulled down it's one of the single most amazing sensations I've felt in my life. </p>
<p>I don't think I was adequately prepared for the six-week &quot;period&quot; that followed delivery. I'm not fucking kidding, stock up on overnight heavy flow pads and underwear you give no shits about, because there will be times you'll go to the bathroom and it will look like Dethklok performed in your pants. </p>
<p>Most importantly, don't ever feel ashamed of the emotional rollercoaster that is woven throughout the birthing and first few months. Get help if you're overwhelmed (which you probably will be, there's a reason many cultures basically don't let new moms do ANYTHING for the first few months), keep in mind that everything you feel is part of the natural process you're going through, and never forget that needing helping hands is natural and normal and doesn't make you lazy or weak or a burden or any of that shit.</p></div>		</li>
