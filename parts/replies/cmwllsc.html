<p>“We targeted the school because the army targets our families. We want them to feel our pain.”</p>

<p>It is very likely that the six Taliban sent to attack the school had themselves lost family and children to Pakistani army attacks.  That would have made it particularly easier to kill other children as revenge, and to easier to die willingly in a suicide mission as they probably felt they had nothing to live for.</p>
<p>ELI5: Revenge pure and simple.  An eye for an eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what drives most terrorist acts, the fact that religious fundamentalism is involved has an influence but it's secondary and it's not like they're born with an evil-terrorist gene. This is about revenge from a disenfranchised group that has been attacked, this is how people become capable of awful crimes, cold blooded revenge fueled by pain and anger; any empathic feeling towards the enemy goes flying through the window. This is how the Islamic States grew so much in numbers; people that have been witnessing a foreign invader bringing death, misery and humiliation for years seek for revenge, for justice and ISIS gave them that option. An option to enact revenge and fight back. </p>
<p>We must understand how this groups are created and procure a world in which no human being is driven towards that state of mind. Dehumanizing them and turn them into evil caricatures does not help, bombing all those evil terrorists and invading evil governments in evil countries doesn't help in the long term either. This petty revenge exchange between terrorists and freedom fighters is going no where, should we not act upon it? Of course we should, but we most approach it with actions more appropriate for the moral high ground we claim to have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to continue this for all eternity? Because an 'eye for an eye' makes absolutely no sense to me.</p>
<p>Following that logic just means that these actions will be passed on from generation to generation, all seeking to makes things even and justifying their actions through the wrongs that have been done to them. At some point people need to just accept that a bad thing has happened without the need for retaliation or so called 'justice'.</p>
<p>Causing someone else pain will do nothing to alleviate your own.</p></div>		</li>
