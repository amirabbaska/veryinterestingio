			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh really? I didn't know that mattered. I thought even if the propellant was slower it would still add speed if there wasn't any friction </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics isn't an answer. Explain the physics. Even then explain the whole story. The exhaust velocity alone means nothing, it also depends on the difference of  mass of the rocket and fuel at full and empty. So if you had infinite fuel the exhaust velocity wouldn't matter and you'd have infinite acceleration.</p>
<p>I know you would never have that situation on the real world but you only say exhaust velocity matters which just makes people think its the only thing that determines top speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually you just run out of propellant. Ion engines give much more velocity per unit of propellant, but it's still a fixed amount.</p>
<p>Still, top speed is a misnomer. You can reach any speed (below the speed of light) given enough propellant. The relevant equation is in the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation" target="_blank">rocket equation</a> article on wikipedia.</p>
<p>deltaV = v_e*ln(m_0/m_1)</p>
<p>where v_e is the exhaust velocity, which is typicall 20 to 200 km/s for ion thrusters. m_0 is total mass, including the propellant. m_1 is dry mass, which is anything excluding the propellant. That is payload, ion engine, power source, etc. As you can see, by increasing the total mass with propellant by a factor of e (2.72) you can increase your final velocity by whatever the exhaust velocity is.</p>
<p>E.g. if you have a system that can reach a top speed of 90km/s, with an exhaust velocity of 20km/s, you can change your final velocity to 150km/s by increasing your total mass by a factor of e^3 = 20, while keeping the dry mass constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As i understand ion engines take their energy to accelerate from electricity. Could one just build a stronger ion engine to eject the same amount of propellant faster? Or would you need to build heav√≠er engines that would cancel out the gain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the price point though. We could do it in a reasonable time frame of 10-20 years if we really threw down the big bucks. Maybe even significantly under 10 years. Though i doubt the majority of people would find it practical to drop 30-50 billion on a space probe, with that said, a planet of this size could theoretically still be quite warm out there in the vastness of space, as could any potential satellites. Life could exist on it  and a good look at this planet if confirmed to exist will be on every astronomers mind for decades to come.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we Apollo it.  If it exists hopefully the next generation of telescopes will be able to give us a good look, but if we really wanted we could visit it in a reasonable amount of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Developing a probe architecture capable of a reasonable <em>transit</em> time would still take a lot of time all by itself.  </p>
<p>The researchers think the planet would more likely be on the aphelion side of its orbit, so with current capabilities that's somewhere between half a century and a century.  Cutting that down to 10 years would require nuclear propulsion, which in itself would take decades to mature at realistic funding levels and regulatory hurdles.</p>
<p>With sustained commitment (but as you say, not Apollo-level), 40 years total would be reasonable (30 development, 10 transit) as opposed to 60, 80, 100, etc.</p>
<p>But given the lukewarm interest in even exploring the outermost two gas giants we already know about - which we already know how to reach in a decent span of time - the likelihood of committing to a probe that far out is small.  Scientists would overwhelmingly advise devoting resources to improving telescopic observations, since the return would be much quicker and more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what kind of payload you want. If you're happy with a tiny payload that basically takes a few pictures you could do it on a shoestring budget (less than 1bn for sure). It's actually not unreasonable as an ion engine technology demonstrator mission, kind of like DS1 was in the late 90s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A perihelion is a specific case of a periapsis.  &quot;Apsis&quot; is the general term that can apply to extreme points of an orbit around anything.  &quot;Helion&quot; refers specifically to orbiting our Sun.  </p></div>		</li>
