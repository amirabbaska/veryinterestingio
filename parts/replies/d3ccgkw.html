<p>also mixing a raising agent such as baking powder or baking soda with certain liquids causes a chemical reaction releasing gasses which is what makes it rise, so you'd want to do this as close to baking as possible. mix your baking soda with milk first then organise everything else you're going to get a flat cake. </p></div>		</li>

Kraft Mac&amp;Cheese made appropriately (creating a roux from the cheese packet and butter before moving on) will give you something insanely better than the standard stovetop slop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I would say you're missing is that depending on the ingredients you may want to stop them &quot;activating&quot; as early as possible, most especially with things like raising agents (not yeast so much, but things like bicarb/baking soda etc). Once a wet medium is introduced, it allows these to start reacting and there is only so much time before they stop or slow down too much.</p></div>		</li>
