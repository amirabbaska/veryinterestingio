<p>Does it though?  Your answer is what I was looking for but I don't think it's correct.  I don't think it our extra stuff could possibly account for all the extra work we're doing.  The price of <em>things</em> (that can be produced in third world countries and/or that benefit from advances in production efficiency) went down drastically.  I would venture to say that a TV in the 1950 could easily buy us the 5 we may have now.  So that seems all even.  Cell phones?  Same thing, one land line = our family plan for 5.  1 car from the 1950s = our 2 cars now.  Internet and computers?  That's a new cost but not 40hrs/week worth I don't think.  Gadgets that might add...but only marginally say 10 hrs a week's worth!  These are just guesses but am I wrong?  If someone could do the math/research that would be swell :)  So I'm still &quot;baffled&quot; where all the profit from all the extra work is going (I'm not really baffled because I still have the same suspicion - corps and shareholders just pocketing more).     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/70yearsofpricechange.html" target="_blank">Using data from here and an inflation calculator:</a></p>
<p>Car in 1960 (inflation adjusted): $21k</p>
<p>Car in 2013: $31k</p>
<p>House in 1960 (inflation adjusted): $102k</p>
<p>House today: $290k</p>
<p>Those are the two largest expenses for most people. As you can see, people spend significantly more on both, particularly housing, than they did in the 1960's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  This is exactly what I was after.  That's crazy though! We should all pause before buying, nay, taking on a mortgage, on a $290K house...that's very sad.</p>
<p>Just FYI I rent an apartment and my car was $21K in 2010 :) same for my SO (thereabouts) so where is my extra 40 hr/week? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that may say some of it. We get cheaper products from 3rd world countries. That explains where some of our money and jobs are going, exported to other countries</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true that is where a lot of our jobs are going to be sure but I'm talking about just those of us lucky to have two jobs per two person household....which is exactly half of one job per two person household of the 1950s</p></div>		</li>

<p>wages being stagnant
Wages haven't been stagnant they dropped in half as soon as women joined the workforce...
And saying inflation still begs the question - let's look at it terms of work hours, why does 40 hr weeks per household then = 80 hr weeks per household now - who is reaping the profit from this extra work?  Especially since labor prices have gone down (third world country slave labor) and production has become so much more efficient. </p>

<p>No, technology is not an overwhelmingly greater cost to people if they don't want it to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was really expensive. I had my own landline phone in 1988. It cost $30/month and didn't rent a phone. Almost no one had two lines in the house.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It wasn't two phone <em>lines</em>, it was two <em>phones</em> period. Bell only let you use their phones on their network while they had a monopoly on phones in the US.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its 500MB / 200 minutes / 500 texts a month for free. The downsides are that their support is crap, their app is meh, and the device selection is extremely limited. They only use Sprint's data network as well so that means calling only works in 3g / 4g zones, and its effectively VOIP everywhere. You need at least a half strength 3g signal to get good quality most of the time. They also have a very good deal for a $20 a month unlimited 3G plan that also comes with 1G of 4g.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All that random crap is chump change compared to the price of fuel, housing, food, and obligatory insurance. Brand big screen TVs cost a couple days' wages for most professionals. Less than a day's wages if you surf Craigslist. This is why the &quot;poor people on Welfare in America are rich enough to afford TV's&quot; meme is total bullshit. </p>
<p>If you were to take my cell phone bill, internet, and amortize out the cost of all my computers and other electronic gadgets that all adds up to less than the price of renting a small private room where I live.</p>
<p>Population has increased and the only thing you can't make more land (see the first Superman movie)</p></div>		</li>
