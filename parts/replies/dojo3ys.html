			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that makes a black hole a black hole is the singularity, the event horizon is just a feature of the singularity. A singularity has no volume, and so it has infinite density. The event horizon is not the defining part of a black hole, something I don't think you quite understand, it's just a feature of all singularities.</p>
<p>That said, there are more types of theorized collapsed stars between neutron star and black hole. The biggest evidence of this is that the smallest black holes have around 5 solar masses, whereas the largest known neutron stars have a mass of around 2.3... so between those numbers, it's possible to overcome neutron degeneracy pressure while still leaving a star comprised of even more elementary particles, such as quarks, whose degeneracy pressure might be higher than that of a neutron, leaving you with a quark star of between 3-5 solar masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we haven't. That's why quark stars are theorized to exist, but have not yet been observed. It's possible that they're just incredibly rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_limit" target="_blank">TOV limit</a> is reached significantly before the object is close to being a black hole, and afterwards it has to collapse. There might be more exotic types of stellar remains, but neutron stars can't exist any more beyond that limit.</p></div>		</li>
