			<div class="markdown"><p>I look forward to that. If you are also using something other than .22, do you think the strings will work to hold it? Or are you going to have to design a whole new rig to hold it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would highly recommend you use green tip 5.56 as it looks like the bullets have enough time to spall before the energy is transferred to the tail. These rounds have hardened steel cores and hit around 1705 Joules</p></div>		</li>
