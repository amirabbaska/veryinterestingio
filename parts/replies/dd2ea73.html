<p>and applies to ALL foreign nationals.</p>

<p>No, it doesn't.  The executive order restrictions apply to seven countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen.</p>
<p>Not saying that I agree or disagree with the order. Just clarifying the breadth of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it applies all foreign nationals <em>from the named nations</em>, including those already granted visas or who posses legal permanent residence in the US, and including those already residing in the US. Sorry if that was not clear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question, no snark: I don't know anything about what kind of documentation is needed to validate a Traveler's status for entry to the US nor what the process is to acquire such documents - but with ID Theft and forged IDs being a concern to many people who have been victims of such a crime, how secure are the documents needed for Travelers that may be affected by Trump's EO? I guess I'm wondering how easy it would be for a &quot;terrorist&quot; to forge docs to get around the restrictions that Trump just put into place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obama order was a rule on who could be granted a visa. Trumps rule applies to <em>entry</em> into the united states for all person from the named nations, even if they have been granted a visa already or are a legal permanent resident of the US. </p></div>		</li>
