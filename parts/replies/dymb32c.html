			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that bivalves are exposing a huge amount of gill surface area to freshwater.  </p>
<p>I think it's interesting that both gastropod and bivalve cracked the &quot;freshwater&quot; problem but cephalopods have not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation for the differences in biology, but I feel like it doesn't really answer the question. Is there something about cephalopod biology that's incompatible with that kind of sodium pump? Or did it just not evolve by pure coincidence?</p>
<p>Like starfish just use straight seawater as their blood, so they don't have any kind if pump system. At least not at this scale. But fish have both directions of pump, dolphins have both directions of pump, but why can squid only have one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am just guessing here but, given the relative porous nature of cephalopoda skin (compared to scales or shells), it would probably be too expensive to develop that kind of pump as said pump would need to be going full out at all times to keep it alive. Basically water would just be diffusing into the cephalopod constantly and in great volumes and without a LOT of ridding of said excess water, the cephalopod would explode. A lot of the cephalopods adaptations also hinge on having super flexibility so adapting tougher skin or a covering would just cause more issues for them.</p>
<p>For fish to have both directions of pump is extremely difficult for them and requires a lot of energy to maintain. They basically have to alter their entire physiology to go from salt to fresh and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are freshwater cnidarians, which have even less control than cephalopods over how much water passes through their skin. </p>
<p>Although they're also simpler and probably don't need the same careful balance of electrolytes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be a gradual process, moving to less and less salty water over time.</p>
<p>There are cephalopods that live in very salty areas of the ocean and some that live in much less concentrated areas.</p>
<p>We could over a few hundred thousand/million years see some species move further into rivers if thats where they survive better or if they discover an easier food source.</p>
<p>But then again evolution of the ability to live in freshwater just might not be a viable path for Cephalopods.  We'll just have to wait and see.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a really good question.  Both snails and clams are found in freshwater, which implies that it's intrinsically possible for mollusk physiology if you have the right adaptations.  People will say &quot;but they have shells&quot; but that ignores that much of the surface area of these animals is in the gills, where blood is necessarily in close contact with water.  </p></div>		</li>
