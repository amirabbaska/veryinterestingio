I don't know anything about eye diseases, but I think &quot;typically&quot; there shouldn't be pain associated with bright lights isn't the proper word, as it seems very common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did anyone actually feel pain when the teacher did that though? </p>
<p>I’m genuinely asking because my teachers always did that and my eyes never hurt. I just assumed the kids that said “ow” were just being hyperbolic and didn’t actually feel anything. </p>
<p>I’ll feel some kind of pain/pressure when going out into bright sunlight after being indoors for awhile. But that’s about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting take to the question but we actually don’t know why there is pain associated with light. You more so describe a mechanism that can cause pain but not why. It’s something still being studied. We don’t know if the pain felt is a made up response from the brain that says stop looking at light or if the light itself triggers a true pain response in something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All pain is essentially a &quot;made up response&quot; to protect the body from damage.</p>
<p>Where and how the pain signal is generated differs depending on what part of the body you're talking about, but all pain signals are generated by the body.</p></div>		</li>
