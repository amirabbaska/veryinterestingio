			<div class="markdown"><p>I did mean to mention this as well... Repetition in music is something that draws people to it, because the brain likes finding patterns and thus people are drawn to music that they can easily remember, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPrtFxd9u9Y" target="_blank">even if the song is redundant.</a>  An ascending or descending series of notes can bring you up or down, and the expectation of an ascending note, but instead hearing a descending note (or a 5th or 7th or some other note in a chord progression) is part of what generates emotion in a song.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Surprise also plays a role too.</p>

<p>Is that why key changes can be so powerful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why. The same repetition is still there, but it's different. Surprise is key, and that's why Bach is so great. Bach is real good with finding surprising ways to switch up a melody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if, say, I listen to a song I exactly know the general pattern of but I just don't like the chord progression although I knew it.</p>
<p>You are saying &quot;When we expect something and we get it, it feels good.&quot; But that actually annoys me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the exact opposite has been shown to be true in general cases. Focus group studies have been done to show that even when a person initially doesent like a song, on average they tend to like it more and more the more that it is played.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude i feel ya. I absolutely hate music that I find repetitive. It's totally ok to reuse riffs but when it turns out the whole song is the same beat and chord progression, I'm immensely turned off. </p></div>		</li>
