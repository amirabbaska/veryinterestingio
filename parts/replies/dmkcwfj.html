			<div class="markdown"><p>Better than glasses, which have some risk of degradation or scratching that will let damaging light through, [build yourself a solar projector.] (<a href="https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/diy-solar-viewer" target="_blank">https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/diy-solar-viewer</a>)</p>
<p>A solar projector will project an image of the Sun onto a white screen, and you can see the sunspots very clearly and distinctly.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do it is to get a cheap child's telescope from the thrift store and mount it to a board such that it points the eyepiece at a piece of white plastic mounted on the end of the board.  It helps to cut a hole in the middle of a pizza box top, and to put that around the objective (big) lens end of the telescope to create a shady area for the screen.  Point the telescope at the Sun, and voila! you can see the Sun on a screen without looking directly at it.</p>
<p>If you cut a ring from a PVC pipe and mount it on a 12&quot; stick at one end of the board, and mount a skinny 12&quot; stick (piece of bamboo tomato stake) in line with it at the other end of the board, you can adjust the height of the skinny stick so that it works like a gunsight.  Point the viewer toward the Sun and watch its shadow on the ground.  You will also see the shadow of the ring and the skinny stick.  When the shadow of the tip of the skinny stick is centered in the shadow of the ring, the Sun will be projected onto your screen.  It takes a little adjustment, but its easy to aim the viewer once you get it aligned.</p>
<p>A good source of white plastic for the screen is a piece cut from the side of a plastic kitty litter jug.  White posterboard or foamboard will also work well.  The distance between the eyepiece and the screen will determine how big a picture you see of the Sun.  If you have the screen close up, you will have a very small image that is very bright, too small and too bright to look at comfortably.  If you move the screen back some, you can get an image of the Sun that is about 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the sunspots will be easy to see very clearly, while the image will be bright, but not bright enough to make it hard to look at comfortably.</p>
<p>The good thing about the shadow gunsight is that you are always aiming by looking at the ground, instead of peeking over your shoulder to try to find the Sun's location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had seen this link before the eclipse. But, I will still build this. My 9 yr old daughter became very interested in astronomy with the eclipse. She is waiting for the 2019 Mercury transit of the sun. I assume sunspots will be visible, so this would be something to keep her interest in the meantime. I also like the idea of the kids telescope. They are more frustrating than inspirational for a budding astronomer.  Thanks for the link and idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Sun rotates every 24-38 days (depending on solar latitude). So they will have moved but not too far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the answer to the question depends on how long sun spots last on average, not just how fast the sun rotates</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When there are sunspots, they are visible for many days, but there are times when there are no sunspots, particularly during the part of the Sun's 11 year cycle that is called the solar minimum.  We are in the solar minimum right now, so there are not as many (or even no) sunspots as there are during the solar maximum.</p>
<p>Edit:  Stupid, stupid maths.  The complete cycle is 11 years, not 22.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sunspots move across the face of the sun as it rotates: the rotation period is 24 days, so you <em>might</em> be able to see some movement over the few hours of an eclipse but it'd be tough.</p>
<p>We were lucky to see such good sunspots during the eclipse and today.  The Sun is currently in a declining phase of its sunspot cycle: the last time it hits its minimum in 2008-2010, I remember that there were many weeks with no sunspots at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks for the heads up &amp; link. I just took a look. There was a little tiny black dot on the sun that was sometimes there &amp; sometimes not. But when I turned my head, the location of the sometimes-there dot didn't move with me, so it wasn't just a trick of my eyes.</p>
<p>I'm in my 50s &amp; I'd never seen a sunspot before. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's probably because they are so small, our eyes can pick out tiny objects better using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averted_vision" target="_blank">averted vision</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Averted vision is a technique for viewing faint objects which uses peripheral vision. It involves not looking directly at the object, but looking a little off to the side, while continuing to concentrate on the object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's like the rods in our eyes are more sensitive.</p></div>		</li>
