			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is sort-of true. Alkaline batteries can &quot;sort of&quot; be recharged but they suck at it, and require very special charging algorithms. Tl:dr is Dont do it, really dont</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an article in <em>Wireless World</em> for an alkaline charger.  It took about 30 hours for a D cell and charged for a few milliseconds and then slightly discharged for the next few milliseconds to check the state of charge.  The author also tested pressure inside a cell during charging (piston mechanism) and found it could reach 70 PSI.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a charger that could recharge alkaline batteries.  I think one of the problems was the battery outgassing as it was recharged, so it had to be done very slowly.  It worked, sort of.  It took about 10 hours to recharge an AA cell and each time you did it, it probably had about 75% of the capacity it had last time.  So basically, you could make an alkaline battery last longer, but it was nowhere near as good as a proper rechargeable battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too.  I can't think of the name of the product, and never had one myself but remember that there was a product marketed as an alkaline recharger for typical  non-rechargeable batteries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you can usually recharge the battery up to 1000 times</p>

<p>several tens of thousands of times for lithium, if you only discharge 70% or less</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have vinylene carbonate to thank for that!  It's the most common electrolyte additive, and extremely effective.  Add 2% vinylene carbonate to a plain li-ion battery and it'll last 20 times longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the cost aspect is not necessarily true. Primary alkaline cells have a bulk cost of around $600/kWh commercial, whereas lithium ion is now slowly floating under $200/kWh. </p>
<p>The main cost aspect is not in the cells themselves, but the additional circuitry in the device that uses these cells. A device designed for a lithium-ion battery needs to have temperature and undervoltage monitoring, while primary cells usually fail safe in almost every imaginable usage scenario.</p></div>		</li>
