			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very similar to the decay of Tritium too, it makes it very hard to store correctly! Tritium decays into helium, which has double the volume of Hydrogen as a gas, due to He not covalently bonding with itself like H.</p>
<p>Coupled with its relatively short half life, ~12.5 years, you can get dangerous increases in pressure of stored tritium if you don't take this factor into account when handling it. Tricky stuff.</p></div>		</li>
