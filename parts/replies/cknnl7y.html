			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that bombs with 'complex electrical circuits' don't exist (except for the purpose of remote detonation obviously.)  Once a bomb is discovered before it has done what it was intended to do it's all over.  Nobody is going to risk their life delivering an overly complicated booby trapped bomb just to blow up a disposal technician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have to partially disagree. Disposal technicians are expensive to train, and morale is an important issue. If you can eliminate them from enemy ranks in a way that is &quot;cost effective at the margins&quot; then you should do so. That said, the more complex a bomb is, the more difficult it will be to build/store/deploy, and the greater the risk it will destroy the wrong target (you) or nothing at all. But wouldn't it be worth it to hire an extra circuit designer if it eliminates one experienced disposal tech? Fortunately that resource is in short supply amongst the animals who deploy these things.</p></div>		</li>
