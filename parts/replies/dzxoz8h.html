			<div class="markdown"><p>So this explains how come we have split brains.</p>
<p>The 'why' is harder in that evolution doesn't have reasons.  We might have to look at what advantages worms got for their split nervous systems.  And why descendants didn't select for something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or not selected against <em>enough</em>. Natural selection isn't purely optimizing as there are random factors in both the mutations themselves, and the manifestation of fitness (survival). Negative traits can certainly be passed down if they are not bad enough, positive traits may disappear due to random, unrelated events. Also, since natural selection is inherently a locally-optimizing algorithm, it can shoehorn traits/the genome into unusable dead-ends.</p>
<p>Often, you can have an inferior trait appear and propagate rather than a better trait simply because the inferior trait was simpler/took fewer intermediate steps, but its expression precluded the superior trait from emerging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one thing that most people do not get about evolution.  Selection is not perfect, not everything has to be beneficial, and lots of characteristics are just passengers on a train driven by something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the evolution of the eye. A liquid-filled eye was advantageous for fish, since they're in water, but less so for animals that made the move to land/air. But it's more advantageous to have a less-than-optimal eye than no eye at all, and evolution doesn't just start over. It works with what it has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you seen Dawkins dissection if a giraffe. That nerve is 6 feet long, double that because of the loop. It is a redundant throwback to some earlier form. Completely unnecessary now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe there is a good reason for it that we haven't uncovered. It was believed the retina was layered backwards as a evolutionary mistake in some mammals until we discovered it considerably enhances parts of daytime vision thanks to a &quot;fiber-optic&quot; effect the glial cells had on certain wavelengths of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer to your question OP. <a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1053811915003444-gr5.jpg" target="_blank">Here's another reference image</a> showing the development of the embryonic nervous system that might give you a better understanding of what is meant by 'lateral outgrowths' (from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915003444" target="_blank">this article</a>). This process is driven by spatial- and concentration-dependent expression of highly conserved genes. Fun fact - one of these genes is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank">Sonic hedgehog</a>, because scientists are big nerds.</p>
<p>As the cerebrum expands to meet the needs of the requirements of the growing brain, it must abide by the physical restrictions of the developing skull plates. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652528/" target="_blank">Here is a very extensive review article that looks at the apparent developmental association between the brain and skull</a>. It's pretty meaty - a bit too much for me to parse right now! But certainly interesting and somewhat related for anyone interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is the real deal. Most of the information in the other top answers appears to be either irrelevant or misleading. For example, I'm fairly sure the evolutionary reasons we have two hemispheres have nothing to do with redundancy.</p>
<p>The more interesting question that naturally flows out of this is whether multiple brain units are an evolutionary prerequisite for human-grade intelligence. Is there something inherent in how the hemispheres communicate and compete that is a necessary step for higher brain functions? As /u/transexualtrex alluded, octopuses and other &quot;smart&quot; distributed brain animals would be a great model organism for this. As the OP said - &quot;Is there a benefit from inhibited interhemispheric communication?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
