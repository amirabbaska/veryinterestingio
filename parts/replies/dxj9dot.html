			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most useful explanation I've seen. If anything, Google's resources are far greater than almost anyone else's (including Netflix)... but still, on YouTube, a lot of my subscriptions are very niche, and I encounter a lot of buffering. A lot of the things I like on Netflix are niche also, but I don't have the same problem there.</p>
<p>Both companies have colossal and efficient CDNs, but the difference is that 'Netflix niche' is one in a few thousand, but 'YouTube niche' is one in tens, maybe hundreds of millions. Google can try and guess what needs to be most available, but they can get lost in the fog. Netflix, with their curated content, can take a much better punt. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Google is accurate here, because YouTube is a subsidiary of Google within Alphabet's corporate structure.</p></div>		</li>
