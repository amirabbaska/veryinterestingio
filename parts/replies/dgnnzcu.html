			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way, it isn't going to be a perfectly inelastic collision, you will have particles bouncing back in the direction the meteor came from regardless. However this is generally insignificant compared to the amount of particles scattered from the explosion. Usually the meteor hits and most of the kinetic energy goes into the moon, vaporizing the location that it hit and scattering the dust relatively uniformly. Of course some of the momentum is conserved from the direction it was heading, but unless it was extremely slow, or a glancing blow, this will be insignificant in comparison to the energy imparted directly to the moon, which will cause a spherical explosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The velocity of the traveling object is what is giving the impact explosion most of its energy I think. </p>
<p>The mass of the moon and the moon's velocity are not changing, the mass of different objects will change the explosion dynamics but since we are talking only about angle of attack that doesn't matter, and thirdly we are talking about normally quite heavy objects moving at incredible speeds, so popping all of the numbers into whatever formula it is that you would use to figure or the magnitude of the explosion I don't think that the angle of attack number changing from 5° to 90° would really change much in the end.</p></div>		</li>
