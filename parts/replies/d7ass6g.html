			<div class="markdown"><p>I also figured it was a natural reaction to check the spot for injury or blood. </p>
<p>(Especially since we cannot see the top of our heads and injuries don't always hurt as bad as they look.)</p>
<p>For instance I sanded off my finger. I only felt my finger touching it but I didn't actually feel anything about it. It wasn't till I saw my white shirt covered with blood before I realized I actually hurt myself. So I clenched it to stop the bleeding immediately. </p>
<p>When I busted my scalp open pretty deep on a sharp corner I didn't feel much pain. Instinctively I touched it to apply pressure and realized it was more serious then I thought. </p>
<p>I don't believe pain is the only factor. I feel like its instinctual reaction to check the injury while stemming blood loss. </p>
<p>(I have also seen babies do it when they injury themselves)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what I thought s/he meant (the second thing), didn't even considered they might have meant &quot;for example&quot;. You can argue about whether or not &quot;grammar nazis&quot; are doing any good when they correct people, but in cases when misuse of language leads to misunderstanding, people certainly should be called up on it. Well done for noticing this.</p></div>		</li>
