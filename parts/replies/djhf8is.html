			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, emotional smiling and voluntary smiling (controlling facial muscles) are controlled by different centers in your brain. It is pretty interesting that people who have lost the ability to smile voluntarily because of a brain lesion can still smile due to an emotional stimulus which is not voluntary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what's wrong with them. I'm blanking on the name of the brain disorder, but sometimes people can perform tasks involuntarily but not voluntarily (like the example above). I once saw a patient who could speak when spoken to and raise her hand to wave if caught off guard by someone waving to her. She was unable to form her own speech, however, and she did not have voluntary control over her arm to wave if she wanted to. Pretty interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father had ALS. When he had completely lost all ability to move (other than his eyes) he could still smile, involuntarily. His eyes and mouth smiled. He also cried, scowled and showed disgust involuntarily. He bawled when we watched Toy Story 3 together, during the incinerator scene. Don't we all?</p>
<p>I miss him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, scientists discovered that facial expressions are universal. </p>
<p>While we knew things like hand gestures can vary from culture to culture scientists were curious if facial expressions were also learned. After psychologists visited various remote cultures they determined that everyone equates the same facial expressions to the same emotions. Thus determining that facial expressions are universal and not learned behaviors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's fascinating to me is the idea that we may have evolved to be easily betrayed by our own faces. That, in terms of survival, it's more advantageous for the group to know what everyone else is feeling, than for the individual to be able conceal their emotions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my son is 6 months old, and he smiles like crazy.  Happiest baby at daycare, by all accounts.  I believe this is because every time I interact with him, I am smiling my face off.  He makes me so happy!  Today, I had a &quot;serious conversation&quot; with him that lasted about 10 seconds, where I talked to him without smiling.  (I was playing with him.)  He got the saddest look on his face... So I started smiling again to make him happy, and he immediately brightened up and smiled back.</p>
<p>Am I conditioning him to smile a ton and be happy?  Did my 10 second &quot;serious&quot; face counteract that?</p></div>		</li>
