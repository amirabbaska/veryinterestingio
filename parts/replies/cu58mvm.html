			<div class="markdown"><p>From what i understand, the definition of a meter is now based on the speed of light. 1 meter is the distance that light can travel in 1/299792458 of a second in a vacuum. So if we found that light moves faster than we think it's the meter that changes, not the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but the number 299792458 was chosen because it was closest to the speed of light using the previous standard definition of the meter. So in a historical sense, there is a reason we defined it to be that number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the definition now, but the original definition was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_metre" target="_blank">1‚ÅÑ10,000,000 part of one half of a meridian</a>.  It's a completely arbitrary length, universally speaking, which happens to be convenient for humans.</p>
<p>Beyond that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank">a second</a> is also an arbitrary measure.  There's no reason for a second to be what it is.  1/86,400 of an Earth solar day is just as arbitrary as &quot;the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom [at rest at 0 K].&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but kind of misleading. </p>
<p>Basically, there was/is a push to make metric units be defined by something in nature that doesn't really change. Why? Well, take the Kilogram. The definition of the kilogram is technically &quot;the mass of this one platinum weight in France that we measure periodically.&quot; If that weight is lost, we literally have no way of perfectly reconstructing the standard. (Also, its mass changes slightly all the time, and this is a huge problem.) Now, with our new definition of the meter, if we lose every meter stick in existence, we can just measure how far light would go in a vacuum in one second (seconds are similarly rigorously defined) and divide by 299792458 to rediscover our meter. </p>
<p>So while the length of a meter would change if we discovered the speed of light to be different than what we thought, it won't. That definition was just chosen so we could recalculate it easily without fear of the result changing each time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly. </p>
<p>Another aspect of course is that no matter what c might be, you could always ask why c is that velocity. It is an inevitable question that really isn't asking anything at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is certainly an inevitable question that could be asked no matter what the value were (provided that askers could exist in a universe with a different value). But I disagree with the second half of your response. It is certainly asking something real: it is asking why whatever the process was that set our universal physical constants to what they are ended up picking the values that it did. The answer is that we don't know, because we don't understand the process by which the laws of physics were determined. That doesn't mean that there <em>was no process</em> to determine them, just that we don't know what it was. I don't like the reflex of claiming that a question is unfair or &quot;isn't asking anything at all&quot; just because we don't know the answer.</p>
<p>Imagine a child asks why the sky is blue. You could say &quot;because that's just what the color of the sky is; blue is just the word we use to describe the color of the sky. It is an inevitable question that isn't asking anything at all.&quot; Or you could explain the wavelengths of sunlight and Rayleigh scattering. If you don't know about the wavelengths of sunlight and Rayleigh scattering, you should say that you don't know why the sky is blue; not that it's an illegitimate question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And ultimately as you continued to explain you would get down to fundamental constants and behaviors of forces and there's no further that you can go with your explanation.  Unless some new wave of physics suddenly makes what we assume to be fundamentals actually not fundamentals and then we can express the previous fundamentals in terms of the new fundamentals but ultimately you must accept that some things just are because we observe them to be and there exists no observable mechanism for why they should be that way or you simply can't explain anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, what it's really asking is &quot;is the value of C dependent on any other things we know, or is our knowledge of it due entirely to measurement?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only real answer you can give is that if it <em>wasn't</em> what it is, you wouldn't be here asking that question. It is fundamental to our universe being what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, the anthropic dodge. How do you <em>know</em> that there's no other set of values for physical constants that could give rise to an intelligence advanced enough to ask the same question? No one knows that; I would argue that you're making it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the real answer is that c is the <em>maximum speed</em> and all other speeds are defined by it.  All other speeds are fractions of c.</p>
<p>Thinking about it like this, the question doesn't even make sense really.  It'd be like asking &quot;What if 1 actually equaled 2?&quot; - the answer is nothing, we're playing some sort of weird word game here.  The number '1' is what we used to define '2' so if you make '1' equal to '2', either, you're contradicting your self or redefining all your numbers in a completely uninteresting way.</p>
<p>It works the same way with the speed of light.  What if 1 / 1 units of speed were 2 / 1 units of speed?  ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah like in other units things are much cleaner. :)</p>
<p>Like: c = 1 light hour per hour</p></div>		</li>
