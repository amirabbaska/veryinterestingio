			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats called fluorescence.</p>
<p>The UV light hits something and the object gives off light (a glow) thats at a longer wavelength/lower energy and thus is a different color.</p>
<p>A UV light wave is 380–450 nm long and at 668–789 THz </p>
<p>So all visible light to human eyes is longer and lower frequency/energy</p>
<p>You shine UV at something that glows green-yellow - that glow is somewhere in the 495-590 nm range</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't actually explain why the thing glows. </p>
<p>Most people know that when light hits an object, some colors/lengths are absorbed and the rest are reflected.  We see the reflected colors. </p>
<p>When you shine UV light at a fluorescent object, that rudimentary understanding would seem to imply that the green/yellow was present in the UV light, but it's not present in any significant quantities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're seeing isn't reflected light. Some objects will actually absorb light and then re-emit it rather than just reflect it. Since some energy is lost in this process the emitted light is a longer wavelength than the original. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used “glow” generically, the why things glow is material dependent - why a rock glows from UV is different than why a black light poster glows from UV</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your white clothing is probably washed with washing powder that can release white light to make your clothes look &quot;whiter than white&quot;. When light energy (in this case from a black light) hits your washing powdered white fabric, it excites the electrons to jump into the next level which releases white light. That makes it seem like your light coloured clothing is &quot;glowing&quot; when you go clubbing under black lights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;Stokes shift&quot; is the grown-up name for this phenomenon. Some things will absorb light and then re-radiate it at a lower wavelength. This is most dramatic when say a black light poster absorbs UV and re-radiates it in visable colors. But it's very important commercially. Fluorescent tubes naturally emit mostly UV, but phosphors shift the UV to green and orange (which we perceive as white). &quot;White&quot; LEDs are mainly blue, with phosphors to shift some of the blue to yellow so we see them as white. </p></div>		</li>
