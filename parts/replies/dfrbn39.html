			<div class="markdown"><p>What is contemporaneously referred to as 3rd world today, certainly suffered from their lack of association with major world powers. The 1st and 2nd world traded among themselves bolstering their own economies. So it is part of the reason why what everyone thinks of as 3rd world exists. They had been isolated for a while with limited economic opportunities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really refers to industrial development - First world being modernised industrial <em>market</em> economies devoted to free-trade (the U.S, the E.U, Commonwealth countries), Second world being modern industrialised nations that follow the centrally-planned Soviet model, and Third World meaning countries that hadn't yet become fully industrial or modernised yet, in other words 'developing' countries  who weren't certain to go one way or the other. As such the status of Third World countries who were in the process of modernisation became focal points during the Cold War, eg. Vietnam (also see 'Domino Effect').</p></div>		</li>
