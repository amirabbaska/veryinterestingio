			<div class="markdown"><p>Auxins also work to enable gravitropism, which is plants growing towards (positive gravitropism) or away from (negative gravitropism) the force of gravity.</p>
<p>Auxins are positively gravitropic, which means they go &quot;down&quot;. Roots respond to auxin the opposite way <del>shit</del> shoot cells do, growing slower with auxin. This means that a <del>rut</del> root lying horizontally will have the lower part of the root grow more slowly, while the top part of the root grows at full speed. This naturally bends the root down slowly over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for weeping cultivars of trees like cherry and beech, is there a mutation with that auxin mechanism that affects its growth habit? Or does the weeping form come about from structural differences like a lack of lignin in young growth or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interestibng question, so I searched around a bit, found this: <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.13204" target="_blank">https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.13204</a></p>
<p>if you search for 'weeping', 7th hit. it's not the same for each species that has weeping forms, from scanning it, seems like most often it's something making the branches limp, or keeping them limp longer before they become more woody. but it says something about japanese morning glory having weeping forms that have some error with gravitropism, but I haven't found yet where the error is, if it doesn't sense gravity(aboveground) or just doesn't react to it.</p>
<p>edit: seems like it's an error in sensing in case of that japanese morning glory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So phototropism is what OP was asking about and what you're asking about is called heliotropism. Heliotropic flowers, for instance, have motor cells just below the flower on the stem that allow it to follow the sun during the day. This happens because the motor cells that are shadowed will elongate. That's just one example of how heliotropism works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, in Sunflowers, it's achieved through differential growth on different sides of the plant! Even auxins are involved there. Young plants (which are growing fast) track the sun that way, while mature plants sit still, facing the east.</p>
<p>See this 2016 Science paper describing the discovery: <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/587" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/587</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, very interesting. I bought a prayer plant recently that was tucked away in a greenhouse. The spot was so low-light that it was lying almost on its side. It made me curious to know how it knew to reach for that 1 percent out there. Now I know! </p></div>		</li>
