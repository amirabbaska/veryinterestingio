			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how you make a sound proof chamber.  Most are double walled with an air gap between them will keep sound from transferring from one to the other.  Ideally the walls are heavy and super stiff so they don't act like drum heads and transfer the sound.  Every layer you add absorbs more sound, if you want to get to crazy levels you can do triple or quadruple walled chambers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, most will have insulation like rock wool or fiberglass pink insulation in between them, as well as having sound deadening wall coverings.  Source: recently helped to install a sound studio.</p></div>		</li>
