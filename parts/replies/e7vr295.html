<p>Neutrinos from product decay  </p>

<p>Which cannot be stopped not even readily observed.  They pass through normal matter, the entire Earth, with almost zero chance of interacting and causing a hypothetically observable effect.  It's &quot;ghost particles&quot;.</p>
<p>Yep, like 5% of the energy just ghosts.</p>
<p>But don't worry, trillions of particles of solar neutrinos are going through you every second anyhow.  Ghost particles.  They can't harm you nor be seen nor felt nor even measured.  We had to build some spectacular science megastructures just to see one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In supernovae, about 98% of the energy released is in the form of neutrinos. (Indeed this is not unexpected -- you can only get such rapid core collapse if there is a means of quickly conveying energy outside the star -- and neutrinos are able to do this quite well).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know neutrinos are verging on impossible to detect but can we detect the rise in neutrinos passing us when a supernova happens? Did I read somewhere that they reach us shortly before the light does so we get a bit of a warning to look for it? Or am I making that up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually &quot;ghost particles&quot; is used for much more &quot;abstract&quot; particles that pop up in various contexts in quantum field theory to make something work but are subtracted away or do not interact with anything else, just arguably make the math easier (I guess there's some philosophical wrangling one can do here). But in this sense, neutrinos are not ghost particles - they do interact through the weak nuclear force (and not it seems they do have some tiny mass, gravitationally), so we can detect them. It's just difficult and requires good detectors and waiting for one to actually interact with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so most of the energy of a nuclear reaction is actually atoms flying apart like a subatomic explosion after they split?</p>
<p>I always assumed it was mainly radiation and they required huge amounts of moderator/shielding to block the radiation and turn it into heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclei flying apart at high speed <em>is</em> radiation. The parent comment is talking about a specific kind of nuclear reaction where something with high Z undergoes induced fission.</p>
<p>In any exothermic reaction, the energy released is due to the change in binding energy between the reactants and the products.</p>
<p>In the kind of reaction mentioned above, there is a very large repulsive contribution to the binding energy of the heavy nucleus in the initial state. The classical way to intuit this is that you have two positively charged things extremely close to each other. As they move apart, their potential energy becomes kinetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the repulsion of the nuclear forces contribute much? I can't remember it's magnitude in relation to electromagnetism at the distances at which it becomes repulsive.</p>
<p>I may have missed it, I don't think you touched on the release of subatomic particles due to de-excitation of decay products. That's not &quot;original energy&quot; but still an important part of the lifecycle of the energy.</p></div>		</li>
