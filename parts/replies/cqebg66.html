			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that only make sense if the Earth's internal heat output varied cyclically over time? However, according to <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Evolution_of_Earth%27s_radiogenic_heat.jpg" target="_blank">this graph</a>, heat output has decayed exponentially. Perhaps there are small variations from this trend, but note that this heat is only 0.03% of all heat at the Earth's surface, the majority being solar heat. So basically this doesn't make much sense.</p></div>		</li>
