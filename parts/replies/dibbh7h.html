			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that one of the things that free trade agreements seemingly ignore is worker conditions. In the US, there are a lot of laws that guarantee workers' rights, from OSHA regulations to labor relations regulations. Many workers in less affluent countries do not have the same guarantees. So in addition to those workers being cheaper because they're willing to work for less, the company also has fewer costs because they're not required to provide health insurance or lunch hours or safe work environments.</p>
<p>I would personally argue that this is the biggest problem with free trade agreements; when purchasing labor, you're not purchasing the same thing, and, in my mind, that makes the trade agreement asymmetric. </p>
<p>That said, I'm not an economist and I'm willing to have my view changed.</p>
<p>Edit: The TPP's <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_Agreement/Chapter_19" target="_blank">Chapter 19</a> is specifically about labor rights.  To me, it feels very weak.  It requires that the signatory countries not have child labor or slave labor, and that labor unions and collective bargaining be respected.  None of the parts of this feel worded strongly enough to me.  For example, it doesn't define what a child is, or what constitutes compulsory labor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership did have some provisions about worker rights. I remember Obama was selling it on this. For example: <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/TPP-Final-Text-Labour-US-MY-Labour-Consistency-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">this agreement signed by Maylasia</a> seems to protect trade unions from having their registrations arbitrarily cancelled and seems to prevent an anti-public-disorder law from prohibiting union activities.</p>
<p>But I'm not a labour attorney and I can't really evaluate what effect this specific agreement would have on labour conditions, much less evaluate the agreement as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's another point.</p>
<p>Decades ago, trade deals usually dealt with tariffs and quotas, with simply allowing goods to be sold in other markets at all. today, those play a much smaller role, and so trade negotiators have instead begun focusing on creating uniform standards and regulation, forcing the trading countries to place the same requirements on goods.</p>
<p>Sometimes that requires one country to raise their standards and impose stricter quality checks (for example, China has been forced to make better stuff in order to be allowed to export to America and Europe). Other times, it requires a country to drop their standards and allow goods that were not previously allowed or considered safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Another problem is that these &quot;modern&quot; trade agreements have tended to have some dubious provisions in them allowing huge corporations to sue countries if they introduce laws that make it harder for the corporation to sell their goods. For example, some countries have been sued by big tobacco corporations because they introduced laws to discourage smoking. Others have been sued for blocking mining companies from creating new, environmentally harmful, mines in populated areas. The EU has dropped bans of certain harmful pesticides in anticipation of TTIP, because such a ban would risk a lawsuit if the trade deal was ratified.</p>

<p>This.... who in their fucking mind would come up with this? Oh yeah, the corporations who control the dickheads who pretend to defend our interests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it was countries who came up with this. Countries with rather ... untrustworthy courts where companies didn't want to invest due to fear of expropriation. So the countries proposed indepedant courts outside of the control of the country.</p></div>		</li>
