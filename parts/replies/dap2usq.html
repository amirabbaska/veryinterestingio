			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on the responses from the other posters, 1% is actually &quot;nice house, nice portfolio, can travel via jet regularly&quot;, not &quot;mansion, don't have to work, private jet.&quot; $300k/year is a lot, but it's not &quot;private jet&quot; a lot. </p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/49807529" target="_blank">see this for context</a>). </p>
<p>If we determine the 1% by net worth, it's a net worth of about 8 million that's the cut-off in the US. That is <em>much</em> closer to &quot;private jet, don't have to work&quot; amount, and I'm guessing is what most people mean when they talk about the 1%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>$8 million is nowhere close to private jet. You could definitely not work depending on your expenses. You could safely withdraw $320k a year inflation adjusted from $8MM for at least 30 years of its invested 80/20 in the market. Its actually very likely that you could do this perpetually but the Trinity study was for periods of 30 years and there were cases of failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it refers more generally to the top 1% of high net-worth individuals, more so than income. Wealth is capital, not income rate. When you hear about how the top 1% has more than the bottom 90% in the US, that's talking about the accumulation of ownership of wealth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1% is one in a hundred. Over 3 million people in the US. And surely this many people aren't extremely wealthy (or maybe I'm wrong). Shouldn't it be something like 0.1% or even less?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, it's more of a colloquialism now. It doesn't literally refer to the top 1% of earners, just the super-wealthy.</p></div>		</li>
