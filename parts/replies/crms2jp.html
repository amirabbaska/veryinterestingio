			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, this is pretty much it. I'm on a Solar team expected to place well in this year's WSC, and for us to be expected to do well our car needs to be so small that most people wouldn't fit in it at all, and it requires serious strategy to not run out of charge in just a day or so.</p></div>		</li>
