			<div class="markdown"><p>If done in a controlled way, this sort of fermentation or curing is perfectly safe, and a legitimate way of preserving food. It wouldn't be a cultural food if it was unsafe, it would just be some experiment conducted by a peasant 1500 years ago that left them shitting their guts into the gutter. </p>
<p>Now is that food palatable? That's a bigger question that has to be answered on a case-by-case basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having tried kæstur hàkarl a few years back, I thought I could handle any food. Until I tried andouille a few days ago. If you imagine what a cow's anus might taste like, that's andouille. Mainly because it's made of cow anus.</p></div>		</li>
