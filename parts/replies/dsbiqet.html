			<div class="markdown"><p>It does make heads hurt. But the thing is, we don't know what the shape of the universe or if there is an edge. If there is an edge, that implies there is something outside of the universe and while we have ideas about that (like m-brane string theory stuff), we really don't know anything about it. There is a limit to how far we can see back in time, like a sphere of visible light and that's where our age estimations stop. It might be that the universe is somehow infinite and without shape. Maybe it's like a Möbius strip. Maybe it's some higher dimensional thing we can't comprehend. Maybe it's actually just a one dimensional point but is holographic in nature and gives the illusion of space. Maybe it's just a computer program. We don't know. What we do know is that everything is moving away from us and the speed of that retreat is accelerating. I guess a good way to visualize that is that we're like a single point on a balloon that's being inflated. All points around us are accelerating away from us. It's a wild thing to think about. Definitely hurts my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you’re a dot on a kids balloon that’s being blown up.  You’d say the surface area is about one square foot.  From another sense, it’s infinite (you can keep walking forever in any straight line). You could also say it’s getting bigger. And every other dot on the balloon is moving away from you and weirdly the farther away they are from you the faster they’re moving. And you could calculate back and say when it started being blown up and was zero square feet.  And it’s expanding not in 2d space, but into 3d space. Woaaaaah.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they disproved that <del>this year</del>. Source coming soon</p>
<p>Edit: source, I couldn't find a source for the date of the discovery.
Basically they used light and found out that there is light that is super cold, and really stretched out, and they could pinpoint places in the universe that it was a little bit warmer, and the specific way this happened matched a flat universe model.  they also noted that their telescopes could only see with so much detail and so it could still be possible for the universe to have an incredibly small curve that looked flat.
