<p>I still don't understand what is a &quot;linear scale&quot; of measurement.&quot;  Would you explain? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between one nanometer (=10^-9 m) and one meter is almost 1m (1m - 0,000000001m to be exact),
whereas the difference between 1m and 1000m is 999m.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, both differences are represented by a distance exactly equal to the difference, hence making 1000m about 999 times farther away from 1m than 1nm.</p>
<p>On logarithmic scales, you basically represent the difference by the number of decimal places you have to go from one to the other, so 1nm is actually 9 units away from 1m and 1000m is 3 units away from 1m.
Therefore, on these scales 1nm is 3 times more distant from 1m than 1000m.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for pointing this out!
I actually meant a &quot;unit&quot; to be a &quot;unit in the scale we are talking about&quot; which is, as many pointed out already, simply one order of magnitude. Sorry to be late for clarification, but I only just now came back from work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent explanation of log scales. My only minor gripe is that you're referring to orders of magnitude as &quot;units&quot; :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for explaining this. Didn't really get it. Just one question. What exactly does a logarithmic scale tell us i.e. what significance does it have over saying 1km is 1000 times more than 1m?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it just me or does this explanation seem unnecessarily complicated?  Even if one knew nothing about logarithmic scales, the natural interpretation to the OP's question would be in terms of a percentage or ratio.  It's intuitive that one would not answer this question with linear scale values.  But that doesn't mean that log values are required. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a logarithmic scale, 10 is half way between 1 and 100. Think of this as counting the number of zeroes.</p>
<p>On an linear scale, the mid point of 1 and 100 is about 50. This is just the difference between two numbers.</p>
<p>Log scales are very useful when comparing things of different magnitudes, like <a href="http://peer.tamu.edu/curriculum_modules/Cell_Biology/images/ScaleofNature.jpg" target="_blank">in this image</a>.</p>
<p>Linear scales are useful when comparing things of a similar magnitude, like <a href="http://www.anychart.com/products/anychart/docs/users-guide/img/Samples/sample-scatter-graph-charts.png" target="_blank">in this image</a>, because you can easily read off the exact value from the graph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this and thought it doesn't make any sense, then I saw your tag and decided I should ask you to clarify before I dismiss it out of hand.</p>
<p>It seems to me that I could choose three spheres A, B, C, with radii r_A &gt; r_B &gt; r_C such that log(r_B) is closer to log(r_A), and log(r_B ^3 ) is closer to log(r_C ^3 ).</p>
<p>Maybe you meant volume and mass; for most solid objects these are linearly proportional.</p>
<p>EDIT: ITT: I'm dumb and annoying about it.</p>
<p>Please explain what you meant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>log <em>x</em>^3 = 3 log <em>x</em></p>
<p>So if the logarithmic distance between <em>r</em>_A and <em>r</em>_B is </p>
<p>log <em>r</em>_A – log <em>r</em>_B = <em>L</em>, </p>
<p>then the logarithmic distance between their cubes will be</p>
<p>log <em>r</em>_A^3 – log <em>r</em>_B^3 = 3 log <em>r</em>_A – 3 log <em>r</em>_B = 3 <em>L</em> </p>
<p>So if B is closer to A in the linear log-scale, it should also be closer to A in the cubic log-scale, because in the latter, all the distances are just scaled up by a factor of 3. No log-distances change relative to any other.</p>
<p>Things are different when the objects you measure have very different physical shapes though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Note humans don't really have a radius, but I'm going to use 1m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This honestly made me laugh.</p>
<p>Your calculations make sense to me intuitively though. Atoms are some of the smallest things in the universe, while the Earth really isn't very large in the grand scheme of things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to think of it is: How many atoms does it take to  make a fully grown adult human VS how many humans would you need to make a planet similar to the Earth.</p>
<p>I don't have the data, but I'm still leaning towards more atoms to make humans.  If Earth was <del>Saturn</del> Neptune sized, I estimate it'd be a closer match-up.</p>
<p>Edit: Did some minimal research  </p>
<p><a href="http://education.jlab.org/qa/mathatom_04.html" target="_blank">Human atoms</a></p>
<p>And comparative mass of humans vs Earth.<br />
Human @ 100kg vs Earth @ 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg.<br />
(1x10^2) vs (6x10^24)<br />
In theory, you'd need 6x10^22 to make a planet with the same MASS as Earth out of humans. (unless I'm mistaken, I'm just roughing up numbers for ease of understanding, not actually doing the math)</p>
<p>Since you need 1x10^27 atoms to make a human, and 6x10^22 humans to make a Earth, the answer is: we're significantly closer in mass to Earth.</p>
<p>Correct me if I completely messed up my numbers please.</p></div>		</li>
