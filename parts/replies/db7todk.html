			<div class="markdown"><p>Even Oxygen is very reactive. It would not exist on earth except that plants like to make it as a byproduct of photosynthesis. Before plants, there was no free oxygen in earth's atmosphere (I think).</p>
<p>So your Chlorine Trifluoride planet needs something that makes Chlorine Trifluoride faster than it reacts with everything. And probably animals living on that planet would exploit how reactive CF3 is in the same way that animals need oxygen to make biochemistry happen efficiently. Those aliens would probably breathe CF3. And they'd be surprised when we landed and all our stuff started on fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC there can be between 1 to 3% free O2 in the atmosphere without plants just from water molecules being broken by lightning and cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Basically the stuff that naturally makes the O3 we see today can also make O2 on a planet without life.</p>
<p>But if its a ferrous rocky planet that gets bonded out into the iron fairly quickly so you only end up with a very marginal amount of free O2 (1-3%).  And that only works if there is water in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There had to be some.  All amino acids have oxygen and most nucleobases have them as well.  Hydrogen binding between O, H and N are what stabilizes Human DNA.  Though I don't know if that is true for Primordial Bacteria and Viruses but I would guess that is also the case.  Perhaps you were thinking of Ancient Earth as a Reductive environment vs. a Oxidative environment.</p>
<p>Edit:  Realized I am totally overlooking the fact Water has O in it.  Still begs the question of how does that water form I guess.  Anyways very little O2 if any at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ClF3 is so bad, the nazis thought it too dangerous to use on the battlefield.</p>
<ul>
<li>burns pretty much anything it comes into contact with, even water</li>
<li>releases hydrofluoric acid when in contact with water</li>
<li>there was once an accident with ClF3 where 1 ton of it spilled and ate throuh a foot of concrete and 3 feet of gravel</li>
<li>it can be stored in a steel container if the inside has a fluorine coating and is dry</li>
<li>it burns asbestos</li>
</ul>
<p>It really fucks yer shit up</p>
<p>Edit: i think there is no such creature (at least on earth)</p>
<p>Edit2: ClF3 not CF3</p>
<p>Edit3: I merely watched a video a few days ago about this subject ad thought I'd reply what I'd learned from that clip. I am not knowledgeable about ClF3</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I normally say that anything is possible, but not on this case. As far as our knowledge goes, oxidation and flourination would still occur no matter where you are. Unless we are talking about other universes or perhaps helium based creatures, this is off the charts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not on Earth. ClF3 will react with just about any substance on this planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the actual book is very rare, and well known. There probably would be someone out there that would pay thousands for a paper copy. </p>
<p>There is also the way some Amazon merchants set prices on rare products. They set the system up to make it a little more expensive than anyone else that has it. If two people use the same setting, the price just scrolls up to some random limit.</p></div>		</li>
