<p>AFAICT, it's partly related to the mechanism I mentioned that weakens gluten in baked goods. Firstly, during marination, the raised pH helps to denature the meat proteins - they uncoil and become looser, allowing the meat to absorb more water. Then, as the meat cooks, the proteins normally join together (coagulate) and shrink to cause meat to become firmer and toughen as it cooks, also squeezing out the water - but the raised pH interferes with the coagulation, so the protein strands stay more separate, and aren't as able to link up to form a solid mesh, or squeeze out water when they shrink.</p>
<p>This struck me as odd, as I was under the impression that <em>acids</em> tenderize meat, through just this process. But it turns out that protein can be denatured by both alkalis and acids, and alkalis might be better for interfering with coagulation during cooking.</p>
<p>Now I have a new thing to try when cooking. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
