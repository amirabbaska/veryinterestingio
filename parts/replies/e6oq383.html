			<div class="markdown"><p>Strong selective breeding can certainly cause quick changes, but that isn't what is happening humans, at least as far as sex goes.  Most (all?) primates don't have mating seasons either.  That strongly indicates that if we were ever seasonal, it is from an extremely ancient common ancestor that all primates share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with our sociability and the survival stability that comes from it. By staying in close-nit, permanent familial groups we guarantee each other's success, which has allowed us to dynamically adapt to a variety of environments instead of adapting to the patterns of one environment in particular. As a result, breeding did not benefit from a seasonal cycle, but rather a cycle that was available year round.</p>
<p>Also, human females aren't fertile year-round against all odds. All females will stop ovulating if they drop below a certain weight index, preventing them from getting pregnant during times with a circumstantial lack of nutrients. This caused us to adapt to being fertile whenever we have an abundance of food, which could be at any point in time for ape ancestors living in all different parts of the world. </p></div>		</li>
