			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed! Jasmonic acid is the primary hormone for being munched on. Abscisic acid is the primary hormone for infections and internal parasites (and also fruit ripening, bud growth, and many other things). And there are many secondary signals that modulate the specific type of damage and specific responses required!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That reminds me of anti-nutrients. Since plants can't run away, they make digestion harder. I think it's kind of interesting how peppers probably have capsaicin so small mammals wouldn't eat them and only birds would, but we eat them anyways. </p>
