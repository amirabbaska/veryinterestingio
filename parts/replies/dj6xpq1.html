			<div class="markdown"><p>I was confused by some of these answers as well. I always considered second wind being when you stay awake for an extended period of time and feel more awake and alert than you should. For example I work nights and usually go to bed around 7am and fall asleep in about 10 minutes. There has been a few days I'll have extra things to take care of after work that will keep me up until nearly noon. When I do try to go to sleep I feel too awake and it takes me 45min to an hour to fall asleep even though I was awake an extra 5 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck psychedelics, just stay up for like 96 hours and you will definitely see smirfs, but only breifly in the peripherals  your vision lol. You're almost there! Don't worry, the body doesn't start to completely shut down/risk death until about 192-240 hors without sleep. You'll just needa 12 hour nap sometime soon!</p></div>		</li>
