			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, theres a lot of autonomic processes working when being chased by a tiger. The body will selectively increase and decrease mucus secretions in certain areas, itll shut off insulin secretion (since you dont want to be storing glucose and instead using it for energy), open up the airways, selectively constrict and relax blood vessels to push the blood to where its needed (skeletal muscle, the lungs, etc). Theres a lot of tiny automatic processes that we dont think of that the nervous system does. Its very amazing.</p></div>		</li>
