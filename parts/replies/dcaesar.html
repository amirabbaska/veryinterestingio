			<div class="markdown"><p>That tells them they have a good show, but how do they know it's economically feasible for them to run it when they don't have advertising dollars to gauge value?</p>
<p>Westworld cost HBO $100 million to produce.  I would assume they believe they will make more than $100 million on the show, but how do they know that?  How do they know that a subscriber joined HBO to watch that show, and wouldn't have joined otherwise?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix has a anytime cancel policy. If netflix makes a good show, they are not just bringing customers, but they are also trying to keep them there. </p>
<p>To gauge how much a show worth is by measuring the viewing activity on that particular show. If a show is released in say February, and got picked up a lot of viewers by April, you will see lots of new users viewing them as well. </p>
<p>To answer your question about finance, well again I would go back to keeping customers with netflix/hbo. They make money in long term by measuring how many customers are still with them just because of that show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work with Netflix's policy of releasing all episodes for a season simultaneously?  That allows someone to subscribe, binge watch the show for a week, then cancel.  Why not drag it out for a few months to get more subscription fees?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't read this as total gospel, but it is based off a similar conversation I had with a former HBO employee.</p>
<p>One way you can look at it is utilizing the budget for original content they already have in place, as opposed to necessarily trying to profit directly from a specific show. So they have their overhead of $x millions to pay salaries, etc, they have the licensing fees of $x millions for other studio movies/shows they acquire, then you have their original content budget. HBO is an on-going fee for viewers, not a one-off and not free, so they care just as much about retention as they do new subscribers. So obviously they want as many new people to sign up as possible, but you also have to make sure people stay. And quality programming does that, in theory.</p>
<p>The other thing about HBO, and I'm assuming Netflix, even AMC, is they are run by people who actually WANT quality shows. They aren't catering to the most encompassing entertainment all the time because they don't have to. And they are somewhat notoriously known to pay fairly low rates for actors, directors, etc BUT the creatives love that because they get way more freedom than on other networks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There absolutely is some metric they use to quantify whether that is money well spent.  The &quot;this part of thebudget will be used to hopefully retain users&quot; conversation doesn't happen without a good idea of how much of the budget and what they expect to see from it. </p>
<p>Otherwise we'd have 9 seasons of John from Cincinnati.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other than that you simply have to go with your gut feeling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean you can use data analysis to figure out how many people watch a show, how many of them resubscribe each month, and many many more business metrics, and through that you can figure out whether a show is worth renewing. It's complicated as fuck and I don't know close to all about it, but business intelligence can give you a fuckton of insight in to your business, making sure you don't have to rely on gut feeling.</p>
<p>The problem is a bit wrongly phrased, OP says they have &quot;no way to gauge how much money they earn as a result of each show&quot;, which I'd dare say is not the case.</p>
<p>That said it's also a matter of their business model, basically Netflix and HBO can't let people run out of stuff to watch, because then they'll unsubscribe, therefore they have to produce new shows on a fairly regular basis. That's why especially someone like Netflix has quite a lot of shit stuff as well, like the Adam Sandler movies they did. It's just matter of giving people if nothing else then a sense of neverending tv shows and movies to watch.</p></div>		</li>
