			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving air carries a lot of debris in it, mostly tiny soil particles, the dust then settles out of the air a little like rain. If you have ever looked at a torch light or the light from a projector in a dark room you will see lots of the particles floating in the air.</p></div>		</li>

Lot's of dust particles are in our attic. The attic itself is of course wooden and i guess thats also factor which enhances the &quot;production&quot; of dust.</p></div>		</li>
