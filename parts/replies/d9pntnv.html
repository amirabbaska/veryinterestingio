			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, I used to work on a golf course. One of my jobs was watering the course, which involved pressurizing the system at the source. That main pipe was like 8&quot; thick. That's 4000 times the maximal flow of household plumbing. I'll never forget the sensation you got as you manually cranked that thing open. It was like slowly releasing an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand that cross-sectional area is radius^2, but where is the other squaring coming from?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also &quot;jet flush&quot; style direct flush toilets, which use a smaller output right at the &quot;exit&quot; to push the waste/water down the pipe...  They work alright if you live in an area with decent water pressure.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes way beyond that. Public toilets are subject to the public, which means they are subject to destruction. Tanks are an easy target for a stomp to flood a bathroom and run. Source: years of working in bars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the application. If it's an office building, the owners probably aren't worried enough about vandalism to shell out all the extra money to route larger pipes to a bathroom. If it's a bar, it might be worth it. Also, the tankless toilets are easier to clean. Source: HVAC/Plumbing design engineer who should be working right now. </p></div>		</li>
