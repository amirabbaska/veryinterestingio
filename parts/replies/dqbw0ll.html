			<div class="markdown"><p>Children’s immune systems aren’t better than adults, surely? Perhaps the elderly, but wouldn’t a fully developed adult have a better chance of fighting off diseases than a baby? Maybe I’m wrong on that, but I agree that a baby’s bone will heal quicker because they are developing and more of their energy goes to growing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't put money down that a baby's immune system is better than a full grown adult. The only source of immune defense a newborn has is its innate immunity and the antibodies acquired from the mother in the womb. Upon birth, the baby is exposed to microorganisms that will soon colonize their otherwise minimal microbiome (of the gut particularly), as well as skin flora, and even pathogens (both viral and bacterial). As far as the broken bone scenario, I'd say that a baby's immune system doesn't directly influence their recovery time in the case of a broken bone. But fun fact, bone marrow is the source of many of the precursor cells that eventually make up our immune system!</p></div>		</li>
