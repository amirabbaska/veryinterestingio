			<div class="markdown"><p>When Jimmy Carter was president he had solar panels on the roof of the White House. When Reagan was elected he took them off. Do you think we would have been farther ahead if we had governmental support from 1980, or would we still be here based on the rest of the technological advances in other areas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jimmy Carter actually put solar thermal panels (essentially water heaters) on the White House, not photovoltaic panels (that produce electricity). Reagan did take them down and Obama put photovoltaic panels up. Ironically, one of Jimmy Carter's panels is now in a museum in China. See the Nova video &quot;Power Surge&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That tells you all you need to know about the 2 political parties.  Hasn't changed since either of those 2 presidents.</p>
<p>Republicans can't fight simple economics though.  They can promise to open the flood gates on open pit coal mining and throw up all sorts of road blocks to renewables but simple economics will win and they will lose.  </p>
<p>I don't think anyone is building new coal plants in the US.  Old ones are being shut down because they are not worth upgrading and it's cheaper to use nat gas or renewables.  So Repubs can claim to be a friend of coal all they want.  If there is no market for it then it won't matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubtful as a big hurdle for a long time was storing the electricity.  Batteries are just now catching up(I had a friend whose family has been using solar power since the 90s, they couldn't store that power efficiently until rather recently).  On top of that the government does(and has) support battery tech, so technically they were supporting solar power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, by the way, do we really need the AC inside of our homes that much? Almost every appliance I can think of are working on a DC inside, including LED light, so it's a triple conversion at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a good point as well. If I were building an off grid cabin I would move towards DC in the house. There are DC only LED can lights that avoid the conversion from 120V 60hz AC to 24V DC. There are 24V to 5V USB outlet unit available. There are 12V refridgerator/freezers that work very well, albeit expensive because they are specialty. Most other devices could be powered direct from 24V since they do that type of conversion from AC already.</p>
<p>The big issue is heating and cooling. Both are energy intensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use AC because DC is limited for long range transmission. to carry power over long distances we need to use very high voltages. However, these voltages aren't very practical for use around the house. AC is easier to step up and down, so it's used for the US grid. </p></div>		</li>
