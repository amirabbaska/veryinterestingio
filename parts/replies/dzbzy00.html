			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because your short term working memory depends on your long term memory. </p>
<p>When you remember something, you are temporarily &quot;taking&quot; something from your long term memory and &quot;working with it&quot;, thinking about it, which is your short-term frontal lobe dependent memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why our long term memories can change over time - each time we recall a memory and “take” it from LTM to “work” with it in Short term working memory, we can slightly “alter” it. Over time this can result in a “memory” that is actually largely different from the true original situation. </p>
<p>Short term memory can, in a sense, change the LTM but they remain in agreement.
Human memory is incredibly complex and even more fascinating.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you mean by recalled differently. In the wikipedia article I liked, it describes one &quot;distraction&quot; experiment to test the different between A. recalling something that was just shown to the subject, vs B. recalling the same that was given some time to form &quot;long-term&quot; memory. They noticed that distracting the subject in situation A impairs their ability to recall more than in situation B. That is a simple example and demonstrate the principle to set up experiments to test if there is a difference between long and short term memory.</p>
<p>We also know of people with amnesia. Some can't remember anything from the past but they their short-term memory works just fine. We also know of people who can't form any new long term memories. So they recall what they already know but they can't never remember anything new. Their memory span is like 30 second and anything prior to that is forgotten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. We just don't have a full understanding on how it transfers one to the other. </p></div>		</li>
