			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reason why.. is because they used to let em die at sea or in the stores and would start decaying immediately and taste awful. </p>
<p>Its only when they learned to keep them alive and kill them moments before cooking that they tasted good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dirt-cheap because they were so copious, lobsters were routinely fed to prisoners, apprentices, slaves and children during the colonial era and beyond. In Massachusetts, some servants allegedly sought to avoid lobster-heavy diets by including stipulations in their contracts that they would only be served the shellfish twice a week.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it was peasant food for ages. The thing is, more than many other fish, it doesn't keep well after it's died. But, as we learned to keep them alive until just before cooking, they became exotic, and the extra care was very expensive if you weren't going to eat it within sight of the pier. Exotic + expensive is pretty much 90% of the reason most &quot;high class&quot; foods are considered such, and so it quickly 180'd in perception. Good lobster, especially inland, meant you had cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Emphasis heavily on the <em>allegedly</em> there; it's actually a complete myth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's one indignity that didn't befall the undervalued lobster: 'One of the most persistent and oft repeated food myths', wrote food historian Kathleen Curtin, is 'about laws being enacted to protect prisoners/servants from eating lobster more than three times a week - it never happened. [There is] not a shred of documentation'.</p>
