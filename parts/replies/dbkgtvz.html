			<div class="markdown"><p>The virus becomes optimized to interact with chicken proteins.  Things like the receptors on the cell surface, the proteins that take the virus inside, those that replicate the genome - every step in viral replication and transmission depends on proteins from the host, and if the virus is good at interacting with chicken proteins, it's not as good at interacting with human proteins, so it's less effective as a virus in humans.  </p>
<p>It's not a simple or guaranteed process. There are some viruses (though not many) that can replicate in many different species, and of course those wouldn't be good candidates for this sort of attenuation.  It's possible for viruses to adapt to a new host with just a few mutations, and those are not good candidates for this either, because they could quickly revert back to virulence; by comparison, the MVA attenuated virus has <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682298991231" target="_blank">mutations in at least 25 different genes</a>, so it's very unlikely to mutate back to virulence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adaptation itself isn't done on a large scale.  It's done with small amounts of virus over a long period.  Once the virus is adapted to eggs (say), then you grow up that virus and set aside stocks of it that are tested and validated and so on.  It's those stocks that are then used to infect huge numbers of eggs on an industrial scale to make the actual vaccine.  </p></div>		</li>
