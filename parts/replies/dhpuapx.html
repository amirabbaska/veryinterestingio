			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there's one other detail you forgot to mention, which is that horses also cannot afford to lie down for prolonged periods of time as it messes up their internal organs. </p>
<p>This is problematic as not only will having them support themselves on 3 legs cause damage to their intact legs, but you can't lie them down either or you get pressure sores, fluids accumulating in their lungs, etc.</p>
<p>To allow a horse to heal from a leg injury you pretty much need to keep it supported by a sling with a crane in a swimming pool (so that it's suspended in the water, without too much weight on the torso), which is insanely expensive and usually very distressing to the horse. It's pretty much never done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their bones are huge, and the hardware to fix them has to be specially made, the hardware for humans doesn't fit their bones. </p>
<p>Bones are harder than the surgical implants used for bony fixation. Horses are not known for their compliance with weight bearing restrictions, which could cause the hardware to break and compromise the reduction. </p>
<p>I have personally been involved with the amputation on a horses leg with immediate placement on a prosthetic, so I know that is an option.  I did not follow the animal after the surgery, so I can't comment on the ultimate success of the procedure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember reading that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruffian_\(horse\)" target="_blank">Ruffian</a> thrashed around so wildly as she was coming out of anesthesia that she broke additional bones, which was a major factor in the decision to euthanize her, although I believe procedures to protect them during that stage have improved a lot since the 70s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have wondered that too, what about horses in the wild (I understand wild horses are feral horses).  Still, such as other related animals, they step on something, break a leg, and that's it for them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses were on their way out as a species because their main food source (grass) had evolved to have a lot more silica in it.  Their teeth were loosing the battle to keep up with eating enough to live.  Then early humans found them and domesticated them, keeping them alive by feeding them other food.</p>
<p>So they might not be here unless we had domesticated them.</p>
<p>Of course they have also been selectively bred so like our dogs we might have given them a lot of extra problems on top of the teeth thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a swimming pool for our horses and they love the water therapy. One broke his coffin bone and we gave him the water therapy for several months to allow it to heal. Unfortunately he broke the bone 2 more times and we just retired him after that (he was a racehorse). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also forgot that the when repair of the bone is possible, the horse will need to be kept in a stall to limit their movement. Not all owners have this option and even when they do, long term confinement can lead to the development of &quot;boredom behaviours&quot; that the horses will use to alleviate their boredom - these can cause further injury, gastric ulcers, and life long bad habits that generally contribute to an overall lower quality of life for the horse.
In essence, without a lot of time and money, it's simply kinder to let the horse go to sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that you rarely see clean breaks. Horses' bones (especially the lower leg) will often deform before they break, like hard plastic. Or they just shatter. When this happens, it's not simply a matter of setting the bone and keeping the weight off it while it heals--the fragments are warped such that it is impossible to put the bone back together in its original structure.</p>
