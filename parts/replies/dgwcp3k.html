			<div class="markdown"><p>Ligaments are connective tissue connecting bones to bone, and tendons connect muscle to bone. You sprain a ligament, strain a muscle. Straining a muscle involves tearing the elastic fibers, similar to what's written above. Just specifying a little! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We try to remember it this way: strain has a t in it, so that means tendon (and muscle). Sprain doesn't have a t in it, so it must be the other thing, aka ligament. It's not perfect, but it somehow served me well for exams. </p></div>		</li>
