			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that no natural &quot;cycle&quot; occurs when taking hormonal birth control pills. The cycle completely stops and therefor there is no point at which hormones would not be required to prevent ovulation. I thought any break in the hormone level (that is being supplied by the pills) would start up the natural cycle process and begin to release the hormones that would result in ovulation 2 weeks later? Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, you are wrong. Placebo pills do not cause ovulation - if they did, there would be a lot of disappointed people around the world.</p>
<p>After taking 21 consecutive pills, you will not ovulate during the placebo week. The pills prevent ovulation. Take less than 21 pills, and there's no guarantee.</p>
<p>Of course, the placebo week is not needed, but it's included as an option. Some of my pill brands have not included them at all, but simply given the option to not take any pills for 7 days.  </p>
<p>POP, also known as the minipill, has to be taken every day and there is no break. It also doesn't always prevent ovulation, but protects against pregnancy in several ways.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!
I am under the impression that ovulation is a &quot;2 weeks in the making&quot; ordeal. The continuous hormones provided by birth control pills block the body from producing it's own hormones that are naturally produced in a menstrual cycle. My question then is, why doesn't the withdrawal from these hormones (even after taking 21 pills) cause the body to produce it's own hormones (and in turn, start it's natural menstrual/ovulation cycle)? To put it simply, if a bc pill is required to be taken EVERY day to prevent ovulation, why can you go 7 consecutive days without them and still NOT start up the ovulation cycle? </p></div>		</li>
