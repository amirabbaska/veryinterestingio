			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I say I'm a recovered anorexic. Even when I'm not actively eating in an unhealthy way, all the urges and feelings still exist. I still fight the desire to starve myself, and feel the crushing guilt when I don't. I still struggle with accepting my body and loving myself and feeling like I'm worth taking care of. </p>
<p>Although I have been dealing with a bit of a relapse, so I guess &quot;recovered&quot; isn't entirely accurate anymore either. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p></div>		</li>

<p>always will be an alcoholic.</p>

<p>I wish some people understood that. My father was a raging alcoholic. He was basically forced to get clean against his will (he got pneumonia and ended up sedated in the hospital for 3 weeks while they waited for him to stop detoxing, because they sure as hell won't give you alcohol in  a hospital to stop detoxes.) My father's detoxes were <em>bad</em>, he didn't even have to be sober for them to start. He just had to be not drunk enough. (ie, they'd start before he'd even sobered up) So he was drunk 24/7 for probably 2-3 months. Caught pneumonia somehow and ended up in the hospital.</p>
<p>Anyway, after he got out, he was sober for maybe 6 weeks, then started drinking again insisting he was fine and could handle it and we're all idiots for doubting him.</p>
<p>5 weeks later, he's back in the hospital detoxing. Ugh. Same thing, he gets out, insists he's fine and there's no reason he can't drink, then he's back in the hospital detoxing again a few months later.</p>
<p>Repeated this process for about 2 years until his body finally said &quot;fuck you, I've had enough of this&quot; and he died.  All because he refused to accept the problems with him drinking wouldn't go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are not anonymous amongst  other AA's , you can share your last name in a meeting. The anonymous part comes into play if you run into someone from a meeting out in public, you do not &quot;out &quot; them as an AA . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's deeper too. There is an element of anonymity of the group, as in no lists of members officially, though many groups have a phone list to reach out to during crisis. Remember that when AA was founded in the 30s that it wasn't just anonymity of a and b but also anonymity from the group. It helped deter any interference into the meetings. Alcoholics were a much maligned bunch and as such felt the need to be secretive.</p>
<p>Within the group the anonymity is also about not being better or worse than anyone else. The member is an alcoholic first and foremost, not a doctor or stock broker. So, whether you're a bum or barista or baron you are an alcoholic first. They say principles before personalities in meetings not because you put principles in front of other people but because you put them ahead of your own personality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are private groups on Capitol Hill for politicians too. </p>
<p>I ran afoul this sort of thing with a big book study group and it felt weird being off schedule invite only, but then again it wasn't a group for the newcomer, also weird, it was for fellowship and study. </p>
<p>A group I started on a college campus ran into a few issues and though it wasn't troublesome for anonymity things like self-supporting became questionable as well as the announcement/posting about the group, we solved it by moving into the church across the street, which bothered a couple members who were happy to finally have a non-religious space to meet. The traditions are not easily followed and anyone who thinks they are clear cut is missing the point, they are their because if we don't think about what we are doing we will fuck it up. Not the whole of AA, but many groups go under because they fail to uphold those traditions.</p></div>		</li>
