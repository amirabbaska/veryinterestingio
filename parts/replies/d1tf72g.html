I thought knowing that the tail rotor counters the torque from the main one was all there was to know about helicopters, didn't pause to wonder how they actually move.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, thanks. Now I need to look into that, too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It has less to do with the natural forces balancing the bike. He does talk about how much math your brain must process to make the correct adjustments to stay upright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a very interesting model of bicycling handling based on aircraft handling that was developed by a professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in order to design non-standard bicycle geometries (e.g. recumbent). The professor, Bill Patterson, wrote a book on the topic called &quot;The Lords of the Chainring&quot;. I used this model in college to develop the geometry for a recumbent fully-faired race bike for the ASME Human Powered Vehicle Competition. Here is a link to <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/~wpatters/lords.html" target="_blank">his website</a> where you can purchase the text and read some excerpts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recumbent vs more standard bicycles are interesting.  I ride both of them and the recumbent is impossible to ride without constantly holding onto the handlebars.  The standard diamond frame bicycle is easy to ride without holding onto the handlebars. I can balance while standing or moving on the standard frame but cannot balance while standing still on the recumbent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that apply to unicycles? I've been riding them since I was 7, and I always tell people it's governed by the same forces as a bike except you can fall forward and backward.</p>
<p>Once you get the forward-backward balance right, you're golden, because the side-to side balance pretty much takes care of itself as long as the wheel is turning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When riding, you're moving the point where the wheel touches the ground directly underneath your center of gravity. To balance left to right, you have to move that wheel left or right.</p>
<p>Obviously it can't do this while you are stationary as it only rolls forwards and back. So, if you're rolling forwards or back, you can twist your body to make the wheel &quot;turn&quot; and travel left and right relative to your position and bring you back into balance.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The forward-backward balance is more like an inverted pendulum. And I doubt a unicycle will be able to stay upright on its own, so it all comes down to the human balancing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unicycles don't have rake and trail, which is one of the reasons they're so much harder to ride than bicycles. You'd be right if you were comparing to pennyfarthing bikes, which are also pretty hard to ride.</p></div>		</li>
