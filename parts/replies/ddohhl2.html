			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it's the exact opposite.</p>
<p>The technical name for what happened is called a cytokine storm. I'm ripping this example off from a really good ELI5 from a while ago; if someone finds it please tell me so I can offer credit.</p>
<p>Consider your immune system a sniper. Kids have bad aim because they're kids and don't use guns, so their immune system doesn't work as well. Old people are tired, so their immune system don't work as hard. Healthy adults have practiced many times, so they're very accurate and kill the target quickly and effectively. </p>
<p>Now, imagine that someone convinces the sniper that everyone is a zombie. The sniper is going to bust out a semi-automatic and start killing people left and right. Same limitations - so the good shooter will be successful. Except for that nobody was actually a zombie, so a lot of innocent people just died.</p>
<p>That's a cytokine storm, the sniper freaking out.</p></div>		</li>
