			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people are confusing average face with average attractiveness. An averaged face means that each of its features are averaged among many people, but will have an above average attractiveness. Most people have facial irregularities that make them perceived as less attractive. By averaging features together, you get a more symmetrical and attractive result. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re choosing the wrong meaning out of two possible meanings for average here. One meaning, the one you are choosing, is someone who people rate 5 out of 10. The other meaning, the intended one, is that more attractive people have common features for a region. </p>
<p>See, for example, most common faces for various countries. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by the first assertion. If we look for genetic diversity, shouldn't we be looking for non-common features? Or are you saying we look for it to screen it out? In that case, that might explain why people always call their doppelgänger good looking. :P</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do this, though. Literally ask for the strangest, unique thing available.</p>
<p>I also do a lot of other things that people don't, so maybe I'm just the exception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>strategies. Different people execute different strategies. One is conservative, go with the proven solution to a problem and plays the odds. The other is daring and takes the long shot for the big leap.</p>
<p>The tried-n-true crowd keeps you going generation after generation, giving time for the long-shotters to make the big leap. </p>
<p>Exotic is attractive but not to everyone. A population that splits its strategies up will do better than one that stagnates (won't ever change, even when the environment changes or moves to a new environment, and will thus lose its fitness) or one that simply gambles and implements a bunch of long-shot low probability options and fails and wipes itself out. </p>
<p>So ideally you want a core of people afraid of change and maintaining the status quo and a fringe of risk taking free thinkers who fail horribly but also succeed miraculously. </p>
<p>Everyone who tried to kill an animal bigger than themselves got slaughtered while the scavengers kept the tribes alive generation after generation until someone threw the first rock. That guy shifted the paradigm from scavenging to hunting and made a whole lotta protein available that wasn't available before.</p>
<p>The first person to tend to a plant to make it grow did the same thing. </p>
<p>Before those changes, just put your full bet into scavenging, worked for your parents and your parents parents, etc.</p>
<p>One theory about the Neanderthals, maybe this is discredited now I don't know, was that they were ultra conservative without a lot of change. Well adapted to their environment and didn't try new strategies. Modern humans came along, wandering, adapting and implementing new strategies and out-competed them for resources. As long as there was no outside pressure the ultra-conservative strategy worked fine but change the rules of the game and poof you lose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking for genetic diversity by preferring non-diverse features? Surely that's not the conclusion to be made here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it is, instead of a face maybe it will make more sense if you imagine wanting  a soup. You want a soup that is diversified across all flavors so that no one flavor stands out.</p>
<p>Well then you don't want a red soup, or a blue soup, a thick soup or a thin soup, hot soup or cold soup... the soup that is most diversified is the soup that looks completely average, it will be a warm grey soup with just an average amount of viscosity.</p>
<p>Same goes with faces, the face that is most diversified is the one where nothing stands out, in other words, it looks completely plain and average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is counter intuitive, but genetic diversity results in less extreme looks. </p>
<p>This is probably massively oversimplified but:</p>
<p>If you breed a small population with itself over and over for years, you end up getting more and more extreme features in that group as the diversity wanes and certain singular traits are selected for whatever reason.</p>
<p>But then if you mix that population with the rest of the world population evenly, before long those extreme traits would start trending back to average. </p>
<p>Mathematically it would be like if you rolled a 6 sided die 1000 times, added up all the numbers, and got an average. That number would be <em>extremely</em> close to 3.5. Now if you rolled it twice and took an average, it could literally be anywhere between 1 and 6. The more results that are added in the closer the average will get to 3.5 for the whole population.</p></div>		</li>
