			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, ya, and you're probably not going to live with a siberian tiger in your house long-term.  Fel d1 is a very stable allergen so it remains in your environment for a long time and will progressively accumulate as long as the cat is there.  I doubt there are many people that have a siberian tiger in their home for a year.</p>
<p>Visiting the cat house at the zoo is likely not recommended.  </p></div>		</li>
