			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think that's bad, then you'll love reading about fake stash houses.  Basically the undercover agent convinces a bunch of people that there's an easy target full of drugs, cash, guns, whatever, and when they get together to plan the robbery, they're all arrested for conspiracy.  The magnitude of the crime is however much stuff the house held, <em>which is completely made up</em>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's one thing people are good at, it's rationalizing shit like that.<br />
Just telling them it's a stash house gives them the impression that it's someone's ill gotten gains.  If they stole it or earned it illegally then who cares if I steal it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;We're charging you for conspiring to steal something that you <em>thought</em> existed.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... That's TV for you. Go big or go home. I'm taking your reaction is to the craziness of it, not faulting the police. </p>
<p>But anyone who thinks the cops are to blame in that situation are mistaken. If anything, it sounds like those kind of bikes in that area should be a dead giveaway that it's a trap. The way you describe it, I'm sure even the cops were surprised someone fell for it.</p>
<p>It's probably the lowest denominator thief anyway that may likely bring violence into the mix if, God forbid, someone was there and they're caught. Those are the people we need off the streets. The ones who can't use their reason size up the situation. Last thing anyone needs is to get killed over a material object.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also what if you're down on your luck and you really needed that bike? Couldn't afford to replace it? Had sentimental value?</p></div>		</li>
