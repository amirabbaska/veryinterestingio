<p>A higher decay energy will produce more electron/hole pairs per decay. Measured relative to decay power (decay energy * decay rate), there is no large difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that isotopes with higher decay energy decay less often (or at least produce fewer electrons) or am I understanding this wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two things are independent. Energy per decay depends on the isotope only, power depends on the isotope and the number of atoms you have.</p></div>		</li>
