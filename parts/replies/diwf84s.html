			<div class="markdown"><p>Rotation does not provide a perfect simulation of gravity. There are artifacts of rotation that would induce notable experiences that deviate from real gravity that would make the scenarios distinguishable. The larger the radius of rotation, the less these effects present themselves, so perhaps if the radius was enormous, a human would be unlikely to notice these effects, but they would always be measureable.</p>
<p>Your statements would be true in the case of linear acceleration, though. There is no way to know, if you're in a room and being held to the floor, if its because of gravity, or because you're being linearly accelerated by some force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said about linear acceleration is not true for the same reason you just explained. Gravity can never be perfectly linear. However, the farther away the gravitational source is from you, the less this effect would present itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The equivalence principle states that there is no way to distinguish between gravity from spacetime curvature and linear acceleration. They are basically the same thing. With gravity of Earth, effectively Earth's surface is constantly accelerating us upward away from our inertial trajectory due to the curvature of spacetime. It's basically the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, that's not true though (I think). First of all, if a rope is hanging down from the center of a spinning wagon wheel space station, then the Coriolis force should press it up against the wall of the shaft, like /u/ZeusHatesTrees mentioned in their reply. Also, as you climb the rope towards the center of the space station, the apparent gravity should decrease, since your angular velocity (which is the same as the angular velocity of the space station) remains constant, but the rotational radius shrinks as you climb up.</p>
<p>Do I have this wrong?</p></div>		</li>
