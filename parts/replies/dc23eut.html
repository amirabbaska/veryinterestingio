			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is why some people who suffer chronic nose stuffiness have sinus surgery to remove some tissue and widen the passages permanently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Had this done a few years ago. A combination of my sinuses being extremely narrow and allergies to just about everything airborne was causing pressure to erode my facial bones. My ENT went in and removed my adenoids as well as some tissue and damaged bone. </p>
<p>I still have trouble breathing through my nose when exercising, but I no longer get constant sinus infections :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had the same thing done over Valentine's Day two years back. Removed tissue, reopened a sinus cavity or two(can't remember) that was actually grown shut from swelling/trying to heal over time. Adenoids out, crazy deviated septum fixed (it was in 3 separate pieces all out of wack although I never broke it). Damaged bone and bone spurs removed.
I've had 3 surgeries since then, not sinuses, and god I would do 10 more to never have to do the sinus one again.
Best part was, anesthesia makes me vomit. It's a given. As soon as I'm slightly conscious. Turns out that with how much they had done and stitched and stuff with gauze, every time I puked, they had to knock me back out slightly to clean it out. And repeat. Recovery to get sent home took about 5 hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went and saw an ENT one time to solve Chronic Sinusitis - and he said &quot;your problem isn't that bad&quot; and insisted on not doing anything to me.</p>
<p>And he claimed that I should not bother using antibiotics that it &quot;wouldn't do anything to solve my problem&quot;.</p>
<p>However if I don't almost perpetually take light antibiotics - my sinus just becomes unbearably useless - also the antibiotics never actually seem to be able to fully fix any of my problems - I wake up everyday with yellow mucus even while taking them.</p>
<p>ENT did say I had a polyp in 1 side though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also just had this surgery about a month ago but it was a combined septoplasty and turbinectomy. </p>
<p>On the lining of your sinus cavities are these finger-like projections called turbinates that are what swell up and make breathing through one or both nostrils difficult.</p>
<p>I had a pretty bad deviated septum and I found out about a year ago that I'm allergic to basically everything they test for. So my turbinates were constantly swollen and it was always difficult to breathe through my nose. I probably had at least 4 sinus infections every year for five years before this surgery. Because I was getting the septoplasty surgery to fix the deviated septum, I was under anesthesia for the procedure. My gf said it lasted about an hour and then another hour for the anesthesia to wear off. I was in some pain for a couple of days but it wasn't unbearable, felt more like a bruised kind of pain, and I was prescribed some painkillers as well. </p>
<p>I had plastic tubes in my nose that were connected with stitches for a week after the surgery and I was told not to blow my nose at all. The tubes were annoying af and made it hard to taste anything (due to lack of smell) and hard to breathe through my nose. </p>
<p>But a week later I went back in and the doc snipped the stitches and pulled the tubes out. Holy shit that was the best feeling ever getting those things out. Then he asked me to breathe in and it was like taking my first breath again. The difference in breathing ability still amazes me. I'm not fighting a constant battle with my nose or having to blow my nose 50 times a day. And I haven't had any signs of a sinus infection yet which I am so thankful for. </p>
<p>I highly recommend this procedure to anyone suffering with sinus issues. </p>
<p>Edit: I'll also add that obviously the procedure does not cure allergies. I'm still taking Claritin and Zyrtec daily (I may end up going with allergy shots eventually) but there is much more room in my sinus cavities for any allergic swelling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(not a doctor, so my explanations are crude and terminology probably off a bit)</p>
<p>There are two types of sinus surgery (probably more) but the balloon one was what your brother had.  The other type is where they actually cut / scrape away tissue. This is the one I had done (Dec 2014), and it's worse than expected (and worse than it sounds).  They told me I would be back to work after a long weekend; not true.  After I healed, it only improved my chronic sinusitis and allergies minimally.</p>
<p>Ironically, I had bariatric surgery in April 2016 and that has done more to alleviate my life long allergies and health issues than anything else.  Losing 140 lbs affects things you would never think are related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So...I get sinus infections all the time. (I have an ENT doctor. I'm working on it) but like where does all the snot go?! Like how is it all in my face like that. </p>
<p>Unlike th original question, I usually find myself with sooooooo much gross thick snot coming out of my nose I don't understand how it's possible. </p>
<p>And reading that back, id just like to say to all the fine gentlemen out there, sorry boys, I'm taken. But I sure sound like a catch, huh? Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good point.  I think that actually <em>is</em> mucus falling to one side or the other due to gravity.  But maybe it's the sinus shifting?  I'm not an expert I just know enough to explain to a 5 year old...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cartilage in the middle of my nose will bow to one side and when I roll over will pop to that side.  No doctor has really understood what is happening. The best thing that has helped is Bepreve eye drops in each eye before bed every night, and preservative free eyedrops in 4x use dropper (looks like a vile of 'lucky U' from iZombie).</p></div>		</li>
