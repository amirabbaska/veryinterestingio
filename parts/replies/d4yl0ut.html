			<div class="markdown"><p>adhd is primarily a failure of the executive functions of the brain to regulate behavior.  There is no reason to believe people with ADHD daydream differently than normal.  They would just have less control over when it happens than someone without adhd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only skimmed, but it seems to say that the default mode never switches off properly in autistics, and didn't work properly in the first place. So their daydreaming must be something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add several things to your paragraph on sleep, because there's a lot we do understand there.</p>
<p>There have been many studies of how the Default Mode Network functions in sleep. In general, as we descend into sleep, activity of this network decreases, especially in prefrontal cortex (which may account for loss of logical thinking during sleep).</p>
<p><a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/17/cercor.bhq295.short" target="_blank">http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/17/cercor.bhq295.short</a></p>

<p>Interestingly, there are key differences in the functioning of the Default Mode Network and brain activity in general between REM and NREM sleep. While dreaming occurs in both NREM sleep (people report dreaming ~30% of the time when awoken from NREM) and REM sleep (~90% of the time), the most vivid and interesting dreams occur in REM sleep. During REM sleep, the Default Mode Network is largely reconstructed, and large-scale brain activity, as measured by EEG, is actually quite similar to wakefulness (high frequency, low amplitude waves) and very unlike NREM sleep (low frequency, high amplitude waves).</p>

<p>People have speculated on a possible link between daydreaming and dreaming since Freud, but the underlying mechanisms are still not entirely clear for either phenomenon. Certainly there are some similarities in functional brain activity, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The validity of the default mode network has not been challenged. One can observe the network using a variety of different methods, many of which do not suffer from a problem with multiple comparison correction.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>One can identify the default mode network by looking at the structure of spontaneous correlations in brain activity. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12506194" target="_blank">Pubmed link.</a></p>
<p>One can identify the default mode network using multivariate approaches that don't require multiple comparisons. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600998" target="_blank">Pubmed link.</a></p>
<p>One can identify the network by its high baseline metabolic demands using PET imaging. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11584306" target="_blank">Pubmed link.</a></p>
<p>Please don't exaggerate the recent findings by Eklund and colleagues. Yes, what they found is a significant problem, but the sky has not fallen on the world of fMRI.</p></div>		</li>
