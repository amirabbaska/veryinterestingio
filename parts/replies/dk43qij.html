			<div class="markdown"><p>my heavier race prepped t595 was a daily 196 mph while my friends more costly zx10 with street mods was able to reach 192 mph on the same roads together.
so many variables play in but the zx10 was 10 years newer, 40 lbs lighter and 30-40 more hp.
drag, torque vs hp, final drive ratios intersecting with power bands were the most likely reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The faster you go, the harder the air pushes back against you.</p>
<p>And then you have diminishing returns, because in order to get from 100 to 200 mph, you need say, 500 horsepower. But to get from 200 to 250 mph, you need an additional 500 horsepower. And then to get from 250 to 275 mph, you might need yet another 500 horsepower.</p>
<p>It becomes harder and harder because you end up needing enormous amounts of power just to go even 1 mph faster. That's just in the same car. </p>
<p>The Bugatti Veyron for example, only needs around two or three hundred horsepower to go from zero to two hundred miles per hour. But it needs the other thousand horsepower to go to two hundred sixty seven miles per hour.</p></div>		</li>
