			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation and what I was going to type out, so you get an upvote instead but I still don't know how to handle your name being Dr Propofol. If you're an anesthesiologist, shouldn't it be Dr Yacht? Just playing. I don't want to tube and bag all those people. Although I suppose you have the upside of they don't often talk...</p></div>		</li>

<p>So exercise can cause the heart to become bigger (like a failing heart), but the increase in size is from growing muscle units and building the muscle, rather than stretching it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you sure about this? My understanding was that cardiac muscle is different to skeletal muscle, and one of the biggest ways in which it is different is that it doesn't get bigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heart does get bigger in the form of hypertrophy. There are two main forms: concentric and eccentric hypertrophy. Concentric hypertrophy occurs when the stress is due to pressure overload and eccentric hypertrophy occurs when the stress is due to volume overload. Generally speaking, concentric hypertrophy results in a thicker heart but not necessarily larger while eccentric hypertrophy results in a larger heart. Both forms can occur with exercise (depending if aerobic or weight-lifting) and both can be maladaptive if taken to the extreme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's predominantly hyperplasia (increase in cell numbers), so you're right. </p>
<p>Two years ago, I did some work on newly emerging cardiac evidence, and I believe we are now realising hypertrophy also does occur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, I might be very wrong as I don't know much about how cardiac hypertrophy works yet, but I have a question about this.</p>
<p>Would I be right in saying that the 'de-compensation' is due to the Frank-Starling mechanism and that the increased length of the sarcomeres is causing reduced contractility? </p>
<p>If so, why does this not apply to cardiac hypertrophy induced by exercise? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Your thick/thin filament overlap is the key. The greater stretch/preload, the greater the contraction. But if the stretch is too great, the filaments now have no overlap and contractility drops off.</p>
<p>I can't give a textbook answer to your question because I'm going from rough memory. </p>
<p>You may expect the key difference between obesity and exercise is the temporary stress vs persistent stress. However, weightlifters who take steroids can also get heart failure from excessive hypertrophy. Probably because your BP can increase way over 300mmHg during a lift, so their heart gets bigger until it literally becomes 'sloppy'. </p>
<p>But in cardio/aerobic exercise, the muscle stretch, wall thickness or blood pressure aren't the main factors. It's the work rate and subsequent improvements in metabolism. So the muscle does get a bit bigger, but all the intracellular processes get efficient and optimised. </p></div>		</li>
