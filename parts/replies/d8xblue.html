			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments are making this point. I want to add that for years I had very little to do and barely any responsibilities.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean I was living the good life relaxing, I just couldn't find a job and had a poor social life. It was often stressful.</p>
<p>Getting myself to &quot;play&quot; in any form was very difficult at times. Even something as easy as starting a video game was often not very appealing.</p>
<p>Certainly, I felt a lot more like playing as a child than now, even with lots of free time.</p>
<p>I'm sure lack of time comes into it, but I feel like it's a pretty small part of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that you did have responsibilities, but circumstances prevented you from fulfilling them, leading to stress. There's no expectation on most children to get a job.</p></div>		</li>
