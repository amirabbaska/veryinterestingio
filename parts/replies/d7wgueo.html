			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. You mention that the time you spend in REM grows with each sleep cycle, more or less. As someone who has had part-time work at odd-hour jobs like bartending, I went through stretches where I would normally wake up at 7 and choose to sleep for another cycle or two. In those cases, was I actually getting much REM? Is there an benefit to going back to sleep after waking up? I've certainly heard that the rest you get from snoozing over and over is worthless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question - is it possible to induce REM sleep faster and for longer? If so - couldn't we feasibly require less sleep assuming the process was repeatable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I think that's the idea behind the &quot;uberman&quot; sleep schedule and other polyphasic sleep schedules.  Basically, you break up the one long sleep into many little sleeps and eventually it forces your body to jump into REM sleep right away.  So instead of sleeping 8+ hours a night, you may only be sleeping for 2-3 hours per 24 hour period but getting the same amount of REM sleep as an 8 hour sleeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is the general idea behind the uberman schedule. However, since you're only sleeping in very short intervals, it's extremely important that you follow the schedule strictly.<br />
If you wake up a half hour early on a normal (8hr) sleep schedule, you probably won't even notice a difference. If you miss 10min out of one 30min sleep period on the uberman schedule, you'll feel like you missed an entire night of sleep. It's also more difficult to make up for sleep debt, so sleeping exactly when and for how long you're supposed to is essential.

There are <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ELrf0.png" target="_blank">many different types of polyphasic sleep cycles</a> that are easier to work with. I personally follow a biphasic schedule and sleep 5hrs a night with a 30min nap about half way through my workday. I've also gone for weeks at a time on a modified Dymaxion schedule while working on my thesis.</p></div>		</li>
