			<div class="markdown"><p>They can't because an egg is only viable for about 24h. During this time, it's lurking in the Fallopian tube, which is difficult to access. By the time it comes out with the shredded blood and tissue, it's not really viable anymore due to age and hormone changes. Also, it's not feasible to sort through all the blood cells, uterine lining cells, etc. to find a single cell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a healthy woman normally only releases one egg at a time. But you need an average of 20 eggs in order to get a viable pregnancy through IVF. So the hormones make a woman's body release a while bunch of eggs at once (may be 20 but may also be much fewer than 20 in women who have lowered egg counts).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maturation process has yet to be replicated. An egg can't be harvested until the ovary matures it. Science hasn't accomplished this feat articulacy yet. I learned all this firsthand when I considered freezing my eggs this year before having my one remaining ovary removed. I only had 3 follicles (precursors to eggs, if you will) where they normally like to see 10+ on both ovaries. So I decided to save my money since the chance of pregnancy would have been very low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: are there really psychological tests? Is this only when you're donating? I looked into harvesting my own eggs this year to preserve my own fertility due to an ovarian cancer diagnosis. There were no psychological tests mentioned. But the rest is accurate. It's about a 2-week process but it sounded like a sucky 2 weeks. (Not why I opted out).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's only for donating, especially when the woman is being compensated, just like organ donation they don't want people doing it because they're in a financial hardship and not mentally prepared. </p></div>		</li>
