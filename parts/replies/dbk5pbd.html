<p>Yes it still could have happened by chance, but doesn't the figure (97%) already account for that? There is a 3% probability that it was chance -- that's exactly what the figure says. What am I missing?</p>
<p>Also, aren't probability and likelihood two very different things?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have to take into account the assumptions. What you're saying that &quot;if the coin is fair, then there is a 3% chance of getting this result&quot;. You can't just flip this statement around to say if you got this result then there's 97% chance of it being loaded.</p>
<p>The Bayes rule is: P(coin is fair | 5 heads ) = P(5 heads | coin is fair)P(coin is fair) / P(5 heads). Without some assumption about what the chance is that a coin is fair you can't even calculate a result.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why not? I thought it meant that there is a 97% probability the coin is loaded assuming the coin flips were independent random samples. </p>
<p>Also, why is Bayes rule more valid? Or is it? I can't think of how it would apply in an experimental setting, because when would we ever know prior probabilities? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In response to moxius, I wrote that the following statements are not the same:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;If the coin is fair, then there is a 3% chance of obtaining this result by random chance.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;There is a 97% chance that the coin is loaded.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>The last statement is the same as
2a. &quot;There is a 3% chance that this result was obtained by random chance&quot; (100-97 = 3)</p>
<p>If I simplify the logic of statements 1 and 2a, I can rewrite them as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If A is true then B is true.</p>
</li>
<li>B is true.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where A = &quot;the coin is fair&quot; and B = &quot;there is a 3% chance of obtaining this result by random chance&quot;</p>
<p>I hope you can see from this simplification that 1 and 2 are not the same statements.</p>
<p>You're right, probability and likelihood are different things and I'm not sure what you're referring to, but I often make the mistake of mixing up technical and colloquial language so if I screwed up somewhere I apologize.  But in the way I think they're normally used, they're not very different; probability is simply the integral of the likelihood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see grammatically and logically how they are not the same statement. What I don't understand is why you can't read 1 and correctly infer 2.</p></div>		</li>
