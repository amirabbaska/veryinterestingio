			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having trouble understanding what this &quot;z-z-z-z&quot; sound is. </p>
<p>To me, snoring sounds more like a series of snorts, and &quot;zee-zee-zee-zee&quot; doesn't remind me of snoring either. But just the onomatopoeia of &quot;zzzz&quot; sounds more like <a href="https://youtu.be/d6B8aVZA4sM?t=1m35s" target="_blank">this noise an RC car makes or a pencil sharpener.</a></p>
<p>edit: Oh, is it sort of like a whistling noise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the name of the letter, rather the sound the letter makes.  YayC posted the sound of a hand saw cutting through wood.  Slow it down, and it is similar to the sound many people make when they snore/sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sound of z and s is actually very familiar and sometimes in the rules of phonetics the (s) turns into /z/. I took a class of linguistics and still pretty clueless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like this, but slower:
