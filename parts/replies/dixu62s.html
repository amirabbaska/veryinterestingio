<p>Zara manufactures their clothes almost exclusively in third world countries, even though they do pay better wages than most for those places.</p>

<p>they really don´t, well depending on your definition of third world country. say some 10-20% of their stuff is from Portugal and Spain, some 40% from Morocco, some 30% from Turkey and China. They do have some stuff from bangla desh but it´s  relatively rare.</p>
<p>They are about the only company I know which puts country of manufacturing very visibly on the back of the neck label. I am biased to Portuguese made things, nationalistic reasons a bit maybe but also their portuguese made things are usually better - better materials, better finishings, sometimes tailoring details you can´t  really see but make for a much nicer piece to wear and wear.</p>
<p>If you look at inditex other labels, the cheaper ones got more third world origins, Massimo Dutti is mostly Portugal/Romania/Morocco/ China with a lot more Portuguese made stuff.</p></div>		</li>
