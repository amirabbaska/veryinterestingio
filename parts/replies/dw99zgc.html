			<div class="markdown"><p>All the people saying yes are incorrect. It goes to a completely black screen for a frame before the white boxes appear around the targets. The black screen is a necessary part of the calibration and it won't work without that. If you could somehow time it so you turned the light source on and off at just the right time you could probably get it to work. Anyone who claims they got it to work by just pointing it at a lightbulb is simply spreading an old urban legend.</p></div>		</li>
