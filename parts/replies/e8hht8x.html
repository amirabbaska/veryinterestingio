			<div class="markdown"><p>Survivorship Bias. It's why we exaggerate how much better things were made in the past. Planned obsolescence and just straight up overengineering have a large part to play in it, but the vast majority of items made in the past are gone, so we only see the ones that obviously were built to a high standard. It leads us to believe that they were all like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd change it, but then your comment would look odd. So I guess I'll just let this badge of shame linger.</p></div>		</li>
