<p>It's all because our distant ancestors were fish-like and we're built upon that model.  </p>
<p>Evolution doesn't give a crap about sense or better - just if it works better than the previous version. </p></div>		</li>

<p>First, bear in mind that evolution almost <em>never</em> finds the optimal solution to a problem. It's a process of luck and survival, so a lot of &quot;good enough but not great&quot; features are present.</p>

<p>Exactly! I always cringe, when in animal documentaries they say that a species developed feature X to do Y. No, they didn't! It's the other way round. They can do Y because they developed that feature X. It's nitpicking, but it's important for understanding the process of evolution. At least in documentaries they shouldn't make it sound like there was decision making involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite example of this is the giraffe (basically long horses). They have a recurrent laryngeal nerve. Basically, this nerve was looped around the aorta when the neck was short. Once the giraffe started evolving the longer neck to reach higher food sources, the nerve didn't reroute of course. Consequently, this nerve, which really should only have to travel a few inches to its destination within the body of the giraffe, has to travel all the way down to the giraffe's heart, loop around, and travel all the way back up the neck to the brain. It would be a very poor design in a closed system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that nerve follows the same path in pretty much all mammals, independent of neck size. It's a pretty good argument in favour of evolution rather than intelligent design (as if we needed more). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have a recurrent laryngeal nerve on both sides as well. Embryologically, both the right and left recurrents loop under the distal sixth aortic arch. On the left, it develops into the ductus arteriosus (connects aorta and pulmonary trunk in utero) and hence the left recurrent loops under the aorta. On the right, the distal sixth aortic arch atrophies away. On both sides the fifth aortic arch atrophied away. Hence, on the right, the recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under the fourth aortic arch, which develops into the subclavian artery</p></div>		</li>
