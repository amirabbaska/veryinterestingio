A lot of spotlight was on it in the media (at least in my country) because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The decline in cases/outbreaks/news is likely/most probably due to the fact that so many humans in affected areas have an immunity against the virus, and thus less virus is in circulation among adults. Herd immunity through natural infections. In a decade or two, it'll likely make headlines again, but by then a vaccine will likely be available so who knows if the impact will be the same (no promise it's affordable, though). </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is the infection was mild, and only a fraction of infected adults actually had symptoms. BUT, of course, there were the overwhelming cases of microcephaly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can herd immunity work if the infection is coming from an arbovector with nearly no human-to-human transmission, and a huge interspecies reservoir?</p>
<p>Edit: Found a paper on potential &quot;herd immunity&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5441000/" target="_blank">Perspectives on the Zika outbreak: herd immunity, antibody-dependent enhancement and vaccine</a>, however they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The decrease in the number of zika disease cases after the 8th Epidemiological Week (EW) of 2016 (February 21st to 27th), cannot yet be explained by herd immunity, but is probably due to vector seasonal features, as reported for dengue cases during the same time. Therefore, despite the 130,759 confirmed cases of zika disease until the EW 4 (2017), it may still take some years before the herd immunity decreases the number of cases, which will remain lower until the emergence of a new na√Øve human generation, leading to a second outbreak (Figure 1A).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning they haven't seen a sign of herd immunity yet, but are expecting it to be an explanation when infection rate drops off in some years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vector is a mosquito. It was hypothesized - probably correct - during the outbreak that it's not a comparable problem in Africa because exposure is almost universal before you're old enough to be pregnant. Most people who get it are asymptomatic and most of the ones who do have symptoms are mild. So there are way more &quot;cases&quot; than reported. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to be a lot more knowledgeable than I am.  Regardless of the Zika virus' actual affects, how would you rate the WHO &amp; world governments responses to the outbreak? Had the affects been more widespread or deadly, do you think that what was done would have been effective? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Internal knowledge from conference abstracts, and an understanding of dengue epidemiology. Retrospect studies are currently underway, although one difficulty in evaluating specific changes in antibody seroprevalence in affected populations is the cross reactivity of antibodies between dengue and Zika. (For those of you who are not familiar, dengue virus is also endemic in most areas Zika is present, making seroprevalence studies precarious). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Precisely. They estimated when in <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004726" target="_blank">this paper</a> (around 2040 in French Polynesia).</p></div>		</li>
