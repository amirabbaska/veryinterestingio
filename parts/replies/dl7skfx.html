<p>The last study mentioned in the quoted portion used medically diagnosed alcoholism., which they call <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/basics/definition/con-20020866" target="_blank">Alcohol Use Disorder</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that's been studied, but it stands to reason that if heavy drinking causes heavy damage, light drinking causes light damage (unless there's some kind of threshold effect).</p></div>		</li>

<p>If there were evidence to even <em>suggest</em> that marijuana has the same impact that we <em>know</em> alcohol has, the Reaganite crowd would be in full-blown moral panic.</p></div>		</li>
