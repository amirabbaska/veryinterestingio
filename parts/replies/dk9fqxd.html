<p>sure! any papers or webpages I could (try to) read?</p>
<p>I <em>was</em> also wondering if recombination is possible!
but I don't know if I am thinking of the same thing ...</p>
<p>can the photons B1 and B2 be combined?
would it sort of be a B photon, but polarization-filtered ...?
(if I understood the other answers correctly, the BBO only lets a certain polarization 'in') ...</p>
<p>strange consequence: the recombined pseudo B photons would be in superposition, but we would also know what state they had???</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as recombining, I believe it is possible! You are absolutely correct regarding the polarization. That may not be true for all crystals though. There are multiple types of downconversion and multiple types of crystals. I believe the individual in our research facility is not using BBO (although we use it in different experiments). He is looking less at polarization and more at spectral entanglement, hence he doesn't need to know the polarization of the input beam. One of the problems he is running into, though, is his output signal is so low that it's difficult (read: impossible) to differentiate between the signal and &quot;dark&quot; counts or false positives caused by various inefficiencies in the equipment. </p>
<p>However in my experiment, we know the polarization of our input into PPKTP by using a beam displacer. The beam displacer separates the pump into H and V streams and we using a half wave plate to flip the undesirable polarization into the desired polarization! </p>
<p>I'm so glad someone else is interested in this! It's not often I hear individuals interested in what I do at work! :D</p>
<p>EDIT:  you are in luck!  I found copies of the PDF in my email.  I'm not really sure where online they were found though.  Do you want to PM me your email and I can send them to you directly?  Sorry, I know that's probably not most efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question! So we are actually doing this with plans for a much larger experiment. Our larger experiment is competing for a NASA related fund. Essentially, I am a part of a two-person team that is doing a proof of concept. We have yet to get funding approved (still waiting on one signature, argh!) so we are creating a proof of concept with materials we already have. </p>
<p>Essentially we have laid out the entirety of the experiment and plan on swapping out the crystal we have (PPKTP) for a possibly more efficient crystal (maybe PPLiNbO3) when the funding finally gets approved. That way nothing else (displacers, splitters, collectors) will have to be changed/set up as it will already be set up and correctly positioned. In addition it'll show we can achieve the desired wavelengths (there are very specific guidelines for the NASA related funding) before having the optimal set up. </p>
<p>Hope that answers your question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat. Good luck! KTP is pretty economical. I wasn't aware that poled crystals were a whole lot less expensive than PPLN, and PPLN is nice because the damage threshold is way up there, and for SHG. I have never come across any papers on exploring SHG in these experiments. </p></div>		</li>
