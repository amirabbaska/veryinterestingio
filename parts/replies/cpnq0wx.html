			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of something I thought about previously:</p>
<p>Why is the communication between my conciousness and my body so bad? It seems really strange that In order to know if I'm pregnant, I have to have an external test before my consciousness gets the message. Why doesn't my body just tell my conciousness that there's a baby on the way? </p>
<p>Same with cancer. Why doesn't my body tell my mind that there are some weird cells over there that are strange? Why do I need to have external test to tell me what my body already knows? </p></div>		</li>

<p>You are conscious of the things you are conscious of because it was evolutionarily advantageous. The things you aren't conscious of are either because they were NOT advantageous, or random chance never got around to giving it to your ancestors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the sheer insane amount of information processed and automatic actions your brain and body does 24/7 would take up too much of your mind.
You do not need to know these things to eat, sleep, stay warm, stay safe or even to procreate. Could be handy, but the baby will come whether you know about it or not, and cancer will kill you weather you know about it or not.<br />
Elected abortion and cancer treatment are not part of evolutionary hardwiring. Today knowing you have cancer cells might count for something. There might be something we could do about it. But it wouldn't have made a lick of difference for millions of years before that. </p>
<p>But being distracted from eating, sleeping and staying safe, could in fact kill you. And so the tradeoff isn't worth it. </p>
<p>Aside from the why, I'm not sure how the brain and neurological system would actually collect so many different types of information that comes through cells, neurons and hormones and give us an answer we can understand. The body doesn't really talk our language, we just do our best to interpret it's whims, reactions and temperaments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet some people know they are pregnant way before they have a test or miss a period. Maybe some people are just more in tune with their bodies and whether or not there is some genetic or other scientic link I have no clue,but wanted to point it out. I think peoples' bodies are always talking,but we aren't always listening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, as a former food inspector ill say this. </p>
<p>People often think its the &quot;thing they ate the last&quot; that gives them the trots. However, if its an hour after dinner its likely the breakfast or lunch that day or the food from the day before that is the problem and not the item consumed immediately prior to the event. </p>
<p>If a food item is truly spoiled/contaminated and likely to cause illness after point of consumption it will likely cause indigestion and vomiting rather than immediate uncontrollable diarrhea. To get the trots an hour after consumption its probably something consumed some time prior that is the problem rather than that &quot;last thing&quot;. </p>
<p>There are exceptions and complications of course. However 95+++% of the time its probably something from the meal consumed hours before that's in question. (or in the case of certain &quot;slow brew&quot; food borne illnesses potentially days prior.)</p>
<p>Edit:
Well that blew up and got smeared with more than a few anecdotes of &quot;OMG you are so wrong here is a single instance why&quot;. Here is the average incubation times and duration of onset for various common food-borne illnesses which I'm referencing to. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm103263.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm103263.htm</a>
Also, consumption of large amounts of stimulants, toxins, or having metabolic problems or food allergies can lead to faster onsets of an event. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain <em>this</em>?  My wife and I went out to dinner and both of us had diarrhea within an hour after completing our meal at the exact same time.  And, no, we did not have any other previous meals together in the 24 hours that led up to our memorable dinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You and your wife more than likely ingested a preformed bacterial toxin. Depending on the food you both ate, you can could make a guess as to what was the &quot;most likely&quot; offending agent., especially if there was some mayonnaise based product that you both ate. An example would be the enterotoxin made by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. That toxin has a quick onset of diarrhea, typically an hour or so after the ingestion of the toxin, and causes diarrhea that lasts about 24 hours. </p>
<p>There are many different enterotoxins that exist and that is one way you can get diarrhea. The other would be ingesting the bacteria and having it survive the transit to the small intestine. If that happens, some bacteria can invade the wall of the gut and cause bloody diarrhea. Like <del>Cholera</del> Salmonella! Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Edit: Cholera just causes massive, uninhibited watery diarrhea and you die of dehydration. Had to fix that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Foods can irritate the digestive tract without having anything to do with bacteria or contaminated food. The post above is correct when it comes to food poisoning, but you can still easily eat something that will irritate your stomach and send the entire train speeding along almost immediately. Large amounts of fat or spices you don't normally eat or all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>Spoken as someone with IBS and a supertrain of a digestive system. Not to be too descriptive, but a lot of foods don't digest well for me, like vegetable fiber. So when my stomach is unhappy with what I ate, it's not unusual to see at least part of that meal make its way through in an hour. </p>
<p>So I imagine that would be possible with anyone if the system is irritated enough. Mine just happens to get irritated by just about everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that many people are extremely unwilling to believe this reality. As someone who sells food, it's frustrating. &quot;Your food made me sick.&quot; Did it? Probably not, but you're blaming me anyways.</p>
<p>Especially when the sickness comes out point A, it is at least understandable. If you eat some chicken salad, and then puke up chicken salad, it isn't unreasonable to assume that the chicken salad got you sick. Just turns out to not be true most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know people who are lactose intolerant that get the shits minutes after having any dairy product.</p>
<p>I personally have an intolerance to something, but I don't know what it is. I randomly get the shits about an hour after I eat fairly infrequently. After years of trial and error, I still haven't narrowed it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lactose intolerance is a bit different. It's not an allergy like bee stings and pollen in the &quot;traditional&quot; allergic reaction. Lactose intolerant people lack an enzyme, lac<em>tase</em>, to break down the sugar lactose. Other sugar examples are glucose and fructose for comparison. They have their own enzymes to break them down. When you cannot break down the sugar, it acts like a water sponge and draws water into the main tunnel of the bowel. It also adds like a big sugary treat for the bacteria in your gut, because if you cannot digest that delicious sugar, all the bacteria will! They show their appreciation by creating excess gas (since it's an end product in the breakdown of sugar) and causes the farts in conjunction with the diarrhea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the food a package being shipped by IPS (Intestinal Package Solutions). Lactose, for a lactose intolerant, is an &quot;expedited shipping&quot; label. </p>
<p>This analogy would make IBS a &quot;drop shipping&quot; or &quot;no signature required&quot;.....</p>
<p>Your body can &quot;see&quot; the lactose, and whatever interactions occur during the process will activate as soon as lactose enters your body. In your case, you may have a different type of intolerance, or it could be something else entirely - everyone's body is a little different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all fairness, things don't always pass through your digestive tract in the order they went in. Your digestive tract has mystifying powers of separating out different components of your food. I never would have thought this before, and only learned it because I have a bifurcated feeding tube so now instead of just having holes at the two ends of my GI tract, I also have direct access into my stomach and my jejunum. As it turns out, for example, I can digest the flesh of a banana but the teeny tiny black seeds from it will stay in my stomach much much longer after the rest of it has passed through the small intestine. I don't quite understand how this is possible, though I think likely it has to do with the curvature of the stomach, like maybe they get trapped in a curve.</p>
<p>Also, food <em>can</em> sit in your body and take a week or more to pass from your mouth into the toilet. The results of my sitzmark intestinal transit study proved that I had exactly that problem. If you were having that problem, however, it's highly likely that like me you would notice some pretty severe symptoms and seek medical attention. As an aside, it definitely wasn't meat causing the issue as I'm a vegetarian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that sounds like an interesting, if serious condition. My condition is in the sigmoid colon, so by the time it gets there, it's on the way out. I know what you mean about food staying in the stomach to be digested more thoroughly, and you're right. Just not how some folks describe it hanging out in your colon for days as other food goes on by. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, if you have a diet without any roughage (which a EXCLUSIVELY meat diet will tend towards), it can lead to constipation and stuff &quot;just sitting in your bowels for days&quot;. This is what leads to things like this <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anal-fistula/Pages/Symptoms.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anal-fistula/Pages/Symptoms.aspx</a> which you DO NOT WANT. </p>
<p>Without roughage the walls of the gut cannot &quot;grip&quot; the food passing through it and you end up with the system being driven by pressure from higher up the gut (not a good thing) rather than by the peristaltic movement of the lower gut and bowel walls. </p>
<p>The bowels dont like this and neither will you. Even small amounts of roughage will keep things moving.</p></div>		</li>
