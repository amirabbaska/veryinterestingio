			<div class="markdown"><p>Who said they wanted a profit? The issue with benefits (in some cases) is that people don't use it as a stepping-stone to build a better life for themselves. They use it as a crutch.</p>
<p>If I am using the case of my sister-in-law, who lives in the UK, she gets monthly payments for each child, free housing, free healthcare (including all meds) for her family, and income support (food expenses mostly). If she has other expenses like clothing, she can receive assistance through that (back to school clothing, backpacks and school supplies, etc. she has qualified for). Utilities are paid for with the exception of her TV/internet which is less than Â£30 a month. She actually makes enough money off of benefits that she is able to go out to eat once a week and enjoys drinks on the weekend (there's no problem with wanting to have a life, I get that, but it's all on the taxpayer's dime). She does not work and is a stay-at-home mom, and her children go to school for most of daytime hours. To top it off -- her boyfriend lives in her council housing, but she doesn't report him/his income. She doesn't want to report him because then she will lose her income support from the government. Her children need help, yes. But she is dependent on the system and manipulates it to her advantage.</p>
<p>Also, I'm a US landlord. I have many residents who are on low-income housing support and Section 8... and those that need it, I firmly stand by their right to have affordable housing and gladly pay that tax that helps them. Yet I also have residents on those programs that have lived off of it for 20, 25 years and who brag about how easy life is on the system and who I know don't need to be in the program.</p>
<p>I'm all for benefits, but want them to be used in the appropriate way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Whenever I bring up something like this up with people my age (just out of college) people say I'm heartless. I support the system, as a short term solution and a stop gap. Living off the system is ridiculous. I want to say that the kids should be taken away and put someplace that will support them properly, as the money she goes out on is meant for those children. She's neglecting them in some way. But I wouldn't want the kids to suffer by being separated from their mother, no matter how bad she may be for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the problem with your example is that I doubt most people in the rest of the world know enough about UK social assistance to know whether or not that is accurate (but persistent stereotypes about the poor being greedy and lazy will lead them to assume you are correct).  However, I know enough to see glaring inaccuracies that suggest that you don't know very much about social assistance in the UK either and have either made up that story or grossly exaggerated it.  For one thing, healthcare in the UK (including medications) is free for <strong>everyone</strong>.  It doesn't matter whether or not a person is rich or poor, has a couple of kids, a lot of kids, or none at all.  Every UK resident is entitled to free healthcare.  So using it as evidence that someone is gaming the system by having extra kids is ridiculous.  I also happen to know that some of your other remarks about the council housing and whatnot aren't 100% true either.  Although for specifics I'd have to do some research.  See, I have relatives in the UK too, so I know.  Difference is, you resent British people for having a country that gives a shit.  And you resent poor people for having anything but meager subsistence.  Do you want them in rags too?</p></div>		</li>
