<p>Why do people find watching other people die, interesting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people watch it to desensitise themselves to people dying: medics, police officers, firefighters, soldiers. If those people saw someone dying on the job and then freaked out it might cause more people to die. So instead, they watch videos of people dying until it's just &quot;wow that really sucks&quot; rather than &quot;oh god oh god oh god&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do people like to punch people in martial arts but loathe violent punks? Why do people watch horror movies but don't think of acting those things out? Why are there metalheads who aren't interested in killing people?</p>
<p>It is good to feel horrified, to feel depressed, to feel evil. These things are best done when they are controlled, and many people understand that. Many people know and feel that it is wrong to hurt others, yet they have these feelings. To sate them in a healthy way, they listen to metal, watch horror movies, do a martial art, or go to /r/watchpeopledie.</p></div>		</li>
