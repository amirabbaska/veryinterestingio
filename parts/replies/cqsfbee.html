<p>&quot;Layman-friendly&quot; doesn't mean that every layman has to get it. The more who understand it, however, the better example of LI5 it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A system that is unnatural (like a giant storm) and uses up energy will always, if no massive amount of new energy enters into the storm (like a hurricane moving over a body of evaporating warm water when it had previously just been over cold water), be weakened over time by natural forces (like temperatures slowly changing due to the way that heat works in a gas environment).</p>
<p>However, this weakening can cause new weather to occur (in this case, higher temperatures means faster particles, which means they tend to spread out more, which means a lower pressure, which allows winds to start as cold gas particles from higher pressure areas move up to the new low pressure area, bringing down the average temperature in the upper area, and returning it to its original cold temperature and high pressure: the bottom of the storm works with the same rules, but in the opposite scenario).</p>
<p>Effectively, thanks to the energy supplied to the system overall by the powerful streams of wind naturally caused by Jupiter's weather and rotation (called &quot;jet streams&quot; because Earth airplane pilots as far back as 1933 hitched a ride in the jet streams to cover more ground without forcing their planes to fly through the air any faster) and the balancing forces of &quot;radiative equilibrium&quot; (AKA &quot;temperature equality&quot;) and &quot;pressure-driven winds&quot;, the storm has been able to keep a relatively stable size and shape since at least 1831.</p>
<p>If there is anything you still don't understand, just let me know and I will try to give a better explanation.</p></div>		</li>
