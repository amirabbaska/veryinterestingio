<p>Dont think of an electron as orbiting around an atom but being &quot;stuck&quot; in an orbital.</p>

<p>Not really stuck, but more that it's in the whole orbital at the same time. Rather than thinking of electrons as moons orbiting a planet, think of them as layers of atmosphere around the nucleus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Search &quot;atomic orbitals&quot; and you will get some pretty neat pictures of where the electrons end up.</p>

<p>Neat looking, but mostly confusing until you get more into quantum mechanics and understand why everything past P looks like space flowers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly the S orbitals can be thought of as layers of atmostphere with 2 electrons in each layer, but the P orbitals are on opposite sides to each other with one electron in each lobe. One aspect of thinking of the electrons as &quot;trapped&quot; or &quot;stuck&quot; in an orbital helps the thought process of electrons &quot;jumping&quot; from one orbital to another and emitting or absorbing photons of a specific energy.</p></div>		</li>
