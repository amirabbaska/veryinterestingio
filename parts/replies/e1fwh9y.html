			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's a physical limit dependent on the finite speed of light. </p>
<p>The only electromagnetic radiation that can reach us, is that which has had enough time to travel to us given the age of the universe. Once you compensate for the accelerating expansion of space, it's a sphere whose radius extends about <del>45.7</del> 46.9 billion light years in any direction from your eyes. Anything further away than that is too far for the photons to have reached us.</p>
<p>Edit: updated distance to particle horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps a dumb question: if light has travelled 45.7 billion light years to get to us from the edge of our observable universe why/how do they say the universe is 13.8 billion years old? Presumably the source would have had to emit the energy 45.7 billions years ago in order to reach here. Is this where the expansion bit comes into play?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is difficult to grasp. In order for your OU to be different from mine, there would have to be photons that make it to you, but don’t make it to me. This doesn’t seem plausible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, your OU is effectively growing as time progresses. It's always centered on you, but the  source of that photon is in person A's OU, then subsequently person B's - by which time A's OU has grown further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this explanation helps: when trying to set up a counter-example, one could think that if your OU is bigger than mine, then you could just hold up a sign with what you see beyond my OU, and I could just read that (since you're obviously standing within my OU). However, note that there is some non-zero amount of time required for photons from your sign to reach my eyes. During the trip of these photons (from your sign to my eyes), my OU has grown, exactly by as much as the distance a photon can cover in that time.</p>
<p>In fact, this principle is the very definition of the observable universe.</p>
<p>To stick to your words: the photons that made it to you, but not me yet, need some more time to reach me. By the time they do, my observable universe has extended to include where the photons started. Before the time they reached me, my OU didn't include that place, by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But light outside the OU may never reach you...because space is expanding. So, how can it never reach you, but does reach the guy with the sign? Did the space between you and him finally do the photons in? There is something else to this for it to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it not possible that he sees things that you dont see because vision is how we interface with photons. And if there is more than one photon in this universe then most photons would enter the eyes of animals us included, but not yours, I mean the ones you get only you get them.</p>
<p>Another thing we all live in two universes as paradoxical as that is, I should say we divide the universe. Each of us has a universe on either side of our eyes, and they are equally primary to you as well as equally secondary depending on your state of mind. But we need to realize that we must experience each one inside of the other, so no two humans have had the same OUs they may have shared the outer world but every inner world is supposed to be unique though these days its a cookie cutter factory down here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that’s a pretty philosophical answer...I think for this to be true a photon from across the galaxy streaming towards us has to know or maintain linkage with where it originated from and it already knows at the time it departed where it will next interact. I mean it has to decide, yes, this guy right their is a valid point to land, but this guy behind him is not, he’s not observable. Otherwise, once it got near the two of us, it couldn’t know, yeah this guy is ok, but the guy back there, that’s out of my range. It already knew that when it first departed because that was the only point at which it was in fact within one OU but not the other.</p></div>		</li>
