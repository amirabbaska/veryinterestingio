			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, almost impossible for me to see decent people in any kind of pain or misery, let alone laugh at them. That’s why I can’t stand subreddits like /r/watchpeopledie but whatever people find entertaining, I guess. On the other hand, I think morbid curiosity is fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I literally find nothing funny about people hurting themselves.</p>
<p>Even someone farting in public or whatever, I just feel bad for them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This kind of &quot;autonomic empathy&quot; apparently increases with age. I'm just over 40 and now sometimes have to stop a movie or skip ahead when a character is embarrassed or humiliated. I literally sometimes have to remind myself that it's just a movie the way you might do to a little kid watching a scary movie.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too! I have to skip ahead, lower the volume (or mute), or put my hand in front of the screen when something really humiliating a cringe-worthy is happening. I absolutely hate the jokes at Jerry's expense on Park and Rec, but the rest of that show is hilarious.</p>
<p>I don't find this so much with physical pain... I can laugh at videos of people falling over all day - I only dislike it when there is a real injury show, or there is a very high chance of severe injury - especially head injuries.</p>
<p>I'm only 26 so I hope it doesn't get worse with age... :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Second hand embarrassment. I have this soooo baaaaad. In addition to feeling empathy instead of humour in painful situations, second hand embarrassment is also a kicker and is the main reason I can't watch most comedies. It's physically uncomfortable to the point where I need to leave the room sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It did for me, sorry. With 26 I would cringe, but I still could enjoy the movie. Nowadays there are a metric ton of movies that I didn't finish watching because of that. Not with physical pain scenes, but anything with social humiliation. </p>
<p>The funny thing is, I have no social anxieties at all. I'm able to make an ass out of myself and laugh it off. I even played amateur theater for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've never understood laughing at others when they fall or get hurt. I usually rush over to see if they're ok. I'm typically a very lone wolf in life, but feel a tremendous amount of empathy for others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda do both. I saw a kid falling on his head after he slipped at school. I rushed him half cackling like a maniac half trying to ask if he was ok.  </p>
<p>I think people found me more worrisome than the kid who smashed his head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I think adults either laugh or don’t laugh at people getting hurt, every baby I’ve ever played with fucking <em>loves</em> it when I pretend to get hurt in a dumb way. </p>
<p>Wonder what’s up with that. Regardless, I find it adorable</p></div>		</li>
