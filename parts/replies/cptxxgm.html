<p>Well, you could certainly just wait a full lifetime, and solve all those pesky disease problems at once. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The reason for this is because of the reproductive rate of the Virus or Pathogen in question, the r0. If you have an r0 of 1 then you have a low risk epidemic- One infected person will only usually infect 1 other person before either dying from the infection or their immune system recovering. An r0 of 2 however allows for exponential growth of the virus through human hosts. It doesn't take many infected people to start an epidemic and it doesn't take long either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not an expert, but the R0 is not a rate, it is just the reproductive number.  Infections can have a high R0 but aren't considered a break-out risk because their means of transmission.  For break-out risk, you're focused on high R0 (infect multiple patients), ease of transmission (ease of spread) and asymptomatic transmission (can spread before person knows they are ill).  Notably ebola doesn't score very high on these for the developed world....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as it takes the person with the weakest immune system to kill the virus.  And considering the some people (with AIDS or on chemo) have virtually no immune system, they would not be able to kill the virus.</p>
<p>So counting the entire human population, never.  I'd conjecture that the immune responses would be bell curve shaped so with, say 90-95% of the population you would have eradicated the virus within 2 months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they were required to stay at home with AIDS, on chemo and no immune system, they would die reasonably quickly themselves. Thus eliminating the virus that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something important I'd like to add which was also in the book: wiping out the common cold is <em>not</em> a good thing. They serve as a sort of &quot;training&quot; for our immune system. If we never get in contact with a minor illness like cold, our immune system will be too weak to fight some bigger diseases and we die from it more easily.</p></div>		</li>
