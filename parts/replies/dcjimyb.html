<p>this means companies are willing to purchase more goods from the UK</p>

<p>Lower value of the pound doesn't necessarily mean it's cheaper to buy from the UK.</p>
<p>We buy raw materials from abroad, which has became more expensive, negating the benefit of a devalued pound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basic economics.</p>
<p>The exchange rate (the value of the £ compared to other currencies) determines how expensive exports and imports will be.</p>
<p>A weakened £ means exports will be cheaper, and imports will be more expensive. As a result, more people will be buying UK exports, and fewer UK citizens will be buying imports from abroad.</p>
<p>As a result, more money is flowing into the UK economy (in the form of exports) than is leaving it (in the form of imports). More money coming into the economy means businesses that rely on international trade will flourish.</p>
<p>In short, the falling value of the £ can be said to be a good thing for the UK economy, and the businesses represented in the FTSE100 have had an exceptional year because of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all well and good, unless you heavily rely on imports to make the finished products in the first place, like the UK largely does.</p>
<p>On top of that, in the future we likely won't have free trade, putting us at a further disadvantage, both in terms of buying raw materials and selling finished products.</p>
<p>Plus, the FTSE100 isn't a very good measure - the government put billions into the FTSE100 after the Brexit vote (likely fearing a market crash), a better measure would be the FTSE500.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a UK company, global and it trades in the dollar. Since the decision our shares have been climbing back up. Call it a shitty business or whatever for those decisions, but it actually makes it far more attractive for them to want to keep work here for having a devalued pound.</p></div>		</li>
