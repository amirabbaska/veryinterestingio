			<div class="markdown"><p>I got this shit after bad deadlifts. I hadn't dead lifted in a couple years so I put 320lb just to see if I still do 5 reps of that still.</p>
<p>Boy when I tell you I heard a pop and my whole back crumpled and knotted up like a bear trap had been set off. I had never felt pain like this before. I just turned to Jello and hit the floor. It felt like a bull had stuck it's horns into either side of my lower spin and filled the holes with Sriracha. I felt like if I hadnt tensed up my shoulder blades would have naturally touched my ass cheeks and id have just turned into a human donut.</p>
<p>The next two weeks were the most excrutiating painful days of my life. My whole spine just stiffened up like cement. And my lower back had outward radiating burning sensations that went out to my love handles and down to my knees and thighs. I thought it was done and disabled. But thanks fate it just gradually went away after 2 weeks. By the end I could almost feel my spine spasm and unlock and disengage and rearrange itsself back to normal. It would audibly snap crackle and pop and all of a sudden some more range of motion would return like perks on an rpg skill tree. Until finally I at least feel 100% normal today.</p>
<p>The body is so weird....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think something similar happened to me last year, though all i was lifting was myself and my baby nephew off the couch. </p>
<p>i stood up and my back was just like &quot;hahahaha no, idiot&quot; and i went right back down. i was crying, my nephew was crying, my sister was irritated with me for making my nephew cry, it was a big mess. my mom made me take a muscle relaxer, and i couldn't even stand up for about three hours. i was horrified because this happened just a couple of days before i was scheduled to go in and take my GED test, but i must've been insanely lucky because over the next few days i only had some minor pain. </p>
<p>i'd hurt my back a little less than a year prior to this and spent 6-7 months with excruciating sciatica. when it finally went away, i thought everything was okay, but that pinched nerve was a grim reminder that my body is fucked... i feel legitimate fear anytime i pick something up now. </p>
<p>you're right, the body is so damn weird. also, your descriptions are amazing omg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be onto something. A few months before my deadlift injury I had lifted something for work and sored up my back for a couple days. Nothing major but it def made sitting idle mildly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You think I could have weakened it just enough to cause the deadlifts to throw it out completely?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have thrown out my back several times since a nasty fall a few years ago.  it's the same thing you are describing.  I think I have a bad disc, but when I do throw out this one specific muscle, all of the lumbar muscles around it seize up.  I have full range of motion for my whole body but when it's aggravated and I move wrong and try to engage those specific muscles, it literally feels like someone is holding a taser against my lower back and I lose the ability to control my leg on that side and I fall over.  It is the most painful thing I have ever encountered and the doc said it was exactly that.  Basically the nerve that runs through that part of my back is being held in a death grip by the muscles, so when they squeeze harder because they are damaged, the nerve fires like crazy to warn my brain about possible damage if I keep doing that, so my brain just shuts down all of the nerves in that vicinity for a moment to stop any possible damage from happening. </p>
<p>It really hurts.  A lot.  But it's pretty fascinating that the entire thing is an involuntary response by my body to try to reduce and prevent damage from happening.</p>
<p>Thankfully it has stopped happening since I started working on my core more and strengthening my back.</p></div>		</li>
