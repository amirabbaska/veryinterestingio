			<div class="markdown"><p>That's funny. When I got my truck I opted for vinyl on the floors for easy cleanup. One of my first jobs was washing cars, and getting sticky crap out of carpet was awful. We had a spray can of stuff that would freeze bubble gum so it would crumble for easier removal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just the floor mats that are rubber, right? Those are optional accessories on most cars, I don't think they're strictly linked to bottom-tier models. They're super handy to swap out when you go to the beach or something.</p></div>		</li>
