<p>If the deal goes south, the LPs lose their shirts but Bain still received money needed to pay its bills and people. So their might be a temptation for Bain to invest recklessly. So the LPs generally require the the GP contribute a certain amount of its own money as an LP interest. So when a deal goes well, they make money from that investment.</p>

<p>To be fair Bain isn't some upcoming high risk joke firm. Their reputation is <em>extremely</em> important to them so if they make a totally shit business decision they lose a lot more than just the dollar figure of losses. It'll be harder and harder to round up those investors next time around which is what their whole business model depends on. </p></div>		</li>
