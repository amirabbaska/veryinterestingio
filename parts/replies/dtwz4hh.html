			<div class="markdown"><p>Both, depending on what it is. For instance if you drink spoiled milk it's the byproducts that will get you. But let's say you didn't cook your steak through and then leave it out and a colony of salmonella move in. Now it's the critters themselves that will fuck you up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are exotoxins and endotoxins. Exotoxins are proteins that are made by bacteria and secreted as byproducts. Endotoxins are actually harder to deal with because they are some of the components that make up the bacterial cell. When you heat up food, you kill the bacteria (which cannot make additional exotoxins) and you denature the existing exotoxin. However, the endotoxins remain and are sort of released as bacterial cells lyse. They don't denature in heat like exotoxins do. If its in your food, it can give you food poisoning, but if you have a bad systemic infection, killing that bacteria can put you in septic shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The byproducts, although in a way you could say the little critters are toxic as well, as they can get into an open wound or colonize your digestive system and produce a steady stream of toxins that get into your bloodstream and poison you. In the case of eating and drinking, they will almost always get destroyed by your immune system, but all the toxins they produced before entering your body will still be able to poison you. Very rarely would they be able to colonize the gut of a healthy adult, so it's the toxins already produced that cause the food poisoning.</p></div>		</li>
