			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not be as straight forward as the physics formulas you learned in high school or college... The brain works using patterns. So, throwing a ball, using a certain muscle memory for the motions, add on conscious effort for distance... sure, you got the ball to its destination. But the brain isn't calculating for distance or analyzing the parabola of the ball, it's following every successful throw it's previously made. </p>
<p>Because the brain works via patterns, it strengthens those patterns that succeed. So, throwing a ball accurately is just the brain recognizing what muscles need to activate in order to get the ball from here to there. This is why &quot;practice makes perfect&quot;. There might be different muscle patterns for the line drive and the hail mary, but accurate passes are nothing more than a brain's approximation (best guess) of what works best. If all you throw is short rockets, then a deep pass will, as an unfamiliar pattern, likely miss. </p>
<p>To sum up, the brain is essentially storing then comparing actions and results. The more experience (i.e. actions and results) you have, the more accurate your brain can predict the result of your next action. </p>
<p>If the action is throwing a ball and the result is observing physics, then your brain will essentially approximate physics via experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can apply mathematical concepts to brain processes, but that doesn't really mean that the brain is <strong>doing</strong> math. The same could be said of the physical universe. This may be more of a philosophical distinction though. Maybe others have a different take.</p></div>		</li>
