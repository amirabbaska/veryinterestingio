<p>That's not a battery, then.  That's just called nuclear fuel.  It'd be like saying your car runs on gasoline batteries.</p>
<p>A battery is a reduction reaction that moves electrons between two dissimilar metals.  It's literally the motivation and exchange of electrons.  The energy is stored in the potential energy of electrons wanting to move from one material where they're concentrated to one where they're not.  Because this energy is literally electrons pushed up a gradient, the way to release this energy is to let the electrons flow down the gradient - electrons flowing is literally electricity.  This is why batteries store electricity.</p>
<p>A fuel is a chemical compound that has energy stored inside chemical bonds.  Heating the fuel above some activation point will cause the bond to break, emitting more heat and continuing the reaction.  Chemical bonds have a lot more potential energy than electron potentials in a cathode-anode system ever will.  But you also don't magically get electrons flowing from this.  You have to convert the energy through several steps to get it to push electrons.  Hence no such thing as a hydrocarbon battery.</p>
<p>A nuclear fuel is a mass with energy stored inside its nuclear bonds.  Fissioning that (and along similar lines, fusioning it) releases about 1 millionx the energy of a carbon-hydrogen bond.  But you still have the same problem.  This energy release does not manifest itself as flowing electrons.  So you have to go through a roundabout process to do so.  </p>
<p>The closest thing you could get would be 'nuclear battery' that uses the constant (but decreasing) decay heat from a radio-isotope wrapped in thermocouples that convert the heat to electricity.  But this doesn't store energy. It constantly, inefficiently provides electricity.  Still not the same thing - you'd want to couple the system with a real battery to buffer the energy output.</p>
<p>These things all work on fundamentally different principles.  You can't just take a completely different energy source and slap the word 'battery' onto it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electron potentials are generated by chemical reactions so I'm not sure how they would really have much more energy per mass since its still just chemicals.</p>
<p>The huge thing that makes combustion much more mass efficient is that of runs on atmospheric oxygen. You only have to carry around 1/Â³ of the reactants unlike a battery which is entirely self contained</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we can create self sustaining fusion reactions small enough to work as a battery we probably would not need to worry about the radiation, as I am sure the sheilding involved in making such a thing would be advanced enough to handle it, and once you turned it off all radiation ceases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern lithium ions are great compared to alkalines and the market is competitive with major companies (Panasonic, LG, Samsung) offering close performance to each other (because they all make the most of available tech). The Tesla megafactory and their partnership with Panasonic has put a lot of thought into optimizing not just the chemistry but physical construction with a slightly larger (21700) size than the ubiquitous 18650.</p>
<p>Ask e-cig (vape) or powerful flashlight owners and they'll tell you, battery tech isn't bad or stagnant-- disposable alkalines are. </p></div>		</li>
