			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only answer in the thread that attempts to answer the question. I don't even know if it's accurate, but all of the other answers say &quot;S is higher than A because S is higher than A&quot; or they make a metal gear joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any source for that? According to Japanese wikipedia, it comes from the English words &quot;Special&quot; or &quot;Superior&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/S" target="_blank">劇場や競技場、業績等のランクで特別 (Special) または優れた (Superior) の意味で、A級のさらに上位の階級を表す。S級、S席など。また、Sより上のランクでSを2、3文字重ね合わせてSSや、SSSを付けることもある</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ifromjipang: My source was two Japanese expats who went to school through first and second year (respectively) university in Japan, and it was a conversation with a sketch that occurred 18 months and 6 months ago. The conversations were related, and we discussed the grading system in the school system, and how it mirrored in the Japanese gaming design culture. Do you feel that my observation is valid, or are we getting hung up on my limited knowledge of Japanese language? I admit that I may have conflated &quot;Excellent&quot; with &quot;Superior&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
