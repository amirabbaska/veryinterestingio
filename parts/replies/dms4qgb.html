			<div class="markdown"><p>I have hypothesized for many years that there is a progressively shortening exponential curve of development that happens every time there's a revolution in information technology that significantly increases the ability to exchange ideas. </p>
<p>It starts with the invention of language itself, then written language, then the printing press, then the telephone and mass literacy, and now the internet via a smart phone. </p>
<p>With each development followed a great change in human culture that democratizes power and creates an expanding shared culture. And after each cycle, the next revolutionary development seems to follow a pattern of taking progressively shorter time to arrive. </p>
<p>So whatever happens after the internet has had its moment, I think we can expect it to happen very quickly, to massively democratize power, solidify a global shared culture, and perhaps be the end of this pattern as I'm not sure it could reduce any further.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me to. I wouldn't say information technology but progress happens faster when communication improves and when you think about it, it makes sense. Even the most intelligent, most creative person couldn't invent things in a vacuum, those people take the ideas of others and build on them and in turn other people develop those ideas further and over time society transforms.</p>
<p>We started out in caves or in small tribes, communication would have been fairly basic. Then we developed language and that allowed us to transmit ideas to other members of the tribe. We started to create settlements, villages and then towns. We invented writing and ideas could be passed to people outside and our descendent. By today's standards progress was slow, after all not everyone could read or write but every generation was moving forward slightly faster than the last.</p>
<p>Cities grew and grew. In London, for example, the population doubled in the 17th Century and doubled again in the 18th. As you say the printing press was a huge leap, as was improving education, better healthcare and better infrastructure. In the 20th Century we saw even more improvements in those things, we have universal education for children in most of the world, workers have more rights and have more free time. We can now move easily between cities and even continents thanks to transportation. We can communicate with people anywhere in the world thanks to the telephone and the internet allows communication without requiring it to happen simultaneously.</p>
<p>It's crazy to me but this is going to happen more and more. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait until we have brain chips that allow us to communicate instantly to anyone. If only we worked together a bit more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omnipotent is definitely the wrong word, but I think I get your meaning. </p>
<p>Self delusion is the ultimate root of all suffering,  and the biggest delusion is that you exist,  as in a &quot;you&quot; that exists apart from everything and everyone else. </p>
<p>We are all random fluctuations in a continuum of matter that occasionally and briefly peaks high enough to allow a tiny portion of that continuum to see a fraction of itself just long enough to wonder about its own existence, then suddenly the peak falls and is again indistinguishable from the rest of the universe. </p>
<p>The illusion that there is any meaningful separation between you and anyone else will probably be impossible to maintain once we have a global shared consciousness, via a chip in the head or whatever we come up with. </p>
<p>We are already the most cooperative mammal on the planet, but I think we're likely destined to get vastly more so.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The end of the cycle would be truly instant and universal communication,  like a literal global shared consciousness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability of the brain to process knowledge is complete shit. Not just that it's terribly slow (a computer can read Gigabytes of data every second), storage is also modifying the data (your memory is often wrong) or outright deleting it (we call it forgetting).</p>
<p>Imagine what you could do if in a few seconds you could not only correctly read and remember all research ever done on a topic but also think about it as much as all university professors and students do together in a few years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of this is also the distance across which you are communicating. </p>
<p>In each of those cases of development the range of those communication technologies grew. </p>
<p>So part of the next leap in communication will be to deal with range, probably a way to communicate faster through space to satellites and shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 to this</p>
<p>The ease of sharing knowledge after the invention of the printing press is a major turning point. It meant that knowledge was no longer in the hands of a select few. </p>
<p>While there are some people in history who have had brilliant ideas completely out of the blue, most progress takes place as a result of building on the ideas of others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Chinese were ahead of the West on this, but probably hampered by the lack of an alphabet.  The Koreans invented an alphabet--but their elites tried to suppress it for some time.  There was an established nature of Western alphabets, Latin as a <em>lingua franca</em>, the tradition of the Church in preserving texts and later printing them, and the constant warring in Europe with no continent-wide power that could suppress printing.  All of that might have been necessary for the Renaissance to progress.</p></div>		</li>
