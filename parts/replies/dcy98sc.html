<p>If I had to speculate: Everyone has bad ideas sometimes, even the best and brightest folks, but when it's the boss who has a bad idea it's a lot more dangerous. I've seen horrible projects get released because some director wanted it that way, and either everyone was too scared to tell the boss their idea was shit, or they did and the boss didn't listen.</p>
<p>If everyone is on an equal footing then people will still have bad ideas, but then their peers can say &quot;Hey, maybe if we did this instead.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gabe is a data/insight focused person. The book he recommends for management, &quot;Peopleware&quot;, is one of the most scientific books on management I've ever read, it quotes studies for most pieces of management advice it offers. </p>
<p>So I assume that you're right, but I imagine he might've read studies on the subjects or he found information that led him to believe this was the best way to do it. Or maybe he just thought of it, I dunno. </p>
<p>The only tidbit in &quot;Peopleware&quot; that points to Valve's eventual structure is a part about project management, and how one study tested having deadlines according to 3 structures - having the managers set deadlines, having the team set deadlines, or have no deadline at all. </p>
<p>The groups that had no deadlines came out ahead. They worked faster. That was one of the pieces of information, I think, that might have led Newell to make the decision he did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way I could thrive without deadlines would be in a pair programming or other intensively team-oriented environment. On my own, the ADD kicks in, and deadlines are the only way work gets done. </p>
<p>Which makes me wonder what else is special about the environment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately in a self-organizing group without an official leader, unofficial leaders will organically appear along with some semblance of social structure. I've worked jobs with true, proper management and even then certain people with more dominating personalities would easily win out in any meeting. In a setting where there is no manager to consider business needs over personal, one can easily imagine the domineering to win out over the quiet, contemplative. </p>
<p>Having a strong hiring process, and not being afraid to take action on a bad hire certainly help, but having an organization with great freedom can result in some unpleasant side-effects. Oftentimes no one wants to do the dirty work, the maintenance and hard bug fixes. Products rot and die, other products do not get built. In the case of Valve, I've read many an allegation that Half Life 3 has fallen victim to folks not wanting to be a part of the project. Google, organizationally, does bear some similar structure and there's a reason why so many of their projects are sidelined, unsupported, and get killed off.</p>
<p>I firmly believe, Valve, as any other company is a victim to unintended consequences. Incentive &quot;innovation&quot; and folks will flock to the new shiny thing for glory and honor. Prioritize &quot;flawless&quot; software, don't be surprised your product is stuck years behind. It's no surprise Valve is still able to hold such a policy, they're practically printing money with Steam. However for every open and innovative Google, there are companies that failed or realized they needed real, explicit management and structure to function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also the Oculus move - there's a comment at hacker news recently (would have to find it) about how the VR team basically moved itself into Oculus with all the tech and they were quickly acquihired by Facebook, turning themselves into millionaires. In a bossless structure, the decision was made, I suppose, by the team itself. A very curious turn of events that many people at Valve are bitter about (again, according to the commenter). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The structure at valve allows that kind of instance to occur, but the focus is then on the people that they hired, not the bosses. Its a lesson the entire company learns, not just a mistake everyone from below would have ordinarily crucified upper management for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. The commenter did say he was against it and so were other people in the company but the team was free to make their own decision.  </p></div>		</li>
