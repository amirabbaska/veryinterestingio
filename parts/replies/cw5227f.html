			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there,
The effectiveness is already tested on different mice models. We need 3 to 4 years before being able to go to phase 1 of clinical trial.

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 years from phase 1 is still something like 8 years from market even if everything goes perfectly. As someone who has been involved in biotech investments, I'm very curious to know how you've prepared to get extra resources to handle the massive jump between phase 1 and 2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you have a molecule in mind the standard quoted figure in the journals is &quot;20 years&quot; til market. At this point though, it's almost become drug industry law.</p>
<p>In reality, that's probably the mid-point of someones range. It is a fairly useful benchmark though. </p>
<p>I would say if they have the molecule sorted and a financial backer, 5-15 years til Human trials (after pre-clinical testing, etc).  IF you can't patent it, it might somewhat slow down the funding and motivation to push it to market. </p></div>		</li>
