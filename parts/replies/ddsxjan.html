			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinton might have had only a few agents in a place no one knew he was going to be, but security at publicized events is still very strict. George W Bush spoke at a conference last year, where the attendee list had to be finalized a month in advance, and registration required you to consent to whatever background check the Secret Service decided to do on 400 people. I didn't see his on-site security, but I know there were restrictions on when attendees could leave the room, enter the room, and everyone had to stay put at the end of the speech. </p>
