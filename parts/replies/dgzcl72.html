			<div class="markdown"><p>In an editorial he wrote Asimov also tells of a time when he wrote a short story and has it rejected for being too similar to another story received by his publisher a couple weeks earlier. Similar names, events, the whole nine yards. Only neither of the authors had communicated in any way while working on these stories. Sometimes it is just the appearance of plagiarism the we try to avoid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The melody of the Chainsmokers' &quot;Closer&quot; is the same as the background piano melody during the chorus of The Fray's &quot;Over My Head.&quot; Instead of stopping sales on the song, they added two of The Fray as songwriters to collect on revenue.</p></div>		</li>

They just randomly come up with an already existing sentence, and then my room of leech lawyers starts trying to suck blood out of stones (unfortunately not the rolling type) to pay for the eventual defense.</p>
<p>It's a mess.</p></div>		</li>
