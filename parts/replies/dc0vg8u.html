There were a couple of monitors with these images and I thought they were just for show until someone started telling me all about it. Pretty awesome that we can check it out online.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, as I type this, antenna 63 in Madrid is communicating with Voyager 1 (probably the contact details of some alien life form, well, one can hope)! </p>
