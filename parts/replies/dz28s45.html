However, he decided to use the last couple sentences to directly insult the pope. That’s why he was found to be “vehemently suspect of heresy” and the book was forbidden. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, I think that those with any investment into their faith will undoubtedly attempt to reconcile evolution with their faith, coming to the conclusion that either 1) evolution is incorrect or 2) evolution is true but god(s) was an influencing factor.</p>
<p>However, when taking a step back and considering evolution for what it is and how it works, the beauty of it is that it doesn’t NEED god, or any other spiritual phenomena to work. The idea of a god is wholly unnecessary in explaining the origin and development of life genetic complexity. </p>
<p>Now THAT is why I think it is a ‘symbol of atheism’, as you say. Because it neatly swats away gods hand in the creative process of ‘things so complicated and beautiful, like the eye’ which ‘couldn’t happen by accident’. Evolution tells us exactly how complexity and design-like structures emerge out of natural processes, and you no longer need a divine designer or creator to rationalise the <em>improbability</em> that they have emerged as they have.</p>
<p>To quote Douglas Adams:</p>

<p>It's not bland pro-Christian stuff either. I mean, you can definitely see his roots in his writing, but it's still pretty good stuff, imo, and I'm a bit more agnostic, myself. <em>including things like restoring your mental engrams to a clone/new body after you died.</em></p>
<p>I was raised a Roman Catholic, and it's not any scientific stuff that's really caused me to &quot;lose my faith&quot; but more of the shit I've had to deal with over the years, and seeing shit that others do as well.</p>

<p>My counter to this is that it’s damn near impossible for any one person in particular to win the powerball, but powerball wins occur. What I mean is that if you pick someone at random and let them play powerball or any lottery, they will likely never win the jackpot since powerball is 1 in 175,000,000 or something. However, if 175,000,000 people are playing, there’s a good chance for one of those people to win. There’s also a chance for them to not win since statistics work in wonderful ways.</p>
<p>Basically, given a X amount of precursors and Y amount of time, with proper environmental factors, single cell life is bound to happen. And not just one type of single cell either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It would make more sense if he became agnostic out of scientific skeptcism. When you believe that there are lots of unanswerable answers and decides to apply science on them, you usually find out that either the questions are wrong or there are very mundane answers, and once you realize that, you drop religion like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hMp65SzyTU" target="_blank">The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, whom plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table in 1998</a>.</p>
<p>It could be an excuse to leave him alone though, as people tend to not mess with other people's grief.</p></div>		</li>
