<p>I think what OP is referring to would be something like teleportation. If you could Battlestar Galactica-esque jump from point A to point B, in a way such that if you jumped to a point 1 Lightyear away from Earth, you would see the light from a year ago when you pointed your telescopes at Earth. And if you jumped back to Earth after 10 minutes, you wouldn't have missed the whole reign of America's Pumpkin King. You'd just have missed the ad-break on your Seinfeld rerun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;FTL but never backwards in time relative to the CMB&quot; would be possible. It would violate probably the most fundamental assumption of relativity, that all reference frames have the same laws of physics, but it would lead to a (new) self-consistent framework. Every observer can agree if something goes backward in time relative to the CMB, and if nothing does you don't have causality violations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would that even work though?</p>
<p>If you’re not violating causality you’re not going faster than light. Or are we referring to a hypothetical space where everything it twice as far away, but you travel twice as fast? If that’s the case isn’t that what relativity already does? Your length compactification can be thought of as the universe getting longer and distances increasing while you simultaneously approach infinite speed, which is effectively what actually happens from the travelers point of view.</p>
<p>Meaning the OP is just describing traveling from the travler’s point of view that is near the speed of light in units from their own reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only if you use the relativistic notion of causality, but we talk about a deviation from relativity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you talking about here? Any literature you can point me to? I don't think I've ever heard of such a thing. Is this the concept of a timelike curve created at some point in the future, where a thing could travel along it after its creation close to the point of origin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? It is something in between SR and classical mechanics. Causality is preserved, you have no closed timelike curves. In the preferred reference frame everything goes into the future. This is quite obscure, but models along this line are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08771" target="_blank">discussed</a> once in a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that in quantum field theory, to obtain unitarity the probability amplitudes must allow for travel (of virtual particle paths which I know aren't real and are the same as probability amplitudes) outside of the light cone. But beyond that point, if observed position is on-shell, then the particle was traveling consistent with the c velocity limit. The point I do not understand though, is how quantum mechanics is any different than classical if the particles are always found on-shell, whereas if they are sometimes found off-shell outside the light cone, that would violate c. Can you help clarify this for me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at virtual particle propagators in coordinate-space, they're not exactly zero outside the light cone, although they do decay exponentially.</p>
<p>What enforces causality in QFT is that the field operators commute with themselves outside of the light cone. For a scalar field, [φ(x),φ(y)] = 0 if x and y are spacelike-separated events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Well, so I guess my question now is, if the virtual particles decay exponentially outside the light cone, and if the light cone is what I understand to represent being &quot;on-shell&quot;, and if field operators commute with themselves outside the light cone to enforce causality, then are observable events always on-shell or not? If they are always on-shell, then isn't that just classical mechanics, and so what was the point of going quantum? If they are not, then doesn't that risk violating causality?</p></div>		</li>
