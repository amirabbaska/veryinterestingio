			<div class="markdown"><p>this should not be the top comment. Polynesians navigated to Hawaii starting from Taiwan, they did not float there by accident from South America like Thor Heyerdahl was trying to prove.</p>
<p>The simple explanation is that Polynesians were able to tell their direction using the sun, stars, and ocean swells. You can look up a film called the navigators or look up the hokulea for more info. They could also follow birds (season after season starting from where they lost them last year) and see land refracted in clouds. Another sign you were near land was coral reefs.</p>
<p>The evidence is that these people set out on purposeful journeys of colonization and exploration in large (50 feet outriggers) canoes with plenty of supplies like taro, breadfruit, pigs, etc... to establish their food sources on the islands they discovered.</p></div>		</li>
