<p>Thee only way I've really thought about this working, or an example of it, is trying to think of a random object/thing/action, anything, and continually try to do that. No matter how hard I try, one thing can't come without a few other related hints coming to mind, even if I think f something &quot;unrelated&quot; over and over again. If memory is a neural network, and our actions work the same way (in a sense), then there is both a reactionary effect (when you dodge a ball) as well as the intent to do so, or &quot;organic&quot; action without stimuli.</p>
<p>To me, animals have a lot less of the intent working for them, and much more reaction. My dog will come up to me for scratches, and he made that decision, but is it a reaction to an itch, boredom, etc?</p></div>		</li>
