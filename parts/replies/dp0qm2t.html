			<div class="markdown"><p>We already use certain plants to absorb the radioactive contamination. Sunflowers for example are in use in Fukushima prefecture as bioremediation. They absorb the cesium and strontium from the soil, they get harvested, incinerated in a special facility built on the grounds of the power plant, and the ash is captured, concentrating the radioactive material and allowing it to be safely disposed of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would it do that?
I mean, okay, the fungus ingests radioactive material, and continues to do so.
You're still left with radioactive fungus all over the place, which contains the same materials, though probably in a chemically different form, perhaps easier to manage.</p>
<p>They can't make it less radioactive though, not a bit.</p></div>		</li>
