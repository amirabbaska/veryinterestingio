<p>Uh, I remember this funny stuff from a Japanese restaurant - I don't drink alcohol, so my choice was quite limited, so I opted for this lemonade. Which turned out to have a strange chewing gum flavor - and a bottle seal I have never seen before!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a soda. It is a lemon lime flavor that kinda actually tastes like bubble gum to me. Ramune come from the English word &quot;lemonade&quot;. There are all sorts of other flavors like melon, lychee, mango, strawberry (ichigo), etc. It is very difficult to get the marble out, no real worry about choking. You can now find them in Asian food aisles in grocery stores.</p></div>		</li>
