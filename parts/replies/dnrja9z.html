			<div class="markdown"><p>Whose momentum has to be preserved?
if its the original particles momentum, and those original particles exist  afterward, how does one conserve momentum while extracting energy to create the new particles? </p>
<p>Is it because there is now more mass, that all the particles don't need to be traveling as fast to contain the same momentum?</p>
<p>When particles collide head on, does the conservation of momentum say the result can be stationary saving you that energy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The <strong>total</strong> momentum needs to be preserved. Before the collision the total momentum is the momentum of the moving proton (when shooting at a stationary target). With all particles at rest the total momentum is zero. </p>

<p>Not sure what to answer here. I have difficulty to reason about kinematics in special relativity intuitively myself. I just cling to the math :) </p>

<p>Yeah, when they collide head on with equal but opposite momenta the total momentum before the collision is zero so it has to be zero after the collision as well. </p>
<p>This <em>can</em> mean that all four particles are at rest. It also can mean that the momenta just add up to zero (for example the particles fly into four different directions at a 90Â° angle with the same speed).</p>
<p>I think that they <em>can</em> be zero is not really interesting in general but is handy here because we are trying to figure out the <em>threshold</em> energy, so we are calculating the initial kinetic energy <em>assuming</em> that all particles are at rest after the collision.</p></div>		</li>
