			<div class="markdown"><p>So my memory is pretty fuzzy on this, but didn't they die from sudden lack of phosphate levels in their blood, because the sudden large intake of food allowed for the production of a large amount of ATP which sequestered the small amount of phosphate in circulation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well-intentioned soldiers in WWII essentially killed a lot of holocaust victims initially because they liberated the camps, found starving people and immediately started handing out their rations to them. Re-feeding syndrome occurs because the bodies stores of electrolytes are depleted...when food is then ingested it needs electrolytes to digest it, which pulls what little electrolytes remain out of circulation to do so. If too much is ingested at once then those electrolyte levels become critically low. The phosphate/ATP is a big factor but I'm sure other electrolytes like magnesium, potassium, sodium and calcium are also problematic since you need them for proper nerve conduction and cardiac function. So as soon as those poor starving souls stuffed those rations down they were doomed, probably relatively quickly succumbing to cardiac arrest or fatal arrhythmia. I like to think though at least they died happy thinking they were saved and with a full belly...still shitty but a better end than they were probably expecting. </p>
<p>When a starving individual is treated today (at least in part thanks to what we learned during WWII) re-introducing food is a slow process, starting with small amounts of relatively easy to digest foods and only after dehydration and electrolyte depletion has been addressed parenterally. My first guess would be IV ringers lactate solution and dextrose, close monitoring of blood serum electrolyte levels, IV electrolytes as needed...but I'm not an expert, just know some medical stuff and taking an educated guess. </p>
<p>Edit: Forgot a few things. </p></div>		</li>
