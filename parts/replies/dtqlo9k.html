			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it's the same family of hardware, you still need to emulate all the quirks of the console - weird behaviors, bugs, different design decisions. You're not just executing the same game on different hardware - it wouldn't work. You're moving all the differences into software; say, your PC's gfx card has 250 different shaders built in, the console has only 30 - but out of these 30, about 4 exist that match none of the 250 of your PC's gfx card at all; the emulator needs to create these in software.</p>
<p>There was a funny business sometime around '2000, with Nvidia Riva Vanta gfx cards series. Somehow, NNidia got into a conflict with Microsoft. Microsoft was about to release new DirectX, a software that standarizes which shaders are available to applications. Due to the conflict, Microsoft refused to tell NVidia what are the shaders planned to be included, and NVidia didn't want to wait for the official announcement - they made some informed guesses basing on state of the art and what they deemed most useful and &quot;in demand&quot;.</p>
<p>And they guessed wrong. The card had some of most advanced shaders of the time, which nobody could use due to lack of DirectX compatibility, and NVidia, to retain compatibility and remain relevant, had to rush the missing shaders implemented in drivers of the card - in software - resulting in abysmal performance.</p>
<p>The card quickly went into the 'budget' shelf, NVidia had to do a lot of catching up, and general bad taste remained.</p>
<p>Still, it can be summed up as NVidia <em>emulating</em> the card &quot;as it should be&quot; with card &quot;as it was&quot; and an extra software layer in the drivers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed! Although the control isn't ultimate. If Microsoft tries to push its weight around too much, gfx cards manufacturers will just reach an agreement and move to OpenGL leaving Microsoft out in the cold with a system that rapidly becomes obsolete.</p>
<p>Thing is negative pressure from Microsoft would need to outweigh the negative pressure of directly cooperating with straightforward competitors. Microsoft can bully one manufacturer or another, but not all of them at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true.</p>
<p>They even made an entire console line (the Xbox, originally known as the DirectXbox) just to make people who port from console to PC use DirectX.</p>
<p>Game engines with support for multiple graphical API's are coming out, and the open-source community's Vulkan, as well as Apple's Metal API's are really good, so this might change in the future.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could imagine that but nowadays directx is very versatile and its specs are well known so complying to them isn't exactly a constraint plus they are more or less similar with other API. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, what exactly do you mean by &quot;shaders&quot; here? Shaders are small programs executed on the GPU, written by the app developer. They are most definitely not built in.</p></div>		</li>
