			<div class="markdown"><p>The body composition explanation makes total sense. Annecdotally, one time when I got very lean as a teenager, around 8-10% bf, and went to the sea in the summer, I'd notice that, unlike before, I could barely handle spending more than 15 minutes in the water before I started shaking and that never happened before. That's why all aquatic mammals have considerable body fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is this relatively well known idea in anthropology called the aquatic ape hypothesis. It points to certain features of our anatomy and behavior that seem indicative of having lived by the sea/ocean for an extended period of time in pre-history, certainly long enough to affect our evolution.</p></div>		</li>

I remember summer at the beach last year when I had a 10%BF. it was scorching hot and even the water wasnt cooling people enough yet there I was freezing my ass of in the middle of July in water. muscles help warm up in winter but its still not as effective as fat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely! Muscle won't help you there, you're in constant contact with water, a great thermal conductor, which is at a much lower temperature than your body temp and is steadily syphoning heat away from your body because there is barely any insulation between the two of you.</p></div>		</li>
