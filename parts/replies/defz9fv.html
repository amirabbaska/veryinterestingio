			<div class="markdown"><p>within a actual/full dog family the puppies will lick the adult dog's faces for up to about a year (for the exact reasons you stated), at about that time the adults kind of snap at them to let them know that behavior is no longer tolerated. </p>
<p>Many humans seem to love it so they never learn to stop licking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, domesticated dogs (as well as most domesticated animals) keep a lot of their traits from being young, so it's a kept trait for dogs to lick like their puppies, even into adulthood, because we like, it reinforces through positive feedback, and it's natural for pets to keep traits from being young </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think humans who don't like it also often miscommunicate that we don't. My dog loves to lick my face and if I push her away with my hands, she keeps doing it. If I push her off with my forearm, she gets the message and stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had a lot more success acting like a dog to my pups. I growl occasionally, and other things they do to each other. Ones a real bully over her little sister. </p>
<p>I did end up with a broken tooth when I tried to play their teeth smacking game</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 4yo Chihuahua mix obsessively licks my 13yo Feist. The older one used to hate it and growl to make her stop, but now she seems to enjoy it and reacts just like a human is petting her, leaning into it and whatnot.</p>
<p>Does anyone else's dogs do tricks for other dogs hoping for the same reward that they get from humans? The older one will &quot;high five&quot; (basically smack with her paw) the other, just like she does with me, to get the younger dog to lick her. The younger one will &quot;sit pretty&quot; (like a meerkat) if the older one has a toy that she wants.</p>
<p>The weird part is that <em>they comply with the requests</em>, every time. It's really strange to watch them interact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My family has a rescued pitt bull mix that was either used by a &quot;breeder&quot; or a puppy mill. </p>
<p>She compulsively licks. Like, literally non-stop. I am a dog person, I have met a lot of dogs that lick before but nothing compares to her. If you sit with her and let her lick you she will not stop until you forcefully stop her.</p>
<p>I've always wondered if it was some compulsive dysfunction from being forced into motherhood perpetually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a rottie that did the same and I raised her from a puppy so I know there wasn't any weirdness in her past.  When a 90 lb. Rottweiler wants to lick you... you'z getting licked.  I was okay with it most of the time but sometimes she ate poop :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a male miniature dachshund we got as a puppy. He was bred by a neighbor and lived in their house so we know he was never abused.  Yet he compulsively licked. He licked one of our other dogs until they had a little bald spot, and he'd lick the couch until there was a giant wet spot.</p>
<p>Never figured out why, just assumed he was naturally a little OCD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My family used to raise dogs. Sometimes I would lick the puppies back for kicks. 100% of the time they looked weirded out by this. Personal conclusion: they know we're not the same kind of animal and that we don't show affection by licking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this with my puppy (actually 3yo dog now) who is a walking tongue. He seemed amused, let it happen, then came back with a violent barrage of licks.
He tastes gross though so this has only happened once. Now we mess with him by just sniffing his neck, and his response is still an insane licking attack :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always just assumed dogs and cats view petting as our version of licking them to show affection. Since they don't have hands they use their mouth/tongue/nose, so from their perspective I guess our hands are just mouths to them. </p></div>		</li>
