			<div class="markdown"><p>Well...kind of.</p>
<p>100g of rare cooked rump steak will have the same calories as 100g of well done cooked rump steak. So two steaks from the same cut, that weigh the same after cooking will have the same calories.
The problem is that the steak loses more mass from fats and water loss the more you cook it.<br />
i.e. two uncooked steaks weighing 100g will <strong>not</strong> have the same number of calories if cooked to different degrees.</p>
<p>Usually the nutritional information on uncooked products will have an &quot;assuming you followed the directions&quot; label or &quot;assuming medium cook&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have to cook them exactly following the labels. It was worst with some products that were clearly uncooked when taken out of the oven following the manufacturers instructions. </p>
<p>Sometimes made the lab smell lovely though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. A calorie is a measure of energy, gas fires and boilers are measured in the calories they produce, enabling a quick measure of how much heat they will ultimately produce.</p></div>		</li>
