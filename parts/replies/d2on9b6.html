			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the study you are referring to is <em>Antidepressant Drug Effects and Depression Severity: A Patient-Level Meta-analysis</em> by Jay, C., et al. published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (<a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185157" target="_blank">source</a>). The conclusion as summarized in the abstract are exactly what you said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conclusions: The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms. For patients with very severe depression, the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what metrics they are using to judge severity? I mean, some of the more stereotypically 'severe' depression symptoms (psychomotor retardation for instance) don't really index to having a very bad time. I mean, I can have psychomotor retardation and be having an OK day,  but if I don't take steps to hide my powerlevel, doctors be thinking about inpatient care, just because somebody walking around like a zombie looks much more 'bad' than somebody who shows no sign of their illness to somebody without real experience of depression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, depression treatment studies use the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. This is a standardized clinician-administered measure of symptoms and impairment. For each item, the clinician queries the patient, then asks follow up questions as needed to clarify the response in relationship to the provided anchor points. <a href="http://healthnet.umassmed.edu/mhealth/HAMD.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a PDF</a>, which will make some of that more clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a graduate psychology student with emphasis on psychological evaluation. I don't deal with clinical evaluation, but as far as I understand, every study should use some sort of psychological instrument, which may be filled/answered by the patient or his doctor, and whose manual will provide information on the severity of the disorder depending on the patient's score. Do note that the score may be a simple sum of positive answers, or different items may have different weights and/or characterise a different severity of the disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this work with CBT? From the little actual research I've read psychotherapy often gets very close to matching or matches medication in treatment of mild depression, but drops off quickly as the severity of symptoms increases. Is there a link between the two treatments efficacy in severely depressed individuals?</p>
<p>I can't read the full research you linked. What's the distribution of different types of anti-depressants? A lot has been said about serotonin and SSRIs recently, what about TCAs and MAOIs? I'm not hearing much about them. Since patients with severe depression are likely the only ones to actually hit MAOIs, have those been proven to be inefficient in the treatment of mild depression as well? Are we likely to see SSRIs dropped as a first line of defense and skipping straight to TCAs, should SSRIs really prove ineffective, or will we stick to the current system and begin deceiving patients (albeit for their benefit)?</p>
<p>Sorry about my wall of questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any data suggesting better efficacy for TCA or MAOI drugs.  Rather, they became 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) line drugs decades ago due to toxicity: TCA are bad in overdose (fatal arrhythmias common) and the problems with interactions drove down use of MAOI well before the TCAs fell out of favor.</p>
<p>In contrast, the SSRI profile generally looks better.  Though there is the problem of increased suicide in the early weeks, thought by many to relate to improvement in energy before improvement in mood and other symtpoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychotherapy can be as effective as medication, but medication is often prescribed because it is more cost-effective. I cannot reference the studies at present, but I think that the best outcomes are associated with using both therapy and medication. Unfortunately, since most insurance companies would rather pay for prescriptions than hours with therapists, efficacy will always come second to economics. </p>
<p>SSRIs will likely be supplanted by something equally unpredictable in terms of efficacy when the patents on the drugs run out and they can be prescribed as a generic drug. I don't mean to sound as cynical as that comes across as, but it is true that often old drugs are replaced mainly because they become less profitable (though, in the case of TCA and MAOI, it was because of side effects/interactions that were more dangerous). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm not as knowledgable about your anti-depressant questions, I can give some information about CBT that might be useful, and may be able to even dredge up some useful meta-analyses if you would like. What most studies have established is that when it comes to treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), CBT produces results that are ultimately on par with pharmaceutical treatment. However, and this is very important, when drug therapy for MDD is discontinued, we typically see substantial reemergence of symptoms, whereas relapse after CBT stops, while still present, is much smaller. The reason for this difference in long term efficacy likely has to do with the ability of CBT to help teach individuals skills for combating MDD, which drugs cannot provide. This being said, when it comes to treating MDD, we shouldn't think of our options as having to pick either anti-depressants or CBT, as a combined approach actually tends to be more effective than just using one alone.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I recently got off of Zoloft myself, and let me tell you, it was not a fun experience. Getting on it was the best thing for me, since it kept me from waking up every morning worried that today might just be the day I finally decide to kill myself. But once I realized I had moved on from my depressive episode, I decided to get off the drug, and that was the hardest thing I've ever experienced physically. It was like someone replaced my skin with lead and my brain with Swiss cheese. I'd frequently have experiences where I felt like I wasn't in total control of my body, or that I was just sort of playing a video game of my life. I had no energy to do anything. It sucked. Doctors should not just prescribe SSRIs willy nilly.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, the bad side effects started once I started tapering off the drug. When I first got on it, I experienced some sexual dysfunction and lethargy, but it was significantly better than what I had been experiencing before I had started taking Zoloft. Tapering off was the hard part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>whats very interesting though, is that its possible for someone to go through everything you've gone through with zoloft, on sugar pills they thought were zoloft. </p>
<p>edit: figured i should link to something</p>
<p>A 2014 review found that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;nearly 1 out of 20 patients receiving a placebo in clinical trials for depression dropped out due to adverse events, which were believed to have been caused by the nocebo effect&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on Zoloft for what I thought was post partum depression but I now realize was depression as a side effect of my Mirena IUD.  I went off it cold turkey on accident.  Horrible flu like assumptions for a couple weeks during withdrawal.  I do not recommend.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, while I do feel that I received a real affect from the drug for treating my depression, it also cured my sever phobia of spiders.  Started during treatment and the cure has lasted after I stopped the drug.  I was only on one med so it must have been the Zoloft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not-so-fun-fact: A lot of what is called the placebo effect is just a regression to the mean, i.e. it would have happened regardless of whether the patient took the medicament/placebo or not. Many studies don't differentiate between pure placebo effect and placebo+regression effect, because ultimately it is not important for the question of whether the medicine works. So it is entirely possible that he is risking side effects/wastes resources for no real reason.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It's incredible how placebo effect is misunderstood, even by professionnals. So many people think it's some kind of half-magical mysterious biological process... where it's probably just poorly conceived studies, reporting errors, various bias, and just &quot;letting the problem take care of itself&quot;.</p>
<p>The <em>placebo effect</em> is a statistical effect on <em>study results</em>, not a biological effect on the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Placebos can produce some objective physiological changes, such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and chemical activity in the brain, in cases involving pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and some symptoms of Parkinson’s. In other cases, like asthma, the effect is purely subjective, when the patient reports improvement despite no objective change in the underlying condition.</p>
