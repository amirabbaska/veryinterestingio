<p>And could you mount the wheel to match the outer tires on a semi truck (i.e. concave side facing out) or is the axle designed in a way which wouldn't allow it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah you can use it in the rear, it's just a bad idea since steer tires are so much more expensive than the retreads most drivers/companies use in the rear/trailers. Also noteworthy is that often (at least on trucks I've worked around between Texas and canada, not sure about the coasts) that steers are usually a different size than rears as well. Insurance on these trucks ain't paying for tires that blowout, unless it hurts someone, and those are more likely to be poor retreads than steers.</p>
<p>TL;DR steer tires are too expensive to put in the back</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. I always thought that the dually trucks had wheels that stuck out because it was to catch more air to cool down the front brakes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The prior post was talking about how the rims are interchangeable, what you're talking about is why the dually wheels are there to begin with.</p>
<p>Duallys give trucks better stability with heavy loads that are being towed. I believe they're also better for the roads - 1 tire with 5000 lbs of weight to support will dig into the road more over time than 2 dually tires with the same weight (thus 2500 lbs)</p></div>		</li>
