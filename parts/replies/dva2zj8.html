			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're ever in Stockholm, it's well worth seeing in person too. Its size has to be seen to be believed. It's the only true galleon style ship in anything resembling good condition that still exists. Of course most wood ships from that era have long gone, wood of course being an organic material doesn't tend to last that length of time unless in very particular circumstances. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The chemical makeup of the water, the salinity, the current flow, pollution level, all of those can have a bearing on how much anything that sinks deteriorates.</p>

<p>The planes are mostly aluminum.  I don't know of many organisms that digest aluminum, unlike the bacteria eating up Titanic and forming the &quot;rusticles&quot; with its waste.  Also, Navy ships are designed to combat the effects of salt water, so layers of rust preventative and anti-fouling paint keeps the rust and organisms away.  Not as great a need for such measures on Titanic, and there's a 30-year difference between the 2 ships.  Paint formulas likely greatly improved in that time.</p>
<p>Would be interesting to compare water conditions at Lexington with those at Titanic.  The &quot;Atlantic Conveyor Belt&quot;, and ocean current from the Caribbean, up the east coast of America, and across to Iceland, Ireland and England, almost certainly has more organic matter in the flow.  Palm seeds have made the trip and grow naturally into mature trees in Ireland (but it's too cold for those trees to produce seeds). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lexington was laid down on 8 January 1921 as a battlecruier, the ship's construction was suspended in February 1922 at 24% completed, restarted in July 1922 as an carrier.</p>
<p>Titanic was laid down on 31 March 1909</p>
<p>So only 12 years apart</p></div>		</li>

<p>Titanic sank in 1912, Lexington in 1942.  Thirty years to experiment with new paints and treatments.</p></div>		</li>
