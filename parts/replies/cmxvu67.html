			<div class="markdown"><p>Well - there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_contamination" target="_blank">international treaties</a> on what we are allowed to do on extra-terrestrial planets. </p>
<p>You might object that this wouldn't dissuade someone from doing their thing - but at least some sort of juridical frame-work exists already.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt those treaties will be worth the paper they're printed on once people have a reason, desire, and capability to actually go to those other places.</p>
<p>Those space treaties tend to ban stuff that governments couldn't do, or didn't want to do anyway. Like the no weapons in space. Well of course they agreed to that, because nukes in orbit are pretty useless, even for a first strike capability... An SSNB will put more warheads on target for cheaper, with less reaction time.</p>
<p>So they sign the treaty, because it doesn't limit them, nor cost them anything really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those really don't sound like wise words to me. Microbes on mars would be incredibly interesting to study, I'm sure, but ultimately still just microbes. They have no desires, no thoughts, no cares, no worries, no fears, nothing. Just tiny little machines mindlessly doing whatever it is they do with no goal or purpose.</p>
<p>There is really nothing special about that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it would be totally interesting (and pretty much a scientific necessity) to study if discovered. But in the context of that quote he wasn't saying we shouldn't study it, or that the microbes have 'rights', just that if there is already life there we shouldn't go and start altering the processes of the planet (terraforming etc.) to suit our own needs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not taking a jab, but I fear Jared Diamond is a better pick for quotes about what would essentially be just another conquest.</p></div>		</li>
