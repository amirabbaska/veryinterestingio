<p>I didn't think it was true until you prompted me to research it a bit. The majority of exoplanets are found through transit (planet passing in front of a star, decreasing its brightness), but gravitational microlensing is a method, though one of the rarest</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question. What about light emitting from the opposite direction than the gravitational force? For instance, if a sun is getting sucked into a black hole, light can still escape until it crosses the event horizon. So if the sun is directly in between us and the black hole, and is very close to the event horizon, will this affect what we see? Will it cause a red shift? If gravity can cause gravitational lensing, then I would think my theoretical situation would cause some change in the light, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the instruments werent as exact as they presumed n most data set were thrown out n skewed the measurement. I mean a telescope that is set on a stone is subject to vibrations even to the earth' natural low frequency hum, not to mention removing glass plates from the old camera's itself could produce distortions on the setup of instruments to show enough change on a select subset of data collected to produce the result a priori.. a double blind experiment would not have proven this ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a simple view:  light always follows a straight path. But what happens if the Universe it moves through is curved?</p>
<p>In Einstein's theory of general relativity, massive objects bend spacetime around them. A photon passing nearby will then see its trajectory deviated, as it follows the structure of spacetime itself. </p>

<p>Damn, thank you! Sometimes it takes so little.. </p>
<p>Do you have a solid book on the topic that you would recommend? Ã  la Feynman's lectures on physics.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the recommendations! I'll start acquiring :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate on the other responses... The answers people are posting are due to Einstein's work on General Relativity, which is our modern theory of gravitation.  You learned Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation which involves the masses of the attracting bodies.  Newton's law is very accurate under some circumstances but breaks down in situations with massless objects, high speeds, high energies, and a few other places.  This is why it was replaced with Einstein's work roughly 100 years ago.  We learn Newton's law in school because it is still pretty accurate under normal circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would expect a massless particle to be already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens#History" target="_blank">affected by Newton's gravity</a>, because the trajectory of a particle in a gravitational field does not depend on its mass. The interesting result of Einstein's theory is that the deflection is twice as big as predicted by Newton.</p></div>		</li>
