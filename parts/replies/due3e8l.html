			<div class="markdown"><p>Stripes here, to expand on this from the officials perspective: we will let it go as long as one player isn't placed in an obvious or dangerous disadvantage. (Broken hand, unable to remove equipment like an elbow pad sliding down over the fist, turning it into a weapon, one guy trying to stand on just one rocker, etc.) Also, and most importantly, we don't break it up because we don't wanna (nor do we get paid enough to) get hit ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former stripe.. came here to say just this. They hit hard, and I don't want to catch a right hook. Fisty cuffs until you're tired or go down, then I'll give you quiet time for 5 mins to think things over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems bizarre to me, coming from a background of rugby and soccer, that that's your attitude as a match official. I'm not saying it's incorrect or wrong, it just seems extremely weird!</p>
<p>Rugby is not a placid game, but sportsmanlike conduct is expected and enforced. Fighting, punching, biting, and so on will almost always result in a red card. Red cards are then investigated by a panel after the match and will usually result in a several week ban at least. </p>
<p>In soccer you can get the same just for spitting or making an offensive gesture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a a hockey game once, and a two players were going at it pretty good. The ref decided to try to break it up, and got between them. Got clocked right in the jaw. The guy didn’t mean to hit the ref, but it is just a bad idea to stick yourself between two fighting guys.  Thankfully the ref wasn’t badly hurt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two questions since you know stuff and I barely follow hockey but kind of have paid attention to this over the many years I've watched sports:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Would pulling the other player (fighters) sweater up so they can't defend themselves be something that would trigger a break up?</p>
</li>
<li>Is it true that outside of the NHL, it's pretty much frowned upon to fight. Like in the minor leagues you don't have anywhere near the number of fights?</li>
</ol>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically that doesn't happen anymore because of a device called a fight strap, that basically snaps the sweater to the inside of the players breezers(hockey pants for the degens out there) in the small of the back, so it's very difficult to do, assuming the player is actually using it. </p>
<p>More directly answering your question, no. Typically we'll only break up a fight if it goes to the ice, or something like what I mentioned above happens.</p>
<p>To your second question: it depends on the league. Tldr: college and youth hockey it's forbidden.</p>
<p>However there are leagues that overlap both collage and youth aged players called Junior hockey, where it's allowed. </p>
<p>Hope that helped clear some things up!</p></div>		</li>
