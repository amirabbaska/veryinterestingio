			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the portable devices then only do their job if they detect the right conditions? Would I be able to, as a uneducated person in it's use, typically be able to apply it and have it function as expected? Just curious as I'd be worried about causing more harm with a device like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The AED will only charge and instruct its user to press the shock button if it recognizes a shockable rhythm. If after 2 minutes of CPR it detects a rhythm that is not shockable it will not charge a shock and audibly alert the user “No shock advised continue CPR” An AED is very “dummy” proof. There is no need to worry that you will cause more harm by applying it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of rhythm (other than flatline) is not shockable? And can the AED recommendation be overridden in the event that I'm a kinky guy and just like that kind of thing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It says very clearly &quot;shock advised, stop compressions, stay clear and press the shock button&quot; if it detects that a shock is needed. Also in regards to 'more harm than good' at the point a person is allowing you to do hard chest compressions on them and have let you cut their clothes off and strap a defib on them they're as good as dead anyway (which is why you can't sue someone for breaking your ribs during cpr <em>at least in the uk</em> because it's either that or be dead) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup that's exactly how they work. There's both diagrams and voice prompts that explain everything from where to put the pads to when to start CPR.
They're designed to be used by people who have very little training. Once the button on the device is pressed it does all the work itself. It analyses the patient's heart rhythm and determines if defib is necessary, administers a shock, checks rhythm again and continues until paramedics arrive to turn it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this, modern AEDs do much more than deliver a shock.  It assists the person administering first aid through the entire process.  Beeps at the rhythm at which compressions should be done, some have a small pad on the chest so you know exactly where to press. It continues to analyze the heart rhythm every few minutes and will administer a shock if it recognizes VF or VT.  A voice will guide you through the whole process of CPR and administering a shock if required. </p>
<p>I strongly recommend taking a first aid course, it is a great way to familiarize yourself with these machines and it could save a life. </p></div>		</li>
