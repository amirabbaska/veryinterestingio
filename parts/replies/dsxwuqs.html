			<div class="markdown"><p>But this would also apply to the liver. An injure serious enough to take a chunk out of your liver will also kill you without modern medicine. Not necessarily because of the liver itself, but by other more imediate factors like blood loss, infection, inability to fend for yourself, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were scavengers at some point of our evolution and ate carrion. We needed to have all the nasty things filtered out from organism, so our liver is both larger and regenerates better than we need right now. </p>
<p>While filtering out nasty things, liver becomes damaged and has to regenerate. Injury resistance is just a side effect, it's worse at regenerate actual physical damage than its &quot;working&quot; tissue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be a lot easier to lab grow a new heart with the patients DNA, with defects corrected first, than to let the body regenerate an organ while hooked up to life support.  That and from a physiological perspective, it would likely be more damaging to spend all that time out of commission in a hospital.</p>
<p>The benefit however to having a regenerating heart could come into play as a preventive measure for heart disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding a gene to produce a protein or an enzyme is one thing. Testing for genetic disease, easy enough. But you'd need to change way more than you can imagine to generate something like a regenerating heart. </p>
<p>And there would be a high probability of issues that would make ethical experimentation on humans impossible.</p>
<p>In 50 years, no. In a hundred years, almost definitely not. In five hundred years... maybe. Because there's no way to even guess what the world will be like then. But I'd still expect that genetically engineered humans with regenerating hearts will not exist in 500 years.</p></div>		</li>
