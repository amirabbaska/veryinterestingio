			<div class="markdown"><p>This concept was something I only really fully grasped a year ago. My dental hygienist said you shouldn't brush harder than you can holding your brush with two fingers and your thumb. Any harder, you're just wearing away more enamel and being hard on your gums.
The goal isn't to &quot;scour&quot; your teeth, you're just disrupting that film.
Edit: Words and a grammatical trainwreck.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bacteria does not &quot;evolve&quot; in the same way that we regularly use the word &quot;Evolution&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement is a bit ambiguous. </p>
<p>Surely bacteria evolve exactly like anything else evolves. Microorganisms just do it more rapidly since they go through many more generations than macroscopic organisms and they and also do horizontal gene transfer.</p></div>		</li>
