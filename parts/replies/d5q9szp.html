<p>In fluid flows, there are ways that components of the fluid flow can act as a barrier to transport across them. The lines of maximum stretching (hyperbolic coherent structure if you feel like googling) act as transport barriers. One of these surrounds the polar vortex. Therefore, not much air outside of the polar vortex gets in the vortex and not much from the inside gets out. <a href="http://www.lmd.ens.fr/legras/publis/chaos2002.pdf" target="_blank">Here's a paper with some pretty pictures of the material stretching in the polar vortex</a></p>
<p>This effect is the reasoning behind &quot;air curtains&quot; at big stores (like Costco) that have a fan above the doors blowing air straight down. This keeps most of the air inside while they leave the doors open.</p></div>		</li>
