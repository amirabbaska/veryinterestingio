			<div class="markdown"><p>Height definitely changed a lot and would probably be the most recognizable physical difference. However, it's not an evolutionary advantage so much as a change in environmental factors resulting in the height attained. The pre-historic data you cited is from Europe so it records the (relatively late) transition from low density hunting and gathering (which results in relatively good nutrition and taller populations) to much higher densities of subsistence farmers. Other places would show the same pattern, but the decline would happen around the introduction of farming in an area.</p>
<p>Early farmers would have had it pretty bad. Populations increase rapidly due to the need for more labor and the ability to make soft foods allowing earlier weaning of children. Combined with the inherent lower nutritional quality of grains, and the increased competition, availability of calories, protein, and several important vitamins and mierals plummets and takes height with it. </p>
<p>With the modern introduction of industrialized farming, global food networks, a wide variety of available nutritional options, and a generally rising standard of living, height has picked up again more recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When anthropologists find a buried skeleton they can almost immediately tell if it's a hunter-gatherer or not.  Hunter-gatherers have better teeth and are far taller and have healthier looking skeletons.  In the words of Jared Diamond &quot;agriculture was the worst mistake in the human race that we still have not fully recovered from&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, you were putting some information out there and I got distracted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be strong preferences for height, but I doubt those preferences translate directly into reproductive outcomes or success on the part of tall men. This is especially true when you factor in other attributes considered physically attractive, personality, cultural pressures, economic socio-economic status, and a host of other things that influence mate choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1806/20150211" target="_blank">a recent study</a> suggests that (in NL anyway) it's due to tall men having more children than shorter men. Over time this leads to a taller population on average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it. Sexual selection is unlikely to be consistent between cultures, but height shifts have incredibly broad distributions bordering on a global scale. Migration could account for some of the change, but it wouldnt explain why the same pattern occurs in Iraq and Mexico around the same time. It's a really short time frame and rapid genetic change over something like height should show up pretty clearly through linkage disequilibrium. We also have no record of sexual selection causing the rebound over the last couple hundred years and no reason to suspect migration for the rapid recent changes.</p>
<p>During the Holocene, strongly selected traits show up pretty clearly but are generally related to diet and disease. Alcohol tolerance, lactose tolerance, and some traits reducing susceptibility to malaria have all been strongly selected. There's also a gene controlling earwax consistency in East Asian populations with strong signals for selection, but as far as I know, we don't yet understand why. As far as I know, there isn't much genetic evidence for physical changes like height.</p>
<p>There is a ton of evidence, however, that it's all about nutrition. Protein consumption drops dramatically for early farmers, dental hypoplasias show up at greatly increased rates, dental health in general declines. All of these correlate pretty well with height and are consistently related to agriculture in areas where agriculture appears at vastly different times. Environmental differences are the best predictor for height in modern populations as well, so the global variation is unlikely to have a strong genetic component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that the recent height change was evolutionary but, instead, environmentally caused through factors such as nutrition. I could be wrong though. It just seems like, in such a short period of time, we wouldn't have evolved so much.</p></div>		</li>
