			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put! One of the underlying theses of my pedagogical approach is that anyone can learn to sing. Pitch is a hurdle, but even that is surmountable.</p>
<p>For anyone out there desiring a physics-based approach to the science of the singing voice, look no further than 'Vocology' by Ingo Titze. He created the field with this title.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot sing at all. Like not even a little bit. Not only do I sound like a frog, but 30 seconds of trying to sing has my throat in serious pain. All I want is to achieve the ability to learn a single song well enough as to not get booed doing karaoke in front of drunk people. How do? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like some serious tongue tension. If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say your tongue placement is rather high. A high tongue cuts off some of the low/mid range resonance out of the voice, producing what some refer to as a &quot;froggy&quot; sound; additionally, the hyoglossus attaches at the hyoid bone, pulling the larynx upward. That could be causing your pain. </p>
<p>Do you live in a big city? Should be a plethora of qualified voice teachers; I'd definitely recommend a lesson or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolute pitch is not an ability to recreate the note you've just heard, it's the ability to name the note you've just heard and to sing a named note without hearing anything. It even says so in the link to wiki you gave - &quot;without hearing a reference tone&quot;. Don't know how you meant to put it, just clearing things out. As for biological reason, i don't know, it's possible. Never legitimately tried to train an absolute pitch, because frankly it is useless, other than  tuning your instruments without a tuner, wich will not be good enough (or as precise) either way. I unwillingly memorized some reference tones over the time though, at least to an extend. So i tend to believe it is just a skill. P.s I've read your last paragraph. Absolute pitch has nothing to do with singing ability, you're going to sound as in tune with relative pitch.
Edit: P.P.s Oh yeah i forgot, absolute pitch will help you to find the key faster playing an instrument when you are joining an improvised jam session at a subway wagon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, absolute pitch is actually <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/speaking-tonal-languages/" target="_blank">more common</a> among speakers of tonal languages like Mandarin. Only makes sense - tonal languages require you to recognize pitch and get a particular meaning from it, which requires you to gain at least some degree of perfect pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the thing is that absolute pitch necessitates the biological prerequisite to identify and replicate, but there's still learning to be done.</p>
<p>I was identified having perfect pitch as a teenager and was able to sing and identify perfect note and yes hearing myself wrongly making the note (I'm french-canadian, I feel I'm not saying this properly but you get it) would make me redo it until I had it right, so yes it helped me sing better and I did sang in a band, etc., but in order to do that I needed to read music as well which isn't biologically given.</p>
<p>I'm now unable to read and identify notes because I've stopped playing music but I'm still able to reproduce exact pitch from songs heard during the day. A friend of mine, now professional musician, who played with me as a teen, is still unable to do it after years of practice.</p>
<p>It's typical of many false debate in anthropology around the nature/culture debate, it's rarely only one, you can have the dna to run fast but if you never ran, you won't run fast, you'll need practice first.</p></div>		</li>
