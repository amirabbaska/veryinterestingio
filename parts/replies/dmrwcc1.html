			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the bit about baby being unable to turn their head. When my wife and I had our baby, she was holding him in the hospital bed for skin-to-skin after an exhaustive 24 hour labor. All three of us were tire so she and the baby dozed off. After a short while, our baby lifted his head but it would drop at the same position. Essentially he couldn't turn  his head to a better  position. He did it again after about a minute and at that point, I figured out that he was lifting his head for air. I woke my wife and we moved him to the bassinet. I think if I didn't happen to check up on him at that point, worse would have happened.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is just from memory, but I think I'm remembering correctly... </p>
<p>In the old pre-bible Christian texts, one of the books talked about Lilith. Lilith was Adams first wife, before eve. Eve came from Adams rib, she was created from him, therefore she was subservient to him. </p>
<p>Prior to eve, Adams first wife, Lilith, was created at the same time as Adam, from the same dust as Adam; they were equals. Adam tells Lilith to &quot;lay under him&quot; (during sex), and she refuses, because she says they are equals. </p>
<p>God steps in, and tells Lilith to lay under Adam. Lilith refuses, and &quot;flys into the sky&quot; to escape both Adam and God. </p>
<p>God tells Lilith that if she doesn't return, he will smite (kill) a thousand of Liliths children every day until she is back. </p>
<p>She never comes back. Then God creates Eve, but this time, he makes her from Adams rib, so she has to listen to him. </p>
<p>This ancient story was used to explain things like SIDS and miscarriages, as well attempting to put fear in women to stay subservient to the men.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great stuff.  Thanks.</p>
<p>Every culture has it's myths about infant mortality.  Some say it's from a cat that can suck a child's breath away.  Some say God needed a new angel.  Today we call it SIDS.</p>
<p>The day we have an explanation for every child death is the day that &quot;SIDS&quot; will disappear from language.  The term won't be needed once we have an explanation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically SIDS is just a term for any mysterious death of an infant that can't be explained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also gets used a fair bit when it's clear that someone accidentally smothered the kid and you'd rather say it's SIDS than say &quot;You killed your baby by mistake, sorry&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually separate causes of death for SIDS and accidental suffocation of an infant. Not to get morbid I've just worked with a lot of death data.</p>
<p>ICD-10 coding:</p>
<p>R95 = sudden infant death syndrome </p>
<p>W75 = accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (includes due to bed linen, mother's body, pillow) </p>
<p>It's probably worth noting that codes in the R95+ category are more or less the &quot;other&quot; or unknown causes. R99 is basically the equivalent of &quot;no idea&quot; how someone died. SIDS is not very well understood, more clear causes of death have their own codes and are no longer SIDS</p>

<p>Tldr: SIDS is another way of saying &quot;unknown&quot; infant death. If the exact nature of death is known it won't be coded as SIDS at that point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about apnea and bradycardia? Can those things cause death but lead to the cause of death being labeled SIDS?</p>
<p>My twins came home on apnea monitors and had three events per the reports in the first month where their breathing slowed followed by lowered heart rate. It scares me to think what could have happened if the monitors hadn't been on. </p>
<p>I'm curious if a lot of SIDS deaths could be apnea/Brady events. </p></div>		</li>
