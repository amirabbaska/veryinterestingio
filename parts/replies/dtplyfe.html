			<div class="markdown"><p>4:2:2 or 4:2:0 doesn't really affect the 'richness' of the colors - if you have a solid block of colour it won't look different if subsampled.  Subsampling only reduces the ability to see fine detail in the colors.</p>
<p>One of the other developments somewhat in parallel with HDR is displays that have a wider gamut, which <em>does</em> directly relate to producing richer colours.  </p>
<p>In particular, DolbyVision specifies a fairly wide gamut.</p></div>		</li>

So a 120Hz TV would be able to display up to 120 frames per second?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but some tvs say 120hz motion rate which is bs because it’s actually 60hz. They just made up some marketing words to make their 60hz tvs sound better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also often some software in the TV that tries to simulate higher refresh rates, usually in the form of motion blur, afaik. This is done to make really fast objects (like a ball at a sporting event) appear as a streak instead of as a few separate dots across the display.</p></div>		</li>
