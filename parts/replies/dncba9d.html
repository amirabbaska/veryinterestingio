			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve given hundreds of injections and no one has ever told me that the orientation of the needle mattered. </p>
<p>I’ve never seen a nurse rotate the syringe to orient the bevel before giving me an injection. </p>
<p>Additionally, nothing on the needle or syringe indicates this critical orientation so that I do it right. </p>
<p>I don’t think this is right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, i think you might want to ask a supervisor about protocol. This is both correct and usually taken for granted in medical facilities. Most people check the orientation while tapping out the air bubbles, before injecting the syringe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The orientation doesn't matter for things like sc or im injections.</p>
<p>For venepuncture, bevel up is preferred because it allows better visibility of insertion depth. </p></div>		</li>
