<p>Elon Musk has a lot of money. His net worth is about $16.7 billion dollars. The Manhattan Project, adjusted for inflation, cost about $25 billion dollars, so even if Musk liquidated all of his assets, he still would come up short</p>

<p>There's a flaw with your logic here.  The Manhattan Project was cutting edge research, which is expensive.  They were esentially starting from scratch.  If Elon Musk wanted to build a nuke he wouldn't be starting from scratch.  The research has already been done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you over selling it a bit.  The Manhattan Project was expensive because it was all R&amp;D.  The mechanism that is a nuclear warhead is relatively simple (see North Korea).  The refinement and delivery is the logistical problem, the &quot;math&quot; and &quot;physics&quot; isn't overly complex.  Get enough refined uranium together and it goes critical.  If you had billions, your best bet would be to get the refined product from a 3rd party as you suggested, and delivery could be a truck.  To make a WMD, it doesn't need to be missile.  Frankly it doesn't need to be nuclear, but that strays from the question a bit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what people don't realize. The amount of science that was conducted during the Manhattan project is just staggering but that was because there was so much we didn't know. Now- a lot of that knowledge is available in a college physics textbook.</p>

<p>Exactly! Tall boy, for example, is dirt simple. Two masses of uranium fired together = boom. (It's a little more complicated than that- but only barely). The science was so well understood that they didn't need to test the bomb- they knew it would work.</p>
<p>Implosion triggers are more complicated- but that's more of an engineering problem in many ways. You need a precisely shaped explosion from all directions and with the right magnitude. That said- even that isn't all that hard these days. Explosives have improved- as has software modeling and manufacturing.</p>
<p>The hardest parts of building a nuclear weapon are getting the fissile material in the first place, and then miniaturizing it for use on a missile. The latter wasn't a requirement for this thought experiment which leaves us with simply obtaining the materials as the main problem.</p></div>		</li>
