But no, the animals aren't said to have autism, as that's anthropomorphizing, but we'll refer to them as a model of autism due to the behavioral phenotype and usually genetic or molecular markers that are related to the human condition.  Also, no model of autism or Rett Syndrome perfectly recapitulates the human condition so we use these models to study how the changes in Mecp2 (altered in Rett Syndrome) expression impacts things like neurodevelopment, brain function, behavior, and contribution to sex differences seen in these disorders.</p></div>		</li>
