			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta, the guide mechanism is the same, using magnetic fields to direct where the electrons go (deflection), and then more magnetic fields to straighten them out (collimate). </p>
<p>The front of the system uses a similar physical effect, the photoelectric effect, a photosensitive coating on a glass in a vacuum. In TVs electrons cause it to emit photons, in cameras, photons cause it to emit electrons.</p>
<p>The rear of the camera has an electron multiplier, then an aperture which only allows electrons to enter which come at a specific angle, typically straight on and directly in the middle of it, corresponding to the specific portion of the screen as the system scans horizontally and vertically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this! Essentially a video projector with an electron gun that scans the images and turns them into electrical signals, all contained inside a vacuum tube. Often the answer to &quot;how did they figure that out?&quot; is the same as the answer to &quot;how would you do this if you had to figure it out all on your own&quot;. I think that holds true here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there was a <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/how-secret-spy-satellites-camera-found-second-life-mapping-13834" target="_blank">brief attempt</a> to shoot film pictures, chemically develop them onboad, scan them, and radio the digitized image back to earth. </p>
<p>It worked but the quality wasn't good enough so they stuck with the Corona-style film returns for another 20 years before recon satellites went digital. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For decades, that was one of the only image sources for the far side of the moon (IIRC) - about 99% of the moon was mapped using this method in the lunar orbiter program. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_program" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_program</a>)</p>
<p>Data from that program actually got a new lease on life, as some independent researchers just finished reprocessing the data tapes and generating higher-quality imagery back in December: <a href="https://loirp.arc.nasa.gov/loirp_gallery/" target="_blank">https://loirp.arc.nasa.gov/loirp_gallery/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used to telecine (film a video monitor!) the east coast nightly news then develop the film in a plane in mid-air and air said news on the west coast three hours later.</p>
<p>Then in the 1960's Ampex invented the spinning-head video tape recorder, and AT&amp;T launched the Telstar satellite.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is reminiscent of the BBC'S early tests with John Logie Baird,  in which images were shot on film and then developed and reshot by the mechanical TV camera for broadcast,  in one unreliable process. </p></div>		</li>
