			<div class="markdown"><p>California is an at-will State but trust me, as an employer if you terminate someone and there is even a hint of any form of discrimination you will lose big time. As a result many employers require you to write an employee up a minimum of 3 times before terminating their employment so that there is documentation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, a few years back they tried to fire her because she fell asleep on the job, but she lawyered up and claimed she was praying (not sleeping) and that they were discriminating against her religion. Now we’re stuck with a god awful charge nurse forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, firing someone for a discriminatory reason is illegal federally. You can fire someone for no reason, but you can't fire someone for Race, religion or nationality. (Or in some states sexual preference though that is not a federal protection)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Montana is at-will during the person's probationary period.   After that you have to fire them for a &quot;good cause&quot;.   </p>
<p>In practice that usually means several write ups for a related issue.  Kinda a 3 strikes your out setup.</p>
<p>But this can still be worked around without much trouble.   Just about every company has an employee handbook that the employee has to sign.  And there are almost always items that say &quot;violation of this can lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination&quot;.  So if you want to get rid of someone you fire them under one of those sections, stating they broke explicit rules they signed.</p>
<p>One restaurant fires pretty much everyone for insubordination.  This is probably technically true, especially in a restaurant BOH setting with os much going on.   They also use this to try and avoid paying unemployment.</p></div>		</li>

I started looking for a new job after they let go one of the managers who was there for 14 years with no notice, no severance, nothing.  All for no reason.  They continued to let people go and cried poor even though sales were better than they had been for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jobs that do this were the primary reason I went back to school at 26. Earned my BCS and I was shocked when I got a job that DIDN'T do this. They actively recruited me, they had lots of small perks like free food, beverages, and even a free laundry service if you wanted your stuff cleaned during your shift. If I didn't have shitty jobs with shitty managers that constantly reminded me I was nobody and could be replaced within the hour, I wouldn't have had the motivation to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is truly dependent on your &quot;boss of the moment&quot;. I reported to three that considered me family and I held them in the same esteem. The layers above my bosses called the shots and when the layoff musical chairs game began there was little the honorable tier of management could do but watch good people get fucked over. I think better advise would be to recognize you are a company asset and as such expendable, there are few &quot;were family&quot; companies left in the world. Part of your job is to create the illusion you buy into that axiom whilst making damn sure you prioritize the ones you love first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you're born with no resources and no immediate means to survive (food/shelter), the most proven strategy to avoid betrayal for said resources/survival is to trust no-one. This is what late capitalism teaches. The invisible hand holds a whip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what industry you're working in and in what capacity though. For roles that are very hard to replace like a doctor or engineer usually the direct and indirect costs of firing someone then rehiring &amp; retraining are high enough that this sort of thing is rare unless the employee is being problematic. Of course this doesn't apply for positions where they're getting too many well qualified applicants for open positions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>More often than not it's more of a &quot;This can make me hit some arbitrary <em>MONEY SAVED</em> goal that will net me the CEO a few million in bonus money from the board.

You fire someone for no reason, and now every talented worker who hears about it is going to make you the last place they agree to work so you'll be dealing with only people who are desperate for a job or not doing their due diligence.</p></div>		</li>
