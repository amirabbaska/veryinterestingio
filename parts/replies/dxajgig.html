			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Jupiter and Saturn, the geo dynamo appears to be driven by circulation deep inside - it could be a metallic core like that of the Earth, but most likely it is down to the circulation of metallic hydrogen in their Mantles.</p>
<p>In the case of the Ice Giants, Uranus and Neptune, their fields appear to have a different origin. Uranus's field is not even vaguely aligned with its rotational axis and is offset from its centre of rotation by almost 1/3 of the planet's radius. This suggests the field is generated inside Uranus's Mantle at temperatures and pressures where metallic hydrogen can't form. The best suggestion is that the Uranus field is being created by the circulation of mixtures of water and ammonia. But that raises more questions of what is driving the dynamo - uniquely amongst the giants, Uranus doesn't radiate heat to space.</p>
<p>Neptune's magnetic field is similarly offset from the centre and from its rotational axis. It has a similar strength to that of Uranus, and probably forms from a similar circulation of conductive water-based fluids.</p>
<p>HTH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>like the other comments have said, Mars indeed used to have an intrinsic magnetic field. However we don't really know why it stopped. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5617/299" target="_blank">Mars core is still liquid</a>. It might not have enough convection to sustain a magnetic field, but this is just a theory and has not been confirmed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The field faded as Mars’ core cooled. The Earth’s core is much larger and has a lot of radioactive material in it. This serves to keep the core molten, allowing it to act as a dynamo, generating the magnetic field that protects us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since Mars is a relatively small planet, the core was able to cool down a lot faster than a larger planet. </p>
<p>Mars did once have a magnetic field and we know this because there was volcanism and liquid water in Mars' past. The volcanism tells us that there was mantle under the crust and the liquid water tells us that there was an atmosphere that was thick enough to maintain liquid water on the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding that the lack (or lack of strength) of Mars' magnetic field caused the Sun to gradually 'blow away' most of the planet's atmosphere. my information may be wrong, but, if the magnetic field of Venus is similar in strength to that of Mars, why is it that Venus has its atmosphere, despite being closer to the Sun? The atmosphere on Venus is supposedly even denser than Earth's atmosphere. Any idea why is this so? is this caused by the planet's crust evaporating due to the proximity to the Sun, and thus forming the atmosphere itself in the process?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus is significantly larger, I wonder if the higher gravity is a factor? It would change the balance of forces.</p>
<p>If be interested to see the gas composition of Venus, has the sun blasted away all the lighter gases and left behind the heavier ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was asked on StackExchange Astronomy <a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/10189/why-did-venus-not-lose-its-atmosphere-without-magnetic-field" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://sci.esa.int/venus-express/50246-a-magnetic-surprise-for-venus-express/" target="_blank">this</a> article was mentioned. I'm quoting here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The article explains therefore that although Venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field, but the interaction of the thick atmosphere with the solar winds causes an externally induced magnetic field, that deflect the particles of the solar winds. The article suggests, however, that the different magnetic field may cause that lighter gasses are not that much protected and therefore are lost into space.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that Venus likely had* oceans of water in it's past - that atmosphere you're seeing with up to 90 times Earth's atmospheric pressure is what became of them when they boiled away. A true runaway greenhouse effect. </p>
<p>I can't remember where I read this, but it struck me rather chillingly (or the opposite, I guess, but who is struck boilingly?) as a glimpse at Earth's future as the sun continues to heat up as it nears the helium burning stage of it's life. </p>
<p>First, the oceans would have begun evaporating, the water vapor capturing yet more heat as a greenhouse gas and accelerating the process. </p>
<p>The next stage occurs over time as the lack of magnetic field allows the solar wind to strip away the lighter hydrogen, while ocean's worth of remaining oxygen began to bind up with carbon, sulfur, and other products of a clearly heavily volcanic past, inferred by Venus' multitude of volcanoes and almost completely new surface, leaving behind mostly carbon dioxide, and other friendly atmospheric contributors like sulphuric acid. </p>
<p>This of course, traps yet more heat, and so the system just goes completely off the rails, until you have what we see now. A planet that has replaced it's oceans with a sea of carbon dioxide holding in enough heat to melt lead at the surface. Not to mention, thick and heavy enough to resist most erosion from solar wind, along with some sort of interaction at the cloud tops that creates something of a magnetic field - like barrier as well. </p></div>		</li>
