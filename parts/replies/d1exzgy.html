			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the way of life. Today, commercial farmers prepare the animals they are going to consume before they are even born. In the meat industry, animals are genetically modified to meet our needs as consumers. To me, that sounds more cruel. We raise our livestock with care and respect. When it comes down to it, we try to make it as quick as possible. Once we set our sights on the pig, cow, or goat we wish to slaughter, they somehow know their end is near. It's sad, but our family has to eat somehow. My uncle works in the meat industry  after being on our small farm. He says that we treat our animals like royalty when compared to those that are raised commercially. When buying meat, make sure to check if it was raised locally. 9 times outta 10, local farmers treat their animals better than commercial farms.</p></div>		</li>
