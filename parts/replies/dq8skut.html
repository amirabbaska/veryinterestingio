			<div class="markdown"><p>Why encrypted? I’m talking about ensuring poor decisions made by American politicians don’t affect services hosted in the US for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>I do however expect VPN and IP recycling to get interesting. I’m quite sure that American citizens and the global community will get quite inventive with privacy. It’s none of our ISPs business what we do online.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm wondering about is how would ISP's classify traffic? If all my traffic is encrypted and going to proxies, would they penalize all of it? Like all traffic they don't recognize would be heavily throttled, and allow normal speeds only to servers they recognize and for which the user paid for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting point. A lot of people don't think or even bother to do basic privacy stuff, even in IT.</p>
<p>Hell, I have a pretty decent understanding of the risks and what can get captured, and I'm just too lazy :/</p>
<p>This is gonna be a bit of kicking a hornet's nest. More people will step up. But I guess the cost/benefit is there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they can shape traffic on the backbone network then they'll get nearly everything from Canada too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to say “that won’t happen”, by “that” I mean for example: stopping/throttling a user in Brazil from accessing a service hosted in Canada because it goes through the US.</p>
<p>I want to, but I can say nothing for sure. It’s just... unthinkable. It would not go unresponded to. Honestly, I’m not concerned about that scenario at this time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, if it does <a href="https://i.imgur.com/2b4hnxB.jpg" target="_blank">Latin America and Australia will be hit the hardest</a> (from <a href="http://submarine-cable-map-2017.telegeography.com/" target="_blank">telegeography.com</a>).</p></div>		</li>
