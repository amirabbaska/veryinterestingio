<blockquote>
<p>Speed limits are being lowered on normal roads much more excessively than on paid roads. This could be done to urge/pester people into paying for the subscription.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the analogy, If Comcast (or any other ISP) owns the lines, they can slow the traffic of every other ISP while increasing theirs, forcing customers who have a choice to go with them for the speeds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a particularly brutal election year, the current Rep/Dem government adjust the roads. Lanes are closed, speed limits are lowered, and it will take you hours to get to your destination. &quot;Coincidentally&quot;, the roads that are affected are the roads that lead towards the Dem/Rep conventions (the opposite party).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a big one. In the analogy, it's Comcast (or another ISP) lowering the download speed of Netflix, while boosting their own version of it. Forcing Comcast customers to go with their version because the others are too slow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Car manufacturers start improving their cars in ways that adhere to paid road standards and become less applicable on the normal road. E.g. would you pay more for a car which has bluetooth connectivity to switch road lights on (paid roads feature) if you do not have a road subscription and there is no bluetooth system on norma roads? No? So that means that a notable subset of new cars that are released are irrelevant for you (or at least unjustifiably expensive). Unless you buy a subscription...</p>
<p>The company you want to find a job at needs someone who starts early, and quickly loses interest in those who do not have the paid road subscription. It's never said explicitly, but it's painfully obvious in the interviewer's posture and interest in the interview.</p>

<p>How do these fit into the analogy though?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think maybe the best comparison would be to say if McDonald's had two separate drive throughs, one coming from the paid roads and one from the free roads, where they clearly serve people from the paid roads faster. Or you can only order some items from the paid roads dirve through.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>For the car manufacturers: imagine if the paid network works in Tbps while the free internet still uses Gbps. A sizable subset of premade computers will be sold with Tbps capabilities. Customers who don't have the paid subscription will either have to pay more for a feature they will not use, or have to buy the subscription to actually use the Tbps network card. If they do not want to pay for the subscription <strong>or</strong> the useless feature, then they can only buy the Gbps computers. As the subscription gains popularity, the Gbps premade computers will become less and less available.</p>
<p>For the job interview: image if LinkedIn decided to only be accessible through a paid internet subscription. Plenty of employers in my sector (software development) will pull their nose up at someone who doesn't have a LinkedIn <em>today</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To expand on this, imagine Comcast <em>bought</em> LinkedIn and required users to have a ComcastULTRA subscription (or a similar package from an 'affiliate' company) in order to make full use of LinkedIn</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever the topic comes up, there's always a top comment describing this hypothetical dystopia caused by the lack of net neutrality. And I always wonder, has this person never heard of Romania?</p>
<p>We're one of the poorest countries in Europe. We have an inefficient government</p>
<p>But in the past 15 years, in a barely regulated market, the ISPs have gotten from 0 coverage to better coverage than the state-owned water companies.</p>
<p>We've never had net neutrality, but what we do have is internet speeds which most americans would kill for. 1000Mbps down 500mbps down for 10 euros (about 2 hours of average gross wage, about 5 hours of minimum gross wage), available even in some rural areas (where 56% homes are connected to the internet but only 28% have a toilet which flushes).</p>
<p>How do you explain the fact that none of this high-way bullshit was even attempted by Romanian ISPs, in a country with institutions so weak that they can't even enforce tax collection?</p>
<p>Instead, they've created a healthy market in which competition dragged the speeds up and the prices down.</p>
<p>Do you see how this is empirical data which completely disproves your assumptions?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/5bldls/flashback_to_bernies_campaign_he_uses_10th_place/d9pppwc/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/5bldls/flashback_to_bernies_campaign_he_uses_10th_place/d9pppwc/</a></p>
<p>Edit: If the current actors don't compete, others will compete against them. But the government has to get out of their way. As it stands, regulation is preventing competition.</p>
<p>ISPs in Romania were very uncompetitive in the early 2000s. 50 usd for 32KBs is what it costed us in 2001 (medium gross wage was around 150 USD at the time). So we set up our own network to share bandwidth. So did thousands of others, as I pointed out in the comment I linked. No approvals, no taxes, no neutrality. The government didn't crack down on it, so ISPs had to step it up or go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 16 years and companies routinely try to offer me free stuff to change ISP. It's funny because I saw redditors complain about how internet in Croatia sucks because Telekom owns most of the infrastructure and they won't upgrade it. Telekom salesmen knock on my door every couple of months. I'd have half-price cable with my gigabit internet if I was dumb enough to sign a 2 year contract.</p>
<p>What the US government is doing, on the other hand, is cracking down on competition by regulating. Net neutrality is not the worst way you can regulate an ISP, but it's destructive nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because America is trying to open up economical markets through its governmental policy; because of a government which heavily relies on lobbying coming from big business.<br />
Big business wields the government as a tool, and tries to pass legislation to get more money, instead of simply improving their service to the customer and have the customer <em>willingly</em> pay more for a better service..</p>
<p>Also please note that it's currently not illegal to charge more for higher bandwidth. With my ISP, I decided to either get a 100mbps line or a more expensive 200mbps line. This is normal and not the focus of the net neutrality argument.</p>
<p>The issue isn't about charging for bandwidth. The issue is about throttling bandwidth <strong>based on which site you choose to visit</strong>.<br />
Currently, it is illegal to change a user's experience based on which part of the internet they wish to browse. The abolishment of net neutrality would change that.</p>
<p>As a redditor, would you be happy if your ISP blocked Reddit (you can still access all other websites for the original cost), unless you purchase their Reddit package for $50 extra per month?<br />
That is the crux of the net neutrality debate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The theory:</p>
<p>If by charging you $50 to browse reddit they get to profit $49, there's room for another company to charge $49 and pocket $48 for the same service. Repeat until the profit is low enough that it doesn't motivate any company to enter the business.</p>
<p>The facts:</p>
<p>The only thing net neutrality could have stopped in Romania was the unmetered pokemon go last summer.</p>
<p>Your argument is more hypothetical dystopian bullshit which is contradicted by both economic theory and the empirical evidence I already laid out.</p>
<p>The problem with economics is everyone has an opinion on it.</p>
<p>And the problem with net neutrality is too many people watched that John Oliver episode. Next time you watch him attempt to stop the evils of Time Warner, remember that he works for Time Warner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the solution to big businesses lobbying local governments for regional monopolies is to create a bigger regulatory framework for them to lobby? When the FCC or whatever government agency is granted the funds and power to enforce against bandwidth throttling, do you really think that big business are going stop lobbying for market power? Just take a look at the FDA and factory farms if you think I'm making up the reality that is regulatory capture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the dystopian fear comes from some of the shady business practices that have historically transpired in the US.  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.mercurynews.com/2014/05/08/cogent-ceo-comcast-purposefully-slowed-down-netflix-streaming/amp/?client=safari" target="_blank">Cable companies purposely limiting access to some internet services like Netflix</a> so that you are more inclined to use the cable company's own video streaming service. How the big cable companies <a href="http://www.digitopoly.org/2014/06/02/how-is-it-exactly-that-cable-companies-in-the-us-dont-compete/" target="_blank">divide up regions to stay out of each other's way</a>. This way they don't have to compete with each other and are free to set higher prices. </p>
<p>Many countries have put people first before profit, the fear is that we may not be so lucky. Great Britain has unlimited data, we are still fighting for it whilst trying to keep from being throttled. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is literally 0 competition in the USA because the companies pay off politicians to grant them monopolies on cities. If you live in USATown, USA you can only subscribe to comcast. If you live in USACity, USA you can only subscribe to AT&amp;T. </p>
<p>I think thats the difference you are looking for. There is no competition like there is there bc the lawyers that work for these companies found ways to eliminate local competition. It's sad :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A serious internet infrastructure is incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>Would you really have, say, 2 or more separate power grids in every suburb in order to create competition?</p>
<p>The answer is to separate the infrastructure service (backend) from the consumer-facing frontends. The frontends compete with each other. The backend is regulated as a utility. That is exactly why power infrastructure is so successful without being redundant. This is how it has worked for decades, even places like Texas use this model for utilities because multiple parallel infrastructures is inefficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This part is really important. The internet today is probably the most pure free market in the world. If you have a great idea you can invest only your time to make a minimal product to start competing against fortune 500 companies. This both keeps large companies in check; ensuring they keep providing a better service to their customers to compete, and creates probably the most meritocratic, accessible system for class mobility in history.</p>
<p>Without net neutrality that near perfect competition is entirely gone. Instead of just investing time to create your product, you now have to raise enough money to bid against a fortune 500 company for bandwidth before you even have users. That's impossible.</p>
<p>The end result of that is the entire internet becoming more and more monopolized, shifting from the customer obsessed style of current companies like Google and Amazon, to the customer wringing style of Comcast and Time Warner. Every large company on the internet will have a totally new kind of leverage to screw you over for any reason they want.</p>
