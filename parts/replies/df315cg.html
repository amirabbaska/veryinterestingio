			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also another very large reason for region locking. Every country/region has different criteria for the type of content they want their people to see. Sometimes in order for content to be published it needs to be heavily altered. The distributor can choose to not alter the content as it will not be profitable for them to do that just for 1 region. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been watching How to Get Away with Murder on Netflix, and I was told there's 3 seasons. I am at the end of 2, hoping to get my jollies with the 3rd season and it's not in my Netflix library.. </p>
<p>I can totally see why people resort to piracy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These reasons are governmental and distributional. </p>
<p>If someone in China, Pakistan, Qatar, Ghana, Brazil, Peru or Malaysia wants to watch True Lies, why does some organization get to tell him he can't?</p>
<p>Region locking has no benefits for the end consumer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm sure the distributors could spout off a list of reasons it's &quot;beneficial&quot;, I can't think of any that would hold water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see a content owner saying &quot;I want to charge people in the US and western Europe $6 to watch my movie, but in Africa nobody would pay that but they'd pay $2, so I'd rather have $2 than nothing.</p>
<p>While that might seem unfair in the West, that seems like a reasonable, non-dickish thing to do.  </p>
<p>Now, I don't know if anyone's doing that. But that would be a use that benefits the consumer, at least from the view of those in the lower-income regions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It <strong>CAN</strong> be (but isn't always) used in consumer-friendly ways.</p>
<p>Say Netflix needs $8/month from Americans. For some reason(s), they cannot or will not compromise on that.</p>
<p>But they want to provide Netflix to Nigerians, who cannot afford $8. So they make it available for $0.50/month. </p>
<p>But now you need to prevent Americans from paying Nigerian prices and watching Nigerian Netflix. </p>
<p>There are a few ways to do that-- totally lock them out, or reduce the selection/quality available on the cheaper, foreign version of the site. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other thing to consider is that there may be local laws governing what content can be distributed.</p>
<p>For instance if a movie gets banned or censured in Malaysia then if you'reâ€‹ a content distributor you will need to figure out how to prevent streaming that movie to Malaysia, but but to Thailand.</p></div>		</li>
