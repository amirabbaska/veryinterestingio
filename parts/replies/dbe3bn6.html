			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly yes, but the body would need to be burried in the right circumstances in order to promote fosillization. Likely this kind of thing has already happened, as we've burried a lot of humans in the past. </p>
<p>The problem with your scenario is that the vast majority of the bodies wouldn't get burried, but would instead sit on the surface to be eaten by everything from microbes to scavenging animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there would be some fossilized people already from people who fell in tar pits and such, far more permanent would be the structures we've built.</p>
<p>Even if the buildings topple to the ground the structures themselves will remain.  The roads would remain as flat layers of stone and metal with other materials accumulating beside them.  Structures that end up getting covered by various means, depending on how humanity ends and what happens after, will survive.  The metals would not revert to metal ore, but would remain concentrated.  Plastics that were properly trapped would still be around in 65 million years.  Many resins we create would still be around, including people's dental fillings. </p>
<p>A city that ends up underwater -- such as Venice Italy -- would quickly be covered by other material and the city would remain quite clear even after many millions of years have passed over.  Assuming the water easily invites new matter to float on top of it, and die and settle on the sunken city, it would quickly be covered in a protective layer.</p>
<p>It may take some excavation to uncover the city after it had been covered for millions of years, but the layers of humanity would be clear for anyone able to extract and read the scene.</p></div>		</li>
