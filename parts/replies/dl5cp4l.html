			<div class="markdown"><p>The spectral lines correspond to relatively little energy - they're observable only because they occur only in narrow wavelength bands. Even in those bands, they typically reduce the emission by less than 20% in most cases. So the solar spectrum is indeed dominated by blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>More directly, the spectral lines are absorption lines rather than emission lines, and take away from the radiation rather than reinforcing it. But even if they were emission lines, their energy would not be that great compared to the blackbody spectrum</p></div>		</li>
