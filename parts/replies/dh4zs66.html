			<div class="markdown"><p>I'ld point out that microwave does penetrate a bit inside the food, thru cooking it inside out, but not much, it is still mostly on the surface.</p>
<p>Also, air is a very good heat insulator, and hold very little heat capacity, this is why it take so long in an oven to cook: the food is surrounded by an insulator.</p>
<p>It take LOTS of air to actually transmit heat from the element to the food, you don't realise it because you don't see the convection movement inside the oven. Also, there is alot of heat radiated directly from the element/burner to the food via infrared radiation.</p>
<p>Fiberglass, foam and other insulation materials almost all work with the same principle: create lots of tiny air pocket. The material itself may conduct the heat somewhat (fiberglass is actually a relativelly good heat conductor), but the material being mostly air cause the heat to not be able to travel fast due to all the air pocket, hence the insulation propriety...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nope, and I suspect it is about the same, as water absorb the microwaves, so if it have water, it can't go deeper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves actually spin water molecules like a top. &quot;Microwave ovens work by causing molecules that have two opposing poles to spin rapidly. Because of their polarity, molecules like water will constantly align themselves with a magnetic field they're subjected to. Microwave radiation creates a magnetic field that oscillatesâ€”which means that the field is constantly changing its orientation (direction the positive and negative charges face). Those shifts make polar molecules like water start spinning as they try to keep up with the changing charges. As the molecules spin, they generate heat. This process is known as dipole rotation. (&quot;Dipole&quot; simply means &quot;having two poles.&quot;)&quot; <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-homes-soap-microwave/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-homes-soap-microwave/</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They both use physics!  Electric ovens use coulombic forces to push electrons across a resistive element.  In passing that resistance the electrons cause atomic vibration in the element and shoot off electromagnetic waves.  Gas ovens cause entropy increasing reactions where atoms combine into lower energy rest states, while excess energy again causes particle vibration and electromagnetic waves to shoot off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you mentioned, microwaves aren't evenly distributed with the microwave box. A cool way to see that is with Indian papadum, a snack food that needs to be cooked (usually on the stovetop) and expands when cooked. </p>
