			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, but it takes a while. It's like mixing water and a powdered drink mix, or milk and strawberry syrup - you could just put the ingredients into the same glass, but unless you either stir them together or wait for an hour or two, you're just going to have a layer of flavoring and a layer of drinkable liquid sitting on top of each other. The only things that can really &quot;stir&quot; rivers are waterfalls, rapids, and being forced into the other river by all the water coming up from behind, so the big factor is time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the two fluids have dissimilar enough properties, they won't mix, or they'll be very slow to mix.  You can see this most easily in fluids that have different densities (<a href="https://imgur.com/qfai9ZW" target="_blank">like this</a>).  You can easily mix together corn syrup and maple syrup, or dish soap and water, but unless you add energy to the system by stirring them up, they'll tend to stay separated and only very slowly mix together.</p></div>		</li>
