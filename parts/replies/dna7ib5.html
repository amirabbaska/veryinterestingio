			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragonflies are acrobatic fliers certainly, because they have DIRECT flight muscles/attachments (muscles that control the wings directly), whereas many flying insects have indirect muscle attachments. These indirect muscles control the shape of the thorax, which moves the wings. Imagine stabbing two pencils into a racquetball. The pencils are the wings, the ball is the thorax. If you squeeze the ball, the pencils move. These are how indirect flight muscles create flight - it's not really as precise or controlled as direct flight muscles, but it gets the job done. Just a fun dragonfly fact for you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dragonflies can apparently fly at ~4x the speed of houseflies and can hover (most flies cant), but those bastard horseflies are faster than all of them. </p>
<p>I'm having trouble believing an insect can reach 145km/h</p>
