			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all true! You’re pretty much spit on with just a few small extras:</p>
<p>Another big issue that is always looked at in aircraft is performance during an engine failure. If you lose a single engine in a quad you will essentially have no operational control or stability whatsoever, and you’d get flipped upside down pretty quick. Also in a giant quad you would have 4 driveshafts powering the roots (because batteries aren’t powerful enough for use in aviation... yet ) which means 4 times more shafts/bearings/joints/etc that can possibly fail, as well as a lot of lost energy in the transfer from engine to multiple rotors. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if i want to lift massive ass weights? I imagine you can only lengthen the main rotor so long. Shouldn't a quad be able to produce the much bigger lifts that a helicopter simply can't?</p></div>		</li>
