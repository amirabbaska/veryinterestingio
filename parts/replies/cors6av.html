			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, you are really GOOD at this (explaining things clearly).</p>
<p>I have completed a graduate level course on electromagnetics, but have never studied gauge theory, and your use of em to illustrate gauge theory was useful. You've made me curious to go out and try to understand what this symmetry is that gives rise to the strong force.</p>
<p>Your explanation of the weak force is pretty light, (giving the shape of the potential and really nothing else) but at that is still the most detailed explanation I have ever encountered. (It beats the heck out of &quot;mumble mumble Radioactive Decay mumble mumble&quot;!) Really helpful, thank you for taking the time to make it so understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh good!  I'm never sure if I'm making any sense at all.  If you've taken grad E&amp;M you should be able to understand gauge theories pretty well at least at the classical level (assuming you've seen lagrangian field theory).  Spoiler alert: the symmetry of the strong force is called SU(3).  You can find a pretty good treatment of basic gauge theory in griffiths &quot;introduction to particle physics,&quot; or a more advanced treatment in Peskin and Schroeder chapter 15.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a QFT course I was not entirely prepared for last semester, and we did in fact use Peskin &amp; Schroeder (alas, but I'll check out that book by Griffiths, seeing as I am a huge fan of his books). Anyway, none of the chapters about gauge forces made any sense to me until I read what you wrote above. Better late than never, I guess. Thank you! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. </p>
<p>Still trying to wrap my head around the first part of it (about symmetries). Not a physicist, hope you'll excuse my  imprecise terminology.</p>
<p>So, first, I'm not sure I get if <em>global</em> symmetry is an empirical result, i.e. if we have direct evidence that it holds. But the way you phrased it made me think it does.</p>
<p>Next, <em>local</em> symmetry you're saying is &quot;demanded&quot;, as in: presented as an axiom basically, right? So then my question is: why do  we demand local symmetry? And, if the additional terms required to make local symmetry hold are fields, what is their point? Again, basically the same question: is there an empirical reason to introduce those fields, or are they motivated in a different way (formal elegance? laziness? :P)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in a theory about elementary particles, global symmetries are (in a sense) empirical.  We know the form of the matter field equations from previous knowledge of the matter fields, and the global symmetry is inherent to those equations.  </p>
<p>As to the local symmetry, yes I think it's fair to say that demanding the local symmetry hold is just an axiom -- i.e. a GUESS.  But, it's not a blind guess; there's a lot of logic there, and it has to do with geometry.  There's a strong analogy that exists between gauge theories and einsteins theory of gravity (which is also a gauge theory, just an unusual one.  glossing over this..).  Basically global transformations are analogous to intertial changes of reference frame (changing to a reference frame moving at constant velocity), and local transformations are analogous to nonineratial reference frames (changing to a reference frame which is accelerating).  When you change to a reference frame that is accelerating (like a car accelerating) it feels like there is a new force that wasn't there before.  I.e. the theory has changed because theres this new &quot;force&quot; hanging around.  The analogous thing in gauge theory is that when you do a local transformation you get a new term from taking the derivative of the phase factor.  </p>
<p>Einsteins big conceptual leap in developing general relativity was that he said physics should be the same in all reference frames, inertial or otherwise.  So what he had to do was introduce a new field (called the metric, which leads to curved space and all that jazz) in order to make the theory invariant.</p>
<p>In gauge theory, we basically say the same thing.  We postulate that the theory should be invariant under the local transformation, and we have to introduce a gauge field (force field).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I'm going to stop being mysterious and just use the word Lagrangian.  The equation for your fields is called a lagrangian.</p>
<p>Basically the way you build a lagrangian for your matter fields is you decide which symmetries that you want your theory to have and you write down ALL possible terms which obey the symmetries.  In the example above, I could have included + c<em>|phi|^4 +d</em>|phi|^6 + ....  This sounds nuts, but it can actually be managed because there can be quite a few constraints from symmetry.  </p>
<p>Although, in general there are still an infinite number of terms.  Through a process called renormalization, the higher order terms get suppressed.  They are still there, but the coefficients in front of them are very small and so they can be ignored.  If fact, even if you don't put the higher order interactions into your lagrangian initially, they will be &quot;dynamically generated&quot; through the renormalization procedure.  I know this doesn't make sense, and I would need a dedicated post and a lot more thought to explain renormalization properly, but trust me it's really cool.</p>
<p>One symmetry that I didn't mention above is Lorentz symmetry.  This is a fancy name for &quot;physics is the same in all reference frames&quot; (remember Einstein?).  A theory which is invariant under change of reference frame is called Lorentz invariant, which all good relativistic theories should be.  This is one big thing that constrains the form of your Lagrangian.  We categorize different Lorentz invariant objects by their spin (intrinsic magnetic moment).  All the matter fields we know about have spin 1/2, and all the force fields have spin 1.  this is another way of differentiating between what is a force and what is matter.  That was all we knew existed until we discovered the higgs boson, which has spin 0.  If you're wondering &quot;what about spin 53 or 243/2?&quot;  We don't know; maybe the big physicist in the sky didn't want to do the algebra.  But for some reason the simplest Lagrangians tend to be the ones that are realized the most in fundamental physics.  </p></div>		</li>
