			<div class="markdown"><p>This is famously the case with Kakapos in New Zealand. Kakapos are lek-mating (males do not provide any parental care or resources to the female and so females choose males based on their courtship displays &amp; such) and like other lek-mating species the males have highly variable reproductive success.</p>
<p>They're also critically endangered. Early conservation efforts used supplementary unlimited feeding. Because of this, the females of the population were in good condition and the sex ratio of the new kakapos was heavily skewed towards males as a result because each mother was &quot;trying&quot;* to have the next generation's top males.</p>
<p>*It's not a conscious choice, hence the quotes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what you said, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4639502.stm" target="_blank">some studies</a> show that human male fetuses are more likely to be miscarried during stressful pregnancies. I'd imagine a woman with a 'high rank' - more money, stable home, choice to not work during pregnancy - would have less stress than a woman of 'lower rank'. And thus, the woman with a 'lower rank' may terminate male fetuses due to stress whereas a 'high rank' female would be more likely to carry a baby boy to term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Healthier diets and mothers who feel safe and secure due to their social status will create a less hostile environment in the womb which is less likely to cause a miscarriage. Males are miscarried more often than females. This can be evidenced by an increase in female births during times of famine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the previous understanding of human conception was that the male's sperm is highly active and the woman's egg is a passive recipient of the winning sperm's DNA.</p>
<p>More recently, there is evidence that the woman plays a more active role; her entire reproductive system is designed to react to subtle changes in the environment and, in doing so, select against certain traits in the sperm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's differential survival of the sperm.  I'm not sure of the exact mechanism but presumably it has to do with the quality of the female/mother.  If she's well nourished (because of priority of access to better resources due to high rank) she can selectively kill X chromosome sperm, thus producing a male-offspring bias.</p></div>		</li>
