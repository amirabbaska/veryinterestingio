			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. You have two possible correct heights to pick each pin to, instead of just one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth noting that many master keyed lock systems don’t have two positions on all pins, but only a subset. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would a correct combination be able to take either option on all pins or only one or the other?
for example, in logic:
5 pins, M is master position, S is standard.</p>
<p>(MvS)\^(MvS)\^(MvS)\^(MvS)\^(MvS)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(M\^M\^M\^M\^M)v(S\^S\^S\^S\^S)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Early master key systems had one set of pins with two cuts, so any key that was a combination of the master key and the door-specific key would unlock it. This, if you had the door-specific key, you could discover the master key with an attack where you try variations to discover what the master pin settings are one at a time. A typical lock has 7 pins with 5 possible heights. There’s 5^7 = 78,125 possible keys, but with this attack you only need to try 5*7 = 35 of them.</p>
<p>Modern master key systems have two concentric sets of pins, one keyed to that door and one keyed to the master, so the hybrid keys won’t work, and you can’t get information about the master key this way. They rekeyed the locks in my college’s doors while I was there, because the master key was leaked via this technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure does.  And multiple-master systems (like college dorm locks, where there's the room key, and then an RA key for all the locks on the floor, and a true master key for all the locks in the dorm, so every lock has to open for three different keys) are so easy to pick you basically just apply tension then stick the lockpick in and wiggle it and it pops open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a some system of protection against fake keys? In a normal lock there's just one key that will fit, in a lock with a master key there is a valid master key and a valid normal key, but there's also (I think) n^(2)-2 invalid keys that will work. Really raises the chance of me stuffing my key randomly into someones lock and it working, and also makes it significantly easier to pick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but locksmiths use charts to ensure they don't inadvertently create keys that will match a combination not intended.</p>
<p>Also for very large installations key blanks may designed such that one key will enter more than one keyway, so the master key will enter two different cylinders when the more restrictive keys won't enter.</p>
<p>I was in charge of what at the time was the largest master key setup ever, 1978, Renaissance Center, Detroit.  There was a master key that opened over 95 percent of the door locks.</p>
<p>Special keyways, x,y, and z by Yale and seven pin locks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a nightmare. I once had to rekey a college campus that had a comprised system. The buildings ranged for original construction in the 1800's to 2004. There were 500 plus doors and the administration insisted on a master key system. The best we could do was get them down to three, Yale, Schlage, and an IC core mix. The sad part, we had to do the entire job again in less than a year because they didn't make changes internally to protect the systems integrity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I take my regular low level key and grind away all the furrows along its side so that it will physically fit into the cylinders, it might open new doors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, it's the locks that are keyed both to a master and to a specific key for that lock, right? For example, the locks to the exterior doors of my school only open with master keys. The classroom doors open with masters and with room-specific keys. The exterior doors are more secure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but... This kind of locks only helps so far anyways. Basic locks work with the assumption that people see that the door is locked and don't try to enter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Designed for yes, but incidentally many more keys will open it.</p>
<p>Say a key with the combination</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>Will open your lock, and you have a master key code that will open it too:</p>
<p>665</p>
<p>There will be 2+4 pins in the first cylinder, 3+3 pins in the second, and a regular 5 in the 3rd.</p>
<p>To get back to the point, keys 265, 635, 635 etc will also open up the lock as long as the shear line is at one of the two heights in the position.</p>
<p>There's a base height of pins, so a no. 1 pin will always be 4mm tall, and each pin size increase will go up 0.5mm for instance.</p>
<p>So the 2+4 pin will be a 4.5mm tall pin with another 2mm pin on top. That will create two separate shear lines for each keyway.</p>
<p>Different key systems also use different pin heights, spacing, and shape.</p></div>		</li>
