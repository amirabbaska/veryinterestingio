<p>Perhaps it's the id making an effort to affect you in a way your conscious self can notice, due to stressors affecting you in a negative way that are un-perceivable to your conscious self.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to think on- in double-blind studies on conditions that can be objectively measured, the placebo effect disappears. </p>
<p>Placebo effects come in many shapes and sizes. It's the patient misremembering how much they were in pain before. It's the patient assuming that the pill they took had to do something. It's the patient (unconsciously!) trying to please the doctor. It's the doctor wanting to justify their finding. There's a ton of reasons why people will think that their pain or sniffles or whatever are better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard otherwise. In studies pharma industries even tweak the shape and taste of placebo pills to be identical to the real drug because this has an effect on the study if they are not identical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true.  What double blinded studies do is allows the placebo effect to be measured with statistical significance. In fact placebos are a very important part of double blinded clinical trials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out the brain's effect on pain. Funny and informative 20 minute lecture. All of Lorimer Moseley's lectures are reasonably approachable and contain numerous studies showing the placebo effect. Some of them double blind.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false. It's outrageous that this is the top comment. There are some broad comments in here that have an element of truth but they have nothing to do with the &quot;placebo effect.&quot; In fact several of these claims are the opposite of placebo.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;diet and environment cure diseases.&quot; This is 100% false. Diet and environment can cure some diseases. Not all, a significant percentage are totally unrelated to diet or environment and a larger percentage are unaffected by diet and environment after they are present. Your statement is false. But even more -- this has nothing to do with the &quot;placebo effect.&quot;</p>
<p>edit:added un in front of affected, both are true, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My goodness, this place has become crackpot central.. it is as if science and truth itself is a matter of democracy, or a popularity contest among the clueless. I dont know how they used to have quality content and answers here, but lately the top answer spots are filled with hand-wavey inaccurate stuff just baiting for upvotes. Its shameful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Careful - it proves that <em>some</em> diseases can be cured in <em>some</em> people in each study (sometimes the majority of them) if they are <em>told</em> they're taking the drug that cures it. It absolutely does not show the diseases will clear up given no intervention.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>diet and environment cure diseases</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also not quite right for the same reasons as above.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>statistical data and double-blind experiments are the only valid medical evidence and drug development method</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I (college biology professor) most completely agree with this one. There's no substitute for trying and measuring before you assert a conclusion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I was trying to say that there are many circumstantial and undetectable factors in every individual case. None of these factors can be isolated as a universal cause or therapy. I have improved my answer a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great.You've left in the part that says placebos show things can get better on their own, though. Placebo groups aren't left alone - that's the job of the negative control group. Placebo groups are given a dummy version of the treatment. The patient has to be under the impression they're being treated.</p></div>		</li>
