			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I think it's 60 feet before and after an intersection you put them up/down, could be wrong but it's somewhere in there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with everything you say, wouldnt more axes reduce the load on the road, atleast spread it out, and reduce the wear and tear on the road? Seems that would be the case wouldnt it? </p>
<p>I get that its an easy metric to price out a toll, but why not base the price on the weight of the vehicle instead, and offer discount per axle since the more axels the spread out the load and the less wear on the road</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because putting scales in every lane of every toll gate isn't something the operators feel like doing.  Also it would really confuse consumers who drive the roads.  (&quot;Why am I being charged more today than yesterday?&quot;)  Charging per axle is just simpler.  Also since the government puts a cap on how much each axle can hold, (10,000# here in the US I believe) toll operators know that certain numbers of axles are within certain weight ranges.</p></div>		</li>
