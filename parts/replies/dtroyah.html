			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahahaha, The first person to ever set foot on the island got swiped at by a polar bear as soon as they exited the helicopter.</p>
<p>From the wiki
&quot;[Dr. Hall] was strapped into a harness and lowered from a helicopter down to the island. This was quite a frozen island and it was completely covered with ice. As he was lowered out of the helicopter, a polar bear took a swat at him. The bear was on the highest point on the island and it was hard for him to see because it was white. Hall yanked at the cable and got himself hauled up. He said he very nearly became the first person to end his life on Landsat Island.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that polar bear actually swam to that teeny island, or was born there.  It's 20km of ocean swimming even if you know exactly where you're going, which it couldn't have.</p></div>		</li>
