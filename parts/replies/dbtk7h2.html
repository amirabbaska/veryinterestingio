			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is: Yes, but why would you? Really the only speed limit you're dealing with theoretically is the speed of light. So there would be a point where it's beyond reach, but that's a hell of a long time from now. The real problem would be finding the thing to intercept it, then conducting the about face to return it to earth. In my mind, that would be the most challenging part of the mission. We know it's &quot;out there&quot; but exactly down to the meter is a bit fuzzier, especially if it goes offline. Realistically there's really no reason to go out of our way to try and pick it up unless it detected something of significance that can't otherwise be safely transmitted by its instruments. Long story short, it's destined to voyage among the stars long past the lifespan of humanity. Probably better that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool. Just an interesting thought experiment. Like if suddenly we realized the mystery of life was on there and now it's the farthest manmade object ever and heading even further at a furious pace.</p>
<p>A more detailed question would be, can we catch up to it, given it's 40 year head start, and the need for fuel, etc. to deccelerate it and turn it around once you catch it, given current technology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, compared to some stuff we could send out into interstellar space with current tech, it's not going very fast. (Yes, it's going stupid fast, but compared to stuff we could send out now, no contest.) The difficult part, as mentioned before, would be the logistics of finding it, and having a craft that can stop it in its tracks, then propel it back to Sol in a reasonable time frame (say 20-40 years). When you start to think about the engineering and logistics involved, you begin to realize the scale of the project you're proposing for such a deceptively complicated mission. </p>
<p>The mission couldn't be manned since it would, at best, be a lifetime mission. So the robot(s) that are piloting the recovery vehicle would have to be stable enough and &quot;smart&quot; enough to function without external commands from earth. From a hypothetical standpoint, we have the technology to pull a mission like this off. We could pretty easily develop a drive system that could get a ship there pretty quickly if we really put our minds and resources towards it, and could make the craft &quot;smart&quot; enough to execute the mission without direct human intervention. It would definitely be one of the greatest technological achievements of mankind to date doing it. But again, short of evidence of God or something, there's really no point. </p>
<p>You could develop, build, launch, and manage an entire fleet of interstellar probes that could provide more detailed data, and go several times faster than Voyager for the cost of the recovery mission to bring it home.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Yes, we could do it, however; it would be cheaper to build better probes and leave Voyager in peace. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could a ship be designed built and launched capable of catching up to Voyager, capturing it and returning it to earth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but it would be a terrible waste of resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If so, is there a cutoff point where after Voyager has enough of a headstart that isn't possible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on how good your recovery ship is. But as we currently understand it, there <em>is</em> a hard limit: Anything that gets more than about 14 billion light years away from us is receding faster than the speed of light, and at that point you can't get it back.</p>
<p>14 billion light years is a pretty long way, though. It's more than 7 trillion times farther away than Voyager 1 has already traveled. But in any case, Voyager 1 is moving slower than the Milky Way's own escape velocity at this altitude, so unless given a further boost by something, it will never leave the Milky Way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there any way to visualise what orbit Voyager 1 would assume in the Milky Way, based on its current trajectory? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the sun is orbiting the galaxy at around 220 km/s, and Voyager is &quot;only&quot; moving at 17 km/s relative to the sun, so the orbit of the probe won't be that much different. The galactic escape velocity near the sun is about 540 km/s, so the direction the probe exited the solar system only makes for a difference of about 5% of what remains (17 km/s / (540 km/s - 220 km/s) = 5.31 %). How this translates is beyond my knowledge, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know offhand what direction Voyager 1 is moving relative to the Sun and the center of the galaxy. In any case, an orbit around the galaxy takes roughly 200 million years, and in that time Voyager 1 might well crash into something and disintegrate, or have its orbit perturbed by passing stars which would make it hard to predict the future trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless Voyager will get to light speed before we can launch something that is faster, we can most definitely design something. The biggest challenge (Since Voyager isn't getting anywhere near light speed) would be design, materials, power sources, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a huge problem. We might be able to build a probe that could pass it eventually, but one that carries enough fuel to send it back would be pretty much impossible with current technology.</p></div>		</li>
