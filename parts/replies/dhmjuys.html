If you look at the period ratios of the planets in the solar system, they're essentially random numbers, like 6.307 between Jupiter and Mars, rather than approximately 1.5 (3/2), 1.33 (4/3) etc. like in TRAPPIST-1. The most important near resonance is between Jupiter and Saturn, which are close to a 5/2 resonance.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you play the solar system in the same way we played TRAPPIST-1, it would sound pretty bad. We have a few ideas on how to put things together though!</p>
<p>Interestingly, Neptune is in a resonance with Pluto, and with many other objects in the Kuiper belt like Pluto. This actually gives us information about how Neptune migrated in the early solar system to capture (tune) all these bodies into resonance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could you retroactively take Neptune out of the overall system symphony? and reset the Kuiper bodies back to pre capture resonance and see how Sol sounds then??</p>
<p>I assume you guys have done this before and that trappist is the exception to the rule and that the rest of the systems tested do not display such a &quot;divine&quot; sound?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try messing around with it, it's fun! But yes, TRAPPIST-1 is very much an exception! That's partly what's exciting. You'd think they must be fairly common around low mass stars for it to have been discovered!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly, our planets orbit in more of an oval pattern. I wonder... If you played with the orbital pattern changing frequencies if it would work. Think... instead of a sound here and another there... play the earth as a violin with a continuous note changing tones.</p></div>		</li>
