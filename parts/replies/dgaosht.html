			<div class="markdown"><p>Some are. Most OTC meds contain diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but just look at the labels. Melatonin doesn't work well for all that have insomnia, seems to help best with initial insomnia as opposed to getting back to sleep in the middle of the night and the effects may diminish with time.</p>
<p>In the US, it's considered an herbal med so has no FDA regulation. When labs tested a bunch of herbals they found anywhere from 0-200% of the claimed active ingredient. If you find a good one, stick with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>diphenhydramine</p>
