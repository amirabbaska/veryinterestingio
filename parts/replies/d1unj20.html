			<p>&gt; A judge can choose to offer no bail and hold a defendant until trial <br><br>I think that's the part that confuses people. The Eighth Amendment prohibits <em>excessive</em> bail (along with excessive fines and cruel &amp; unusual punishment). That doesn't mean someone has a right to bail, just that bail can't be indirectly denied by setting it to an absurdly high value. Either bail is denied, or it is set to a reasonable amount to ensure the defendant will appear at court.</p>		</li>

			<p>The idea of bail is to give you an incentive to not run away. If the judge thinks you wouldn't run away anyway then he may let you out without asking you for a collateral first.</p>		</li>
