You show up to your court date, you get the bail proceeds back, and the bondsman gets back his loan plus some interest/fees. You don't show up and the bail is forfeited, and your bondsman loses the money (they may hire a bounty hunter to recover what is owed). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't work that way.  You pay the bail bondsman for the bond which is generally 10% of the bail amount.  The bail bondsman puts up the whole bail amount with the court.  When you show up the bail bondsman gets the bail amount back and also keeps your 10%.  You don't get the 10% back.</p>
<p>If you don't show up the court keeps the bond, and the bondsman sends a bounty hunter after you to being you to court and get their bond money back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>K so say bail is set at $5000. Someone goes to a bondsman and gets the bail for $500. Do you have to pay the full $5000 in loan payments or is it the $500 and as long as you appear in court and such that's it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bondsman will upfront the money (since bail is often a large amount) charging something like a 10% fee, which is the amount the person might be able to afford. Then the financial responsibility is on the bail company. If the person &quot;skips&quot; then the bondsman can hire a bounty hunter to track the person down on behalf of the court. Bounty hunters seem scary (and they are) but they have to be licensed so there is at least some accountability. </p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_hunter#U.S._Laws" target="_blank">&quot;As of 2003, bounty hunters claimed to catch 31,500 bail jumpers per year, about 90% of people who jump bail.&quot;</a></p>
<p>That's damn impressive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A judge can choose to offer no bail and hold a defendant until trial </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that's the part that confuses people. The Eighth Amendment prohibits <em>excessive</em> bail (along with excessive fines and cruel &amp; unusual punishment). That doesn't mean someone has a right to bail, just that bail can't be indirectly denied by setting it to an absurdly high value. Either bail is denied, or it is set to a reasonable amount to ensure the defendant will appear at court.</p></div>		</li>
