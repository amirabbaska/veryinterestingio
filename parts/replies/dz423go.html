I don't think cleaning matters much for sanitation purposes though. Most of any harmful contaminants would prob not survive being melted depending on the type of plastic and heat used. plus recycled material is not usually put into new products but repurposed for other things (e.g. old tires being shredded for soft ground covering for playgrounds or synthetic turf). </p></div>		</li>

<p>With plastics, that's definitely <em>not</em> the case. A ton of &quot;new products&quot; are made out of recycled plastics. Bottles are a great example of that. A lot of them are made from 100% recycled materials. You also see plastic used to make one thing (e.g., milk jugs) being melted down and used to make completely different things (e.g., lawn furniture). Most types of plastics can be melted down and re-molded basically indefinitely. So can almost all glass and metal. Even most paper products can be re-pulped and used to make new products.</p>
<p>Still, you're right about tires. But that's because the rubber used to make tires is really hard to actually recycle. Chemistry is all wrong. It's only recently that chemical processes have been developed that make it economical to reclaim tire rubber. But most tires still wind up either sitting in landfills or being shredded for other uses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I phrased it poorly. I added that to clarify that the bottles are not generally reused to make more bottles (in the context of cleaning and sanitation). </p></div>		</li>
