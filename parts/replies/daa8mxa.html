			<div class="markdown"><p>When I see that I'm feeling a negative mood like frustration, dismay, sadness, anger, etc I reflect upon why I feel like that, if I can take direct action in changing the thing that makes me feel like that and what life will be like after whatever is bothering me is over. After that I like to see if there's a bright side, what are some of the potential positive outcomes from what's going on, if there are no apparent ones can I handle it in a way that will create a positive or at the very least, what could I do next time something like this happens to get a better outcome. </p>
<p>Don't sulk, but don't try to mask your emotions under a fake smile. Work through them mentally, talk to other people if you like, talk to someone on reddit. Sometimes just typing out why I'm upset makes me see it in a different way even if I never post it anywhere it shows me it from a more external angle, how my problem might look to someone else. </p></div>		</li>
