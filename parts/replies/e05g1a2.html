			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this answer. All the other higher answers are over-complicated and wrong. If the universe were static and infinite, it would still be dark. We didn't figure out the universe was expanding until we examined redshift.</p>
<p>This is a basic fact you can prove based on the fact that the universe is infinite and geometry. All fields in 3D space diminish in intensity at a rate proportional to the inverse of r^2 because of the formula for surface area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But an infinite universe (with infinite age) would be infinitely bright.  The intensity from a single star diminishes by r^2, but the number of stars within a solid angle of the sky will increase with the surface area by r^2.  So adding the intensity of light with distance you will get a series that doesn't converge.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. But that’s not the universe we live in. All I’m saying is that it’s very possible to have a dark universe that’s also static</p></div>		</li>
