			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My father has two high school diplomas because of this. </p>
<p>I once accidentally left off &quot;Jr.&quot; on the wrong legal document and I had to get 3 new documents all confirming that the person who forgot to put &quot;Jr.&quot; on that document was the same guy who is now putting &quot;Jr.&quot; on all other documents. It's a nightmare. </p>
<p>What's worse is how often people who fill in things for you don't think it's important. I'll put &quot;Jr.&quot; on something, and when they copy it over, they leave it off. And I'll have to correct them, and they'll tell me it's not important and then I have to argue with them about how it is. This is why my dad has two diplomas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well then I'm cocked because my school, no matter how many times we corrected them, fucked up my last name every single time. It's vaguely french sounding so they would ALWAYS add a space or make a letter in the middle capitalized. For my diploma, they even made us read a form and sign it saying &quot;yes this is right&quot;, and they later on must have looked at it and said &quot;this isnt right. dumb kid, we'll save him from himself and fix it for him even though we aren't supposed to.&quot; and changed it anyway. GARRHHHHHH</p></div>		</li>

<p>you are REALLY risking the two's credit reports getting mixed together. Also happens with mail, and all kinds of official records. Not worth it, I would think, but to each their own.</p>

<p>I'm not even a II or Jr. (different middle names) and this shit happens all the time. Especially with mail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's ridiculous. It feels like EVERYONE has our SSNs, but they still can't keep their crap straight? A friend of mine couldn't get a mortgage when he tried. Turned out his father's mortgage on their house was on HIS credit report. He had to fix it before they'd give him a mortgage.</p>
<p>Similar to you, same first and last name, different middle names, different ADDRESSES (he was renting his own place by then). The credit bureaus don't really care, it's your job to keep track of that crap. Best place to start: give your kid a different name :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works for a credit bureau, we definitely care. We just legally <em>have</em> to report the information the creditor gives us. Creditor says this is your mortgage? Different name, SSN, address, etc? Doesn't matter. They say it's yours, we've gotta put it on your report. And we can't remove it until either they tell us to (of their own volition or in response to a dispute you launch) or the info expires. </p>
<p>So please, if this happens to you, don't call the bureau and berate some random agent like it's their fault. Just tell them what's wrong and they'll tell you the process to try to get it cleared up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I know a &quot;David Johnson&quot; who is reaching 50 and has experienced many, many cases of mixed identity, including from his own bank (they blended his acounts with another David Johnson), the US Postal Service, his insurance agent, and endless examples from college and private business. Happens all the time apparently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boyfriend has a relative with the same last name and almost, but not quite, the same first name. He lives in a different state from us, but we get mail for him <em>all the time</em>. I still have no idea why, especially since we don't have a home phone so it's not like you can find our address <del>in the phone book</del> on whitepages.com or anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the same boat, I haven't really given my child-creation prospects much serious thought, but I feel like I'd end up naming a son after myself just to keep the chain going. There's at least 5 of us in a row, even though most generations it took a few sons for it to happen. I feel like some sort of special flower growing out of the family tree.</p>
<p>Also, after reading this thread I'm thinking that if I ever have a daughter, I'm going to push for her to get her mom's name with &quot;June&quot; as a middle name. It seems like the ultimate dad-joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother and I have different first and middle names, yet everyone switches our SSN's. I think it's going to screw me over now that I no longer live with her. For the first 18 years of my life, my bank had her SSN as mine and made me prove that it wasn't right. My brother is a Jr. And this rarely happens to him and my father.</p></div>		</li>
