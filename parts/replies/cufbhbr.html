			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so the person looked in the mirror and saw a girl. And the person had of all the parts of a girl. But internally knew she was supposed to be a boy? </p>
<p>I guess what I would to know if she was simply remembered she was a boy before in life, or if the memory reverted to a state where she thought she should be a boy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes- and this made the dementia all the more distressing. I suppose, sadly, it /may/ become more common- there are only a very small handful of people anywhere who are currently elderly and trans, and not all of them will (luckily) dement- as we've now more people who are openly trans, it may be more of an issue in years to come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But which one was it? Was the person remembering that they were a boy a long time ago before changing to a woman? Or did their inner self shift to a mentality of thinking they are now currently a boy?</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>
