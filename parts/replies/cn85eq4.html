			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally! This is the simplest and most likely explanation. An expanding circle of chocolate dispensed from one nozzle meets each of its neighbor-circles at exactly the straight line defined by the Voronoi diagram... </p>
<p>The reason they meet at that point is because these circles travel outward at mostly the same speed making this an equivalent of the definition of Voronoi partitioning. </p>
<p>It is not entirely clear why the point where they meet is a different shade of brown, and there has indeed been some conjecture by others here. My guess would be that the edge of an expanding circle of chocolate is curved due to surface tension and does not set like the inner portion does simply by way of having more surface area to initiate cooling. I.e. I'm suggesting that the different cooling rates is what does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the question of what causes the color differences:</p>
<p>From a chemistry perspective, the chocolate has many chemical components that have different melting/freezing points, including sugars and fats.  I would imagine the lighter colored areas have a different composition compared to the darker colored areas. The lines of a voronoi diagram are also the lines of lowest temperature on the Reese's cup given that the chocolate from the machine is dispensed at a constant temperature, so components of the chocolate with the lowest melting point would tend to gather there.  So it's probably more fatty on those edges.  And we can test this :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in culinary terms, the lighter areas are where the cocoa butter is at a higher concentration on the surface. As chocolate goes through temperature changes, cocoa butter separates from the cocoa, eventually creating the powdery substance you see on old chocolate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with both concrete and tile grout and the same batch can come out a different color if it cures differently. Sometimes we have to cover it with plastic to protect it from rain while drying and if there is a portion that is not covered it will be a different color than the rest. It does eventually even out but can take a month or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chocolate is not an entirely stable mixture, and the lighter color is almost certainly due to a higher concentration of fat coming out of solution. it could possibly be a crystallization thing, as different surface textures reflect light differently. Either way, I am pretty sure it is a cooling thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What your seeing is &quot;eddy&quot; currents in the liquid chocolate that has solidified after the chocolate went through the cooling tunnel. Chocolate is tempered in bar form to give it shine and eliminate gross crystals of coco butter.  These are lines from unequal crystallization in the chocolate.  </p>
<p>Things like peanut butter cups are poured, so if the piece is large enough, and the mixing is inadequate, it may loose it's tempering. Hence the poor appearance. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chocolate is a heterogenous fluid. It contains solids, liquids and crystals. Upon cooling and poor mixing, these materials can separate and cause lines where the materials are dissimilar. You'll see fluid swirling and zones of stratifications. </p>
<p>I suspect what's in the surface there, lower melt point cocoa butter in the middle, that solidified first, with higher melt point material on the &quot;lines&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is usually the case with food nozzles because they are part of a filling machine.  some filling machines have something called fillerbowls or some sort of mechanism that fills up with the product, then a piston or piston action of some sort uses gravity fed product or something similar to positive displacement - think syringe like action, forcing all the product needed for one fill index through all the nozzle openings at the same rate.</p></div>		</li>
