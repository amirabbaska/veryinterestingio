			<div class="markdown"><p>I am surprised death from natural causes is so high.  I'd expect almost all animals to die from predators. Because as they get sick or old they will be less able to effectively evade Predators. I wonder if death from natural causes is a factor of human society keeping Predator populations low. In an area with less humans, I wonder if the results would be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of animals aren't hunted at all, so even if they get too sick/old to run or fight, there's simply no predator to eat them. </p>
<p>Apex predators come to mind, but for example here in the Netherlands, we have <em>no</em> large predators capable of bringing down a deer or boar, so those will by default live on until they die of one of the other causes.</p></div>		</li>
