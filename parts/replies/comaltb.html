			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question, I'm not sure. I would imagine you'd have to account for the time dilation in encoding/decoding the transmission, and the practical work around would be to have response latency kind of like when a news channel is interviewing a correspondent halfway around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it would be a fun job getting the radio waves to synchronize...</p>
<p>Since those protocols are digital, likely not? Maybe? You'd just end up with a lower framerate or dropped frames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doppler shifts would probably be more significant in this case. Assuming inertial frames of reference, the planets are either moving away from each other, or towards each other.</p>
<p>If they are moving away from each other then the communication signal will be redshifted and thus stretched. Each person's receiver will have to wait longer than the size of a video frame to be able to process that video frame (e.g. it may take 1.3 sec to receive every second of video).</p>
<p>If the planets are moving toward each other, the signals will be blueshifted and each person's receiver will receive more than one second of video/audio per second and hence will have to go in an ever diverging lag or else will have to start skipping frames to keep up.</p>
<p>Of course the Doppler shift could vary from say redshift to blueshift  or vice versa if the relative velocities of the two planets are at an angle with the line connecting them.</p>
<p>It would essentially be impossible to communicate using the current implementation of Skype/FaceTime, which is designed for intra-planet use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were on a planet that had half the gravity and was spinning at half speed, would the days/nights technically be twice as long and would the gravity have less effect on the body and preserve aging x2?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity preserving aging? Unlikely to work that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think aging has much to do with gravity. If the spin was half as fast you would get twice as long days and nights but that's about the only thing that would change. The gravity being lower would obviously have practical implications but I don't think any of that would substantially alter the aging process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only really becomes an issue if colonies were setup all over the place. Trying to keep time with other worlds would be annoying. The time difference is quiet small so it wouldn't really be a big deal for most people but trying to set up any kind of exact schedule would be annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the idea, yeah. Everyone seems to be moving at 1 second per second from their own point of view, it's only other people they see moving more slowly.</p></div>		</li>
