			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the appeals process that is expensive. Even if the instant the initial guilty verdict was handed down, without a single moment of delay or any possibility of appeals, the judge pulled out a pistol and shot the defendant on the spot, costs would still be about break-even between that vs. getting a life sentence and paying to lock the guy up for fifty or sixty years.</p>
<p>Capital punishment defendants are in the very rare group where they are <em>actually</em> given good legal representation on the public dime if need be. Capital punishment defendants are provided a  defense team. Multiple lawyers who have significant experience in capital punishment cases, whose case load is modest, and who are allowed to hire investigators to look into the crime. Not one overworked public defender with too much else on his plate to give the case proper attention. Which, in turn, means the prosecution also has to work much harder (at added expense) to secure a guilty verdict.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No this is not the case at all.  You can find cases of capital punishment cases where it is literally the first trial case of their entire career.  This leads to loads of appeals issues where the lawyers openly admit they fucked up left and right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are older cases. The ABA has learned from those mistakes; since 1986 they've had a committee specifically working to improve representation in capital cases, and there are much higher standards today than there were decades ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems unfortunate. Shouldn't someone who is effectively losing their life to incarceration have the same level of defense as someone who is losing their literal life to execution? In both cases the person is wholly deprived of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the event of a mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No he is wrong.  That isn't the case at all.  You can find plenty of cases of capital trials where the defendant's lawyer had no experience with capital trials and didn't know how to properly mount a defense.  </p>
<p>Take Gary Nelson as an example who's lawyer had never tried a capital case ever. His conviction was over turned a decade plus later when new lawyers found overlooked evidence that proved he didn't rape and kill a 6 year old girl. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Juries are expensive if you look at the big picture. In my city, 1,000 people are summoned for jury duty every weekday. (excluding Friday) Roughly half show up, and we get $15 each. That's $30k a week, not including the daily stipend for people who are selected for a jury. (It increases to $30 for every day after the first)</p>
<p>Obviously, juries for death penalty cases account for a fraction of a percentage of this, especially considering no part of the appeals process (to my knowledge) involves a jury. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair it was not <em>just</em> Rick Perry it was the entire team behind the investigation that skewed the results. Even to this day the lead investigators stand by their decision. There is a 60 minutes that covers this story and is actually deeply disturbing.</p></div>		</li>
