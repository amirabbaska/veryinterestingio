			<div class="markdown"><p>A very nice explanation. And it includes the most important caveat:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This goes so far that you can basically define a symmetry and some other stuff and determine all the physics of the system from that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually the mathematical part. The physical part of physics is  finding out which symmetries are important to the system. Of course you can take educated guesses and check where to look (Higgs boson as the most recent example), but without confirmation from the real world the prettiest hypothesis is no more than a <em>search</em> for an extension of theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to add that one can think of Lie Groups as symmetries with shape. For example, the symmetries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vase#/media/File:Vase_LACMA_56.35.178.jpg" target="_blank">this vase (from wiki)</a> have shape (ignore the patterns on the surface). Spinning it in place amounts to a circle shape. In fact, its symmetries form two circles. One circle is for spinning it around. The other is for spinning and doing a reflection.</p></div>		</li>
