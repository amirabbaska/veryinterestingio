			<div class="markdown"><p>But politicians are supposed to represent the people who voted him in.  It's not the politician's fault that society's views on certain things change.  </p>
<p>If the politician is doing his job, he will vote/work towards the ideals of those he represents.  That shouldn't make him a flip flopper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A politician cannot represent ALL of his constituents, how could they hold all those different viewpoints at once? They would be schizophrenic and contradictory.  </p>
<p>That is why ideology exists, politicians say they subscribe to X set of ideas about how the world works. Voters are selecting ideology, not people. The winner of the popularity contest then gets to have their preferred ideology in charge for X years.</p></div>		</li>
