			<div class="markdown"><p>No, and there is a limit to heat as we know it. If matter reached the speed of light it's mass would become infinite (not possible). So before this could happen the object would pass its Schwarzschild radius and become a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact:  any amount of mass, no matter how little, would collapse into a black hole if it was packed densely enough.  If you can crunch the earth down to a sphere with a radius around 9mm, it would be a teeny tiny black hole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not how a Schwarzchild radius works.</p>
<p>&quot;The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes historically referred to as the gravitational radius) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe what you are trying to say is that as you gain more an more energy, to an outside observer you appear to get thinner and thinner. And at some point you would become so thin that you would turn into a black hole.</p>
<p>I cant say for sure, but I have never heard that and it does not sound correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought this was the radius something could compress to become a black hole. Didn't know it included the objects speed as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, but temperature is essentially asking &quot;if I take random molecule from this one, what is the variation of energy I should expect from it&quot; (energy having direction and magnitude)</p>
<p>Even though speed can't grow beyond speed of light, the energy of individual particle can be increased however much you want. That means there is no upper limit for temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of energy required to move the speed of light is infinite, so no, they cannot.</p>
<p>By the way, vibrations are usually categorized in two ways. One, how many times you vibrate back and forth per second, or the time it takes to make one vibration.</p>
<p>So what you meant to ask is can molecules move faster than light, and the answer is no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is defined as the inverse of the change of entropy w.r.t to energy, since entropy always increases, the temperature will always be positive.</p>
<p>So that gets us to why temperatures are always &gt;0. Why are they closer to 0, than higher up? Because the higher the temperature is, the more rapidly it loses energy, and thus lowers in temperature, so high temperatures are harder to maintain.</p>
<p>IDK If that is satisfactory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Systems with negative energy are like a series of mousetraps. The trap has two state: a high energy state where the trap is set and can swing into action and a low energy state where the trap has been released. Imagine we put a 100 mousetraps on the walls of a room with a bunch of ping pong balls bouncing around. If a ball hits a set trap, it can cause it to release, which flings the ball faster. If a ball hits a released trap, it can cause it to reset, but the ball ends up moving slower.</p>
<p>The amount of energy in the mousetraps is determined by the number of mousetraps in the set position. To measure temperature, we also need to know how many states we can have with a given energy. If no traps are set, there is only one state. If one trap is set, there is 100 possible states. If two traps are set, there are
9900 states. This increases until we have 50 traps set, which has 100891344545564193334812497256 (100 octillian or 10^29) possible states. After that the number goes down until we get just one state with 100 traps set.</p>
<p>The number of set mousetraps to be around 50 because there are more ways to go toward 50 than away from it. If you have 1 trap set, dropping down to 0 requires a ball to hit that one trap while going up to 2 can happen if any of the other 99 traps are hit.</p>
<p>How to relate to temperature? Temperature relates how the number of states changes increases as the energy increases. Most systems want to absorb more energy, and temperature tells us which one wants it more. Negative temperatures happen when the number of states decreases as you add energy, like with our mousetraps after we've set 50 of them. These systems want to get rid of their energy, which is why they are hotter than things with positive temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
