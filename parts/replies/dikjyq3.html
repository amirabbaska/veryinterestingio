			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note &quot;contractor&quot; applies to more than just these people (perhaps these private military companies prefer the term contractor for that reason). There are all sorts of contractors in deployed and non-deployed settings. Fixing equipment, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also a lot of solo operators in middle eastern air forces. Guys go over as training contractors for a big company like BAE, but end up in uniform after making the right connections.</p>
<p>Qatar only has 250,000 natives with a 70% obesity rate. You can bet they're not filling all of those F-16 and Apache seats on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a general answer as to where do most of the contractors themselves come from?</p>
<p>Ex military of the sorts as we hear in movies, or are people recruited from the public and trained by the private company? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the directors of companies I interviewed hired ex military forces, preferably special forces. This is a source of relatively cheap but highly trained security officers. It costs approximately half a million euros to train a Dutch marine, Dutch pmcs see no reason to make these expenses themselves when they have the option of simply hiring ex military forces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean there is virtually no path for someone without formalized combat training to get a combat job as a contractor?  Is there any scenario in which someone might seek training for themselves outside of government organizations and become a contractor with combat duties?</p>
<p>EDIT: Nevermind.  You answered this elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
