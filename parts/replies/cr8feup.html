			<div class="markdown"><p>If you add two velocities that move arbitrarily, then the sum from the seekers rest frame is arbitrary as well. What you are describing is the special condition where from the rest frame of the ground, both are moving in exactly the same direction. Since they are moving at the same speed and one cannot overtake the other, then they would of course never find each other. Transforming this special condition to the seekers rest frame, then now they would still never find one another, but now it would be because they were both standing still. Keep in mind though, that the OP stated explicitly that they are moving randomly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's just an artifact that the simulations posted so far don't have both people moving simultaneously. i.e. they can't swap positions without seeing each other.</p></div>		</li>
