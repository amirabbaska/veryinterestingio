			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Paranoid schizophrenia&quot; is a hell of a mental illness.  And potentially a dangerous one for both the patient and the people around the patient.</p>
<p>It's characterized by a deep paranoia and vivid hallucinations.  Meaning what is reality and what is pure paranoia is often impossible for the patient to discern on their own, and said paranoia often prevents them from seeking medical help, or even just help in general.</p>
<p>They will see patterns and connections that no one else can see, all pointing to one thing: that someone very powerful wants to make thier life torturous.  To them, the threat of a city mayor enlisting the aid of the CIA to cause them to be perceived as a wack job to discredit them is as real as the sky is blue to you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this makes it next to impossible for them to function in society, which leads to isolation.  Which leads to further hallucinations and depression.  In this state they can become dillusional to the point where they believe -as strongly as you belive that the sky is blue - that they may need to attack first, or retaliate agienst an attack that never happened.  This often has disastrous results.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are a few treatments / methods of control but it involves the patient being able to trust a doctor, which will be a long, slow and difficult process. </p></div>		</li>

I have tried literally everything to break this delusion or appease and they just flat reject it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because to Targs poor sick mind there will be a plethora of counter arguments and explanations that paints the world as out to get him.</p>
<p>That 1 frame drop from the camera lagging out a bit? Proof that someone edited the footage.</p>
<p>A little bit of grain in the footage? Interference from a mind control satellite.</p>
<p>Targ stumbles a bit in the footage? Proof that it's an actor dressed like him.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that Targ's world doesn't look like ours.  His brain is processing the information it receives incorrectly.  It's seeing patterns and cycles where none exist. </p>
<p>The issue is every brain on the planet takes shortcuts in processing the data it receives (optical illusions are a great way to show  some of these shortcuts, fallacies and biases are other shortcuts).  And every human brain is almost wired to look for patterns.  Targ's problem is that his brain is taking too many shortcuts and working too hard to find patterns.</p>
<p>The reason why it's showing as paranoia is because Targ is literally the only person on the planet seeing the stuff he sees.  And there's no rational explanation for it.  It could even be possible (though rare) that Targ's cat never existed, and therefore there would be no video of anyone killing a cat that never existed. </p>
<p>But to Targ that cat was as real to him as your mother is to you. It's disappearance demands an explanation, an explanation as to why a cat that never existed is now not here.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This means that, presumably, conductive walls would block whatever they're trying to do. Thus the aluminum foil to make the walls conductive and block &quot;CIA interference&quot; or what have you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To this I'll like to add: The delusions of paranoid schizophrenics often manifest with them being a very central and important person. This is called Delusions of Grandeur.</p>
<p>For example: My schizophrenic brother often prefaced his delusions with &quot;I know this sounds very conceited, but...&quot; and then proceed to go off on a rant about how Bill Gates is using his X-box to mind control him because my brother was the star of a Truman show and controlling him would allow Gates to use his show for product placement. He seemed to be aware that there was something absurd about scenarios with him being such an important figure, but couldn't help being convinced of their validity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it’s easy to dismiss people as crazy, but it may be accurate to say that they are “crazy, not stupid.”</p>
<p>I used to work with a psychiatry department, and I learned a lot about mental illnesses in that time. Of the things that stood out: many people experiencing delusions or hallucinations are to some degree aware that what they are experiencing is in their head.</p>
<p>One example was a woman who saw a young boy as a hallucination. She would say “There is a young boy there. Oh, you can’t see him, but he’s there.”</p>
<p>The hallucination was still “real” to the patient, but she knew it was not part of the reality experienced by everyone else.</p></div>		</li>

I could always tell when he wasn't taking the right # of meds, because he would start to act rather pompous and overly-optimistic about his own abilities....particularly for a barely-employed, broke, semi-homeless 30-something year old. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just finding the right meds that works for them is a grueling process. Some meds have unfortunate side effects like making my brother's face swell, which played into his delusions. </p>
<p>Once the proper meds are found, they start to think they don't need them anymore and go off them. Then they relapse and need to be put on them again. It's a vicious cycle that unfortunately doesn't really have an end. Looking back I can laugh at the more comical delusions, but I wouldn't wish this condition on my worst enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend once try to convince me he was god. His proof was... Drawing some figure 8s and Infinity signs. Over the next few weeks he talked about buying a convenience store, some farmland, and starting a cult. Broke as fuck. Everything dead serious. Later I learned that it was because he developed bipolar disorder and also a doctor misdiagnosed him, gave him the wrong meds which made everything worse. He's now on the correct ones and is back to being a chill dude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory is that it is an over abundance of the default paranoia all people are born with. Similar to how OCD is thoroughness to the extreme or manic depressives are happiness/sadness gone to far.</p>
<p>There's this extreme sensation that there's a plot against you, and believing many people are out to get you is the most plausible scenario to match that extreme level of paranoia.</p></div>		</li>
