			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct; sparking the war was the assassination of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia. Then Russia pledged to protect Serbia from retaliation, as allies, then the Germans planned to attack France first, then backpedal to Russia (who were slower to mobilize troops, historically). Germany plans to invade Belgium on the way to France, and Great Britain pledges to protect Belgium and gets sucked in to the conflict. Japan, as an ally of GB, also enters, and then finally: British territories (White Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand + imperial holdings of -&gt; India, Africa, SE Asia) all brought into the war.</p>
<p>If I'm missing something, feel free to add on. This is just what I remember and what I've taken from my World History course notes.</p></div>		</li>
