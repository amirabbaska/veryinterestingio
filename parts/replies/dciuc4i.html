<p>There is evidence that pot may increases the risk of psychosis if you are already vulnerable</p>

<p>As far as I know, the evidence is purely correlative. I believe another explanation that is equally consistent with the data is that people who are prone to psychosis experience subjective discomfort and are seeking out pot to self medicate. I bet you could similarly find evidence that sleeping pills are linked to insomnia, not because the medication causes the syndrome, but because the syndrome causes people to seek out the medication.</p></div>		</li>
