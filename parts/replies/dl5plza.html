Example: identical twins with exactly the same body mass, fat-muscle-bone density (etc.) ratio. Both eat the <em>same number of calories per day.</em> Twin A eats mostly pop tarts and fast food. Twin B eats mostly veggies and natural produce. Although their body compositions remain nearly identical, the risk factors for diseases increase and energy levels decreases for Twin A. A will likely have difficulty with digestion and feel sluggish.
Body composition impacts overall health, but does not determine it.</p></div>		</li>
