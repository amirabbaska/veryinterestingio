			<div class="markdown"><p>If you map break/noclip in GTA V you will be able to see very similar structures to the ones from the video. So this would pretty much be the creation process for most rocky terrain in that game. </p>
<p>The level designed in the video took 3 hours but most areas in RDR2 don't have that much detail. </p>
<p>The real challenge though is to design with limited power in mind. It not only has to look good, but it also needs to run well on a game console. Add too little detail and it looks bland, add too much and the game staggers. </p>
<p>There's also scale to keep in mind. Just because it took 3 hours to design that level doesn't mean that the same creator couldn't design a level 10 times that size, with the same level of detail, in 8. Or 100 times that size in a week. Because at that point you spend longer working on each separate tool, and you save time not needing to set each tool up right. </p></div>		</li>
