			<div class="markdown"><p>They're connected in the most amazingly complex arrangements - and yes, often a single failure after testing will cause the chip to die.</p>
<p>I say &quot;after testing&quot; because there are often redundant systems which can be switched in to compensate for defective areas, or more commonly, areas are switched off and the device sold as a lower grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I actually work on designing integrated circuits! Like literally, we are given a desired functionality and design the gates and then the transistor level &quot;maps.&quot;</p>
<p>Just wanted to point out that YES you are right that there are redundant systems, but NO, a single failure does not cause the chip to die. I work on highly critical systems for auto-motives and even for us, we have a 90% fault coverage goal, which means (in a very broad and not completely correct way) that up to 10% of the chip could have faults and the system can still pass the test.  90% fault coverage targets are actually pretty high and difficult to achieve, so it is still a very highly researched area that I have a Masters on and are about to complete a PhD on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes a single broken transistor kills the whole processor. However manufacturers have some tricks.
The PlayStation 3 has an IBM CPU with 8 cores, but only 7 are used. This allowed Sony to use CPUs where one core was broken, which reduced trash and made production cheaper. Some mid- and low-range CPUs for PCs are just the higher-end model with 1 or 2 broken/disabled cores, for the same reasons.</p>
<p>GPUs are even more flexible. They have hundrets of cores. I'm sure they are manufactured with more cores than actually used as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chip won't necessarily stop functioning with the break of a single transistor.</p>
<p>The cache (memory part of a processor) is usually built with ECC (Error Correcting Code, it detects and tries to correct errors) so a failing transistor in the cache might not break anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>it's all produced on a single crystal of silicon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the most pivotal developments in modern technology. When they realized that all the circuit components, transistors, resistors, capacitors, even the wires connecting them could all be made out of the same solid piece of silicon. </p>
<p>Super complex circuits could only be dreamed up before because connecting all the pieces together was almost physically impossible. But making them all out of the same thing, allowed them to use photo techniques to make the circuits insanely small. The advances in technology we were able to achieve because of this simple idea are mind blowing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be pedantic, they're not all made out of the same piece of silicon. The GP's analogy of letters printed on paper is a good one.</p>
<p>The manufacturing starts with a silicon crystal wafer, but copper and other materials are effectively &quot;printed on&quot; to it during the manufacturing process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you also need the ability for very fine photolithography as well as a way to fire atoms of very high purity into various substrates. Which also requires the ability to make various substrate layers by deposition (CVD, PVD, ALD, etc)  only nm thick. It's all a bit bananas really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're at the point in history that I think if enough smart people were lost in wars or natural catastrophes, we'd be long ways back in technology -- you can no longer just pick up the pieces and do science, there's so much interlinked technology to make anything work. What happens if a solar flare fries all the data and knowledge we've collected?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there any super powerful processors that are that way because they are unique in their design/structure/shape? They just can't be reproduced because the process is too expensive and non-modular?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is said that the transistor was the greatest invention of the 20th century. Before the transistor the use of vacuum tubes was the norm. Vacuum tubes were big, prone to burning out, created large amounts of excess heat and had a  short life span. The transistor allowed for smaller and more robust circuitry. If you're really interested look into the history of Bell Labs, Fairchild Semiconductors, and Texas Instruments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short story, yes. The invention of the transistor is really what made the modern world possible. You could still technically make computers and such without transistors, but the size and price would simply make mainstream adoption impossible.</p></div>		</li>
