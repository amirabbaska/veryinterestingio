			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprised &quot;network effect&quot; is this far down.</p>
<p>Facebook's a good example, and their approach is well chronicled in <em>The Social Network</em> if lurkers don't want to read the books or wiki articles.  Mark initially treated it as an exclusive site for specific Harvard clubs and users.  It then expanded to allow all Harvard students.  Then they gradually allowed other schools into it, and eventually non-students and such.</p>
<p>Their expansion strategies were somewhat more complex and onerous than the actual technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, depending on the team, the tech build could be the easiest hurdle to overcome.</p>
<p>My philosophy is that any successful business relies upon an equal focus and quality of execution in three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>product/service</li>
<li>sales/marketing</li>
<li>operations</li>
</ul>
<p>If any one pillar is lacking only failure awaits...on day one of launch or after a larger round of fundraising (or many rounds).</p>
<p>Of course, depending on the specific company a single pillar will take priority over others at different times. But, overall...it should balance out over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They can create many fake accounts to give the illusion of a big network which leads to actual users joining</p>

<p>Interestingly, this is how reddit started.</p></div>		</li>
