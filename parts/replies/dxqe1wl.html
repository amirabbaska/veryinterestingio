			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also important to note what sunburn really is, because it has nothing to do with your skin getting too hot. Rather, the ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight is absorbed by the DNA molecules of your skin cells, and can cause them to undergo chemical modifications. (This is also why sunburn can lead to cancer.) The cell can detect and repair a limited amount of these, but if too much of the cell's DNA is damaged, it can no longer function and will die in a controlled manner (apoptosis) -- that's what hurts.</p>
<p>The absorbing ingredients in sunscreen, as noted above, absorb the UV radiation in place of the DNA. That still heats up your skin just as much (or possibly even more), but your DNA is safe and your cells are happy.</p></div>		</li>
