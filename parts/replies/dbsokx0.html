			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. There is far more to life than simply breathing. However, it was the idea that people had to take efforts to keep the orca alive for 8 hours while it was stuck on land until the tide came back in that spurred the question. My initial thought was along the line that 8 hours on land shouldn't be enough to cause extensive harm and result in death for an animal that can breathe air. You certainly will not starve to death in 8 hours, and a human can last more than 8 hours without a drink, even in the desert. I was unaware how quickly these animals can dehydrate and how damaging the sun is, in addition to how the weight of their bodies can cause great difficulty in breathing and otherwise harm internal organs. </p></div>		</li>
