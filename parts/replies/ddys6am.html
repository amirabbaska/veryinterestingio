			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for him personally, but a intro level meteorology class would definitely teach this. Also, wikipedia is always a neat way to learn about something, thanks to links and what not. Even googling something along the lines of the headline OP used would probably bring up something on wiki, or at least a word to associate his question with.</p>
<p>To be fair, though, it can be more fun to hear others' ways of explaining it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called a rain shadow. It is a common occurrence with many mountain ranges. The windward side of the range has increased precipitation due to air parcels being forced up and cooling, reaching their dew point and precipitating. This leaves dry air parcels to pass over the mountain range.</p></div>		</li>
