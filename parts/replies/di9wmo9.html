<p>There's the style of milling and storage that play factors as well. Modern industrial grain mills are roller style mills that crush the kernel and hold back the germ. This style of mill has only been around in the last 100 years. Previously they were all stone mills that grind the flower down between two massive grooved discs. In this case the germ is ground down with the rest of the kernel. The germ is the 'whole wheat' bit that contains most of the enzymic content, lipids and a fair share of protein.</p>
<p>At a certain scale storage becomes a very complicated process. Managing a rotating stock of hundreds of thousands of pounds of flour is not easy, so there's some inevitable degredation involved at those scales.</p>
<p>Finally the type of bread produced plays an enormous role. Handmade bread (especially sourdough) ferments the flour via commercial yeasts in combination with airborne yeasts and yeasts provided by the baker via skin contact. These all work together to break down the glian  (gluen?) and gliadin in combination with water to form gluten bonds. It takes mechanical pressure <em>or</em> time for these bonds to be established and even more mechanical pressure <em>or</em> time for them to align and create strands of dough. </p>
<p>My own loaves of bread are sourdough from whole grain, unbleached wheat and ferment for roughly 2 days with very little mechanical interaction. A loaf of yeasted factory bread from bleached enriched roller milled flour &quot;ferments&quot; for an hour at best. </p>
<p>Eating one bread will nourish you and take little effort to digest, while the other leaves you with a ball of dough in your belly that bloats you for hours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anecdotally speaking, I have a couple different friends who react very badly to american wheat products - but who don't seem to have any problems with wheat now that they live in Italy. I've often wondered if it has to do with the kind of wheat we have in the US, or how we treat and process it, as opposed to in other countries. </p></div>		</li>

She buys imported German products and makes her own bread with European flour and is totally fine though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is me! A good European flour doesn't give the ridiculous symptoms I get when eating wheat products here in the states. The catch is soy sauce, can't eat that shit anywhere :/ Dave's Killer Bread however I seem to be able to eat. It still is bread, which in itself can cause its own issues, but the ridiculous amount of back (and kidney?) pain I get is not there... so that's nice :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's been my guess with non-wheat products. I have acid reflux and have issues with a lot of foods in the US, but when I travel outside the US I have no problems at all, even with foods I know trigger the symptoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're right in this. I remember seeing a documentary about older times when trains where shipping meat products as fast as possible to try and keep most of the meat good by the time it arrived at it's destination, but some of it would still rot. Now a days we have better refrigeration and preservatives for food so it can transfered long distances without corruption. </p>
<p>I think a lot of the issues with American food comes from the big selling moguls who have to ship food further in the US to get to sellers. I work IT though, so I'm not really sure about food stuff. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's more about what's in the food - not being exposed to natural particles in food means that we're unfamiliar with them, and may develop allergies to them. </p></div>		</li>
