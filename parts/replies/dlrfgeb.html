			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about the new glitch, which relies on the special Stat of the Pok√©mon you last encountered, when combined with the trainer fly glitch, which occurred when you broke the sequence of a trainer battle and then returned to the area where the trainer occurred. This restarted the battle sequence, but with no data for what should spawn the game used the special Stat of the last pokemon you encountered to generate one. </p>
<p>This lead to the ditto glitch, and then the ability to spawn any pokemon you want any number of times you want. Say hello to my 3 mewtwo... Lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm the serious glitch hunters are all well versed in assembly and use their knowledge of the game's data structure and built in subroutines to create exploits. For example: Putting a certain Pokemon in the 221st? slot of your party to make sure a C9 (ret) instruction ends up at a specific byte to make a glitch map not immediately crash the game.</p>
<p>Check out ChickasaurusGL and TheZZAZZGlitch on YouTube, they are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the Pokemon games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way IIRC is to go to a specific trainer on the east? side of Safron? city, and right when the trainer spots you, you would hit start really quickly, and use fly to leave. Then when you go into the nearest grassy area that would trigger that Pokemon to be a level 7 Mew.</p>
<p>Don't take my word for it, it's been at least a decade minimum since I tried it. Too lazy to google.</p></div>		</li>
