			<div class="markdown"><p>They are actually sort of opposite. The deionisation process emits a lot of blue light. Power delivered by the electrical arc excites electrons and they emit light when they relax. Meanwhile, liquid oxygen is dense enough to allow a double molecular excitation that is just right to absorb low energy red light. It looks blue because red is missing from any white light that pases through the liquid oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining, very interesting! Could you explain me the concept of double molecular excitation? I've tried reading in on it but I can't get a clear idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but why ionized oxygen glows blue and for example neon glows red? Completely opposite sides of visible light spectrum, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the amount of energy in the electron orbitals.</p>
<p>So plasmas, such as lightning or the sun, happen when a material gets so hot the outer electrons all fly off. Bonds fall apart, and everything is going so fast nothing can stick together. Plasmas are ionised, which means all the atoms have an electric charge. Positive, in this case, while the free electrons are negative. Were the material to cool down, the electrons would reattach to the atoms and the charge would be pretty close to 0.</p>
<p>Now, every cloud has atoms cool enough to stick to others and form liquid water, and whether or not this liquid reaches the ground, there's a bit of liquid in there. Similarly, plasma constantly has atoms briefly cooling into a gas, and then flying back apart when hit by something going faster. Lightning especially, only briefly has enough energy to ionise.</p>
<p>So when the electrons fall back into their orbits around the atoms and become more stable, where does the energy go? Light. Radiation that can be seen by our eyes and even heats the surroundings. The frequency (colour) of the radiation is determined by just how much energy the electron lost when it cooled down. The bigger the jump from unstable to stable, the more energy, the higher frequency, the bluer colour. And most of the jumps in neon are red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So - kinda similar to fluorescence but the difference is that in fluorescence electrons just go to the higher energy orbital and in ionization the electrons fully 'detach' from the atom. Am I understanding this right? </p></div>		</li>
