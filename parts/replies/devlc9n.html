			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing somewhere that the attack of a note is actually much more important than you'd think when it comes to identifying the instrument, and that some easily distinguished instruments (I think it was piano and violin?) actually have surprisingly similar similar harmonic content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the beginning of the sound is called a formant, and is the most important part of determining a sound. If you were to a record a bunch of instruments playing the exact same pitch, then use audio editing software to remove the attacks you would not be able to determine which instrument was which. I best heard this demonstrated in a power metal screams montage video that bounced rapidly between a few different screamers. When it picked up in the middle of their screams it almost sounded like a synth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most famous example of this in the orchestration world is the trumpet and the oboe. Their harmonic profiles are almost identical, but their attacks are completely different, and the trumpet also typically has more noise and variance. In synth terms, you can think of a trumpet as an oboe with an LFO, a hard attack (maybe some percussion noise in the initial attack?) and an LFO. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? No. That is not a formant. Formants are the resonances in a vocal tract that shape vowels. Formants are what distinguishes ahh from eee. You're thinking of a transient, meaning &quot;lasting for only a very short time&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which would explain why piano/organ/harpsichord is so much easier to synthesize believably, as there's really only one variable, if that, to the attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Attack is even bigger than that! Attack is one of the biggest factors in telling, for example, two guitarists apart. You can give two guitarists the same guitar and the same music and anyone who plays will be able to tell the two apart by the differences in their attack, as well as vibrato and tremolo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I agree with that classification though. Wouldn't this make my electric guitar a pick instrument? In the end what provides the sound on both is a vibrating string, so it should be string instrument, no?</p></div>		</li>

<p>First increase the volume from 'off'.</p>
<p>Then click the different wave shapes or play with the sliders. They all have the same fundamental frequency, but they sound different.</p></div>		</li>
