			<div class="markdown"><p>A prime example of the above concept is Digital Signal Processing (DSP). An electronic algorithm is used to eliminate noise and other interfering sound, like tones, from an audio signal. Although it is quite advanced in today's technology, it still cannot perform as well as a human brain.</p>
<p>I've been an amateur radio operator for 32 years now. Over those decades, my favorite communications mode is continuous wave (CW) or Morse Code modulation. When I was in Iraq and operated with a callsign issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority, I would send out a call for responses and literally get dozens to hundreds of simultaneous replies on the frequency. The only way to 'work the pileup' would be to key in on a certain signal at a certain audio pitch and concentrate. I became quite skilled at picking out individual stations after a year of practice.</p></div>		</li>
