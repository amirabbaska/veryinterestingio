			<div class="markdown"><p>We are canadian geese. We ain’t predators but get close to us and we’ll raise enough hell that you’ll think twice about messing with us. We resolve threats without hurting anyone unnecessarily. If you’re hurt or orphaned, we’ll take you under our wing. Treat you like one of our own. If you try to encroach on our ground... that’s cool, enjoy your beachside cookout,,, just have fun dodging our shit!</p></div>		</li>
