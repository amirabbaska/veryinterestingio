			<div class="markdown"><p>not my area of expertise but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum" target="_blank">the sternum</a> appears to be a bone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum#Other_animals" target="_blank">in mammals</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It probably first evolved in early tetrapods as an extension of the pectoral girdle; it is not found in fish. In amphibians and reptiles it is typically a shield-shaped structure, often composed entirely of cartilage. It is absent in both turtles and snakes. In birds it is a relatively large bone and typically bears an enormous projecting keel to which the flight muscles are attached.[11] Only in mammals does the sternum take on the elongated, segmented form seen in humans.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember where humans came from - monkeys and some of the great apes even to this day are arboreal species. This requires some serious arm and chest muscle which need bones to attach to. There are theories, that, like our teeth, the sternum may shrink in the far far future if we develop technology that allows us to put less and less strain on the muscles and bones. One example of a bone that shrunk and disappeared is the sagittal crest - the ridge of bone on the top of the skull. This bone is what our ancestor's massive jaw muscles attached to. As we developed tools and cooking methods to break open and soften our food, the muscles shrank, and thus so did the bone. After all, why waste energy developing tissue that isn't going to be used? </p></div>		</li>

Only mammals have a diaphragm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mammal sternums start out from cartilage then ossify in development.  There are reptilians with ossified sternums, like birds. Pterosaurs are another reptile with a bony sternum, need a place to attach pectoral muscles. (mmm, grilled pterosaur breast....)            </p>
<p>A good reason? It was advantageous for the mammalian ancestor to have a bony sternum, this successful trait was passed on. A bony sternum has evolved multiple times in reptiles to suit different needs. Sorry I don't have a better answer at the moment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the fossils exhibited are casts of the fossils. Sometimes they are just making something that seems reasonable and fits. So why not put in something to show the cartilage structure? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>*That depends on the age of the exhibit -- check for the amount of support used to hold the the exhibit together, as the casts are a lot lighter than the fossils themselves.  As for the latter -- that probably depends on the funds of the museum, but may also be whether they want to face the wrath of those who would use anything to try and make paleontologists out to be frauds. :( Modern exhibits do try to display skeletons as anatomically correct as possible! </p></div>		</li>
