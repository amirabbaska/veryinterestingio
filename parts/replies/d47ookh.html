			<p>Do you know if there's a good reason that mammalian sternums ossified while reptilian ones didn't?</p>		</li>

			<p>not my area of expertise but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum" target="_blank">the sternum</a> appears to be a bone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternum#Other_animals" target="_blank">in mammals</a><br><br>&gt;It probably first evolved in early tetrapods as an extension of the pectoral girdle; it is not found in fish. In amphibians and reptiles it is typically a shield-shaped structure, often composed entirely of cartilage. It is absent in both turtles and snakes. In birds it is a relatively large bone and typically bears an enormous projecting keel to which the flight muscles are attached.[11] Only in mammals does the sternum take on the elongated, segmented form seen in humans.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Remember where humans came from - monkeys and some of the great apes even to this day are arboreal species. This requires some serious arm and chest muscle which need bones to attach to. There are theories, that, like our teeth, the sternum may shrink in the far far future if we develop technology that allows us to put less and less strain on the muscles and bones. One example of a bone that shrunk and disappeared is the sagittal crest - the ridge of bone on the top of the skull. This bone is what our ancestor's massive jaw muscles attached to. As we developed tools and cooking methods to break open and soften our food, the muscles shrank, and thus so did the bone. After all, why waste energy developing tissue that isn't going to be used? </p>		</li>

			<p>Selection pressure is only one of the drivers of evolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift" target="_blank">Genetic drift</a> also plays a part. If there is no clear reproductive benefit of one over the other, we should still expect to see changes over time, especially in smaller populations.<br><br>Genetic drift can be approximated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk" target="_blank">random walk</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>On top of this you also have to remember that there is no direction and you are left with what you have to deal with. Any given trait might not have any advantage it might be a product of an advantageous thing. It might be better to have 4 functioning arms, but we can't just rewrite the book completely, there is a maximum step size and each one of those must have advantage themselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>In this case, the argument can be made that the outside influence that &quot;favors&quot; smaller muscles and weaker bones would be that a weaker person doesn't need to consume as many calories as a stronger person in order to survive; in an environment where tremendous strength isn't necessary for survival and food is scarce, needing less of it is a tremendous advantage.<br><br>Although exercise and fitness are very important in our culture right now, it's hard to predict whether that trend will extend into the far future. &quot;Ideal&quot; physical attraction changes a lot over time, location, and social class, and so being very muscular may not necessarily be attractive 500 years from now.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're right. If there is no outside influence favoring one trait over another in terms of breeding ability or fecundity, that trait will not have a reason to become more prevalent in the population (outside of large scale catastrophe or pure chance). It's very hard to make any kind of predictions on the evolution of humans due to the fact that technology, medicine, science, and just about every facet of our society is developing at an unprecedented rate.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, could the loss of the crest be due to lower breeding rates like the current subject of being fit? I could see mayes finding it more attractive without it, but that could also be my bias speaking. </p>		</li>

			<p>The &quot;fit people being more attractive mates&quot; is a good point, for sure. I was more referring to the other comment about less muscle strain leading to a shrunken sternum in the far future. If anything I think the sternum could become vestigial like the appendix. That hasn't served any function that we know of for thousands of years and yet we still have it because it has no impact on our ability to mate.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't believe it is accurate to say the saggital crest &quot;shrank&quot; over the course of human evolution. Rather, our brain case expanded dramatically, which pushed the crest outward until our jaw muscles attached at our temples rather than atop our skulls. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly. Mammals have a higher metabolism (warm blooded, very active muscles, bigger brains, etc.) and have multiple adaptations to allow this. Infants with more cartilage in their sternum and ribs and this flexible chest requires more energy to breath. Four chamber hearts is another adaptation. Birds have several of the same adaptations developed in parallel for the same demands. Birds do mammals one better with not only ossified sternums but also lungs that allow air to pass through mostly in one direction instead of in and out.</p>		</li>

			<p>Mammal sternums start out from cartilage then ossify in development.  There are reptilians with ossified sternums, like birds. Pterosaurs are another reptile with a bony sternum, need a place to attach pectoral muscles. (mmm, grilled pterosaur breast....)            <br>             <br>A good reason? It was advantageous for the mammalian ancestor to have a bony sternum, this successful trait was passed on. A bony sternum has evolved multiple times in reptiles to suit different needs. Sorry I don't have a better answer at the moment. </p>		</li>

			<p>birds are in fact dinosaurs' descendants aren't they. Take archaeopteryx for example. Depends how far along the lineage you're going.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/J3Paleos" target="_blank">J3Paleos</a>
			<p>Yes and no. In evolutionary terms (and according to modern biological nomenclature), all birds are maniraptorans, which are included in the Coelurosaurian branch of Theropod dinosaurs, which are in turn Saurischian dinosaurs (mainly Theropods and Sauropods), which are finally paired with Ornithischian dinosaurs to make up the main dinosaur group. When people speak of birds and dinosaurs as being separate, they are speaking more from the flawed Linnaean, rather than the cladistic taxonomy that scientists emphasize today. One would also be speaking paraphyletically when not including avians within the dinosaurs. When speaking to paleontologists, we sometimes emphasize &quot;non-avian dinosaurs&quot; for exactly this reason.  In everyday conversation, however, most people don't speak of them as the same group -- and paleontologists have been working to make this common knowledge for quite a few years now.<br><br>To be honest, there is a lot of work to be done on clearing up the classification of organisms from a long period of an overly complex and outdated taxonomic method (as we continually try to separate organisms into smaller and smaller groups), but that work will one day lead to a better understanding of the history and evolution of life.  <br><br>Source: I have a MS in Vertebrate Paleontology (Geological Sciences) and am working on a PhD with research related to Vertebrate Paleontology and Conservation Biology (or as it has been coined, Conservation Paleobiology).</p>		</li>

			<p>sorry if I didn't catch that very well (must be me bein' slow), but am I right to say that there's birds which are Theropods and thus like dinosaurs, but Ornithischians are also dinosaurs and there aren't birds under them? In that case, with the current rules of taxonomy, what's the best way to classify the avian-reptilian/dinosaur relations?</p>		</li>

			<p>But the fossils exhibited are casts of the fossils. Sometimes they are just making something that seems reasonable and fits. So why not put in something to show the cartilage structure? </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/J3Paleos" target="_blank">J3Paleos</a>
			<p>*That depends on the age of the exhibit -- check for the amount of support used to hold the the exhibit together, as the casts are a lot lighter than the fossils themselves.  As for the latter -- that probably depends on the funds of the museum, but may also be whether they want to face the wrath of those who would use anything to try and make paleontologists out to be frauds. :( Modern exhibits do try to display skeletons as anatomically correct as possible! </p>		</li>
