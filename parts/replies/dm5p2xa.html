			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason gravity is important is because of the way 3DMG is used. In the show, they use the gear to essentially launch themselves toward the Titan, sometimes in a straight line. Because Science calculated that it would take ~45Gs of force to be able to make it 30m without dropping 1m due to gravity over half a second.</p>
<p>If you change gravity, by placing the show on Titan, and not Earth, you can go further forward with the same amount of force.</p>
<p>Accelerating at 2 Earth Gs would be the same as accelerating with 14 Titan Gs, and it would take less force to do it, because the body weighs less.</p>
<p>Practically everything that makes the gear unfeasible on Earth is fixed by setting the show on Titan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are confusing the question of flight <em>distance</em> (which someone used for a particular estimate) with the core issue of acceleration. </p>
<p>In the series, people are shown undergoing significant accelerations -- including in the purely horizontal plane -- that are enough to cause injury or death even in microgravity. The amount of a sideways jerk needed to snap the regular human spine doesn't really depend on what planet you're on.    </p>
<p>Plus, we can tell that gravity in the show <strong>isn't</strong> too different from Earth, because otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans and horses wouldn't be <em>able</em> to walk or gallop normally. They'd need a different gait to bounce around.</li>
<li>Nobody would bother putting up anti-human walls that all humans could easily jump over.</li>
<li>Buildings would be designed differently, to minimize material required. (All them, not just mysterious ancient mega-walls.)</li>
<li>Animals and plants would develop differently. (Not just giant stands of rural redwoods.)     </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a misunderstanding about g's here, g is a measurement of acceleration, not force. The thing that makes this impossible isn't how much force it requires, it's the magnitude of acceleration. 45g means that someone is accelerating at 441.45 m/s^2 . It doesn't matter how much force is imparted to get that, it's still 45g. So the only way to reduce how badly these devices hurt their users is to increase the amount of time they accelerate over, with a net decrease in acceleration, but no change in final velocity, nor trajectory.</p>
<p>Changing the gravity just means that the same device that could pull someone on earth in this method can pull them in 1/7th the time. It actually makes it <em>easier</em> to sustain high g's when gravity is low. Of course, if you then scale your contraption to have 1/7th the strength, the user is still sustaining 45 earth g's. The only way to reduce how many earth g's someone sustains is to either increase their mass, or reduce the force. Either way, this is ultimately just increasing the amount of time someone is subjected to a force to get a net velocity.</p>
<p>Also, the only difference between an earth g and a titan g is the frame of reference. It has absolutely nothing to do with actual gravity other than the number it's referencing. It's like talking about something being 3 celsius and 37.4 fahrenheit, it's the same temperature, just in different terms. When you say something is 14 titan g's, it's exactly the same as 2 earth g's. They are still only accelerating at 19.62 m/s^2 . If you convert all the &quot;g's&quot; to accelerations, this becomes more clear. A human has a hard time withstanding 10g for more than a minute, this is 98.1 m/s^2 , this is also like withstanding ~70 titan g, but it's still just 98.1 m/s^2 , and we have established that 98.1 m/s^2 is still hard to withstand for more than a minute. I would suggest reading up on high g training and videos explaining why humans can't survive high g. It may help explain this all better than I can.</p>
<p>Basically, putting the show on Titan does nothing. Besides, if the show was on titan, bone density would be lower, muscle density would be lower, everything would be different unless the humans magically just weren't even humans anymore. In which case, it's still just shifting the magic elsewhere. There isn't a way the show can work and retain the same laws of physics, I don't think it's worth the effort to say it can, just let it be fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted above as well, but the changes in momentum wouldn't necessarily result in broken bones.

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the guy he refers to is called Dr.John Stapp. He actually decelerated at 46.5g once. Though he typically broke some ribs.</p>
<p>[BECAUSE SCIENCE] (<a href="https://youtu.be/3UEYxf4fl_A" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/3UEYxf4fl_A</a>)</p>
<p>Oh and Dr. Stapp nearly killed himself conducting some of those experiments even though he was in peak condition and underwent that deceleration once per test not several times in battle.</p>
<p>Oh btw his buddy Eli Beeding underwent 82.6g.</p></div>		</li>
