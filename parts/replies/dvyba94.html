<p>the key part of a pillow is not that it is fluffy, but that it allows your neck to rest in a natural position</p>

I remember being shocked at the thought, but in practice it's totally correct. So long as my head has support I can fall asleep pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds similar to how ancient Egyptians slept on beds with a crescent-shaped headrest. I assume they probably padded the headrest with linen or something, given that most of them shaved their heads and that leaves precious little cushion between your skull and hard wood edges, but would be similar to the Japanese takamakura.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit of a random reply, but I believe the Japanese takamakura, the Geishas had the most sensible use for them - since it kept their heads off the ground and didn't really mess up their hair, which they would have to redo every day otherwise.</p></div>		</li>
