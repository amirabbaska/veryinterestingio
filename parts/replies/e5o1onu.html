			<div class="markdown"><p>Its really the size of the hole more than anything. The pressure could be many times greater, but if the hole isnt big enough, it'll move slowly.</p>
<p>Think of it like a soda can. Shake it up a whole lot to increase pressure inside. If you open it completely, it'll explode. But if you open it a little, the gas will leak out slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pressure goes up by 14.5 psi for every ~33 feet (1atm/10m) so if the sub was pressurized to sea level you'd only have to be about 10m below the surface to equal the pressure differential between space and sea level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd depend on what part of the ship you're in.  Water pressure builds up really quickly, so it's possible that the deck of the sub could be on the surface while the bottom of the sub is at +30 PSI.  </p></div>		</li>
