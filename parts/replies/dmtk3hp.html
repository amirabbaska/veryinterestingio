			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, you'll definitely burn. 5 minute exposure to 120° Fahrenheit water can result in <a href="http://www.accuratebuilding.com/services/legal/charts/hot_water_burn_scalding_graph.html" target="_blank">third degree burns</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150 degree water for two seconds. Burns will also occur with a six-second exposure to 140 degree water or with a thirty second exposure to 130 degree water. Even if the temperature is 120 degrees, a five minute exposure could result in third-degree burns.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in perspective, 120 F is required to kill all life stages instantly of bedbug (and some similar species). I used to treat BB infestations using heat and would regularly direct heat into a house or apartment raising the ambient temperature inside to between 120-145 F. In terms of air temp, once you were acclimated, a healthy operator could generally stand to be inside the structure for between 10-20 mins before needing to go outside and cool down, depending on how active they were being and whether or not they stood/moved directly in the path of the heat tunnel blowing around the perimeter of the rooms. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I commented here about sous vide steak temps (125 to 128F for &quot;very rare&quot;), but it's probably good to point out that fish &quot;cooked&quot; at those temperatures is <em>barely cooked</em>, which is why sous vide cooked fish is something special (its hard to cook fish by other high heat methods and get it consistently to that low temperature range through the whole piece, where a sous vide water bath can do it perfectly every time.)  But it's still only &quot;semi-cooked&quot; by most people's sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While some of this is accurate, some of it isn't. Hypercanes are only theoretical, and are theorized to have been in response to incredible global warming or disasters such as volcanism and asteroid impact.</p>
<p>The hottest average temperature anyone has suggested for ancient oceans is from the cretaceous at a whopping 108 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average was about 99 degrees. Hypercanes would have needed at least 120 degree fahrenheit ocean temperatures to form.</p>
<p>While this very warm ocean would probably have created more intense hurricanes, it's not likely that they would be hypercanes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hottest average being 108 heavily implies the oceans got hot enough to make hypercanes, though, doesn't it? Our current average ocean temperatures aren't hot enough to support our current hurricanes, after all - and so they don't form over the &quot;average&quot; areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Also, if average temperature was 99 F (circa 37.2 °C or, why not, 310.37 K), wouldn't it be still warm enough to create enormous cyclones? </p>
<p>I suppose that also the vertical temperature gradient in the water would play a role</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons I'm sure, but the two largest ones I'm aware of are greenhouse gasses and a less active ocean current. The entire Earth was warmer on average due to increased carbon dioxide levels, giving surface  temperatures more oomph.</p>
<p>In addition (and kind of as a consequence), the temps at higher latitudes were closer to those at the equator. This resulted in weaker winds and jet streams, which help drive ocean currents. So cool water from near the poles and warm water from the equator would've had a harder time mingling.</p></div>		</li>
