<p>The &quot;number of states&quot; is an integral over phase space.</p>

<p>But... an integral counting what? I mean, in the end W is just a number isn't it? It has no units, I thought. If I imagine a particle on a line segment [0,1], and call that the macrostate, then how do I count how many microstates there are? Looks to me like there's an infinity of them. Particle at position 0.5, at position 0.05, 0.005, 0.0005, etc.</p>
<p>But I just found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcanonical_ensemble" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>h is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of energy×time, setting the extent of one microstate and providing correct dimensions to ρ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems related to my question, if I understand it correctly. You just pick a 'resolution' and stick to it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second question is how does Pauli exclusion work for identical particles in &quot;similar&quot; states?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah... and I understand the anti-symmetry of the wavefunction thing. Actually, no I don't. I've seen the equations and derived it myself before but I don't understand what it actually implies for the shape of the wavefunctions.<br />
I don't know how this applies to, for example...</p>
<p>If you have a potential well, each added electron takes up a new level, a new state with higher momentum (let's just ignore spin). So a small &quot;box&quot; of electrons can hold a certain number of electrons below a certain momentum. Let's just say we stop adding electrons once they are forced to occupy states with momentum M.</p>
<p>Then if we get a bigger box, surely we can put more electrons in it, right? I mean there are twice as many electrons in a chunk of metal that's twice as big.</p>
<p>So... uhhh... what's up with that?</p>
<p>What happens if you slowly squeeze the box? They have less room, so they must start occupying higher momentum states right? Eventually you can't squeeze it anymore because of electron degeneracy pressure - because the momentum states they're beginning to occupy are so fast they have high temperature which means high pressure. Right?</p>
<p>But that implies that each state takes up a certain amount of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an integral counting the phase space volume of the system. That's how you quantify the &quot;number of states&quot; for a system with a continuous spectrum.</p>
<p>In classical mechanics, h is an arbitrary constant so that (d^(3)q d^(3)p)/h^(3) is dimensionless. In quantum mechanics, Planck's constant is the natural constant to use.</p>
<p>You can't actually &quot;count&quot; the uncountable infinite number of states, but you can loosely think of this phase space integral as being &quot;proportional to&quot; the absolute number of states. If you double the phase space volume, you &quot;double&quot; te number of states the system can exist in.</p>
<p>As for the question about electrons in a box, if you imagine an infinite or finite rectangular well, the degeneracies of the wells don't depend on their physical size. You can fit the same amount of particles into each energy level regardless of how big the box is. If it's a finite well, the number of bound states will depend on the well depth, but it's not true that having a spatially larger box will allow you to put more electrons in each energy level.</p>
<p>What happens when you squeeze the box depends on how quickly you squeeze it. In the adiabatic limit, the particles will stay in the lowest-energy configuration, even though the basis states are changing. If you compress the box, the energy of each orbital will increase, and that's where your degeneracy pressure comes from.</p>
<p>Each orbital <em>does</em> take up a certain amount of space, but it doesn't have a well-defined size; it's a wavefunction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gotcha.<br />
So is there a sense in which you don't need to know the exact number W? You only need to know how it changes when you change the system? Is this why the more directly useful definition of entropy is a definition of the change in entropy?<br />
(I'm thinking of <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b9e94797c5d1bbc306b4db93ff507214cf9f24ea" target="_blank">this equation</a>: ΔS = integral dQ/T)</p>
<p>Was this the view they always held? I mean, when Boltzmann first came up with his equation... did they think in terms of phase spaces and things already?</p>

<p>Huh! Okay...</p>

<p>Ah! Of course! Because the harmonic wavelengths obviously get smaller too. I see now. Thanks very much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I just realised. If you have a finite well, let's say the walls are 'height' M, and the base is L wide. Fill it up the brim with particles so the one at the top has energy M, and then start to squeeze it until it's only L/2 wide.</p>
<p>The particles inside gain energy, right? Because their wavelengths must shorten. The ground state now has twice the energy. So that means some will spill out! So a spacially larger box can fit more electrons in.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anti symmetric aspect of the wavefunction is understood to mean that if  spacial and spin components of the wavefunction are inverted the transformation has odd symmetry (i.e. f (-x)= -f (x) in one dimension) . Recall that the wavefunction can have positive or negative amplitude depending on spacial coordinates.  For example the p orbital consists a positive and a negative  lobe, corresponding to the amplitude of the wavefunction. This has real consequences in spectroscopic transitions and the theory of molecular bonding because amplitudes can be added and interference constructively or destructively representing bonding or antibonding states respectively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's more important than the amount of space is the uncertainty of that space.  The uncertainty principle requires that dqdp &gt; h, so in a sense, planks constant is a resolution which specifies how close to states can be and still be separate states.  You cant have points in phase space, not even in principle.  A state occupies a volume of at least h^3</p></div>		</li>
