<p>But it gets even worse, because the Universe is expanding over time, space stretching apart and becoming larger, so beyond a certain distance (roughly 14 billion light years), the overall expansion of space passes the speed of light, and objects beyond that distance will never be affected by any of the gravity 'emitted' by the Earth right now (nor will we ever be affected by the gravity they're 'emitting' right now).</p>

<p>Could you give me a bit more info on this? Is this saying that, past 14 billion light years (size of universe now), space (and the objects in it) are traveling faster than the speed of light so our gravity cannot &quot;catch up&quot; to it? I assume the objects are not traveling that fast, so wouldn't, over a very long length in time, our gravity eventually &quot;catch up&quot; to them post their creation? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The 14 billion light year figure isn't, necessarily, the size of the Universe overall. It's a very particular measurement of the size of the <em>observable</em> universe- to be precise, it's the distance to the cosmic event horizon, past which objects are receding faster than the speed of light and can never encounter us again.</p>
<p>Other than that, yeah, that's the basic idea.</p></div>		</li>
