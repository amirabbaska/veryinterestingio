			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as it still holds a positive electrical charge, you can stack electrons in orbitals around it, which means that It will behave the same as a normal nucleus when it comes to chemistry. I feel like the behavior in nuclear reactions is going to be out of left field tho.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will read the original paper for sure. But judging by the fact that the general trend of bounding energy was not drastically altered with the discoveries of SHE, my first impression is that the writer at phys.org didn’t make the greatest job.</p>
<p>On top of that, one has to think about the conditions - is the system’s halflife long enough to be considered nucleus? Are we looking at its interactions at low energies? Because we know for a fact, from heavy ions collision experiments from CERN, Fermilab, ... that if you smash two nuclei like 208Pb against each other at high enough energy, you can very well describe than as a “sea of quarks and gluons”.</p></div>		</li>
