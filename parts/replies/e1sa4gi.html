			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some problems though. Not too crazy but things we need to think about. </p>
<p>The redshift, in addition to changing Ye frequency of measured EM waves also changes the rate of information transfer. At 1/5 the speed of light youâ€™d expect the message to take 20% longer to capture than to send</p></div>		</li>
