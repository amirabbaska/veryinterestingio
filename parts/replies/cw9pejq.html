			<p>Totally a guess but I feel like it might have something to do with the adrenaline pumping in your body when you get injured and your brain doesn't make the pain connection until you actually see it. That happened to me when I fell and sliced my knee open. I felt totally fine but then when I looked and saw a flap of skin and like inside my knee I almost collapsed. I think the ER nurse said it had something to do with me running on adrenaline or something. TOTAL GUESS. </p>		</li>
