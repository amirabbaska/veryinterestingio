			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't taste capsaicin, you feel it. It binds with the temperature receptors in your mouth, not your taste buds. </p>
<p>Carbonation forms a mild carbonic acid when it comes out of solution. The acid has a slight burn to it as well (usually in a very pleasant way).</p>
<p>Add the two together and they accentuate each other. If you like spice, you'll enjoy this. If you don't like spice, try drinking something else.</p>
<p>Sweetness decreases the burn.</p>
<p>Menthol also binds with your temperature receptors.</p></div>		</li>
