<blockquote>
<p>Do you mean the ~8 inches of space between the floor and bottom of door/walls? Or the cracks where the seams of the door and wall panels meet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: ITT everyone disagreeing with each other about the answer while claiming to know it because &quot;isn't it obvious you retard&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit 2: If it were &quot;obvious&quot;, there would be consensus. The fact that everyone is arguing about the meaning is proof that it isn't &quot;obvious&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Door and panels meet. In the image linked you can see the toilet paper draped down the panel, beside the door. That's the gap shield. People washing their hands, looking in the mirror, can inadvertently catch eye contact through the overly large gap and ruin the moment mid-squeeze. The tp draped down the side prevents this. It's like the people that install these panels intentionally make ~2 inch gaps to satisfy their strange fetish or something.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Codes are a huge driver.  I work for an Architect in California and have drawn many bathrooms. Depending on the layout the stalls may require a certain toe clearance for additional maneuverability for people in a wheel chair.  This allows the foot to swing out from the bottom of the partition if trying to turn around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts are that the American ones are like that so that you can see if the stall is occupied. Cuts down on amount of materials used. so it's probably a little cheaper. And, if you're trying to hide from a bad guy you have to stand up on the toilet so he can't see your feet, which makes for better movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gaps referenced to are the cracks between panels. You can see into the stall through them, and if you're moving while doing that you get the full view of whoever is in there.</p>
<p>Europeans think this is absolute lunacy. Most European restrooms don't even have stalls, but are just fully isolated rooms. </p>
<p>The gap between the door and the floor is to ease cleaning btw, no one cares about that one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience (foreigner living in America) the main source of confusion is the huge cracks around the doors and wall panels. In the rest of the world there is no gap to see through. In america there is usually a fairly large crack, big enough to clearly see through. As for gaps under doors/stalls or short height, I find that is pretty variable. </p>
<p>As for why the big cracks? Only thing I can think is it's supposed to discourage any sort of lewd or illegal behaviour going on inside a stall, because 'Murrica.</p></div>		</li>
