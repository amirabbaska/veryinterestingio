			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, kind of. I am a Caribbean Spiny Lobster biologist and we’ve raised several lobsters for years in our wet lab. Our oldest is a male that was probably 10+ years old when we got him (wild caught), and we have had him in the lab for 9 years. He is huge and I have pictures somewhere, but his carapace (head/abdomen bit) is a little bit longer than my size 8 women’s feet. He gets fed every day and basically gets as much as he wants. He molts 2-3 times a year, but since he is so large he puts on more weight than length (it’s still a large increase in volume). We haven’t weighed him recently to not stress him out (we usually do carapace length measurements).</p>
<p>So, large lab kept lobsters do exist. His biggest risk is a bad molt, and unfortunately he just had a rough molt where his gills are outside of his body, instead of on the inside. This isn’t a death sentence, but it’s not a great prognosis either. He seems old to me (ie doesn’t move around much, doesn’t mate anymore) but I’ve also had to “fight” him to get him out of the tank and he’s definitely got some strength in him, so who knows.</p>
<p>On the inevitable day that Big G dies, he will be used as part of a study that tries to figure out how old wild lobsters are. Fun fact: they have structures in their stomachs to grind up their food and if you take one of those and sand it down and polish it, you see rings, like on a tree! Now we are checking to make sure what those rings represent.</p>
<p>(Edit: picture of Big G next to my shoe from two years ago <a href="https://imgur.com/a/F4HWGXt" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/F4HWGXt" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/F4HWGXt</a></a> and a gif of the face peeing, featuring Big G and one of his lady friends <a href="https://gph.is/2O1SLpd" target="_blank">https://gph.is/2O1SLpd</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like the sort of project that would take too long for too little payoff for most scientists to try. An unfortunate side-effect of the culture of academia is that you're pressured to study things that can turn over results quickly. Any project that takes decades better have some potential for a crazy sexy payoff that will get you published in a top journal, or be a super low maintenance project. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: no more comments about the pitch drop plz. there are like 15 already. that and beal's seed viability experiment were what I was thinking of when I mentioned super low maintenance projects</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aquariums would have tried this, however, to help their animals live longer lives. I’m unaware of any stats or if there’s a solid study that’s been done on the lifespans of lobsters in captivity- I volunteer at an aquarium and know that it is tough keeping our older crustaceans alive through their molts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of the latter category is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment" target="_blank">pitch drop experiment</a>. The most famous one has been running for decades now, but all that has to be done is let it sit there and check on it every so often. </p></div>		</li>
