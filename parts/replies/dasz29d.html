<p>I don't know if I want to do that just yet, becuase yeah it's a huuuuge pain in the ass and this sound system is pretty tough to disassemble, and it's like 10 years old and I've been considering replacing it anyway. I'm all for fixing stuff myself though :D</p>
<p>I'm not too concerned, hoping that &quot;percussive maintenance&quot; will last for a good long while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that oxidation affects all contacts too.. and of course all kinds of dust and dirt. Knocking it shakes things up. One common &quot;fix&quot; is that tapping it moves the contacts or solder joints in microscopic level allowing ion channels to form. Once we have &quot;shunted&quot; thru whatever nanometer scale layer of dirt or oxidation we have, things can also heat up and expand and we have enough connection that everything works until the system is powered down. Requiring another tap when we power it back on.</p>
<p>In case of mechanical stuff, without a doubt it is a case of missing lubrication (can be caused by oxidation) and strategic drop of oil in just the right place does the trick. Not as bad as electronic issues as this can go on for years without it getting worse.. may actually fix it too but very rarely random application of force is good solution.</p>
<p>If the problem fixes itself or is triggered by time, it is 99% chance a cold solder: the solder was cooled too fast or was too cold to begin with or various other temperature related stuff that causes solder to either crystallize or ball up. Heat expansion slowly cracks these open. The symptoms are usually time related, almost at set time, say, 15 minutes after powering the device it just shut off or malfunctions and a tap will fix it. </p>
<p>But i can say without a doubt that any device that needs a tap today, needs a sledgehammer tomorrow as this WILL get worse.. The vibrations you cause will hammer the surfaces away from each other, each tap basically has to be stronger than the last (averaged over time). So get ready to repair it and do not wait long. It may just stop working right now, any second may be the last one.. The connection might be still mechanically solid, for ex held by glue on the component chassis or other pins. It only takes so little to break it forever.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily need to reflow, first inspection is visual: magnifying glass and spend about 2 minutes per 5x5cm area in the motherboard. Go slow and take lots of breaks.. You may catch the cracked/cold solder and re-solder only that pin. And do not attempt if unsure, leave it professionals.</p>
<p>Edit oh yeah, whiskers... Long crystals that may form over years and specially affect digital stuff (analog side of circuit can be strong enough to either withstand the malfunction or it just burns the whiskers away). A tap will break the connection but the distance we clear is stupidly small and it will return soon. I don't know a fix for this, maybe canned air could help as they really are very thin and fragile.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, broken  leg on a resistor. </p>
<p>I also had a buzzing g string on my banjo, but that's a different story.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, coming from the perspective of someone that fixes TVs, a the two points that commonly fail like this are the yoke connector and the vertical output IC. The picture will collapse into a horizontal line or get jumpy and start to fold over. Hit the set and the picture pops back in to place, or at least changes drastically. You'd be surprised how much of electronic diagnosis involves hitting things and wiggling, poking and flexing them.</p></div>		</li>
