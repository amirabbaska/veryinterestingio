			<div class="markdown"><p>But as time goes on and the lightbulb starts to fade an offset begins. If you were to store something that was say an 8 on the new lightbulb, but on a work lightbulb it displays as a 6 you suddenly have data corruption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it's significantly more difficult to look at the lightbulb and know it's 66% bright with consistent accuracy.  Especially as the lightbulb wears out, as /u/Zotlann noted</p>
<p>Data integrity is absolutely vital.  A single incorrect bit can result in corruption.  There are ways to identify and correct such errors, but they would become exponentially more complex as you increase the possible states of a single 'bit'</p></div>		</li>
