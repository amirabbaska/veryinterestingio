			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. What I read about aging was explained like this : Whenever DNA replicates a little bit at the end is truncated. At the end of all DNA is a length of junk DNA called a telomere that does nothing for your body and is only there to be truncated. Over your lifetime as your DNA replicates and replicates and replicates this junk DNA at the end gets truncated down again and again a little bit at a time until it is all gone. Once that happens important DNA starts being truncated off the end and things will start going wrong.</p>
<p>So basically there is a wick at the end of our DNA that is always burning down. Once it's gone our body will fail. This is why we can't live forever and why I don't think a transplanted liver/heart could be passed on indefinitely(with current medicine anyways).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a relevant segment from the wikipedia article :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is becoming apparent that reversing shortening of telomeres through temporary activation of telomerase may be a potent means to slow aging. The reason that this would extend human life is because it would extend the Hayflick limit. Three routes have been proposed to reverse telomere shortening: drugs, gene therapy, or metabolic suppression, so-called, torpor/hibernation. So far these ideas have not been proven in humans, but it has been demonstrated that telomere shortening is reversed in hibernation and aging is slowed (Turbill, et al. 2012 &amp; 2013) and that hibernation prolongs life-span (Lyman et al. 1981). It has also been demonstrated that telomere extension has successfully reversed some signs of aging in laboratory mice [40][41] and the nematode worm species Caenorhabditis elegans.[42] It has been hypothesized that longer telomeres and especially telomerase activation might cause increased cancer (e.g. Weinstein and Ciszek, 2002). However, longer telomeres might also protect against cancer, because short telomeres are associated with cancer. It has also been suggested that longer telomeres might cause increased energy consumption.[30]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer cells have telomerase.  That’s what happens when you make telomeres longer...you eventually get cancer.</p>
<p>Lengthening telomeres might delay aging, however, your DNA will still mutate randomly.  And those mutations will lead to cancer.</p>
<p>Shortening telomeres is one of the body’s defense mechanisms to prevent cancer because the cells die before they become cancerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of cellular divisions occuring in the heart is negligible compared to the rest of the body which is one of the reasons why heart cancer is extremely rare.  As I understand, the cellular replacement rate for a heart cell is around 100 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plaque buildup would be an issue for a heart (unless during transplant they could somehow flush it?), but I could see a heart being transplanted twice if the people had really heart-healthy lifestyles. So like 60 year old heart goes into a 20 year old, then do that again. Could last 100-150 years. I don't see a reason to do this because there are way more healthy hearts being buried/burned than heart transplants needed. It's an issue of getting consent from people, not theoretical supply.</p></div>		</li>
