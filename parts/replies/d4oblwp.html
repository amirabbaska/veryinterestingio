<p>value of whatever minerals are up there.</p>

<p>It's not the minerals NASA is interested in. It's the knowledge gained from testing mining equipment in order to build better equipment which can be used to actually mine asteroids in the belt.  </p>
<p>The whole point of NASA wanting to bring one to Earht's orbit was to cut down on costs developing and testing equipment. Plus, other mining companies other than NASA could also greatly benefit from it if they wanted to expand into space.  </p>
<p>After all, if we're to build a Dyson Sphere, we gotta start somewhere, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA isn't full of idiots. If they're going to go to the massive expense of such a mission they'll do it with a target that will give immediate return. Besides, they'll want to test one that is compositionally similar to the ones companies will want to target. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully Nasa can use that knowledge to figure out how to solve the expenses of manpower, fuel and time... which are not going away or diminishing except as a function of lighter weight mining equipment. After they figure that out, they should, in theory, be able to apply that knowledge to solve every problem we could possibly think of.</p>
<p>You could start on the Dyson by pulling your meteor sized noggin out of your arse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, all of the serious capture and/or mining plans for asteroids have been based on using near-Earth asteroids because of the low energy cost to get to them (many would cost less delta-V than a trip to the Moon does).</p>
<p>This one falls into the same category, so it's not special in that regard.  It's just one more potential candidate.  Ultimately, orbital mechanics will tell us which one is &quot;cheapest&quot;.  The more that get discovered, the larger chance we have of finding one that's within fuel and technology constraints of moving it at all, or of finding one that is both easy enough and interesting enough to justify moving at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, rather than mine it to bring to earth, it might be worth mining for manufacturing basic spacecraft/station parts. If it costs $10,000/kg to lift metal to orbit, and you have a giant source of iron... Sending up a robot miner/smelter could be a thrifty choice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's safe to say that we would want this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because this is such an enormous number, I feel it should be pointed out that the USA's GDP is only $18T annually. Just to give a sense of scale. </p></div>		</li>
