<blockquote>
<p>Prior to launch, Soyuz 1 engineers are said to have reported 203 design faults to party leaders, but their concerns &quot;were overruled by political pressures for a series of space feats to mark the anniversary of Lenin's birthday.&quot;[4] It is not clear how much of this pressure resulted from the need to continue beating the United States in the Space Race and have Soviets first on the Moon, or to take advantage of the recent setbacks in the U.S. space program with the Apollo 1 disaster. There is some question as to whether this report of design faults ever existed.[5]</p>
<p>Yuri Gagarin was the backup pilot for Soyuz 1, and was aware of the design problems and the pressures from the Politburo to proceed with the flight. He attempted to &quot;bump&quot; Komarov from the mission, knowing that the Soviet leadership would not risk a national hero on the flight.[6] At the same time, Komarov refused to pass on the mission, even though he believed it to be doomed. He explained that he could not risk Gagarin's life,[6] although modern critics say Gagarin was backup crew &quot;in name only&quot; and the Kremlin would have never risked his life due to his &quot;national hero&quot; status, and also say Gagarin's reported attempt to bump Komarov never took place.[5]</p>

<p>Yuri Gagarin tried jumping in front of the metaphoric bullet for his friend, thinking the USSR wouldn't allow the mission if the first guy in Space would be killed.</p>
<p>And guy still died. But not in space, just because of it.</p></div>		</li>
