			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/resonator97, <strong>I'm afraid you are quite incorrect about flies. They not only have a brain, but can learn too!</strong> </p>
<p>Insects may lack the <em>full cerebrum</em> of humans, but their <em>supraesophageal ganglion</em> is nevertheless a three lobed brain: it sits figuratively and literally at the head of the <em>central nervous system</em>. Whilst obviously simpler than ours, this microbrain is perfectly capable of learning and executing new behaviours. Only early diverging animal groups like sponges and sea urchins lack a true brain, relying instead upon a distributed nerve net - which may also contain ganglia. This is perhaps what you were thinking of.</p>
<p>Here's Dukas in Annual Reviews of Entomology (2008): &quot;Learning and memory, defined as the acquisition and retention of neuronal representations of new information, are ubiquitous among insects. Recent research indicates that a variety of insects rely extensively on learning for all major life activities including feeding, predator avoidance, aggression, social interactions, and sexual behavior.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew something wasn't right. There was a housefly that appeared in my house once. It was crawling on a nearby wall for hours for no reason. Placing my fingers on the wall with no motion, it eventually crawled onto my hand, seemingly with no fear. It eventually was hopping around my computer keyboard without fear while I worked. If I grabbed for it, it would just land on my hand and continue walking around with no issue. Being the psychopath that I am, I eventually decided to take care of the fly. While it was happily crawling around hopping from hand to hand and around my keyboard/mouse area, I decided to try to slam my hand down to kill it. It flew off to the far end of the room, and avoided me like the plague until I finally caught and killed it. Clearly some memory and intelliegence happening there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that we do now consider the ganglion of an insect, a &quot;brain&quot;. But I had a university professor that wanted to make very clear that it should not be considered a &quot;brain&quot;. Some people today even argue our gut is a actually &quot;brain&quot; of it's own. So isn't it a bit of a issue of definition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <em>central complex</em> of insects is now thought to be homologous (directly related) to the <em>basal ganglia</em> of the human brain. If this is true, then the human brain is essentially the structure that was present in the last common ancestor of insects and humans, with a big extra bit - <em>the rest of the cerebrum</em> - evolved and tacked on later. In light of this (and the fact that insects can display learned behaviour and personalities without it) it would seem anthropocentric snobbery to say that lacking a human-like cerebrum means you lack a brain. </p>
<p>On the issue of whether or not the gut is a 'brain' in its own right, the answer is mostly no. It's clearly capable of complex neural subprocessing, but is ultimately secondary to the brain in terms of control of the body, and neural capacity. However it can make some decisions on its own, even communicating with the central nervous system without going via <em>the</em> brain. It's this fact that has led some people to refer to it as a second brain. I suppose it's like the relationship between a CPU and a GPU in a computer. It's a matter of function and organisation that differentiates <em>the brain</em> from the <em>enteric nervous system</em>. At the end of the day, they're made from exactly the same components.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it isn't just a matter of definition because insect &quot;brains&quot; accumulate memories and learn behaviours. So the key part of the top post is wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know for a fact that fruit flies can and do learn, and can learn to avoid unpleasant conditions. Some stimuli used in experiments are bad tastes, electrocution, vortexing, and heat. A rough example is if the blue food is always bitter, and the red for is sweet, they will learn to avoid the blue food.</p></div>		</li>
