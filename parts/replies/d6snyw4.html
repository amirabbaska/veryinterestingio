			<p>Oy, it's like the dragonfly being able to see in both directions at the same time. Insane.</p>		</li>

			<p>In the pictures it looks like all 3 ocelli are all on the same &quot;plane&quot; of the insect's head.  How do they align one of these with the ground and the other two with the sky?  Does that &quot;plane&quot; of their head become the &quot;front,&quot; so to speak?  Seems like an awkward angle for the head to be at while flying.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not super familiar with flying insect behavior, but generally they do have their heads much further &quot;down&quot; than you would expect given their body plan.  This has a lot to do with their standard eye physiology.  Compound eyes have a fixed visual foci for each ommatidia (the little hexes that make up the eye) and are not super great at seeing things when the insects are moving very fast.  Because of the way they operate, anything part of the eye that is not facing directly towards the direction of movement is going to get the visual equivalent of &quot;speed lines&quot; with low resolution visual information.  If you look at images, you'll notice that a lot of flying insects, particularly predatory ones, have segments of their eye facing up relative to the front of their head, roughly in the same plane as the ocelli.  Because insects have compound eyes, this means that different regions of the eye can get different quality of visual data depending on the circumstances, and these &quot;upward facing&quot; sections are going to be giving the highest quality data during flight.</p>		</li>
