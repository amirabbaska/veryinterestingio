			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're probably making a joke but let me clarify a bit in case this spirals out of control. I'm not saying &quot;stressful people&quot; have stressed babies, I mean that major traumatic life events (stressors) that occur during pregnancy will affect the unborn baby. Stressors such as abuse during pregnancy, or being in a catastrophic accident. It's usually not enough that you're prone to stress to create these physical changes in the baby's brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Their comment on that really made me think. As someone with pretty severe anxiety issues, that's something I'd never thought about before but realized, if accurate would be an issue for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What evolutionary purpose could that serve? It seems that if the mother is living under stressful conditions, it would be better for her offspring to be LESS affected by stress so they would be better able to get on with the business of living, despite the chaos around them. But instead they're more prone to anxiety and such, and in stressful conditions it seems that they would be at a bigger disadvantage than offspring from non-stressed mothers despite being &quot;warned&quot; about the difficult environment before birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely sure but the first thing that comes to mind is survival. Anxiety is protective--it stops us from touching the hot stove, or wandering into the scary, potentially dangerous woods. Someone with more cortisol receptors will be more wary, and thus more likely to survive. It's like, &quot;damn, my mom went through some shit, I'd better be careful.&quot;</p>
<p>(Not sure how closely related cortisol is to anxiety, and anxiety to stress, so it may be a stretch. It's early and this is my best guess without googling.)</p></div>		</li>
