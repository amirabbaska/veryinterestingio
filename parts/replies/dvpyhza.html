			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, golden parachutes are also used as defences against hostile takeovers. They often include clauses that trigger when a change of ownership happens, even if the CEO isn't removed from their position. This effectively increases the purchasing cost for the hostile entity without costing the victim corp a dime, or even requiring any effort to boost their market value.</p>
<p>Although there's much debate about their effectiveness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. But that is hypothetical, not tested. That's why:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a poison pill that's &quot;camouflaged&quot; as a golden parachute (not just camouflaged, it is a parachute).  But it's not explicitly listed as a poison pill, which is usually listed openly.  As /u/titterbug mentioned, this was the case for Yahoo! and Verizon.</p>
<p>Yahoo! voted on Marissa Mayer's golden parachute at the same time as they voted on whether to accept Verizon's deal.  Mayer's parachute was more than 1% of the entire value of Yahoo!, which is a pretty steep cost.</p>
<p>Also, on an unrelated note, I hope Yahoo! dies in a fire -- that exclamation mark is just stupid and leads to wonky formatting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would triggers raise purchasing cost? And if it has to do with the 'golden parachute' isn't it costing the victim to pay a lot of money to the new CEO</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because you buy the company at whatever valuation, but then $30M leaves the company, effectively causing you to overpay. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It raises the purchasing cost because the new owners (the hostile entity), being the owners, are now footing the bill for that parachute contract. Whether that comes from the hostile company's funds or the victim's doesn't matter, because the hostile company has ownership of both now.</p>
<p>Think of it like a snake eating a poison dart frog. The frog isn't harmed by its own venom, but it acts as a deterrent to the snake who is hungry.</p>
<p>By guaranteeing that some portion of funds after the sale must be forfeit, it reduces the value of the victim company for the hostile entity since they get less money for their effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. A common clause in the golden parachute reads something like &quot;if company is bought out, the purchaser is responsible for paying the CEO's bonus&quot; effectively making them pay for the company and then also pay the CEO bonus.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, well then I think the most important point is that isn't what Gordon Gekko did. A company going away isn't the same as bankrupting a company.</p>
<p>Imagine there is a lively trade of classic car enthusiasts who are buying and selling various old and historical automobiles. Prices vary based on a lot of factors including simple nostalgia and even expectation of future value. Most people in this market are buying and selling because they want to keep working on and operating such cars.</p>
<p>But there is also a kind of person in this market who doesn't care about cars, they care about money. What I mean is they may be fully balanced people in other respects but their interest in the classic car market has nothing to do with an interest in classic cars. Instead they are looking at making some quick money and if a classic car's price drops too far they will buy it up and scrap it for raw materials, making a profit. If ever a vehicle's price becomes lower than the profit to be had by chopping it up for parts they will snap it up and not think twice about destroying the vehicle.</p>
<p>This is basically what the character of Gordon Gekko is doing except with companies. A company has assets which are worth money and potentially the stock price of such a company can fall to the point that an investor could make a profit by buying control of the company and breaking it up. Imagine an airline company which is having big problems even turning a profit, losing money every year and basically being a liability. Someone might be able to purchase it and sell off the factory equipment, the properties, the patents, the brand name, etc. for more money than they spent taking over control. Such assets might even be a big pile of cash controlled by the company and earmarked for another purpose; suppose the airline was planning to be really good to its employees and controlled a big pension fund that they didn't use for other purposes because the owners were nice people.</p>
<p>Gekko comes along and sees the value of the company overall is worth more than it would take for him to buy up control, including control of the pension fund, and sell off the assets of the company. Of course this does mean closing the company and all the workers losing their jobs but Gekko doesn't really care about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that &quot;good talent&quot; for executives often just means proven connections that have led to massive sales in their previous job. But that can be worth a great deal, especially for a new company for which it mean the difference between success and failure.</p>
<p>If I'm currently a senior VP at Lockheed Missile Systems and everyone knows I've been closing deals with execs from other companies that I met and keep meeting at the right trade associations, there's no reason to think I'll be less successful somewhere else.</p>
<p>So if someone wants to get a space launch business going, they might be interested in hiring someone like that. But it's a startup, so they have to offer sweet incentives in case it doesn't work out.</p></div>		</li>
