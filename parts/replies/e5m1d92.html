			<div class="markdown"><p>As the above post states - the main considerations are in taking a scarce resource (lungs available for transplant that are a suitable match for a patient in need) and distributing them fairly.  In general, patients should have lung disease without good medical options, high expected chance of death if they don't receive a transplant, as low as possible mortality if they do receive a transplant (which means lack of other diseases such as advanced disease heart or kidney disease or ongoing behaviors that will cause the transplant to fail such as smoking or drug use), and a social support network that can help them get through a very difficult transplant process (large surgery, difficult recovery, many appointments, immunosuppressive post-transplant medications with severe side effects). </p>
<p>Thus, patient with COPD do receive transplants inasmuch as they fit the above criteria - but given that patients with COPD due to smoking often have other medical problems, older age, or ongoing smoking - they frequently aren't as good of candidates as some other lung diseases (such as Cystic Fibrosis, COPD due to A1AT, PAH, etc) </p></div>		</li>

<p>One thing I wish everyone would do is to be a donor and let their family know their wishes!</p>
<p>At this point, I'm too old to be a donor, but am on the Brain Donor List as I have Parkinson's and Cancer. Very least hope to do my part in solving the mystery of Parkinson's.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're not too old to be a donor! A 92-year-old donated a liver in Texas - sign up anyways and the doctors can decide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for your reply! Even though my mum has COPD I am quite clueless when it comes to treatment. She has had rehab but I didn't understand why some diseases have transplants and yet others it's quite unheard of. The comments have given me a good insight though, I never realised how complicated it is. Thanks for the link, I will take a look. </p></div>		</li>
