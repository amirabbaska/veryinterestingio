			<div class="markdown"><p>We have, but with an uncertainty several orders of magnitude worse than measurements. The best calculations I saw had an uncertainty of several MeV, about 1% uncertainty.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3599" target="_blank">Here is an older calculation</a>, they didn't even separate protons and neutrons because the uncertainty is so large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those interested: It's because the proton mass is a messy and difficult calculation to do from scratch. It's not as simple as adding up the quark masses. You have to calculate the binding energies from the strong interaction, which is notoriously hard to do at low energies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate on the antiproton to proton mass ratio please? I thought antiprotons were supposed to be perfect copies of protons, but with opposite charge, wouldn't that imply that the mass ratio is simply 1:1?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass ratio should be exactly 1, but we still want to test this experimentally. Measuring the proton mass is easier than measuring the antiproton mass, so the latter measurement has a larger uncertainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the ratio should be exactly 1 if the inter-quark interactions are symmetric under the transformation of particles to antiparticles. If the ratio is not exactly 1, that could be a sign of interesting new physics. And we don't know for sure whether it's 1 or not unless we measure it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Although isn't it the case that we'll never know for sure - just that the maximum expected deviation from 1 will get smaller and smaller as our measurements get more accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original idea was to express everything relative to hydrogen. Back then it was expected that all numbers are exact integers. Then measurements got more precise and it was seen that this definition would lead to odd effects, e.g. uranium-238 would have a mass of about 236 with this definition. Therefore, scientists changed the definition to 1 amu = 1/16 of the mass of oxygen. Again measurements got more precise, and isotopes were discovered. 1/16 of oxygen-16? That's what physicists used. 1/16 of the natural composition of oxygen (mainly O-16 but some O-17 and O-18 in it)? That's what chemists used. After long discussions, both agreed on C-12. That is not oxygen, so no side &quot;won&quot;, and that definition is close to both previous definitions and carbon is easily available.</p>
<p>O-16 would have been a perfectly reasonable choice as well, F-19 would be possible (the only stable isotope of fluorine), Si-28 would have some advantages (we have the technology to make extremely pure crystals thanks to the semiconductor industry). Au-197 would have lead to significantly different values, but gold is another element that is isotopically pure, and it doesn't react easily with other stuff.</p></div>		</li>
