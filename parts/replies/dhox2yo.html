<p>However, taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All sushi is frozen in the USA, it hast to be by law. I always laugh when people say something like &quot;Oh the sushi is San Francisco is so awesome and fresh, much better than this frozen shit you get in (Minneapolis/Chicago)&quot;...umm all SUSHI is frozen even that amazing SUSHI you got at the fish market in Seattle.</p>
<p>However even in Japan were you don't have to freeze SUSHI most do because they think it actually enhances the taste and texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't support cryonics or harbor any belief that the method could do anything to preserve a person for future eras; however, it should be noted that modern cryonics companies don't utilize a process of freezing but instead a process of vitrification.</p></div>		</li>
