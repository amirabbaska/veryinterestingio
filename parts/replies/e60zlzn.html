			<div class="markdown"><p>If math has no real tie to physical world, how is it that physicists discover things based on pure math, then end is proving it true with experimentation? Or like with Euler's formula and imaginary numbers, how is it that a mathematical relationship ends up being coincidentally used to describe all wave-like phenomena, but not until 100-200 years later when people realized what the formula means in relation to physics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why math seems like magic to me. Maybe we are  just &quot;extending our logic&quot;, but it appears to me that the only reason our logic can be applied to understanding the laws of the universe is because the universe is built off of the same logic, and we can comprehend logic because we are part of the universe. I like thinking of the development of math as a journey to discover how the universe was created, because it makes it way more interesting and it actually makes more sense than explaining it as &quot;oh it just happens to work out that way because we can use logic&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm your conclusion appears invalid to me, because what is used to describe something is not equivalent to the thing described, the existence of apples does in no way relate or depend on the linguistic description and invention of the word &quot;apple&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good, and reasonable, question to pose to someone who is not a mathematical Platonists. I think it depends on what you mean by &quot;no tie&quot;, and what you are calling &quot;pure math&quot;.</p>
<p>First of all, if anything is predicted by pure maths, it is already true by that formal system, and experiment is unnecessary. What will happen, however, is that scientists will develop an intuition of physical phenomenon from working with and trying to conceptualize and understand them, and then will take a leap based off a simple assumption or assumptions and develop the math based of those assumptions (like in Special Relaitvity, Einstein could tell from experiment and his intuition that the relativity of velocity and the constancy of the speed of light were simultaneously true, so he worked forwards from those assumptions and found the math that described that sort of system).</p>
<p>For the Euler's formula example, you're asking more about the unreasonable effectiveness of maths in the field of science I think, which is an interesting and ongoing area of debate. Why does maths best phenomenon, and not some other system or language or whatever you call it? Why when we take what we know and extend with mathematics do we get often very reliable new info? Perhaps it is because math is strongly related to logic, and we are more or less just logically extending from simple assumptions. If you moreso meant how do mathematical structures invented a hundred or more years ago not find their real use until much later, yet still do eventually find use, remember that there are a lot of maths that doesn't one day connect, and we have being toying with stuff for millennia. Look at many of the abstract algebra systems which exist and find no particular use value, they are just pretty. Maybe one day they will all find use, but it is no guarantee, and if we keep inventing maths, and maths is formal systems, sometimes those systems will describe things that actually happen by sheer numbers alone. Though maybe resorting to probability to explain the effectiveness of maths is circular hehe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematics proposes systems that may or may not exist in the real world. When physicists discover things from math, it’s because they picked a mathematical system (model), tested how closely it adheres to the real world system, and decided it was a good model. Sometimes they are right on the mark, and everything that’s true in the model is true in the real world. Sometimes they are wrong about the model, and at some point realize they need to pick a different one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really understand how math can be said to be invented and merely used to describe the universe. Does that mean there may be other ways that can also describe the universe? I mean 1+1 is always 2 no matter whether we're here to see it or not. Obviously we invented the framework and the methods that we use, but the actual facts of math have always been there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does mean that there are or at least could be other ways to describe the universe. I mean, language has described the universe without formal maths for years, unless you are being as vague as all counting is maths, in which case then I would say that that has more to do with how our brains are hardwired.</p>
<p>Also, I don't understand what you mean with your 1+1=2. If you define what 1, 1, and 2 are, then it is by rote definition that 1+1=2. It is similar to the fact that &quot;All bachelors are unmarried&quot; is true. Sure, but it is a tautology, a bachelor is by definition an unmarried person. 2 is by definition the successor to 1, and +1 is by definition that act of applying the successor operation ones. I agree that the universe behaves consistently even outside of our observation, but as soon as you apply mathematical description to it, that is tantamount to acting as if it is observed.</p></div>		</li>
