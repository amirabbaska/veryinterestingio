			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome! I used to study fossil mammal teeth in university and we would look at wear patterns of the teeth to determine the diet of them. However those where only 20,000 years old and dinosaur teeth are much older so that probably wouldn't be possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to study wear patterns in dinosaur teeth - the age of the fossil doesnâ€™t matter as long as the wear pattern was preserved. For example one of the hadrosaurs (I forget which), they know the babies were likely brought food in the nest because the fossilised hatchlings did not appear to be developed enough to walk but had worn teeth suggesting they had already been eating. </p></div>		</li>
