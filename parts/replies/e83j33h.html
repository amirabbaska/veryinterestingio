			<div class="markdown"><p>High quality is a relative term. You can get a very well crafted, very expensive, very sharp knife made with run of the mill carbon steel alloys. Exotic alloys don't mean the knife is better. Its more of a gimmick or for a knife being used for a specific purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Practically there's not much advantage of s30v over 1095. But they do have measurably better characteristics (corrosion resistance, edge retention, toughness blah blah blah), and if you need those, (or are a real life min/maxer) it can be useful.</p>
<p>You're right and I think the real uniquely practical case is marine knives which are tough with bad edge retention, but incredible corrosion resistance so they can be regularly used in saltwater with no problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High-carbon 'cheap' steel is actually the somewhat traditional and is the generally preferred steel for cleavers in and from Asia. It takes a very sharp (but very quick to dull) edge and in a larger format has an appropriate weight. It's easy to remake the cutting plane daily and since you don't need anything exotic (a simple planar angle is sufficient with no convex entry or other fun) it is something anyone with a stone can do, fixing nicks in the process.</p>
<p>It's utilitarian and frankly, pretty much perfect for chefs that are used to that sort of tool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most popular knives on the market for hunters is a mora knife (Morakniv). There are visible imperfections on the spine and visible grind marks at the blade but at $10-20 a piece they really show what cheap steel can do, made in Sweden and all. </p>
<p>The only difference is work. You can get a really sharp knife out of anything but what happens when you need to make it sharp a second time. </p>
<p>Local meat processors use $30 knives and sharpen them on beltsanders. It is cheaper to spend 2 minutes using up a third of a knife than an hour </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I visited a swordsmith in Gifu last week that creates sword the traditional way, and they said they fold the steel about 20 times. 10,000 times seems a bit excessive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each time you forge weld the metal, you lose some of it to oxidation. I can't imagine the size of bar you would need to fold it 10,000 times and still have enough metal to make a toothpick, let alone a sword.</p></div>		</li>
