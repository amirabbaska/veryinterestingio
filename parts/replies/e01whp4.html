<p>Wild animals might just die if they get a psychiatric disorder that impairs them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(From the perspective of a Psychiatrist) It's also worth noting that the diagnosis of &quot;PTSD&quot; is a DSM-5 construct, which our field built to have a sort of &quot;common language&quot; for research purposes, and for communicating our impressions of patients to other clinicians.  If we say a patient &quot;has PTSD,&quot; we mean essentially that they've suffered a life-threatening or life-altering trauma and have developed symptoms X, Y, and Z in response to it.  </p>
<p>It may not be as useful to say that an animal &quot;has PTSD&quot; or doesn't, because even humans can have maladaptive responses to stressors without being diagnosed with PTSD (Psychiatrists may call this &quot;Adjustment Disorder&quot; or in some cases, may say it doesn't meet criteria for any diagnosis whatsoever).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's difficult to translate that to non-human animals because a lot of symptoms of PTSD manifest - as best as current research indicates - because parts of the brain involved in fear and memory essentially &quot;overreact&quot; to the trauma, and non-human animals have both distinct neural anatomies as well as neural mechanisms for recording and recalling traumatic experiences.  Humans may record traumatic experiences in exquisite detail, while non-human animals may more simply record traumatic experiences as &quot;that was bad, don't do that in future.&quot;</p>
<p>I can offer a couple thoughts, though these are merely personal conjectures and the methods to test them scientifically may present both methodological and ethical quandaries:</p>
<p>a) I consider it fairly likely that even early humans likely experienced symptoms that today we would call PTSD.  At the very least, I don't think civilization, society, and human evolution would have significantly altered the process by which we believe modern humans develop PTSD.</p>
<p>b) I think there's at least some evidence that non-human animals experience symptoms potentially on the spectrum of PTSD or other stress-reactions.  Consider for example abused dogs and cats, which in many cases become extremely distressed or agitated in the presence of humans; this may reflect what humans experience as either &quot;flashbacks&quot; or &quot;hypervigilance.&quot;</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts on the matter, and sadly I think that's about all I can offer at this point.  I am very fascinated by non-human Psychiatry and I think the question on non-human PTSD is a fantastic one.  But as accurately pointed out, it would be difficult to translate to non-human animals, and testing for such would both present its own difficulties as well as perhaps it's own ethical dilemmas.</p></div>		</li>
