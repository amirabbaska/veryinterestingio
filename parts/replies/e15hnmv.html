			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct! Hijacking top comment to provide a little detail: Arteries do most of the heavy lifting, moving blood away from the heart and towards other organs and tissues. Other blood vessels are on the smaller end, &amp; are responsible for the &quot;branching&quot; that you'll see people talking about. </p>
<p>When a body part is amputated, blood vessels that have been severed will be sutured, or sewn closed. However, because our body is incredibly adaptive, the site of the amputation will undergo a process called angiogenesis. This is when new blood vessels, or pathways, are created as an alternative route. This can happen as a result of a lot of things, such as blood clots, amputations, cholesterol build up, etc. </p>
<p>Edit: blood vessels encompass many different types of pathways for blood to move through, tried to keep it simple for the sake of eli5. Arterioles are doing a lot of the branching, which I just referred to as blood vessels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or trauma to the area. Fun story! I had a cartilage piercing, got hit by a car (whole 'nother story), it got ripped out, let it all heal, pierced the same spot (don't recommend btw, way worse). Anyways, my poor ear had seen some shit.. To cope with all this healing it had to do, it built itself an extensive network of new blood vessels. Now, if it is even the teensiest bit cold or annoyed, that ear turns brick red, and my other ear is totally normal, going &quot;wtf..?&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, sometimes veins an arteries can go crazy without trauma! Like you, I have a complex network of blood vessels around my knee which makes the skin look purple. I’ve had it my entire life and thought it was a birthmark until last year when it decided to grow. So I had a 25cm venous malformation in my leg that I needed surgery for. It caused immense swelling and pain. These things can also happen in people’s lungs or brains (leading to aneurysms). Though I’m pain free now, there’s a likely chance it will continue to grow and create new networks and I’ll have to another procedure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you know this or just making this eli5; but arteries are blood vessels, the ones that branch out are just in an eli5 sense; just smaller versions of the main arteries (with some structural differences).</p>
<p>Sorry, it's just bugging me so had to mention this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Arteries are blood vessels too. So are veins, which are the large counterpart to arteries. They're all vessels for the carriage of blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further hijack. Arteries usually do not flow directly into veins. But rather, they're connected through arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Think of them as ladders, connected with many rungs. If you shorten the ladder, it's functionality isn't really impaired, except that it's shorter.</p>
<p>Any localised defect in perfusion can either resolve through angiogenesis, where new tiny blood vessels are made, or it dies and falls off, through necrosis. Fun fact, tumors use the process of angiogenesis to order the body to make new blood vessels to support their growth. Back in the old days, if left untreated, those vessels could reach an impressive caliber and number. That's why cancer is called cancer - it looked like the underside of a crab with all those blood vessels representing legs.</p>
<p>But we do, on occasion, connect a healthy, high pressure artery onto a flimsy, low pressure vein, creating a fistula. This is done to support hemodialysis, where we use machines to filter our blood instead of our kidneys. At first, the vein can't take the high pressure, so it balloons up. But as the fistula matures, it becomes stronger and more rigid, that's when we can poke it to get the hemodialysis going.</p></div>		</li>
