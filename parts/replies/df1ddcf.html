			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll help. This is how I'd explain it to my 5 year old.</p>
<p>Evolution is a work in progress. It does a lot of trial and error to figure out what works best.</p>
<p>So far, it seems to think that arches on our feet help us move best. When our feet are curved, they're a little like springs, and it helps us run (very important, because that's supposed to be how we get food!) and makes walking more comfortable and easier on our body. If our feet were flat, there would be no &quot;give,&quot; and we'd thump harder on the ground. That would be rough on our joints over the 80 years we walk around.</p>
<p>So no. In short, distributing our weight evenly would not be better because it would have more impact on our joints and the rest of our body over the course of our lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good comment, but it is believed (I don't know if there's a scientific concensus or not) that our ancestors engaged in something called persistence hunting. This means that rather than actively chase after prey, early humans likely followed their target at a rather leisurely pace over a day or so, pursuing the fleeing animal until it ran out of endurance and stopped in its tracks from exhaustion. We see this type of hunting in &quot;primitive&quot; African tribes. So no, humans didn't need to run to get food, only walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important consideration is that most surfaces we walk on aren't perfectly flat, so by having a flexible foot that puts most weight on the front and back points and is able to bend according to the environment, we're able to distribute our weight better, and balance better, on the uneven surfaces that we spend most of our time walking on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught the importance of feet being able to make all sorts of adjustments to maintain balance and stability for walking, standing and adjusting to a variety of surfaces and terrains. </p>
<p>In the anatomy of the feet there are actually 3 arches (the middle, and across the 'ball' and the outside length), and 26 bones, so they are far more complex than (I had) often assumed. </p>
<p>I figure the arches assist in the structure of the foot to be able to adapt and move to balance and move our weight across different terrains...</p>
<p>I've pretty much just repeated everything above! :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that the bicondylar angle is due to the shape of our feet. You see the same angle in <em>A. sediba</em>, which has a totally different foot structure (and proposed gait by Dr. Jeremy DeSilva) to ours. The bicondylar angle is thought to be due to aligning your center of gravity over your knees. </p>
<p>Edit: Idk if you find this interesting, but the class I'm taking was originally taught by the man who discovered those footprints, Andrew Hill, while he was working with Leakey. He passed away recently, but his memory lives on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hmm maybe I didn't say it properly but I meant more like the formation of our feet has probably been affected by the angle/bipedalism in general. </p>
<p>And that's pretty cool! I'm more of an archaeology student but all the sub fields are interesting to me. Thanks for sharing! </p></div>		</li>
