			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. The cooking temperature may be enough to break the bonds for the bacteria and not enough energy to break the bonds for the waste material. Temperatures that successfully break that bond may also break the bonds for your food (i.e. burn it). So if you have a piece of bacteria-infected meat you might be able to cook it and destroy any live bacteria but still get sick from the waste product left behind. If you cooked it enough to get rid of anything toxic, you'd also ruin the meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question was already asked in another ELI5, I don't remember the user that answered but basically </p>
<p>Cooking an egg will make it unable to produce a chicken  but if you are alergic to egg you're still allergic to cooked egg. </p>
<p>Same goes with bacteria, if the bacteria are not dangerous anymore for you, molecule they produced are still there, sometimes for the best (beer, cheese etc...) and sometimes we talk about Toxin (i.e. cooking a roten steak wont turn out into a fresh one) </p>
<p>For medical application they are technique to remove the remaining molecules after sterilization. </p></div>		</li>
