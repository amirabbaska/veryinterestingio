<p>During REM sleep our body is at its most relaxed and muscles that normally support the throat and tongue relax as well and collapse the airway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep tech here (score sleep studies, occasionally teach), this is some of the story.   </p>
<p>The full issues are not fully understood. Turns out many factors account for snoring and sleep apnea (snoring is basically a very mild version of sleep apnea).  Specifically that although sleep stages (like REM) does affect how relaxed the muscles are many other factors do too including:   </p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>:<br />
We see different rates of events in different ages.  For instance we know that there's an age related affect to this.  Young kids, no matter the size of their necks or throat have a tendency to not get this collapse at all.  </p>
<p><strong>Sex</strong> :<br />
Pre-menopausal women also seem to have some protection that men their age don't have. Once menopause hits though, their rates seem to approach that of men (so the thinking is that estogen has some protective effects).</p>
<p><strong>Sleep Stage</strong>:<br />
The different stages (not just REM) have differing levels of muscle activation in the throat.  Although REM is the most ‘relaxed’, other stages also are more relaxed than wake and will have a greater tendency to also collapse (than wake).  REM though, also has the fact that this stage also has <em>active</em> skeletal muscle relaxation across the whole body. So this means, that aside from the throat, the chest muscles are also atonic (i.e. completely paralyzed).  And anything that makes breathing harder will make these events more likely to happen. </p>
<p><strong>Breathing Stability and/or Arousability</strong>:  </p>
<p>The ease in which someone wakes up, can affect this. When someone’s throat relaxes, sometimes the bodies’ response is to make the throat muscle more firm. However if the person wakes up too easily, this means that they will wake up before the body has had a chance to firm up the throat muscles, which would stabilize – if uninterrupted -- the breathing.  But the constant arousal can block this process from occurring.  </p>
<p><strong>Other factors</strong>:<br />
-Some of it is that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25317087" target="_blank">fluid displacement</a> seems to collect much more in the neck area during sleep (when laying down) in some people.<br />
-there’s some data about brain chemistry (but I don’t know too much about this one)  </p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Defining+Phenotypic+Causes+of+Obstructive+Sleep+Apnea+Identification+of+Novel+Therapeutic+Targets" target="_blank">here's</a> a great paper that explain some of these concepts about the different type/cause of sleep apnea.  </p>
<p>Edit: this list isn't exhaustive, just it is most of the major factors.  </p></div>		</li>
