			<div class="markdown"><p>Viral vectors are ok candidates for gene therapies, but they tend to be the most non-specific option. Additionally, CRISPR might be convenient in some instances, but ZNFs and TALENs have been around for awhile now and are closer to being used clinically. All of these have their own drawbacks, and all can have unintended consequences. For example, TALENs are huge as compared to ZNFs, and both are pretty expensive. CRISPR introduces breaks, and therefore can produce unintended deletions or mutations (the others I mentioned have this problem as well, though). Non-specificity is also an issue for these, but less so than rAAVs (recombinant viral vector). </p>
<p>I think they are currently using a ZNF method to try and deliver gene therapy for liver disease. I'm a geneticist so I don't know details there, but here's a general  article: <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/human-has-been-injected-gene-editing-tools-cure-his-disabling-disease-here-s-what-you" target="_blank">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/human-has-been-injected-gene-editing-tools-cure-his-disabling-disease-here-s-what-you</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>~not really~ You're still missing literally the entire basis of transcription regulation in eukaryotes. People think if you have the DNA you have the physical features, it's simply just not true. Like my friend above said, so many things would be cured already if this was the case.</p></div>		</li>
