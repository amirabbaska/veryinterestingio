			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Too many variables. People's basal metabolic rare varies, you generate heat from digesting food and exercise. Differing amounts of clothing (insulation). Your sweat production constantly varies. </p>
<p>Another way of thinking is that there is a very wide range of ideal ambient temperature, because our bodies have mechanisms to cope with sub-freezing to hotter than 37C, and still keep your important organs at s constant 37C.</p></div>		</li>
