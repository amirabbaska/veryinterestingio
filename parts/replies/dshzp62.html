			<div class="markdown"><p>Reddit gold is like a trophy system for the person that gets it and a revenue stream for reddit. People that do something that somebody likes can be awarded gold as a way of recognition.</p>
<p>When person A post something that person B likes, person B can spend irl money to buy reddit gold for person A. Person A gets benefits for having gold gifted to him.</p>
<p>This creates an incentive to post gold worthy things, improving reddit while allowing reddit to make money to support continued operation of reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a CPU, like every other electronic device. The binary code contains identifying information as to its type and addresses for where it needs to go, and the CPU sends it on its way. </p>
<p>Here's a series of videos describing how such systems work, breaking the topic down quite well if you have an interest in computer science: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!! I'm a visual learner so these will help a lot. If I could trouble you one last time, do the old school &quot;tube&quot; televisions interpret signals any differently than modern ones? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>usually it works like this:</p>
<p>Let's say you have the following byte: <em>10010101</em></p>
<p>There is a specialised chip that reads this and <em>decodes</em> it which means that the chip is programmed to know what signals send so the pixels will behave  based on the data read (the byte) . For example that byte might mean that the first pixel must be yellow, hence the chip will do its thing to paint the pixel yellow which might involve communications or interactions with other chips.  of course to form a picture you have to do this for every pixel and often 60 times a second, so this has to take place in no time.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that it's just a rough cheap, extremely general example of how the bits (0s and 1s) are <em>decoded</em> (which was what you called distributed) but by no means it's the specifics of how nowadays screens work. Also the so called specialised chips are <em>Integrated Circuits</em> which might be CPUs engineered to perform efficiently as to show video.</p>
<p>the how these chips do this it's an awesome thing to study, tho. If you feel interested go and read about <strong>Digital Logic</strong>. believe it or not that's the basics of how screen works today. </p>
<p>hope this gives you a better inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before you even get the 1s and 0s, your TV must decode the 1s and 0s from the received radio signal (either from coaxial cable or antenna). Basically radio signals are shaped in certain ways to encode 1s and 0s. The TV has fancy electronics to figure out which bits it's receiving.</p></div>		</li>
