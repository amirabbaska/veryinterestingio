			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how to interpret it either.</p>
<p>I think the tachyon is moving from right to left but you can't see it approaching, of course. The instant you can observe it is when it passes you by (which, in the GIF is the point where it splits in two).</p>
<p>The blue part is you seeing a delayed version of the tachyon (as it was in the past) approaching. Hence the blue shift. It appears to move backwards because of the way the light arrives (it arrives blue shifted and in reverse order because it takes less time for the more recent light to arrive than the more distant light).</p>
<p>The red part is the tachyon departing. Which even though is moving faster than the speed of light, it still is emitting light behind it (massively redshifted light).</p>
<p>The write up for the GIF can be found on the Wikipedia page for tachyons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that its mass is the square root of a negative number. The reason for this is because of the equation <em>E = (mc^2) / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>v</em> is greater than <em>c</em>, then the denominator of this equation is an imaginary number. The total energy (probably) needs to be a real number, and the only way to get a real number from this equation for a tachyon is if <em>m</em> is also imaginary. This also implies that a tachyon can't be at rest in <em>any</em> frame of reference, since it has an imaginary rest mass (and therefore its rest energy isn't a real number).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is it more likely for the mass to be an imaginary number than for the energy to be an imaginary number?</p></div>		</li>
