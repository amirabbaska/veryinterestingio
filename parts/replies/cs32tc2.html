<p>I would attribute much of this to a better understanding of physics concerning lights, the eye, and photography works.</p>
<p>Around the 15th-16th century many artists played with the idea of the <a href="http://www.oil-painting-techniques.com/flemish-painting.html" target="_blank">7-layer flemish technique.</a> This tried to accomplish some of the warmth of skin and it's translucent properties. Blushing wasn't just adding red on top of cheeks like applying make-up but rather adding a build-up of blood under the skin layer. Look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens" target="_blank">Peter Paul Rubens</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio" target="_blank">Caravaggio.</a> This allowed artists to get closer to realism, but they were still lacking some important knowledge.</p>
<p>It wasn't until around the late 18th and early 19th century began to understand better the science. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color" target="_blank">Color</a> as light is Additive while Color in Pigment is subtractive. How the eye and cameras process and receive colors is pretty much the opposite from how we paint. When various wavelengths of light are <strong>added</strong> together they come closer to white light, which contains all wavelengths (i.e. think <a href="http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_500/MI0003/237/MI0003237416.jpg?partner=allrovi.com" target="_blank">Pink Floyd and the prism</a> or as a child when you see a rainbow. Light is passing through a prism and &quot;splits&quot; into the various colors because white light contained all those wavelengths.) Contrast that with your finger-paintings. When you mix Red pigment and Blue pigment you see Purple, but if you start to add Yellow pigment and it will begin to turn Brown. The more pigment mixed together the darker and more brown the product. This became important as color printing became more popular and we switched to using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model" target="_blank">CMYK</a> (<strong>C</strong>yan, <strong>M</strong>agenta, <strong>Y</strong>ellow, and Blac<strong>K</strong>) for better subtractive color processing. But much of CMYK printing is based around the process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone" target="_blank">Halftoning</a>. Essentially as technology progressed and we began to understand how we perceive light around us, people had to adapt.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism" target="_blank">Impressionism</a> and more importantly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism" target="_blank">Pointillism</a> were the first steps in experimenting with this new knowledge. Think of modern printers using dpi (dots per inch). Pointillism is like an enlarged version of how a printer will paint dots in a line close together. This mixing of the CMYK dots in various <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5-DBYrYHIQI/T6lBO9eVHII/AAAAAAAAAD8/BaZYjrYqzwY/s1600/ColorPicker.jpg" target="_blank">percentages</a> is how we get all the other colors in the spectrum.</p>
<p>Pointillism help then influence the Pop Art movements like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein" target="_blank">Roy Lichtenstein</a> to bring screen-printing (remember our CMYK and Halftone processes) in as a method of making <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/Warhol-Campbell_Soup-1-screenprint-1968.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;Art&quot;</a> and not just used for commercialism.</p>
<p>Then we get to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism" target="_blank">Photorealism</a> movement with artists such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Close" target="_blank">Chuck Close</a> who began to take the principles behind the printing process and apply them to <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Chuck_Close_2.jpg" target="_blank">paintings</a>. Hopefully you can see how this knowledge of physics and technology has helped artists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with what you have said, I think its important to note that photo realism wasn't even the goal for the classical painters. Without photography and video, art was used to tell stories and pass along information. Hyper photo realism is far too tedious and time consuming too be used as a medium of information like that. The role paintings play in our society has fundamentally changed since the classics were produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this, or the others above,  are really the correct answer to OP's question.   I think painters in the renaissance were trying to paint as realistically as they possibly could,  which is why they even disected human bodies in order to study the musculature and skeletal structure.  </p>
<p>The famous ones also had helpers to make paints and do the tedious work for them,  so that wasn't the problem.  </p>
<p>And it wasn't that they didn't have cameras.   These painters dedicated their entire lives to their craft,  and spent endless hours studying the way things looked.  If you have a pear in a bowl right in front of you,  why do you need a photograph of it?   If you have a live model posing in a  chair for you,  who needs a photograph of that model?  Can a photo look more realistic than the actual model? </p>
<p>So all of these answers seem incorrect to me.  From what I remember of my art history class,  it took centuries for painters to make small discoveries,  like that mountains in a landscape look blurrier and blurrier the further away they are, and that shadowing can be used to create the impression of three dimensions.   For some reason the things that seem ridiculously obvious to us now were simply not obvious back then.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your last paragraph hits it but you completely miss how working from a photograph gives such a huge advantage over working from life (and how that strongly connects with your entire point). A very popular tool to use for photorealistic drawings is a grid - you can't exactly do that with a live model. Additionally, like you said about mountains - artists working from life are not only dealing with the deceptiveness of the human eye+mind, but they are also dealing with a 3-dimensional plane and transferring that into 2-dimensions. A camera does the work for you in terms of capturing exactly what is there (instead of what you <em>think</em> is there, one of the most fundamental hurdles an artist has to overcome) and also reduces it to a 2-D image for you - no prior understanding of how objects/light works in 3 dimensions work or how to effectively convey that on paper required. From there it's <em>only</em> about copying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A photograph captures a precise moment in time at an exact angle. Drawing from life is completely different from copying a picture. </p>
<p>When you draw a model in real life they move a bit. They need to take breaks and don't always end up in the exact same position. When you are drawing them you are constantly moving and seeing things from a slightly different angle/perspective. Unless you are in a completely artificially lit room any light from the sun will change the lighting on the subject over the course of a few hours. None of this happens when you draw from a photo. You can literally work at copying a photo for months and always be drawing the exact same image. A photo flattens the subject out. You no longer need to read the way light and shadow create volume across a surface. And the most obvious being that a lot of people just straight up trace the photos. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A photograph is inherently easier to draw from. You look at a model with binocular vision and use your artistic skill to transfer that to a 2D medium. A photograph does this work for you. </p>
<p>What you're saying is similar to saying &quot;Who needs to trace a picture when you can just look at it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!</p>
<p>In fact the same goes for the depiction of Egyptians in tombs -- shown sideways and yet with both legs showing. This was because back then, the images were not intended to be simply nice pictures, but each represented one of the people who would accompany the dead pharaoh to the afterlife, and so each had to be shown being &quot;complete&quot; with two legs, two arms, one head etc. The goal was not decorative, it was more like accounting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of those super bright impressionistic paintings that popped up in the 1800's and 1900's? Most of those weren't possible until this type of pigment was invented. Da Vinci and Caravaggio didn't have them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the paint tube was invented sometime in the 1800s, so if an artist wanted to paint a landscape from life they could go outside and do so without having to schlep a bunch of big buckets with them. But of course when you're painting an outdoor landscape, the light source (sun) is continuously moving--there's a noticeable difference in lighting every 15-20 minutes or so, which means you need to paint quickly, using mostly colors and highlight/shadow techniques to give a general <em>impression</em> of your subject.</p></div>		</li>
