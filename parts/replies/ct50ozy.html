			<div class="markdown"><p>my EE professor worked at NASA qualifying flight hardware and code, they still fly 486's because it costs a lot of money and time to qualify hardware, so there's already a huge time lag, but more importantly it has to be radiation hardened and robust.</p>
<p>the radiation tends to cause twinning defects in lattice structures on modern chips that are made at a smaller size that can completely kill transistors.  Not to mention the extreme temperatures and shocks they are rated for.</p>
<p>Simply put they fly stuff they know will work and program to it, even if they had some 20MP professional camera they wouldn't be uploading many photos at the 1kb/s they get from pluto.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I took the first result I saw, but it looks like the Casio Exilim Pro EX-F1 is a high-end consumer camera which can do 1/40,000th of a second.</p>
<p>I have no idea how fast exposure would be needed to freeze-frame Pluto at that distance, at 14km/s. Assuming the speed is relative to Pluto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yikes, that is fast. I am still not sure who that would look in low light situation. I would assume it would need a shutter of a few seconds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An exposure of Pluto at 1/40,000 second would not show anything but black. Fast shutter speeds don't matter when there isn't enough light to make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>The exposures were likely several seconds long at minimum. tremendous speeds aren't as impactful when dealing with tremendous distances as well.</p></div>		</li>
