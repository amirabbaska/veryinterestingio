			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw, man. The problem here is that Shakespeare is taught as literature, rather than what it was: community theater. Shakespeare was never supposed to be the boring, stuffy monolith that academics have made him into. In his day, he was crude, silly, a little bit of an asshole, and a public sensation. If he were alive today, he'd probably be writing satirical pieces about Brexit or some shit. The hundreds of plays he wrote (most of which have been lost because, hey, he didn't write them to be read hundreds of years later) set the stage for modern storytelling, modern language even. His &quot;fantasy language&quot; made pompous English literature accessible to he general public, and practically invented modern English by revolutionizing spoken word. As for the characters lacking depth, a lot of that was a satirical comment on how he saw society-- everyone is stupid and looking out for their own interests, even though their interests aren't really that important in the big picture. That shit was groundbreaking for his era, and people ate it up.</p>
<p>Shakespearean history is so fun and fascinating, but students end up hating it because academics make him out to be some posh aristocrat. I don't blame you for being annoyed by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally an answer that makes sense.</p>
<p>I would have been much more interested in his work had they presented it that way. But it's not, they force you to dredge through Midsummer, R&amp;J, MacBeth, and Hamlet, while attempting to draw connections with the world today. It just doesn't work.</p>
<p>I learned nothing about his literary advances aside from adding a few new words to our vocabulary. Had we been taught that it was satire, meant to parody life during the era, I probably would have got it. But everyone seems to think that every line in his plays has some absurdly deep meaning that apparently warrants 5 minutes of discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are never supposed to interpret art through someone else's work (unless it too is art). You look first at the art, draw your own conclusions, and perhaps argue your case.</p>
<p>Don't let intellectuals describe the world for you. Experience and describe the world for yourself, and if you dare share your observations with them. Only then should you listen to what they say. Otherwise you rob yourself of any free thought or individuality in your connection to the piece. You will forever think what others thought of it, and at best your most unique thoughts will only be criticisms of the thoughts of others.</p>
<p>You will never touch the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His plays were full of sex, violence, puns.. He'd fit right in here. Consider Titus Andronicus - the Queen's sons (Demetrius and Charon) are ticked off at Aaron for sleeping with the Queen :</p>
<p>Demetrius: Villain, what hast thou done?
Aaron : that which thou canst not undo.
Charon : thou hast undone our mother.
Aaron : Villain, I have done thy mother.</p>
<p>Look at how that sounds. That was the original &quot;OP's mom&quot; joke - boom.  That's still a Mic drop moment. Shakespeare is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a lot of his comedies are heavy-handed satire. Even the dramas have some puns thrown in. For example, Othello uses the phrase &quot;the beast with two backs&quot;, which totally refers to sex (a line hilariously followed by the insult &quot;You are... a senator&quot;). I think part of the problem is that this sort of comedy goes right over a lot of high school teachers' heads. Find someone who's done in-depth research on Shakespeare. None of them take him as seriously as high school teachers seem to.</p>
<p>Personally, my favorites are Twelfth Night (seen in the modern adaptation She's the Man) and Much Ado About Nothing (exemplified by the Kenneth Branagh movie). It's worth noting that Hamlet's &quot;To be or not to be&quot; monologue is literally him considering suicide, so it's not as out-of-touch as you might think. If you were to put <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=hamlet&amp;Act=3&amp;Scene=1&amp;Scope=scene" target="_blank">that monologue</a> in modern language, it'd almost sound like one Hannah's edgier tapes from 13 Reasons Why. People just don't know how to teach it right, IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, when I took Shakespeare I expected what you described as boring and monolithic. However what I found is that the public school system (at least in the US) is just not allowed to go into all the penis jokes, fart jokes, poop jokes, vagina jokes, sexist jokes, and the other inappropriate things he did so cleverly. So when I experienced Romeo and Juliet for the first time in high school, I was bored to tears. But fast forward to Love's Labors Lost in college and I enjoyed that much more.</p>
<p>But I think you made the point that keeps him in the scope of Literature yourself. While Homer and the Epic of Gilgamesh are the oldest pieces of Literature we know of (Beowulf being up there too), Shakespeare began to get people interested (at least in England) in writing- be it plays, poetry, or prose.</p>
<p>And that is an important milestone in Literary history. So they keep teaching him, and much to his probable chagrin, the diction hasn't aged well and takes further study. Which is especially hard on his comedic efforts because it has been said that comedy is like dissection- when you dissect it you know more about it but it dies in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good answer (and the ones above are great) is that Shakespeare is the ultimate exercise in complex reading comprehension. It's super difficult to discern what's actually being said sentence for sentence, you need to study the words, look them up, rearrange them to make sense, etc. </p>
<p>I took several college classes dedicated solely to breaking down and understanding Shakespeare (I was a theatre major) and I couldn't have dreamed the advancement they would lend to my all around reading comprehension. It's like going back to playing a video game on Easy after going through it on Survival mode. </p>
<p>So that's an added benefit of studying Shakespeare. </p>
<p>I wish they didn't pick the shittiest of his plays to teach in high school. There are so many that are better than the popular stuff (The Tempest, The Merchant of Venice, A Winter's Tale, Two Gentleman of Verona, Twelfth Night, on and on) that actually paint vivid characters and heartbreaking scenarios. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people &quot;defending&quot; Shakespeare are defending him in factually inaccurate ways*, so here's a blunt assessment from an English major and former teacher:</p>
<ul>
<li>He wrote a <em>ton</em> of stuff. Nearly 40 plays that we're sure are (mostly) his work. And his buddies put a collection of them together after he died which makes it easy.</li>
<li>His work has variety: all the way from low comedies (the sitcoms of his time) to great tragedies that reduced people to tears. </li>
<li>His work also spans stories based on history, stories based on myths and legends, and stuff he appears to have made up (though very little of that last one)</li>
<li>He was massively popular in his time. He was not some weird loner who sat in his bedroom brooding on the perfect sentence. He was a working writer, actor and business man, who revised his plays if the gags didn't work and added topical jokes and references. His life was more like a standup/improv comedian than a pure literary &quot;writer&quot;.</li>
<li>He has cool plots: ghosts, murders, political assassinations, hilarious crap with identical twins and girls who dress as boys, fairies and witches and so on. All of the stuff that we like to watch on TV right now. </li>
<li>And, you know, fart jokes and bad puns. Nothing is off limits. Bonus: the puns help us understand how words were pronounced back then.</li>
<li>We know almost nothing about his private life, (not even his birthday) so we get to project all kinds of shit onto him and imagine whatever we want. </li>
<li>This unfortunately includes people who like to imagine conspiracy theories because he was a poor boy from the country so they can't see how he can have been so brilliant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>* No, he did not invent lots of common English words or sayings. This belief is caused by a failure to understand the workings of the Oxford English Dictionary. Though a lot of his neat phrases have become clich√©s.</p></div>		</li>
