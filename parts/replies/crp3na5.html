			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is correct, just gonna simplify: China maintains their currency low becuase when they get paid in U.S Dollars for producing goods(ipods,shirts,everything in America,etc...) The Chinese dont exchange those Dollars in Yuan, which means that the value of the dollar stays high, and the value of the Yuan stays low.</p>
<p>Why is that important:
The producers of goods in china, keep getting paid in dollars, which as of now is worth more then the Yuan, so they love it and want to produce as much as possible. The people who suffer are the working class in china that are making pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p>What will happen:
Sooner or later the Chinese will have to turn all their dollars into Yuan, which means the U.S dollar, and other currencies that are used to buy chinese products(every devoloped country, pretty much) will loose its value and the Yuan will rise extremely from its current value. Wich Will bring unpredictable reactions in the economy.
Hope I added some context</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most important reasons is that China is holding enormous amount of US Dollars, in fact i believe China hold the most US Dollars as foreign reserve. </p>
<p>Chinese government keep buying USD because it could not afford to let USD drop in value, or else it will lose so much purchasing power (to buy foreign goods).</p>
<p>China in fact has become the largest stakeholder in the value of USD outside of US, oddly enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't understand is, no one is actually keeping a tally of how much the Chinese have in &quot;usd&quot; right? Isn't this just an imaginary number that's sitting on a computer? What prevents the U.S. From saying something like &quot;nope, deals off, we don't owe you shit anymore&quot;. Like wouldn't keeping this payment in some physical form like gold or something be more &quot;safe&quot;?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Demanding higher wages isnt really what causes it. The fact that so many things are bought in chine means lots of Yaun is needed on the currency market. That means the Yaun gets stronger. Which means that the chinese get more buying power. Which means that they wont do shitty jobs anymore.</p>
<p>So the chinese government prints a fuckton of yuan to make sure that the money stays worthless and their people dont have buying power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you seen how not westernized China is? Do a little bit of research  about &quot;Chinese Culture&quot;. There isnt one. Theres over 150 different ethnic groups in China, all with their own histories, many differing languages, and people living in mountain villages, there's Chinese cultures. This is largely due to China's lack of nationalism (the essence of western culture). Beijing is westernized- China is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuan is not worthless. Even the Japanese yen, a currency so weak they print 10000 yen notes, can buy all of that stuff. Just because they keep the value of the individual yuan down doesn't mean that Chinese can't still buy stuff. It just means that the currency remains at its lower value, which provides trade benefits to China.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let me rephrase what funky_duck is saying, as a Chinese leader.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh hey. Our people are making money and want to spend it on things. But we want foreigners to build more factories in our country <em>instead</em>. Therefore we will intentionally destroy the purchasing power of our people so that we can keep them in wage slavery perpetually. Go China!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a lot of people tend to ignore when it comes to China is how much the Chinese government promotes local Chinese companies. Yes, we always hear about Sony, Apple, Google, etc having their phones manufactured in China, but it overlooks the fact that the factory itself is owned by a Taiwanese or Chinese company.</p>
<p>You can look at examples like social networks. Facebook and Twitter are banned in China, the easy culprit being freedom of speech. The oft overlooked reason is that it has sprouted HUGE companies in China with their own versions of these sites. With China's huge population to prop these companies up, it creates a domestic economic ecosystem.</p>
<p>The spat over Yahoo and Alipay is another great example of this. Short version is that Yahoo had a huge stake in Alibaba. Alipay is Alibaba's checkout/payment system. The Chinese government made a ruling that no foreigners could have any ownership in payment systems in order to continue operating. Alibaba, in conforming to this ruling, split Alipay off as a new company, causing Yahoo to lose a huge chunk of value in its ownership stake of Alibaba.</p>
<p>This is create huge amounts of money in China and is why companies like Alibaba group just went public on the NYSE, or Tencent owns Epic Games and Riot Games.</p>
<p>It's actually really difficult for foreign companies to operate in China without the proper connections. If you're registered with an owner that is even say, from Hong Kong, authorities will show up at your office weekly to &quot;<em>check your papers</em>&quot;. Chinese citizen? Be surprised if they show up at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but there's the other side, where-by creating more money with no increase in spending power, China is expanding the availability of money to the masses. It doesn't make sense to increase the spending power of the yuan abroad, when 65% of the country only has like 100 yuan. </p>
<p>Remember that supply-and-demand economics in China are regulated by the government (after-all, they make nearly everything on home soil). Unless there is literally a shortage of some good (let's say motorcycles), and China cannot get the materials to produce said motorcycles, China is able to manipulate the market to keep motorcycles affordable (Or import it, as someone pointed out, cause China ain't poor.). This goes for all the essentials: Food, water, appliances, housing, and education.</p>
<p>While I don't think the Chinese regime is all sunshine and rainbows, their approach is very utilitarian. I can't fault them for that.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix:</strong></p>
<p>Economics is not a game with right and wrong answers (though people love to be ideological about fiscal issues). The important questions revolve around goals. China's goal is not buying power. China with American or European buying power is an ecological apocalypse.</p>
<p>Their goals are stable and equitable growth through the bottom rungs of society. a) Because the Party wants to stay in power b) to keep the country from falling into destitution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, let me try to explain it differently:</p>
<p>So the US buys stuff from China giving them dollars; if the amount of yuan in the country were to remain unchanged suddenly they would be worth more dollars (we can ignore the exact process why this happens for the sake of this explanation). Now what China does is print more money to avoid the yuan from increasing in price. In a way this reduces the purchasing power of the Chinese, but only in dollars, not in yuans (this remains unchanged). This is good for 2 reasons, first the Chinese are less likely to import stuff (buy from Amazon for example) if the yuan is not worth enough, so they buy Chinese goods promoting their own economy. The other good thing about this system is that wages are kept the same so China getting all this money from foreign companies doesn't increase the costs of producing in China for this companies making it compete &quot;fairly&quot; (for some definition of fairly).</p>
<p>The end result is something called a trade imbalance, the US is basically trading at a loss with China, because dollars go out to China never to return (again, this is a simplification) and this is &quot;bad&quot; and therefore goes against the WTO rules. The reason China can get away with this and, for example, Brazil can't is that the WTO can't punish them without disrupting the global economy, so in a way, China is too big to fail.</p>
<p>Another country that sometimes violates the WTO principles is the US (though it does it less), the reason it gets away with that? Too big to fail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>China has to do something with those dollars. How is it beneficial for them to hoard all this currency while it loses value from inflation?</p>
<p>China has to spend it somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do - in fact, the whole world and their central banks has been lowering their own currencies to stay competitive in the global markets in the face of a weak global economy.  From what my lay market eyes see, it's been a race to the bottom with some currencies it feels like sometimes.  The US's economic woes are not so bad so the US central bank has been telegraphing the markets that, hey, we are getting ready to tighten the monetary supply so that there's plenty of time for the market to react accordingly instead of it freaking out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either they are telegraphing, or bluffing for time. If the Fed raises rates the U.S. government budget becomes increasingly consumed by interest payments. But if rates stay low forever, eventually the currency will be abandoned by international trading partners.</p>
<p>Best of both worlds is to keep rates low while leading everyone to believe that they won't be kept low forever. Which is the Fed's current stance. Don't raise rates until absolutely necessary, and in the meantime keep giving new excuses about why it has to wait.</p></div>		</li>
