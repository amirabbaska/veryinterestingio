			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking... My work is closely related to the hardware and sites of all  carriers in the densest region of the US. 5G is not &quot;right around the corner&quot; as some suggest. People don't realize how stupidly massive the infrastructure of data transfer in the US is. If you live anywhere urban or suburban, you are likely not more than a few miles from a large carrier site. You are probably less than a mile from some sort of tower or small cell booster. If you're in a city, I bet you can see one from any given spot if you know what to look for.</p>
<p>Hardware changes for just one site requires coordination from a shocking number of services and contractors, each with a busy schedule to begin with. Upgrades have to compete with regular servicing and replacement, not to mention the logistical difficulty of coordinating lots of people and money and warehouses and equipment.</p>
<p>Basically what I'm trying to say is that the transition will take a long time and it hasn't even really started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah :3 I suppose I would rather already have a 5G phone when the networks start updating than upgrading my phone because the network updated. Thank you for your help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The international committees are only trying to finalize the standards of 5G. There are still a lot of time until we get them in our phones. Of course companies like Quallcomm have started designing 5G modules based on guesstimate standards to get the lead in the race. But still, they are just designing infrastructure modules yet, not cheap consumer products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, same with home internet. Sure you can be paying for that $200 a month (or whatever) internet for 1 gig up, 100mb down... but will they have it in place? Probably not, unless you're in a very populated city.</p>
<p>My cousins were paying for that high end, and kept complaining they were only getting half. My dad looked into the infrastructure of their area and found that it was only capable of half, even though the company advertised to them they could get the higher rate and took their money for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that fall under false advertising at that point? </p>
<p>I know a lot of people get mad when they don't get the speeds they paid for, but generally that's why they advertise as &quot;up to&quot;, but in this case even saying 'up to' would be false cause the infrastructure could never deliver.</p></div>		</li>
