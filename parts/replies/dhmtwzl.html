			<div class="markdown"><p>Air Traffic Controller here.  It can't be done. There are too many variables.  I'd list them all out individually to you, but I don't have a year of free time to type. But think about this: you want to eliminate the human element? The pilots are humans. The people that operate the support equipment are humans. The people that operate ground vehicles on the airport are humans. The techs that repair the navaids, arresting gear, airport lighting are humans.  The grass mowers, painters, emergency response, crash crew, trouble shooters, all humans. And any one of them could have a non-standard operational request for a specific situation that may have never happened before.  So exactly how do you plan on writing a code to handle a situation that's has never before arisen and no-one had planned for? We use automation as much as we can, and believe me, we love it, but automation can not take into account things that it hasn't been programmed to account for. There are thousands and thousands of rules that we have to follow, and many of them are open to interpretation on some level, and these rules can intersect with other rules to create or handle any possible combination of factors or variables, and you simply cannot take it all into account preemptively.  ATC requires fluidity and flexibility, interpretation, visual acuity, awareness, and responsiveness, most of which are things that you can't code for.  Go ahead and read the 7110.65 FAA ATC manual, then come back and ask this question. Then realise there's also dozens more manuals and charts and publications that you have to take into account as well: the IFR and VFR supplements, the FLIP, General Planning, AIM, high route charts, low route charts, Area planning, facility manual, etc etc etc.  Some rules are only conditional to some airports, every airport had it's own quirks and unique procedures, how do you code for that. What do you do when a C5 has to do High power turns, but the high power turn up area is closed. And then, when you figure out where he can do them, turns out he's blocking the route the follow me vehicle needs to take to get to the taxiway for the next arrival? Then when you figure out an alternate route for the follow me to take, the driver gets confused, goes the wrong way, and ends up nose to nose with another taxiing aircraft? Then a landing aircraft vacated the runway on the wrong taxiway and blocks the vehicle in? Now the only route for the vehicle to get out of the way is to cross behind the C5 that's doing high power engine turns? Then an aircraft on short final declares an emergency? You simply cannot code for every possible situation.  Now the other part of your question, why is it stressful? Because you have literally thousands of lives in your hands every single day, and all it takes is one misheard transmission, or one vehicle to go left instead of right, or one small flock of birds at the departure end that you didn't spot, and hundreds of people could die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I had gold to give you, I would. This, people, right here, is why Aviation is legendary for having cool heads. Listen to the ATC some day during emergencies. Listen to the pilot that landed in the Hudson. And everyone lived. He and the controller spoke fast, calm, and conveyed the critical information, when it was needed, as it was needed. It is stressful -- and everyone knows what's at stake. </p>
<p>Some days it's a comedy of errors and the controllers and pilots just can't help but laugh. The people out of O'Hare are well known for their, achem, directness. And any pilot who hears another losing his cool, especially to a controller, almost always makes an effort to thank the controller and say they're doing a great job... and the guy who didn't keep his cool... well, fuck him, and sometimes people will say as much. There is no other industry I have found with the level of professionalism they have. Consider what they deal with, and how hard it is, and then realize... they always get it done. Pilots almost always say &quot;g'day&quot; on the frequency change. That's what you're flying with when you get in a plane, or climb in the cockpit: The very best. Every time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gradual process. It follows the same process automation has taken for the past 100 years. You slowly replace human elements. Leave some behind for the cases where one is needed. So you can replace 5 with 1. Then you rinse and repeat. This way everyone learns how to use the system and any human element still involved by the end of it still understands everything.</p>
<p>It's how it's always worked. Just because you can't fathom it doesn't mean it can't be done.</p>
<p>It will be done. It's only a matter of when.</p>
<p>Let's take replacing pilots for example. It will start by drastically reducing the skill and knowledge to fly a plane. It will reach a point where pilots are no longer crucial to the planes operation. Taking off and landing are mostly done by a computer.  Keep progressing and you reach a point where the automation is now so good you just need am overseer on the plane on case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Confidence in the system will build over time and eventually an overseer is no longer seen as needed for flights with under 100 people. </p>
<p>Confidence again builds and pilots are then a dying species.</p>
<p>And this is for aviation where safety is crazy important. Think of what will happen with taxis and trucking. Same thing but way more accelerated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former pilot myself, I have mad respect for you guys, the amazing complexity and unpredictability you tackle, and the grace and calmness with which you handle these intense situations. But your argument was applied to driverless cars too early on and that's proving false. </p>
<p>There are two fundamental aspects of your argument as I understand it: human unpredictability and scale/complexity of the variables. Autonomous vehicles and workplace AI (such as Microsoft's demonstration of AI services at a construction site for monitoring safety and policy, or even Amazon Go) are already demonstrating super human capabilities for predicting, recognizing, and reacting to the human element of situational complexity. For the scale/complexity of the variables aspect (lots of variables, lots of regulations, lots of maps, etc.), these are precisely things that computers are excellent at. These problems are inherently algorithmically parallelizable such that additional computer processing power scales to increased problem solving ability in ways that additional human bodies tackling the problems do not (e.g. akin to the mythical man month principle). It's doubtful computers could ever fully eradicate the need for human intervention, supervision and fail safes. But there is already sufficient prior art here that demonstrates this is fundamentally a problem that can and will be increasingly performed by computer AI and eventually will reach super human capability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is getting beaten to death, but I see a lot of responses that only cover half the issue.</p>
<p>When you write software, you write for everything you expect.  Its written for things to go perfectly.  A lot of software bugs and issues are what happens when the unexpected occurs.  I work as an IT security architect now, and its one of my primary methods of evaluating products and processes.  They can sound great and perfect, but what happens when the unexpected occurs.  How does it recover and get itself back to the normal flow.  A lot of things don't recover, or end up with garbage data that interferes with the entire flow.</p>
<p>You cant program for EVERYTHING.  Besides not being psychic and all-knowing, its just too damn costly.  Most commercial products have terrible security built in because people buy it to do a function, not to be secure.  And designing to be secure costs.  While you are spending twice as long in development to make it do tasks A,B,C securely, your competitor is making it do D,E,F as well.  And when a company wants to buy, they are looking for those features... security is much less valuable than function.</p>
<p>The unexpected, unplanned, the &quot;perfect storms&quot; happen.  And a mistake costs hundreds of lives.  Simple, repetitive, and low risk actions are replaced with software.  Everything else is software assisted, and high-risk complex actions are verified or fully managed by humans.</p>
<p>Its one of the same reasons why its taken so long for airlines to let autopilot land planes.  Too many high-risk variables, it takes the computer just one bad calculation, one unexpected action to throw off the entire process.  A human can quickly adapt and recover, software just cant yet.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi. I work in IT as well (engineering). This assessment is accurate. Aviation specific additions to this - - </p>
<p>Pilots are trained to monitor landings closely and flight controls are always active -- AP controls trim not primary controls. those surfaces do not respond quickly. This is deliberate: Computers work at high speeds, so they can screw up at high speeds. In certain situations, a rapid surface deflection can lead to serious, even fatal damage to the plane... or worse, an aluminum pancake. AP landings are used now because it allows reduced separation and precision navigation on short final - - adjacent runway use is possible then. Computers can keep a plane in position so well it may as well be laser guided -- in good conditions. </p>
<p>Crosswind components above 15 to 25 knots require the pilot guide the plane to the runway. in low gusting conditions they let the computer manage the throttle. in strong gusts the AP will &quot;chase the airspeed&quot; and engines can't respond to commanded inputs from the AP -- it can lead to overspeed or stall (stick shaker). A pilots judgement and experience is superior here -- so-called &quot;stick and rudder&quot; skill. He knows his plane and will feel his way through the weather while the airspeed indicator is losing its shit and the computer is crapping out master cautions. Pilots have successfully brought planes down in emergency situations that didn't allow for a diversion in conditions of hail, zero visibility, and crosswind beyond recommended limits. Particularly pilots who don't rely on automation -- flying gliders, older planes, general aviation craft. But I've seen footage from the jump seat of pilots who did things on a landing they'd never teach in flight school -- and airlines too conservative to allow. One pilot tiped the wing over and decrabbed at the same time in a heavy crossind only a couple of feet of vertical left... and letting the <em>runway</em> contact arrest the induced roll to nail a wings-level, runway heading landing that gets the reversers in and throttles up now -- a requirement on slick runways, because you've only got a couple of seconds to start braking action or you'll overrun... and you may very well have eaten up even more runway with a poor flare... putting you farther down the TDZ than you want to be. It takes skill to do that... most pilots who attempted it would blow their tires and maybe even collapse the nose gear. The operations manual for that plane... advised never landing in a crab because of design limits. But in some situations, you gotta say to hell with the manual, and bring them home.</p>
<p>during extreme conditions a computer can't do it. it can't adjust fast enough and will even induce oscillation in Altitude and speed because of the delay between input and response -- it creates a feedback loop that can, if not stopped by the pilot, lead to flight envelope excursions. A pilot knows when speed is too high to shed it fast with a nose up attitude. Nose up like if you're not strapped in back in the passenger section, you're ass over tea-kettle into the guy behind you. In extreme cases he may even cross the controls to create even more drag. When the seat belt sign is on, you obey it like your life depends on it -- because it might. The pilot turned that on because he sees something that might require an abrupt change... or might expect one. Turbulent air is, by nature, not predictable. Landings and takeoffs don't always go according to plan. Bird strikes. Downbursts. Wake turbulence well after it should have dissipated. Aborted landings are not comfortable... that's full braking action, like tires blowing up, undercarriages bursting into flames -- and it's usually done because something else got fucked... like a compressor stall... or worse... a fire. Your pilot will keep you safe. Ground crews know what to do. Keep your fucking seatbelt on -- because the difference between life and death is you getting out that door in the next 90 seconds if the worst happens. If you weren't wearing it... you may be too injured to make it in the ensuing race. Listen to your flight crew! Planes have dropped a thousand feet in a few seconds. Without your seatbelt, you're going into the ceiling... just like you'd go into a windshield in a car accident. It's not always pretty. A computer can't do any of that because it's a dynamic flight configuration that has too many variables to calculate. A pilot can, in these cases, skip flying by numbers and muscle it back to a stable attitude and speed. They know when the risk of aborting past V1 is justified. Maybe they're flying light that day. Maybe it's a short trip. Maybe they <em>know</em> they'll make it... but the computer won't. The computer... would force the takeoff. A lot can happen in the 10 minutes it takes to circle back. That's why you have a pilot. That's when you earn your check. </p>
<p>Computers can get better but they will never be able to take risks -- its their nature to minimize risk. A human knows sometimes the numbers won't save you -- instinct will find a way and know when to take a risk or when faced with a no-win situation what will save the most lives. We can't always win... but often we can miss the worst case scenario with another thing computers can't have: the will to live.     </p>
<p>Computers don't make the skies safe: People do. And if you think computers can do a better job -- think again. Aviation has the highest safety and reliability record of any engineering industry.  Autopilot is nice. Keeps gorilla-arm away, lets a pilot focus on other things like scanning the horizon, and doing briefings without interruption. It's not necessary to do the job. And as to self-driving cars... well, I'll never use one. I like cruise control. I might take one that'll apply the brakes if something gets too close. I'd love one that told me something was in my blind spot without having to crank my head around. But my car doesn't care if I live or die. I do. I don't want my obituary to read &quot;Killed by algorithm&quot; or some voltage fluxuation that made it lose its shit and throw itself off a cliff. Sorry -- Aviation tells us quite clearly what should, and shouldn't, be automated, and where we need to stop. There are some envelopes that should not be pushed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not bringing in &quot;super intelligent AI of the future&quot; into this, but as of right now we are already writing neuron based software models that handle everything more broadly, so even unexpected situations are covered. </p>
<p>I'm not saying I trust this approach yet, because I would have to see massive and thorough testing with it first, but we may be able to start getting into this kind of solution. </p>
<p>The advantage with this is that, while it's a neural system, it can be a locked neural system that's been extremely well tested, so while human neural systems have more dynamic broad problem solving capability, they're also more complex and more prone to error and distraction.</p>
<p>Even so, I would still have exceptionally good air traffic controllers on site and use the AI to alleviate the stress of their job, not replace them. For example if one air traffic controller can stand by and observe instructions given by the AI and the flight situations, then take over situations that they feel are tricky or high risk, they'll be able to relax a little overall and be fresh and ready when it comes to the more tricky situations. \</p>
<p>I could be wrong - the most I've done with neural AI systems is have them learn to play Super Mario Bros on NES from scratch (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44" target="_blank">you can see someone do this here</a>) but I've been seeing much more advanced usage, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ul0Gilv5wvY?t=2m26s" target="_blank">such as this</a> which is really not that far off from being able to drive in diverse terrain and handle unexpected situations. Something more advanced like Aircraft Control could foreseeably come after driving is mastered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you might not be able to write software for every possible situation, you can TEST software for millions of possible (either randomized or constructed from historical data) situations within a fraction of the time that it would take to test a human traffic controller in these. You simply keep iteratively improving the software until it statistically performs better than a human running the same tests. And then you can just copy and further improve that software over and over, while trained humans keep retiring and new ones need to be trained from square one.</p>
<p>The only problem is to convince people that a statistically rare catastrophe caused by a computer error is better than a statistically more often catastrophe caused by human error. Apparently most people can't deal with not being able to put blame on a person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trust me, as a software engineer, you don't want to leave everything up to software.</p>
<p>At the very highest level, understand this: planes are physically interacting with several highly chaotic systems. One is nature itself. Two is the human people involved with flying the plane. Three is the human network of people supporting the plane at takeoff and landing.</p>
<p>We really aren't that great at predicting how any of these chaotic systems will behave via software.</p>
<p>We simply don't have the general software AI to manage those things yet. We have software tools that can assist, but I guarantee you, you want a human making judgment calls. Software isn't even close to there yet.</p>
<p>Here's a brief story about a friend of mine who had nothing to do with Flight Traffic Controlling. He was a Project Manager for a major airline in the U.S.</p>
<p>One of the big things that he was in charge of was changing the de-icing fluid used on planes. It took 6 years to do this safely. You had to manage logistics about the substance itself. You had to make sure it wasn't being mixed with the old formula. You had to put the requisite amounts in the right places for the expected times, you had to test it to make sure it functioned properly after being stored for a long time, you had to do all of this without a break in the lockstep of the airline schedule. And you are always testing in production because even if you test on a plane with no passengers, there's still a pilot involved.</p>
<p>If you fuck up in a project like that, people die. If I fuck up on the job, we have some downtime inside of our company. No one gets hurt, it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>My friend was in his early thirties when he started that project. And that's a fairly controlled and planned project. He's now in his mid/late thirties and he looks like he's about 60.</p>
<p>Now imagine what it's like to be the human in charge of doing the equivalent of that several hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>That's what air traffic controllers do. And that's why it's stressful. You make one tiny little mistake, and people actually die. But they don't have 6 years to plan out every little detail. They have minutes to make decisions. Some software helps, but it can't take every case into account. It's not possible when dealing with genuinely chaotic systems.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is this: when a large factor in your system is run by human decisions, you need humans to make the final call about the sum of those decisions. And when weather and nature are a big player in the situation, you definitely need a human to make the call.</p>
<p>Software just isn't even close to being able to handle this is a reliable way. Don't believe the hype about self driving cars. We aren't there yet. We're not even close.</p>
<p>There is no way that we want software running things like Air Traffic Control.</p>
<p>And mad props to the people in this thread who are actually ATCs. You do an amazing job, and I hope it hasn't taken years off your life.</p></div>		</li>
