			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of this is the use of alcohol at collage football games. Dry stadiums have forced students to sneak in alcohol. Itâ€™s more efficient to sneak in a large flask or ziplock of whiskey or vodka than sneak in a six pack of beer.  Students tend to over indulge on the stronger alcohol.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also on cruises, I've heard of people sneaking in high octane beer in their &quot;allowed&quot; wine bottles, but most people sneak in liquor because it will allow them more drinking time or get them drunk faster. I mean I understand why both industries limit the allowable substances, since they want to make more money. But they also charge somewhat restrictive prices [for instance, a 1 LT of Skyy delivered to your stateroom is $75 plus 18% service charge on Carnival. Total Wine lists the same size as $18+tax. $75 is probably 10 drinks on ship (assuming you only want vodka, but not as great of a deal as pouring it at in to a mouthwash bottle)]. </p>
<p>Even if the tax brought it up to $20 (it doesn't where I am, I guess it's on sale so it's 17.03 after tax), it's still less than a third of paying for the company's bottle. Plus, there are plenty of &quot;innocent&quot; bottles to put in your check in where you could &quot;smuggle&quot; more expensive alcohol than that. (IIRC, they charged like $10 for paton silver so 3.5 shots justifies a 750 ml retail, the 1.75 is 80 so 8 shots would make it worth it before whatever is leftover). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one uses mouth wash bottles. They make bladders that you can fill and conceal flat within your luggage, undetected. Did this on a cruise once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while I think this hits the mark economically I think realistically you have to think about the science and demand behind all this. </p>
<p>First off we have techniques now that can concentrate the plant and isolate thc, cbd, and many other specific cannabinoids to 99.99% purity or greater. We can also pull out the terpenes which are the tasty part and separate those or add those back in whatever ratio we want. So as far as making a pure concentrate to easily distribute, that has been taken pretty much as far as science will take it. </p>
<p>Secondly the demand for a product that is purely thc is pretty low. Stoners like to taste good things, they like their products to be pretty and to connect with the past and people making it. For some crystaline thc mixed with liquid terpenes at your leasure is the future, but a lot of people want buds and water hash and dry sift and kief and rosin and joints and blunts made with all of those things and none of those things are made with 100% purity in mind.</p>
<p>I think the interesting question is will bud continue become more potent and I think the answer is yes but it will likely reach a peak because really what percent of a plants weight can be thc before it ceases to function. We have hit in the mid 30s as far as percentages go (this is without getting into the nebulous unregulated world of testing) and I think this will increase a bit but who knows how high we can get .... zing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see it the other way. I think potency has exploded since California legalized medical way back when. NorCal weed was always famously dank, but it was almost impossible to get outside of NorCal. As these pioneer growers were allowed to go legal, they got rich bottling all their secrets, and as a result the weed got better. </p></div>		</li>
