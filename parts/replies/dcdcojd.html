<p>Actually it's pretty certain. FUBAR was changed to FOOBAR when testing a computer system that used six-letter names for files.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read it a long time ago. Here's one reference to it by John V. Everett:</p>
<p>When I joined DEC in 1966, foobar was already being commonly used as a throw-away file name. I believe fubar became foobar because the PDP-6 supported six character names, although I always assumed the term migrated to DEC from MIT. There were many MIT types at DEC in those days, some of whom had worked with the 7090/7094 CTSS. Since the 709x was also a 36 bit machine, foobar may have been used as a common file name there.</p>
<p>Foo and bar were also commonly used as file extensions. Since the text editors of the day operated on an input file and produced an output file, it was common to edit from a .foo file to a .bar file, and back again.</p>
<p>It was also common to use foo to fill a buffer when editing with TECO. The text string to exactly fill one disk block was IFOO$HXA127GA$$. Almost all of the PDP-6/10 programmers I worked with used this same command string.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wasn't Aware that was a Military acronym. I assume it didn't originally mean &quot;fucked up beyond all repair&quot; either?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it did. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_slang_terms#FUBAR" target="_blank">cites the OED</a> quoting a 1944 military magazine explanation of &quot;fouled up beyond all recognition&quot;, but I think it safe to say that in 1944 even a military publication would have bowdlerized it. </p></div>		</li>
