			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a big bomb, but it wouldn't do more than blow a largish chunk out of a rocky planet.  A supernova could blast that entire planet into its component atoms and spread them across several light years of space.  There's just no comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to /u/Dyolf_Knip a 200 ton black hole detonates with the power of 6 teratons of TNT, or 6,000,000,000,000 tons.  One ton of TNT is equivalent to 4.184 Ã— 10^9 joules, or 4,184,000,000 joules.  If there is the energy of 6 trillion tons of TNT in a 200 ton black hole, that is 2.5 x 10^22 joules.</p>
<p>So far we have:</p>
<p>200 ton black hole is equal to 2.5 x 10^22 joules, or...</p>
<p>25,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules (fun fact, this is pretty close to the estimated amount of energy contained in the amount of coal left on earth in 2010)</p>
<p>Ok.  So what does the energy release of a supernova equate to?  According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\(energy\)" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, the energy release of a supernova is estimated to be 10^44 joules, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules.</p>
<p>Ok.  So we now know how much energy is in a 200 ton black hole explosion.  And we know how much energy is in a supernova explosion.  What is the difference?</p>
<p>4 x 10^21, or...</p>
<p>4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times smaller, or 125 times smaller than Chicxulub impact energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it specifically ~200 tons?  Is it that, at that point, despite being a single point, the gravity is no longer strong enough to hold it together, and it just cascades apart essentially all at once from any tiny expansion the mass does?  Or is something more interesting happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy (and thus mass) radiated away per second is proportionate to the inverse square of the mass.  IE a small black hole gives off a LOT more energy than a big one.  And the smaller it gets, the faster it radiates. A 1600 ton black hole radiates at 1/4 the rate of a 800 ton black hole, which is 1/4 the rate of a 400 ton, which is 1/4 the rate of a 200 ton. So that last little bit radiates away REALLY fast.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>100 tons: black hole lasts for 0.1s, which is long enough for it to fall 5cm straight down. So in that sense, it does something before it's gone. Anyone standing anywhere near it would of course be instantly vaporised by its radiation, so wouldn't be able to watch that happen.</p>
<p>500 tons: black hole lasts 10s, which at least in theory is long enough to absorb significant mass to counter-act evaporation. In practice, it's much smaller than a proton, and it's still radiating so fiercely (10121012 gigawatts) that everything near it is driven away. So it won't actually encounter much matter. Most of its energy is released underground, but it only has time to fall 500m, so it's still in the crust. A huge chunk of crust above it is blasted into the atmosphere, in an event considerably worse than Krakatoa.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, nothing magic happens. It's just that the rate at which the hole radiates is inversely proportional to its mass, so when there's very little mass left it radiates really fast. </p></div>		</li>
