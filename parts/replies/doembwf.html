			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about new college players or players for teams that aren't in a major conference? Surely they're not THAT knowledgeable about ALL those sports, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you would be a bit surprised. As they continuously study film, watch games, and work the games, they are always gaining knowledge on the people that they are announcing. </p>
<p>The majority of the time announcers only call one sport, at one level, so they have the time to learn all of the names. You can tell when theyâ€™re unsure of how to say a name, which in football generally happens on special teams plays as the more known starters may not be in on special teams plays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I'm a slightly more than casual NHL fan. I look at this way.</p>
<p>30 teams(before this year, I think 31 now with Vegas). 4 lines of 3 forwards,  3 groups of 2 defense pairings, and 2 goaltenders. Per team. </p>
<p>So you're looking at 372(?) NHL caliber forwards. 186 defenceman and  62 goaltenders. </p>
<p>It's guarunteed that even the shittiest of commentators know at the very least that. About 600 names.</p>
<p>Then I'm sure they'll learn 150-200(+) names a year coming up through junior hockey in Canada and potential NCAA free agents. As well as probably the same number of foreign players through the KHL, SEL and world juniors.</p>
<p>Commentators are severely underappreciated. Idk their salaries though, so I guess I can't say that lol. They might be properly appreciated for all I know </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're full of shit. They ask. They ask the SIDs that are assigned to that program, the coaches. They ask. They don't study film as much as you think they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Division 1 baseball player, we routinely had announcers in our dugout pre-game to ask clarification on phonetic pronounciation. This information is shared pretty easily throughout a conference/league, etc. It was also listed in our online roster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, and for bigger schools or pro leagues I'm sure the commentators just meet with someone on the staff to confirm everything. It takes a matter of 5 minutes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should ask the World Cup announcers next year now that Iceland has qualified for the first time ever. Trying to say those names is hard enough, and I doubt there are many very well known players. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely correct. Every team puts out a Media Guide which includes full background facts (ever notice how each announcer knows all the same &quot;fun facts&quot; about the players?), depth chart, and a pronunciation guide. </p>
<p>Here's an example:  <a href="http://fightingillini.com/documents/2016/8/3/1_Media.pdf?id=18917?ismobile=true" target="_blank">http://fightingillini.com/documents/2016/8/3/1_Media.pdf?id=18917?ismobile=true</a>   (The pronunciation guide is on page 8)</p></div>		</li>
