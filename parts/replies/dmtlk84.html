			<div class="markdown"><p>Logically at some point it would freeze, since it probably wouldn't remain unfrozen near absolute zero. So it's just a matter of how much colder they need to be in order to freeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the antifreeze proteins are an adaptation specific to a family of Antarctic Toothfish. Gold fish and koi are fresh water fish, so temperatures below freezing would freeze the water around them and the fish would have nothing to breathe. Freshwater fish survive the winter by finding pockets of warm water near the bottom, or even burrowing into the sediment and hibernating there. </p></div>		</li>
