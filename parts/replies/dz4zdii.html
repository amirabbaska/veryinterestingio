			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on who you ask. 2-4 drinks per night seems to be what is agreed to on the high end of &quot;safe&quot;.
Edit: They key is moderation and drinking every day isn't moderation at all. Be safe people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s too much for me. It’s the everyday thing that kills me. If I could do six just in the weekends, I wouldn’t even be worried. It’s the 3-5 a night, every night, that’s kills me. And I HAVE to. I never win the conversation in my head about not drinking tonight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there! Someone here who lost the same convo over and over. It eventually got worse for me, starting earlier and earlier until I was at work drinking. Biggest tip for warning I can give: do you shake/sweat when you don't drink? If so it's time for help. That's when things went spiraling down for me; the physical dependency. Hit me up if you have any questions! Been sober 4 years. Good luck!</p>
<p>Ninja edit: or if anyone has questions for someone who drank a liter of vodka a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more about alcohol content too, I would think. I drink 3-4 beers a night. But it's mostly Bud Light or Natural Light. Instead of pop I drink those. I don't get wasted. I do get a slight buzz but barely. So would that consider me an alcoholic? IDK. My neighbor drinks an entire gallon of wine a night. He's outside stumbling drunk often. I consider that an alcoholic. IDK I've posted this before and I think quite a few people are where I'm at. 4 Natural Lights = 2 glasses of wine and I see older ladies drink a bottle a night but go crazy when I say I drink 3-4 beers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it depends on your behavior and mentality regarding alcohol. If you find it difficult to go throughout a day without alcohol, then I'd say yes. But is someone who happens to drink a glass of wine a night or a beer after dinner an alcoholic? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this though. If someone did something every day without fail, would you consider them an addict? If someone smoked half a pack of cigarettes or went to the casino or smoked weed every day, would you consider them an addict?</p>
<p>There are degrees to alcoholism, despite its immediate negative connotations. But even at 2 drinks a night, you're going to do noticeable damage to your liver and other body systems compared to someone who doesn't drink regularly at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest risk is that it turns into more than 1 or 2 per night. I started out doing that, then it became 3-4 beers a night and I had to put a stop to weeknight drinking because I could easily see it growing further. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally if you’re asking yourself SERIOUSLY “do I have a problem!” you likely have a problem. If you’re drinking non stop Friday through Saturday, my personal opinion would be that there’s a problem, but that’s up to you. </p></div>		</li>
