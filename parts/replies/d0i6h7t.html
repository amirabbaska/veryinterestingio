			<div class="markdown"><p>People typically fail to realize the implications of shutting down a major thoroughfare. You have to take into account the traffic impact of rerouting potentially thousands of vehicles a day to adjacent streets which really begins compounding because people that normally drive that street may reroute to other adjacent streets, and so on. </p>
<p>It's not nearly as simple as it sounds and most of the time is simply not feasible to do.</p>
<p>And this doesn't even take into account the financial impact of that decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it can be done.  More than 10 years ago, a 1.5 mile stretch of interstate in downtown Indianapolis needed to be completely rebuilt - the stretch where I-65 and I-70 are concurrent.  It was decided the fix would be the &quot;Hyperfix:&quot; they completely closed the section.  Both directions.  Of two major interstate highways.</p>
<p>It was inconvenient, to be sure.  It added ten minutes to my commute - but just for three months.  Estimates were the project would have taken nine months if they had tried to keep the highways open.  And it would have cost twice as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be far easier to do than shutting down 2nd ave.</p>
<p>The stretch that you are referring to is just a junction. Yes lots of people drive that, by I-465 is far better equipped to handle a few thousand extra cars and trucks a day than the streets around 2nd ave. </p>
<p>To make this a little more understandable, imagine closing 465. Not just a little stretch, but the whole thing. All that traffic has to be rerouted via 65 and 70. Imagine the gridlock of that? That would be the equivalent of shutting down 2nd ave. You could theoretically do it, and they may. But you are still looking at a major endeavor to find alternate routes for all that traffic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will also basically kill any businesses operating on the street if they shut it down entirely for months. On a major Manhattan streets that's hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses. Even one side of the street being closed will put a substantial damper on things and force some poor performers to close up shop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking care of everybody else and minimizing disruptions is a huge part of it. If you think of some place with a more authoritarian government, and the subway construction is being directed by the national government, it is just &quot;we're doing this; get out of our way; we'll tell you when we're done.&quot; In NY, every single 'stakeholder' requires some level of accomodation, and the engineering and construction plan has to minimize any disruptions. Very much 'excuse us, beg your pardon, sorry about any disruption from building this subway 100 feet underground, we will make sure there are no inconveniences or damages to anyone.' </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infrastructural projects are a nightmare. Mind you I've only been into the coordination of a couple of tunnels and specifically the concrete tube itself. So not the groundwork around it nor the infrastructural matters. You have special companies who only figure out how to change the situation that everything can keep going on. Changing the pedestrians, bicycles, cars, small bridges, traffic lights, safety spots and so on and that layout as you say keeps changing and changing because how the project progresses. You need to get agreement with local municipals which only causes you to spend more money because initially they are never happy even while the plan is good.</p>
<p>You also need to monitor everything 100%. Not only traffic but even buildings get &quot;laser badged&quot; so any change of position you must know. If you don't and any building would form cracks they will find you and you will end up paying for it. So everything has to be precisely indexed and measurements are a never ending story.</p></div>		</li>
