			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is a good thing a large amount of money goes into failing projects that are either too crazy or too expensive to maintain (the new multi role jet is an example, it's just not as useful as it could be if they focused on separate designs) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But these are still good things. When you pour money into experimental projects, we advance. If the military wasn't recieving the funds they were 50-60 years ago, we would have never gotten to the moon as quickly as we did. The advancement of research in nuclear energy and so much more would never have gotten nearly as far if it weren't for military contracts/funding. The money comes back to us in knaawwlige and ferraris. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are good things when you have money to spare. If you're spending money for the sake of spending money you can end up with massive debt that you can never pay off. Ever wonder how long it'll take to pay off our national debt?</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, unless we cancel a lot of expensive government programs (wasteful ones like the military hiring &quot;mercenaries&quot; to guard US embassies rather than actual American soldiers, as well as the important things like social security, and government sponsored healthcare) we won't be able to begin to pay it off until after the baby boomer generation dies. </p></div>		</li>
