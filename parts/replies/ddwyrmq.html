			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, user name checks out in pun-tastic fashion :)
Secondly, thanks for your download of chemical knowledge. </p>
<p>A few questions if I may...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If ion loss is brought about by acidic conditions, does swishing baking soda around in your mouth raise the pH enough to prevent this  ionic loss? If so..how long does it last? Which raises the question: is mouth pH determined mostly by general body chemistry, or is it more dependent on whatever was last in your mouth?
Relating to this, I've read that the byproducts of mouth-microbes that thrive on sugars are the ones responsible for lowering the pH, therefore, two strategies could be either get rid of the sugars so there's no food for the microbes, or raise the pH so their acidifying effect is nullified?</p>
</li>
<li>What are your thoughts on NOVAMIN? Does it work? How does it work? Why isn't it allowed in Sensodyne in the US? I have sensitive teeth and have been buying sensodyne with novamin from the UK, and it has seemed to help.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have this question as well.  I have found PubMed papers that seem to say there is a benefit, and others that say there isn't.  </p>
<p>For your other question, Sensodyne could easily have Novamin in the US, but GlaxoSmithKline (the owners of the brand) want to keep it as a prescription-level toothpaste so that they can charge much more (from my dental quote, a Novamin Sensodyne tube through the dentist is $30 or so, versus $3 if they sold it in the store).</p>
<p>Finally, where do you order yours from? I couldn't find a UK seller that was under $8/tube for a fairly small tube.  I found $6/tube options on eBay from an India-based seller, but that is the non-whitening version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny Novamin Sensodyne story: it's $6 CAD at Walmart in Canada. I literally just drove from Detroit to Windsor today to grab a few months worth of it, for less than the price of US sensodyne (after conversions).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other question I didn't answer is yes. Diet is one of the most important parts to better oral health. It has been shown in many studies diets low in sugar result in less caries regardless of brushing habits. But it is realistically impossible to avoid all so good brushing/home care can take care of that part. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baking soda can help a little as a rinse but the issue is the damage from the acid is already done and nothing is being done to repair. You can get the essentially a similar pH balance by just swishing with water. I'm not super familiar with Novamin so I would need to research it for studies. But I believe it is very similar to ACP as a bioavailable form to allow for uptake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No way I am going to do that because some guy on reddit with a bunch of upvotes said to. Toothpaste tastes fucking nasty, and dries the hell out of my mouth. I usually swish like 5+ mouthfuls of water afterword before I feel normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dentist but I suffer from dry-mouth and severely grind my teeth at night so I have to use toothpaste with high fluoride levels. Couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <em>only</em> get one set of teeth. Trust me when I say you want to keep them.</li>
<li>They make toothpaste for dry-mouth suffers and, at least the ones I've used, have very little taste. </li>
