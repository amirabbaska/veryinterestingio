This is seen as a phase in acute continuous sleep deprivation, but is also seen chronically in most people who sleep 4-6 hours a night after a few weeks (or your whole adult life...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad news: studies show that a single 8-hour night really won't help you that much if you are chronically sleep deprived. It actually takes quite a long time of good sleep to recover!</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are chronically sleep deprived, you will start to &quot;feel&quot; OK. But you will think more slowly than other people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not our fault if society forces on most of us the whole 40+ weekly hours of work, leaving me with - after the time spent commuting, taking a shower, eating etc - only mere 2-3 hours for actual fun/entertainment every day if I do want to sleep the whole 8 hours every night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the length of time needed to recover from such effects directly proportional to the length of the deprivation? Or after several nights of “catching up” on your sleep do you return to your normal cognitive level?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have these studies looked at polyphasic schedules, or only shorter-than-ideal monophasic ones?</p>
<p>My understanding is that there's a great deal of difference between &quot;lay down to sleep for six hours&quot; vs, for example, &quot;sleep for three hours, wake for four hours, sleep for three hours.&quot; The latter is often claimed to be more restful due to how sleep cycles become less efficient as a single sleep session goes on, and I've been interested to see whether this or other more extreme (3-4 or more short sleep sessions) schedules have been looked at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most research on polyphasic sleep shows that the concept of &quot;polyphasic sleep&quot; is flawed and still results in sleep deprivation if you sleep for less than eight hours. The &quot;uberman&quot; schedule or the biphasic 4 hours sleep + 2 hour nap might be popular on the internet, but existing research suggests that these will still result in sleep deprivation. </p>
<p>Admittedly, there isn't a huge amount of research on polyphasic sleep. But what's there seems to agree that you need your eight hours, and while you might try to split it up into pieces, you still need the eight hours.</p>
<p>There's also some evidence that humans used to actually have interrupted sleep, waking up in the middle of the night for a few hours. But they still got that 8 hours total because they also took naps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Northern cultures subject to very long winter nights may have practiced interrupted nighttime sleep, and tropical cultures often developed a siesta practice of mid-day napping when it was too hot to do anything else. But total sleep in hunter-gatherer societies actually averages 6.5 hours, and in temperate conditions that is done in a single sleep block. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/10/16/sleep-study-on-modern-day-hunter-gatherers-dispels-notion-that-were-wired-to-need-8-hours-a-day/?utm_term=.e03810e26bcf" target="_blank">WaPo article</a></p>
<p>The 8-hour idea might have come from measuring time in bed rather than time asleep - sleep trackers portable enough for use in non-lab studies are pretty new, and it is common for someone to be in bed for 8 hours and asleep for only 6.5 of that. </p></div>		</li>
