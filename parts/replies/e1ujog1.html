			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this earlier, but a guy I know fell for a &quot;Russian bride&quot; spam email, and it ended with him visiting the girl in Kiev, going on a date with her, and waking up to all of his money, phone and passport gone. What's even sadder is he sent a company email the day before detailing all of their adventures and shared pictures. </p></div>		</li>
