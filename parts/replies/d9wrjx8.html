			<div class="markdown"><p>One of two things. If the video format was allowed to scale bandwidth, it would chew a looooooot more during that sequence, by virtue of the fact that so much is happening. </p>
<p>However, most video is encoded at fixed bitrate, so, instead, you lose fidelity. The image looks crap, because there just isn't enough bandwidth to accurately represent the scene crisply. You've probably already seen this effect many times before in a pirated movie during a high action sequence, and, to be fair, often in digital broadcast TV. Pretty much any video application where the bandwidth is hard limited. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite right. Yes, online videos do use interframe encoding but they also use very clever compression. H.264, the standard for just about everything uses 4 layers of compression</p>
<ol>
<li>Quantization</li>
<li>Chroma Subsampling</li>
<li>Motion Compensation (The one you explained)</li>
<li>Entropy Encoding</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/" target="_blank">This</a> is a brilliant article that explains all of those in great detail that came out recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>JPEG uses 1, 2 and 4. So that explanation was actually pretty solid. </p>
<p>And the order should be chroma subsampling, motion compensation, frequency domain transform, quantization, entropy coding.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? That must be what that JPEG quality slider controls, the amount of quantization and chroma subsampling. PNG is lossless so it doesn't use any of that, right? I guess you can just get away with a lot more compression with video because of the motion and people tend to upload higher quality images?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as /u/Gawwad said there isn't the hardware support for it. I can play 480p H265 on my computer but anything above that and it gets pretty choppy.</p>
<p>BUT there is also the other side of it. Encoding. Generally H265 takes 10x longer to encode for a 50% reduction in bandwidth. And that 50% is on the high end. It's often less.</p>
<p>So in the case of youtube. When you upload a video they encode it as H264.  Because most videos get a few views. It isn't worth the time to reduce the size of it.  Once a video gets popular and they are sending out tens of thousands of views they will encode it in H265 (actually VP9, but H265 works the same) </p>
