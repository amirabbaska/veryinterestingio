			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a great answer. I think the other important thing to note is that the way athletes were developed in the US/which sports were easily available really impacted what our most talented athletes choose to play. </p>
<p>It's pretty easy to have a basketball court in a city or a football field or baseball field in the suburbs or in rural areas. How easy it is to find a sport really impacts who plays it - there's a reason inner city Jewish kids were so dominant at basketball in the mid 20th century. Sports like gymnastics aren't as cheap and require technical training that US didn't have in as great abundance. The popularity (and profitability) of American sports, the lack of equally trained athletes for these sports outside the US, and the demand for higher level performance meant that we put almost our entire effort into training kids for basketball, baseball, and football, and we did it almost entirely with public funding. </p>
<p>It's amazing that America is actually as good at certain olympic sports as we are considering our best athletes consistently choose to play American pro sports. Most athletes like C.J. Cummings (teenage olympic weightlifter who will end up being our first male lifter in awhile to make the olympics) gravitate towards the money now. Can you imagine how unbelievably dominant we'd be in the Olympics if guys like Lebron James and Russell Westbrook started training for different sports at a young age? Or how many World Cups we would win if every Allen Iverson decided soccer was the way to go?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't know who this was, and when I read his name, it came out &quot;Alien Invasion&quot;, and I was imagining a scenario in which Aliens showed up and challenged us to a duel via soccer a la Space Jam or Mortal Kombat, and I was thinking &quot;I would probably be funneling anyone with decent soccer talent into that...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something that gives me a huge justice-boner is what happened in the 1936 Olympic games</p>
<p>The US sent a black man, Jesse Owens to where else but Berlin, smack in the middle of the Third Reich. This was during the time that Germany was on their huge propaganda campaign about Aryan superiority, so people were entertained by the fact that, in their eyes of racial superiority, America sent one of the least-qualified people possible.</p>
<p>And what does Jesse Owens do? He doesn't just blow the competition out of the water: no, that would be too lenient on motherfucking literal Nazis. He takes Hitler's racial superiority bullshit, tears it up enough to make a paper mache pool, and then proceeds to fill the pool with the tears of onlooking Nazis. Who he then placed into the pool with his competition so he could blow them all out of the water.</p>
<p>In the span of just <em>45 fucking minutes</em>, Jesse Owens ends up setting <strong>4</strong> world records, and wins <strong>4</strong> gold medals. In the span of less than an hour, the toxic bullshit that Hitler was spewing was singlehandedly crushed by the son of an Alabama sharecropper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I'm always down to shit on Nazis, let's not unintentionally imply that the US organizing committees and government were sending him on an honest mission of attacking racist Nazis via sport. Remember, FDR refused to honor him along side the rest of the US athletes upon return to the States, not even a telegram congratulation, while there is some tenuous evidence that Hitler did congrats Owens (albeit begrudgingly and likely just to save public face). He was allowed to stay with his white teammates in Germany but not in the US. Heck, iirc, he almost didn't go because he was initially protesting (alongside the NAACP) the idea of representing a country where he was a second class citizen but got goaded into going by people who said his protests were &quot;un-American&quot;. </p>
<p>Again, I'm not trying to imply that the US was worse than Nazi Germany or some stupid shit like that, nor that your intention was to portray the US at that time as some perfect paragon of virtue, but I think it's important to remember the contexts that Jesse Owens competed under. If anything, it's even more of a testament to what Owens accomplished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, plus nothing FDR did or didn't do matters to the story.   The fact that he became such a perfect rebuke of Hitler's ideology, is almost magnified by the fact that he did it without much official U.S. backing.    Just a black kid from nowhere, alabama vs the third reich.... in Berlin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesse Owens said himself he was treated badly by the American establishment and FDR refused to honour him. </p>
<p>By contrast in Germany he wasn't treated very differently to his white teammates and was even 'sponsored' by adidas, a German company (they gave him his shoes). Whilst Hitler of course had terrible views on black people along with a range of other ethnic minorities, he did quite a lot to hide the repression that he was instituting whilst he  was hosting the Olympics. </p>
<p>I don't think your justice boner is well founded, at all. You're looking at history through a very warped set of rose tinted spectacles.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I actually attended a lecture on this topic at SOAS in London (an incredibly well respected institution) where they argued that the Nazi's had relatively neutral views on black and asian people. It makes sense when you think about it, racial hatred generally comes from social tension and there simply weren't enough non-europeans in Germany at the time for a racist reactionary movement to form. Nazi's essentially tokenised African societies as quaint examples of the ethnically homogeneous ideals they believed in, but didn't officially preach any animosity towards them. They did of course still have ideas about racial superiority that were pretty shocking (what with being literally the Nazi's and all) but they didn't have <em>hatred</em> of Africans in the same way that huge swathes of the US did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But didn't Hitler believe that the US bred African-Americans for their physical strength and endurance through centuries of slavery as part of his theories on eugenics?
