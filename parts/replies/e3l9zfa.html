<p>Add a gallon of water. The pH is now 2.1.... lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. I was just making up numbers. </p>
<p>In reality, the pH of the stomach fluctuates, as does the amount of acid in there. It's not like it's exactly 2.0000, it's between 1.5 and 2.5  or so, and 50-100mL. </p>
<p>You'd never add a gallon of water without some sort of reaction, or some of it being moved out of the stomach, and the stomach making more acid. So no real math is possible. </p>
<p>If you actually took 100mL of 2.0 acid and added a gallon, it would rise to above 3, but that's not what I'm saying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pH is in factors of ten... Diluting it by factors of 2 or 4 or even 10 don't matter much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems very plausible, differences in PH have a really big impact on the efficiency of enzymes so I assume the body has a way of dealing with this. Same as the buffer mechanic of the blood.</p></div>		</li>
