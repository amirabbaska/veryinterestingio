			<div class="markdown"><p>yup. You'll notice the tank is empty and maybe have another ~2 weeks before your lines get all sputtery and it's finally time to have a funeral for the poor thing. Somewhere during that 2 weeks, the baffles will appear to dry out </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>neat- I think that's something most people never experience, since I am pretty sure that most pens are lost long before they run out of ink. (I know I can never find one when I need one to write with.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In pens that don't have this, many factors can contribute to the failure of the ink containment such as barometric pressure changes, thermal changes, and even as much as shaking the thing. </p>
<p>tl;dr you have good taste in pens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started off with G2s (When I talk about pens I sound like a drug addict, probably not by coincidence) </p>
<p>If you're not limiting yourself to a color-coding scheme like I am, <strong>UNI-BALL</strong> makes the best 'compromise' pen. It's not as expensive as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Montblanc-Meisterstuck-Classique-Ballpoint-Black/dp/B00126TNOK" target="_blank">Mont Blanc</a> and the ink is high quality and they never jam. </p>
<p>Personally, I use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Precise-Roller-Stick-Assorted/dp/B004E2O0DS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1489163777&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=pilot+v5" target="_blank">this exact</a> pack of pens, because my color-coding system corresponds to the days of the week (M- black, Tu- red, W- green Th- blue, F- cyan, Sat- pink, Sun - purple) and they're honestly the most cost-effective. I'll usually be able to squeeze about 18 months of use out of this $12 pack of pens </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I love your passion. I don't have to use black, but I prefer that or blue. And clicky pens for that matter because dealing with caps when you're in a hurry sucks. Maybe I should check out some other uni-balls? </p>
<p>Also I like that you have a different color for each day, can I ask what you do that made you decide to do that? </p></div>		</li>
