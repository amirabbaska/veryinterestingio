			<div class="markdown"><p>The billiard ball physicists don't experience the third dimension in their lives, but they might be persuaded to imagine it exists if it explains things in their own lives very well. Some physicists in our own 3D world are starting to believe there might actually be 10 dimensions because a 10-dimensional universe leads to some really good explanations of things in our 3D world. It's important to recognize that it's not necessarily 10. Some theories require 11, some 26, etc. What will ultimately determine the number of dimensions we accept will be the explanatory power of the theory itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't get string theory, but here's my take on your question. The OP with the anecdote about billiard balls is trying to answer your question really. He is proposing a world where to the average billiard ball (i.e. you and me), things make a lot of sense if you thought of them in 2 dimensions. However, when the billiard ball scientists are trying to figure out how their billiard world works, the theories they come up with are complicated and unsatisfactory. Then a super smart billiard ball scientist comes up with a much simpler and more satisfactory theory for how the billiard ball world works, but in order for that theory to work, he had to introduce this THIRD dimension, which would blow the mind of your average joe billiard ball who thinks of everything in 2 dimensions, because 2 dimensions is what they see all the time, and they just can't wrap their heads around this crazy third dimension.</p>
<p>Now we live in this apparently 3 dimensional world, and our early scientists came up with 3 dimensional theories of physics to explain how our world works, and for large objects or large distances, those theories are fine, elegant even. Newton was pretty smart for his day, and probably even for our day. But later smarter physicists start to discover all the quantum mechanics stuff where Newton's theories start breaking down, just like the 2 dimensional billiard theories start breaking down. Our scientists are also trying to come up with an elegant theory that would explain everything, but to do that, the theory they came up with would require 10 dimensions, which is blowing our minds just like the 3rd dimension is blowing the billiard's minds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to point out that Newton was probably a bit more than &quot;pretty smart&quot; for his day being (one of) the finest academic minds of his generation. If today's scientists seem smarter it is only because they are standing on the shoulders of giants. A phrase, incidentally, most often attributed to Newton himself.</p></div>		</li>
