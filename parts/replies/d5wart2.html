			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer in terms of what we know in cognitive psychology today, and should be at the top. I took one of my graduate classes with Kosslyn, and he had us read all the papers in the debate between him and Pylyshyn. You do a great job of succinctly and clearly paraphrasing the two sides in that brilliant 20+ year debate. Just wanted to add a couple things.</p>
<p>First, Kosslyn's high-level takeaway (which I agree with), derived in large part from studies in which they created &quot;virtual lesions&quot; using TMS on low-level visual areas, is consistent with a kind of dual-coding model, in which low-level detailed features require pictorial representations, while higher-level visual &quot;gist&quot; kinds of imagery are probably propositional. To take your example, you would need a pictorial representation to visualize the low level details on the rabbit (e.g., how long the whiskers are relative to the size of the nose say), but not for getting the basic shape of a rabbit (e.g., sort of a roundish mammal with long ears that sits on its haunches). The evidence for this is that it has been shown that pictorial-like representations occur in V1 and other low-level areas of the visual cortex (see below), and when you &quot;knock these areas out&quot; using TMS, people become unable to visualize details of a recalled image, but can visualize the bigger picture (no pun intended). Pylyshyn acknowledged that such pictorial-like representations exist in low-level visual areas, but claimed that they are epiphenomenal, and thus unnecessary for processing mental imagery (i.e., remembered images). The TMS research seems very hard to reconcile with that claim, which is the strongest support I know of for Kosslyn's view that pictorial representations play at least <em>some</em> role in mental imagery (Pylyshyn claimed they played absolutely <em>no role</em> whatsoever).</p>
<p>Second, a clarification on pictorial vs. propositional representations. Pictorial representations are defined by some kind of correspondence between &quot;neuron space&quot; and &quot;image space&quot;. That is, if Feature 1 of an image occurs closer to Feature 2 than to Feature 3 <em>in an image</em>, the neuron (or group of neurons or whatever) that represent Feature 1 are closer <em>in the brain</em> to the neurons that represent Feature 2 than they are to the neurons that represent Feature 3. This is basically the definition of a pictorial representation. In contrast, no such relationship is required in a propositional representation, because spatial relationships are coded as propositions (e.g., &quot;the shin bone connects to the thigh bone...&quot;). Furthermore, this definition helps clarify how pictorial representations might be useful and processable without resorting to a homunculus, as other systems in the brain could extract information from the spatial arrangement of the neurons representing this image, and presumably also translate such pictorial representations into proposition representations.</p>
<p>Third, I wanted to add one additional piece of evidence for pictorial representations that I think is really persuasive, and that comes largely from old studies on monkeys (although there are many more modern variants on such studies, with many different animals). In a classic study from a long time ago when it was considered OK to just kill monkeys for no good reason other than research, researchers pumped macaques full of radioactive isotopes, showed them a circular grid, and then killed them and were able to get images of the neural activation from the grid because of the radioactive isotopes (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v15/n7/box/nrn3766_BX1.html" target="_blank">check out figures Aa and Ab in this paper</a>). The abstract of that paper also gives an excellent summary of pictorial-like representations (what they call &quot;retinotopic maps&quot;).</p>
<p>That's all. Kudos /u/albasri on the excellent response. Give this man some more upvotes people!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the nice comments!</p>
<p>Re your last point: I don't think anyone doubts that there are retinotopic representations <em>when you are actually looking at something</em>. The question is whether they are activated (to the same extent) when you are imagining something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. The TMS evidence isn't direct confirmation for mental imagery, but given that retinotopic maps are widely agreed to exist, combined with the TMS evidence, makes that data much more consistent with pictorial explanations than propositional ones. It's not a home run, but certainly a single or double that any purely propositional argument must reconcile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience is that both are right. I myself am mostly limited to a Propositional View, but I know quite a few people that are able to basically play a full color full motion movie in their mind. Isn't it possible both are right and it depends on the person which of the two, and to what degree, applies to them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, as is often the case in psychology, the answer is a mix of the two extreme views. This is the dual coding hypothesis / theory</p></div>		</li>
