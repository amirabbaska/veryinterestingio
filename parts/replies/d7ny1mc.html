<p>On the flip side, these guys stood at ground zero under a nuclear blast and all six are either still alive or lived another 40 or 50 years, they kept on not dying of radiation poisoning or cancer from the blast.</p>

<p>It was a relatively tiny, 2kt bomb detonated 3 miles away. That's 1/7th the size of the bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima, which itself was detonated at an altitude of only about a third of a mile above the ground. It's like being hit by a little kid on a bicycle instead of a truck doing 60 mph.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems kinda messed up to force a Japanese dude to stand under an A-bomb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That pre-partial-test-ban atmospheric detonation though.  Just a nice light sprinkle of carbon-14 for, oh say, most of the planet.  Just the faintest dusting from each of a few thousand such tests, until atmospheric levels of carbon-14 double over ten years.  The wisdom of man right there.  It's like the cosmic version of eating a taco twelve pack and getting back in the car with your buds on a road trip.  Bruhhhh, my mounds are vibrating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BUT MAYBE, releasing so much C-14 into the atmosphere over such a short time period isn't such a bad thing since it's enabled radiocarbon dating, which has provided a lot of scientific benefits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think maybe you are joking, but that's not how that works.  At all.  The spike is an extra variable that has to be corrected for.  The natural background level is more than enough for radiocarbon dating.</p>
