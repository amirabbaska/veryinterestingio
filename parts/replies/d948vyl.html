			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you got diagnosed! It was like a weight lifted off me when I finally was able to treat it properly and it improved. </p>
<p>Also sorry that I forgot to add that men can have this condition too. It's more common in women but it affects nearly 1% of the world's population. 70 million people!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to just be rid of the sweat glands in general! I didn't realize that was an option for some people. My doctor doesn't think my case is bad enough for some of the more aggressive treatments, but I have heard about the Botox thing. And my doc says laser hair removal can help, but it doesn't fix the actual problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My condition is considered mild and I have pretty minimal scarring, but sometimes the larger cysts would drain on their own. I had to try really hard not to mess with the cysts bc they're painful and it's so tempting to just try and pop 'em lol. if you're into that kinda stuff here's some photos of severe HS. Definitely NSFL</p>
