			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the first right answer I've read, but it's crazy long. </p>
<p>The ELI5 version that a five year old would actually listen to:
Some bee colonies are maintained by bee keepers to help make food, and some are wild colonies. Every year, the bee keepers lose some number of their hives: normally it's about 15 hives in every 100 they own. When the bees get really sick - because of bugs that hurt them or because of chemicals that hurt them - the bee keepers started losing 36 hives out of every 100. This really hurts the bee keepers because it makes it harder to make money if you're losing 20 more hives a year.</p>
<p>However, the price of honey has also increased. Every year, bee keepers split their hives and are able to produce more hives and more bees. Because honey prices are good, bee keepers have been making more hives for themselves. If you have 100 hives, you might lose 30 because the bees are sick, but you might be able to create another 50 hives by splitting them up. So in the end, you'd have 120 hives but it was a little harder than it used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is... Enviromental issues are hard to explain to a five year old. Which is really frustrating, because that's the main audience of a lot of enviromental education, or at least in my experience. That and so much of the media already waters down enviromental issues so that they are easily consumable... Which is probably why this question is being asked...</p>
<p>I've tried working with kids in enviromental education, but I can't water things down. It's too frustrating for me not to explain the details. I also think it doesn't do them any good to tell them half the story. There is a lot of gray in enviromental issues, yet so much is painted as black and white.</p>
<p>I also think it tells them that details aren't important. Then they grow up and don't care about details. Then they read something that says &quot;Beepocalypse is going to happen in 5 years!&quot; But then it doesn't, and they start to distrust researchers and scientists... And you get a mess. This happens on both sides- both enviromental activists and industry in enviromental science's case.</p>
<p>And so already I want pick apart your ELI5 version... Sorry...</p>
<p>But all bees don't live in colonies. Some are solitary- a lot are actually. And those wild bees face different issues than domesticated bees. The habitat loss is very important to explain, in my opinion, because too many people think of a honey bee and think that's what all bees are like. It's also the main reason for many wild bee species populations going down, not pesticides or parasites, though those don't help. That and people don't always realize that wheat and corn are wind pollinated and soy is self pollinatex- unless they grew up around them- and thus take away habitat from bees. </p>
<p>Also, it's not a bugs that hurt them OR chemicals, it's... Both. It's a combined effort, apparently. At least, that's what Australia seems to point to it being. I think this is important to explain, because many people look at enviromental issues as &quot;one particular thing caused this, so it must be banned/fixed/etc.&quot; And it's almost never this simple. It could have negative impacts too, and then people will say it didn't work, and then trust is at stake. </p>
<p>I tend to stay away from the word chemical, because of just how crazy people get about the term. I don't want to teach kids that chemicals are bad, so I would want to use the term pesticide- which... aren't automatically bad either, but... It's not as broad of a term as chemical at least. Though, I did debate this at a place I volunteered so... You aren't the first to say that to me.</p>
<p>I didn't even mention economics... But that is another effect of this all. I've heard that bee products will remain high for years after the bee recover so beekeepers can make up lost profits. </p>
<p>I guess assumed that even though it says ELI5 that these people here are still adults or late teens... Like I said, I tried early childhood environmental education, and I just couldn't water it that far down. Guess it's high school teacher or profesor for me!</p>
<p>Though the mimicry thing was a bit much... Oops...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they aren't as sweet as bees, due to their lack of honey!</p>
<p>It's tough to find population data on insects because... Well... I guess no one is out there counting them. Not too many insects are listed on IUCM's RedList- the list that shows if an animal (or plant or other organism, can't forget the rest of the crew!) Is endangered and why. There just isn't a lot of data out there on them.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if they are pollinating more since wild bees are in decline. My guess is that they pollinate different things then bees... I know parasitic wasps like umbrella-y flowers, like dill, carrot, fennel and cilantro.i don't see too many big wasps pollinating things in my parent's garden though, nor the blueberries or apples in their field... I might just be missing them though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it, not sweet enough due to lack of honey. ELI5 enough for me. </p>
<p>Seriously though, we figured out bees, we can’t figure a wasp? They just wired to be little bitter bastards? Or there’s no economic motive to and they’re jerks anyways so what’s the point. what if wasps are just misunderstood. </p>
<p>And why the hell isn’t there reliable data of every insect population on earth? </p></div>		</li>
