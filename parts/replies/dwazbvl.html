			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, I assume that since the name “Earth” is of English-German origin, meaning “ground”, in interplanetary terms Earth will be referred to as “Terra”, which is what most Romance Languages (Spanish, Italian, French) have some form of, and the term “earthquake” would remain defined as the same action that occurs on “Terra” as it is “Mars”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earthquake would still be a gramatically correct term, even on Mars.  There is a difference between Earth and earth.  Earth with a capital E is obviously used as a proper noun for our planet's namesake.  Earth with a lowercase e is used to describe ground in general.  There could of course be confusion on what is meant with either Earth or earth occur as the first word of a sentence, but context can be used to differentiate.  Also, as humanity grows to become an interplanetary species, languages will likely also change to accomodate phrases and expressions that were created from an Earthly perspective.  For example:</p>
<p>Earth is a word used to describe soil or ground.</p>
<p>Vs.</p>
<p>Planet Earth is the 3rd planet in the solar system.</p>
<p>Starting a sentence with &quot;Planet Earth&quot; for the sake of clarity may become more common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The result of.  Mars crust locked solid very quickly preventing plate tectonics.  The one hotspot Mars had didn't move and since the plates didn't move, the volcano just grew and grew over millions of years.  Think of how massive Iceland would be if not for the constant splitting of the plates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And the regular exercise - although I'll admit portion size probably has more to do with it.</p></div>		</li>
