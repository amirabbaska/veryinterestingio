<p>I learned to do pap smears and pelvic exams and male rectal exams with paid volunteers, by the way. They were all doing it as a public service so that other people wouldn't have to suffer thru incompetent examiners.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I let a military doc in training do a pap and...something else, colposcopy, perhaps or something like that. I was his first ever. He was awesome and gentle. (Also, really hot.)</p>
<p>I often let students do stuff, if/when I can, esp if it's no big deal.</p>
<p>When I was in my late teens, early 20s, (my medical group kept people in pediatrics until 21,) I had REALLY BAD ear infections that day (and tended to have them all my life.) My pediatrician asked me if she could have a group of students come look because I had some of the worst ear infections she'd seen, in her 20+ year career, for starters, and because usually they see them in small children, who are screaming in pain and have no idea what's going on. I was just sitting there. The pain was more than manageable for me, so I had her bring in a large group of students to take a look in my ears.</p>
<p>I'm all for furthering medical education, when I can. There are times this does not apply. Like with blood draws and needles. The trainer can show and talk the students thru the procedure as the trainer does it, but I don't do well with needles.  I have had a few awesome nurses give some tips, and a few awful nurses teach me to ask for someone more competent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago I had to bring a friend to the ER for a non-life threatening injury. While waiting on the bed, we heard the nurse talking to the patient on the other side of the curtain about giving her what I assume was a Nasogastric tube. The nurse literally said “of all the things I have to do to people, this is one of the worst.” Then she described it. Suddenly the fishhook in my friends foot didn’t seem so bad. </p></div>		</li>

<p>First we work on <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tWcOyg1.jpg" target="_blank">typodonts</a> set into a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FKuhHte.jpg" target="_blank">mannequin</a>, and then we work on each other. After that, we have student-run clinics at the school that are open to the public, and then we finish up with rotations in the community. We bring our own patients to our clinical board exams for licensure, after screening an appropriate candidate from the school clinic (they must meet certain diagnostic criteria).</p>
<p>These hygiene school clinics are a great resource for the community, because they are very cheap, and the fee covers all needed hygiene treatment, including full-mouth radiographs (x-rays) and oral cancer screenings. Patients of all ages and diagnostic levels are needed for students to meet their clinical requirements, so uninsured adults, children and geriatrics can receive the treatment they need but may not be able to afford. For those who have gone years without treatment and have advanced periodontal disease, this can mean receiving $2000 worth of treatment for a very small amount of money. </p>
<p>The trade-off is time. These are not quick appointments like in a professional practice, because everything is being observed, checked and graded by faculty. Even low-level patients should expect 2-3 appointments of around 3 hours each, and more involved patients should expect 4-6 appointments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would volunteer. I like students learning. Dentists frequently call other dentists in to come look at my teeth. Apparently, I have really nice chompers. So my dentists like brag to other dentists in the practice about my teeth and show them to each other. It's an incredibly weird thing to hear. &quot;Your teeth are beautiful. Hey Fred! Uhm, do you mind if I show Dr. Johnson your teeth? They're beautiful. Haven't seen this nice of a set in a long time.&quot; (As I write this, I'm suddenly concerned a nice set of teeth is code for a nice rack, but, they really did seem to nerd out on my teeth, and usually, my chest is well draped in the chair.)</p>
<p>It's happened on multiple occasions by different dentists. So I like going to the dentist. Total ego boost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question. I used my schools student dentist service. It was totally worth for how cheap it was. But do y'all ever fudge the numbers a bit to get people to work on? The chick in my mouth seemed skeptical about if I'd be worth her final exam. Seemed like she had to have a few backroom talks with her teacher. But it worked out.</p>
<p>Then I get a call a month later saying OOOOOOH appearantly you did have like 2 cavities! Which they totally did cheap again but I just found it funny that a bunch of dentist never saw the damn cavities for the 6+ hours they were in my mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those things that's hard to explain, but easy to understand once you've set your mind to it (ie, practiced it). The spongy feel of a vein and the feel of securing a line seems so simple once you've done it enough, but the only way to get that comfortable is to just do it. You'll come across plenty of valves, rollers, sclerotic, necrotic, and just plain bad sticks before you feel confident in a stick, and even then nothing is assured. I personally don't fear needles as much as the average person and while I'm a good stick I don't mind a miss or a fish, but I understand the apprehension others feel at being stuck.</p></div>		</li>
