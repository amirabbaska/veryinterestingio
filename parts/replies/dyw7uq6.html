<p>Proteins are very large molecules that are typically designed to function in a certain range (of temperature, pH, ...). For most proteins, that range does not include typical cooking temperatures. On a molecular level, the heat imparted by cooking is enough to undo some of the bonds that give protein its structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heat doesn't break covalent bonds, the &quot;real&quot; bonds in a protein. It does mess up all the non-covalent interactions that ensure the protein folds the right way though.</p>
<p>For comparison, hydrogen bonds (one of the stronger non-permanent interactions) usually have bond energies in the low tens of kJ/mol, while covalent bonds are in the hundreds of kJ/mol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If disulfide bonds are covalent and disulfide bonds are part of tertiary and quaternary protein structure, does that mean that they don’t get broken by heat and if a protein were to have only disulfide bonds in its tertiary or quaternary structure it wouldn’t denature at high temperatures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disulfide bonds generally do not get broken by heat. </p>
<p>They sort of don't fit into the usual categorization of protein structure that well; chemically they're more like the primary structure (peptide bonds forming each polypeptide chain), but they're holding together different parts of the chains and thus have a major effect on the tertiary and quaternary structure. And there are usually only a comparatively small number of them.</p>
<p>Disulfide bonds alone are usually not enough to preserve the protein's proper folded structure against heat or salt or pH denaturation, but they do help. Many proteins that are normally located in a reducing environment may become unstable in oxidative environments just from the cleavage of disulfide bonds.</p></div>		</li>
