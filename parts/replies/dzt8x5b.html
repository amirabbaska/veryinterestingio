			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is sooo cool.  Thanks for explaining this in detail, but also in a really easy way to digest.  </p>
<p>Do you ever have to worry about an image getting over saturated using this method?  I suspect not, but would love hear if it's ever a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you're asking if it's possible to collect too much light? The answer is mostly yes, but it's more likely that a certain bright thing will have too much light while the rest of the frame will look black, though I don't have particular experience with astrophotography. Here's as short an explanation as I could give as to how that plays out.</p>
<p>A common dslr camera has three adjustable settings, and you multiply them together to know the quantity of light that the sensor records. But, you set them based on your guess of how much light there will be, and there are tradeoffs. </p>
<p><strong>ISO:</strong> this is how sensitive the sensor is. What's the smallest quantity of light that should be recorded? The higher the ISO, the faster you can take the shot, but it also means random energy will be recorded as light. So, higher ISO means more grainy shots. A sensor will basically count how many photons hit each pixel. Thats what he was referring to in saying that you get about one electron per pixel, so how bright should that show up in the photo. </p>
<p><strong>Aperture:</strong> this is the size of the opening. A larger opening lets in more light. The bigger the aperture the more light is let in, but it also makes the image blurrier. A pinhole aperture is extremely clear, but it would take forever to record the image. This is what he was referring to in saying that you might have a 3&quot; circle lens (but it's squared, because the area is what matters). </p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> this is how long you leave the sensor exposed. Obviously the longer you leave it exposed, the more light you'll record, but things could be moving in that time. This is what he was referring to by saying that you might wait 1000s.</p>
<p>These three values are multiplied together. I'm ignoring the math, but the point is that you have to balance these three things and their tradeoffs. If you double the sensitivity, then you could half the time or half the area, or any combination. This multipled value is known as the Exposure, which is just a measure of how much light you want total. A camera on auto will probably just guess an exposure that looks good (18% is about right for an everyday snapshot, but stats would be mostly black and have a lower value), or you can tell it how much exposure you want.</p>
<p>Finally we're getting close to answer your question. Photos can certainly be overexposed, like if you maxed out all those three settings and then photographed a light bulb. But that would be a terribly boring photo, so you'd just dial the settings down to an exposure that looks good.</p>
<p>The thing is, you can't expose every part of the scene identically. If you're shooting the moon, you'd want the moon to be a nice and bright gray, but you'd want the sky to be very dark (maybe a nice deep purple), and you'd want some stars to be bright as well. There's a huge difference in the magnitude of light from the moon as from the sky, but you need light from both of them. The moon might be literally a billion times as bright as the stars behind it. This is called the <strong>Dynamic Range:</strong> the ratio of the brightest thing to the darkest thing, in this case a billion to one. That might be too high for the camera to handle, because their dynamic range isn't as good as your eye's. So, you'd have to pick if you want a picture of the moon with no stars (they'd look pure black, because they're too weak to show up at all) or if you want a picture of the sky with a nearly-white moon. This is called <em>blowing out the highlights,</em> with highlights being the brightest parts of a shot. You could purposely manipulate this dynamic range for artistic effect, like by taking a sunset photo of your friend as a pure black silhouette.</p>
<p>But in this case, you want to see everything in the photo: the sky, the stars, and the moon. So, you use a technique called <strong>Bracketing</strong> (multiple similar photos) to get a <strong>High Dynamic Range</strong> shot. Your camera may have a dynamic range of a million to one, which is a thousand times weaker than you need. So, you take two photos, one of the stars, and one of the moon, and you stack these exposures in the computer. You probably change the ISO when you do this. Basically, you lay them on top of each other, and you use the moon from one photo and the sky from the other. This is closer to how reality feels to a human, even though it's less precisely how the camera saw the scene. HDR gets a bad rap sometimes because it can be used to create photos that look unreal (which you may or may not like), but when it's done nicely, it's very helpful. I'm using the example of the moon in a sky because any amateur can try that shot, but stars and other celestial phenomena have widely varying magnitudes as well. </p>
<p>So, TLDR: while the whole photo may not be &quot;saturated&quot; (over-exposed), specific portions of it can be. The more shots you take at various settings, the more you can mitigate this effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction, ISO is not how sensitive a sensor is, it's simply a multiplier. Changing the ISO will not cause the sensor to gather more/less light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are two things here: each exposure and the total cumulative exposure time. You want each individual exposure to be a good optimization in terms of signal to noise ratio in the relevant pixels, so you want more than just tiny signals, you want something that's a significant fraction of the exposure limit given the brightness of the scene. However, there are other noise sources such as readout noise which will be constant per image, you not only want to ensure that the exposure is long enough so that it's not swamped by that noise source but you want to be able to do the trick of adding together multiple pixel aligned images of the same scene to be able to cancel out that particular source of noise and enhance the overall dynamic range of the image. So there are tradeoffs with different optimizations at play.</p>
<p>I should note that when you add up multiple shots that are each individually properly exposed you won't have a problem of over saturation (depending on the tools you're using), but you might need to do some processing on the image to preserve the right level of brightness and contrast of the object of interest without necessarily blowing out other elements of the image, especially at the bit depth of the given final file format.</p>
<p>As for individual exposures, there are tradeoffs there and one of them is the risk of overexposing a bright star in the scene and just accepting that as a cost of being able to pick up more detail in a dimmer feature like a nebula or distant galaxy that is the subject you care about.</p></div>		</li>
