			<div class="markdown"><p>We mentioned biological data in social psychology. The professor mentioned that some studies indicated the average person's circadian clock was about 25 hours, but that's the middle of the normal bell curve and some people are significantly shorter than that and some people are significantly longer than that. I believe one person measured a 17.something hour internal clock, but that was an extreme example.</p></div>		</li>
