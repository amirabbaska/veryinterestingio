<p>quantum key distribution, uses quantum mechanics to guarantee secure communication. It enables two parties to construct a shared secret, which can then be used to establish confidentiality in a communication channel. QKD has the unique property that it can detect tampering from a third party -- if a third party wants to observe a quantum system, it will thus collapse some qubits in a superposition, leading to detectable anomalies. QKD relies on the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics instead of the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems</p>

<p>So potentially quantum computing could make communications MORE secure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are under the misconception that breaking hard encryptions will keep getting easier as we develop new technologies. The natures of quantum encryption methods are such that they should not get easier to break as technology develops, as they are based on things that are actually mathematically, logically, or physically impossible to reliably break.</p>
<p>For example, the concept of a hash is such that hashing an amount of data (say, a password) will be very different from hashing the same password with a minor change, but also that multiple passwords may hash to the same value. Given only one hash (and any good password hashing setup will salt, so we'll even give you that too), the user's actual password is still unguessable.* No amount of quantum computing will be able to tell you that the user's password is definitely [this] and not [that] because if [this] and [that] hash to the same value, then the hash contains not even an indication of difference between the two. In addition, the number of [that]s that you could have is infinite because hashes are finite length, so infinitely many things hash to the same value. Add onto that that you can write your own hashing function and you introduce an unlimited amount of variability in the relationship between the original password and the hashed version. All guesses have 0 reliability, even if you had the computing power of a divine being because you're missing information that you can't guess based on context.</p>
<p>(*I will note that hash collision is the current method for guessing at hashes, but if you have a secret custom hashing function, there is not even a way to do collision.)</p>
<p>The hope is, of course, that companies will switch to these new practices before quantum computing reaches the ease and availability such that the old techniques are breakable. More secure institutions (banks especially) will switch earlier (and some already have).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most or all are, if I'm not mistaken. Quantum computing isn't magic—it can solve certain problems very quickly (in theory) but it isn't especially useful for brute force, which is the only way to break a well designed symmetric scheme. Quantum computing would only be a major problem for public key but, as you said, there are very promising alternatives to the &quot;hard problems&quot; currently used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not true. Quantum computing can use grovers algorithm to search for a value in O(sqrt N) time. Classical searches for a random key over a space of N possible keys takes O(N). This means quantum computers can attack AES-128 the same as classical computers can attack AES-64. This is why the NSA insisted on 256 bit keys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the current state of symmetric ciphers, no set key size is 'safe' for an indefinite amount of time, independent of QC. NIST is already adjusting key size recommendations every 12-18 months. Grover's algorithm is just a leap in that direction, but does not break them. This is why I used the term '<em>resistant</em>'.</p></div>		</li>
