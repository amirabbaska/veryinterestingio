			<div class="markdown"><p>But how do you space out decimals in scientific notation? Goruping the first three would not correspond to the thousands, millions, billons of the grouping for normal numbers. </p>
<p>Does 123 456.789 become 1.234 567 89E5?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The definition of million and billion has changed in the last hundred years. There is the long million and the short million. The US uses the short million and the UK changed to that somewhat recently. Germany still uses the long million. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Choices in digit grouping has a history of variation. European languages tend to use three as this corresponds to groups of thousands, China/Japan/Korea also use this even though their language divisions are in myriads (10 000). India is easily the most complex with the first 3 digits closest to the decimal separator being a group, then grouping in two. (10 00 00 000.)</p>
<p>In terms of more recent standards, there is a growing harmony to use groups of three with a thin space in between. This can be used on either side of the decimal separator, keep in mind that this is to serve one function: make the number easier to glance - there are a lot of common sense scenarios where you don't use groupings.</p></div>		</li>
