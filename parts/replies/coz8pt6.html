			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only half of the complete truth. in fact, particles that are large enough to be called &quot;crumb&quot; are not even able to be eaten by alveolar macrophages, let alone actually reaching the alveole. It would block parts of the bronchiole tree and not get further.</p>
<p>There are generally 3 different mechanisms of clearing airways and lungs, and which one is the predominant one depends on the size of the particle in question: coughing, mucociliary clearance and alveolar phagocytosis.</p>
<p>Coughing is probably the most well known one. Larger particles (including what would be understood by as crumbs) touch the surface of the airways and stimulate special neurons inside of the walls of the airways (the neurons are very close under the surface, directly under the so called epithelium). Once stimulated, the signal is sent to the brain where the breathing muscles are ordered to coordinate in such a way that air is very quickly and strongly expelled in short bursts; this causes a high degree of turbulence with which larger particles are sent flying outside.</p>
<p>Second one is mucociliary clearance. This pertains to particles (and microorganisms) that are typically microscopically small and/or so lightweight that they don't stimulate the &quot;coughing neurons&quot;, but are large enough to not be eaten by macrophages (although there is quite a bit of crossover). The airways are covered in a thick film of mucus. Underneath the mucus are very very small hairs that rhythmically beat in the 'up' direction (towards the throat), called <del>kino</del>cilia. What happens is that most particles attach to the sticky mucus layer and the mucus is transported to the throat where the mucus gets then reflectively swallowed (thus landing in the digestive tract). Another way to picture this is that the airways are covered in a large sticky &quot;fly trap&quot; that gets automatically cleaned and cleared via a conveyor belt principle. This is probably the most important mechanism to keep your lungs free of e.g. dust and pathogens. Depending on how exactly small we define our hypothetical crumb, this could be the dominant mechanism for our scenario as well. </p>
<p>The last one is the aforementioned phagocytosis from alveolar macrophages within the lung. The particles they clear need to be small enough that they a) reach the alveoles of lungs without sticking to the mucus and b) the macrophages can actually eat them. Phagocytosis becomes also increasingly more important the higher the load of the particle is in the breathing air since the mucus is not 100% efficient in catching every particle if you are breathing a whole lot of the particles at once, for example during smoking.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'd like to add that the system is not perfect, and in the comment discussion below are various examples when these mechanisms fail.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: it's been brought to my attention that apparently the hairs in the respiratory wall lining are called cilia, not kinocilia, whereas the (motile) cilia in the inner ear are called kinocilia. This is unusual to me because at least in German literature (take a guess where I am from), kinocilia are generally called cilia with a distinct architecture of cytoskeletal filament proteins (a ring of 9 pairs of microtubules and a pair right in the middle, or 9x2+2). The cilia of the respiratory tract fulfill that criterium and therefore are commonly called kinocilia here. Does anyone have an idea where that discrepancy stems from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome question. There are a few things that <em>may</em> have factored in this case (based on pathophysiology of this man's disease).</p>
<p>Foremost is the nature of COPD, which he has. <strong>C</strong>hronic <strong>O</strong>bstructive <strong>P</strong>ulmonary <strong>D</strong>isease is defined by &quot;air trapping&quot;, usually through a combination of decreased elasticity of the lung tissue (emphysema) and blockage of the larger conductive airways (usually chronic bronchitisâ†’mucus and cell hyperplasia). This man's COPD means he is predisposed for stuff (air, mucus, and even peas) to get caught in the air sacs. In fact, COPDers can have <em>huge</em>, single air cavities in their lungs called <em>bullae</em>. These airspaces make it really hard for your body to clear foreign material, leading to pneumonias, abscesses, and &quot;COPD exacerbations&quot;.</p>
<p>Second, COPD is usually caused by smoking/smoke exposure, which also leads to fibrosis of the conductive airway tissue and loss of mucociliary clearance. It also causes loss of sensation in the airways, diminishing the cough reflex. This is why we often have to treat COPDers for aspiration pneumonias and abscesses. This man had a typical case of aspiration, especially in the setting of a recent hospitalization for an exacerbation. The only weird thing about it is that instead of chewed food/saliva/secretions (the usual stuff aspirated), he aspirated a whole pea. Peas and other legumes will start to sprout if they get wet, even if not in soil. Try putting some raw beans on a paper towel and keep it wet for 2 days to see what I mean. Same thing happened here, but in a lung.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only in the conductive airways. If something is small enough to make it to the tertiary bronchioles without getting stuck along the way, the ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium give way to non-ciliated Clara cells, which will eventually give way to pneumocytes involved in gas exchange. Distal to cilia transition it's phagocytosis by a resident macrophage. The airways at this point are quite narrow (&lt; 1mm)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm nitpicking here, but I just want to point out that we call the ciliated parts with goblet cells &quot;respiratory epithelium,&quot; and that ends when the conducting portion ends and the respiratory portion begins. So the epithelium of the respiratory portion is not called &quot;respiratory epithelium,&quot; which I think we can agree is really dumb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered what cilia in the lungs really look like! In the description of the photo,  it mentions the cilia cells are vulnerable to smoke,  etc. Any idea what the replenishment rate would be for cilia destroyed by something such as smoking? </p></div>		</li>
