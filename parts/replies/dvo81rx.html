			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly though, it wasn't all to surprising to hear in hindsight.  At 76 alongside his form of motor neurone disease living past the few years he was expected after being diagnosed?  Little surprising that he lived until his 70's.   I'd be more surprised if he passed in his 80's, given what he had to live through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stan Lee is getting into some potentially serious issues right now. He's fighting pneumonia and there are vultures circling aiming to steal his fortune as soon as he kicks the bucket. They're isolating him from the outside world and are refusing to let anything from him &quot;get out&quot;. It's a classic elder abuse situation right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think that people like him never die. They're just no longer with us. His words and advancements will live on forever as part of humanity's greatness.</p>
<p>He's alive as long as we remember him.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The question now is who is going to take up the mantle of the smartest motherfucker on the planet. I can’t think of anyone else on his level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edward Witten is a special mind as well.</p>
<p>I would be cautious about characterizing people as transcendent geniuses, however, without also observing that there are so many people out there with tremendous mental capabilities who don’t have the ability to exercise it due to poverty and lack of educational opportunities.</p></div>		</li>
