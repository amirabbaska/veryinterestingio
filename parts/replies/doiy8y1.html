<p>To be pedantic, the current does happen: charge carriers in the conductor will move due to Lorentz force until the EMF is established for a given velocity and field strength. This is why in a changing field or with a rotating conductor you end up with ac.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, my mistake. To clarify, you will build up a gradient with an internal bias, but in practice this happens in microseconds, much faster and less current than would be relevant for OPs question. Thank you for the clarification. </p></div>		</li>
