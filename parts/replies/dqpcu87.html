<p>I see battery recycling bins fairly commonly in front of stores--are they not being recycled in general, or just not specifically to recover the lithium?</p>
<p>Edit: and to clarify, I specifically mean lithium batteries--cell phones, rechargeables, laptop batteries, stuff like that. Not normal AA batteries or anything. I always see a bin for that stuff in front of Best Buy and Walmart. </p></div>		</li>

<p>From the battery producer point of view, there is no need, but from an environmentalist point of view it is a definite need. Too much of those stuff still hit the landfill, recycling initiatives might reduce that. My city has one, but I must admit I never checked it.</p></div>		</li>
