			<div class="markdown"><p>The key point is that the moon's gravitational effect on any particular point on Earth is constantly fluctuating whereas the Earth's is relatively constant at that same point.</p>
<p>Harnessing the Earths gravity while on earth effectively requires picking something up to let it fall, whereas harnessing the Moon's gravity from Earth requires just having an object or substance on earth for the Moon to to influence over and over as it orbits.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to throw out this video from PBS spacetime about how tides actually work. It's probably quite different from what most of us think. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4</a></a></p>
<p>Tides are not cause by decreasing the gravity directly under the moon. More, the moon's gravity acts on the entire ocean, and it is pulled from every direction toward the point directly under the moon. That's why tides are so big, even though the effect of moon's gravity on the spot directly below it is almost zero. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>problem is that gravity is a constant force.  wherever you go on the moon, there is gravity.  Its like asking if you can use a magnet to generate electricity.  The answer is no.  The magnet itself is not a source of energy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There is a *slight* difference of magnitude if your on the near side of the moon or the far side of the moon due to the distance, but your talking less than 1% further away, which doesn't mean a whole lot.  So sure, you pick a heavy weight up when your near to earth, and drop it when your half away, and it was 1gram lighter to pick up than it was to drop... but this variance would likely be well below the inefficiency of the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, moon's gravity effect on earth is the same as earth's gravity effect on the moon.</p>
<p>If you mean tides, then the effect is gonna be greater with a bigger diameter so the tidal forces and tidal effects on the moon are weaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this answer is almost correct.</p>
<p>Tide based energy is sort of using the moon to generate electricity, but really, most of the energy is coming from the rotation of the earth underneath the moon's gravity. Tides and technically tide based energy are slowing the Earth's rotation by a tiny, tiny amount. The reason we have tides isn't because the moon orbits the Earth, but rather that the Earth rotates under the moon's pull of the oceans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the earth was not rotating, we would still have tides, though they would be less frequent.</p>
<p>We're really extracting energy from the difference between the rotational speed of the earth and the orbital speed of the moon.</p>
<p>If the earth were not rotating (or if it were rotating slower than the moon orbits), then the tides would flow in the opposite direction and would be speeding up the earth by a tiny amount.</p>
<p>If the moon were in geostationary orbit, then the lunar tides would be still relative to both. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But if the Earth was tidally locked to the Moon (like the Moon is to Earth), we wouldn't have tides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't quite that simple.  The primary cause is the gravity differential between the pull from the Moon/Sun and the inertia of the ocean itself.  The net force on the ocean is toward the center of the Earth at the points 90 degrees off of the imaginary line between the center of the Earth and the Moon/Sun, ergo the ocean squishes at these points, bulging at the points centered on that line.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To refine it slightly: this is the reason the tides move relative to Earth's surface. If  the earth and moon didn't rotate relative to one another, there would be a permanent high-tide on the part of the Earth facing the moon, and another on the point directly opposite.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually, even if this were the case, there would still be (weaker) moving tides on Earth's surface, because tidal forces from the Sun would vary as the earth-moon system rotates.</p></div>		</li>
