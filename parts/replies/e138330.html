<p>Brick can expand up to 1 inch for every 60 feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expansion is temperature dependent.  From an NIST document published in 1941, the coefficient for the fire-clay bricks was about 3.7 x 10^-6 /°C.</p>
<p>An expansion of 1 in (25 mm) for every 60 feet (18 000 mm) would be a ratio of (18025/18000) 1.00139 and an expansion of 0.00139.  This would mean the brick temperature is at 375°C. </p>
<p>For one I can't imagine brick getting that hot and second for a row of bricks 18 m long to expand even by 25 mm would seem difficult if the structure is constrained.  </p>
<p>Can you provide some type of proof or calculation to back up your claim?  </p></div>		</li>
