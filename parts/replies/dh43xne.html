			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say suing the official for an illegal search is an option, are you saying that's how it would have to work? Does there always need to be a lawsuit for something like this? I was imagining something like a direct punishment like jail time or something. </p>
<p>Like if someone steals from a store, for example. Or does there still need to be some kind of lawsuit even in cases like this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A government could pass a (criminal) law making it illegal for government officials to violate people's constitutional rights in certain particular ways.  In such cases, the person who illegally obtained the evidence would face their own separate charges and trial for their actions.</p>
<p>While this would partially address the problem of individuals being forced to launch a suit at the same time as mounting a criminal defense, it would still leave a lot of problems.  First, there are obvious accountability issues: looking at recent police-related fiascos, do you <em>really</em> trust the threat of IA and sanctions to deter police from violating people's rights?  Second, it doesn't effectively deal with less deliberate violations, even though the person's rights have been equally violated.  Third, and perhaps most worryingly, it would allow the police (collectively) to conduct any illegal search they want so long as they have someone to throw under the bus.  This would probably turn illegal searches into merely another tool, albeit an incredibly expensive one which would be used sparingly.</p>
<p>In the end, the most practical way to deter police from conducting illegal searches is to ensure that there's no way they can benefit from doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed what I'm pretty sure is one of the biggest policy reasons against such penal codes. There is a pretty big (relatively speaking) grey area between a constitutional and unconstitutional search/seizure. We as a society vest police with the power to execute and enforce our laws. This is a dangerous and tough job that, in practice, requires a lot of split second judgment calls under often stressful circumstances. The Supreme Court has recognized this in generally granting a lot of latitude toward officers (do some research on the legal test for qualified immunity for an example, see Tennessee v. Garner) for just this reason: we want officers acting in the interest of justice, to solve the crime before them without having to second guess every decision they make with fear of criminal punishment for what may be an honest and well-intentioned mistake. The exclusionary rule is therefore the preferred method of deterring unconstitutional behavior by police. </p>
<p>Edit: To address the reply to this, there are of course exceptions, and police certainly should be prosecuted for egregious breaches of the Fourth Amendment committed with malintent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not simply add criminal punishment for illegal searches, AND keep the evidence inadmissible?</p>
<p>That way there's still no way people can benefit from illegal searches, and if they DO obtain something illegally, they face actual punishment for breaking the law.</p>
<p>I feel like Op's confusion was more of why people who break the law and obtain evidence illegally DONT get punished, rather than why we DO make the evidence inadmissible.</p>
<p>To use OP's analogy of stealing from a store, it would be like if you get caught stealing and convicted, you JUST dont get to keep the stuff you stole, and you dont face any punishment. Sure, taking away whatever they stole ensures that they cant benefit from it, but it doesnt <em>punish</em> them for committing a crime, it just puts them back where they started. They havent lost anything; theyve just failed to gain.</p>
<p>Like, to start, youre at 0. If you obtain something illegally and benefit from it, thats plus 1 point, so now youre at 1 instead of 0. If youre allowed to keep what you stole, you stay at +1, but if they dont let you keep it, you go back to 0. Then, if you get punished with jail time or a fine or some such, thats not a benefit, its a loss. So thats minus 1 points. </p>
<p>So basically, if someone starts off at 0, and steals something (or obtains evidence illegally) that puts them at +1. Making the evidence inadmissible (or not letting them keept what they stole) ONLY puts them back at 0; back to the status quo, whereas an actual punishment would put them at -1.</p>
<p>Simply not being allowed to keep what you stole isnt a punishment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in perhaps more simple terms, the police (who do the potentially illegal searches) and the district attorney (who would be responsible for bringing charges for illegal searches) are on the same team. People accused of crimes (and their defense attorneys, I suppose) are the other team. The judiciary are the referees. If, as suggested, illegal searches were admissible but with possible criminal penalties on those conducting illegal searches, that's kind of like letting one team call their own fouls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that illegally obtaining evidence is not always intentional or nefarious. In fact, it usually isn't. You seem to be thinking of situations where the cops or prosecutors doctored evidence, falsified records, planted evidence, etc. Something like that with a clear intent to act in an illegal fashion may very well result in jail time or serious sanctions. </p>
<p>But that's usually not how it happens. If you've ever watched law and order you'll recall that it's usually a casual mistake or technicality. Also, the rules of evidence are very complicated, and cops are not lawyers to begin with. Often they have to make a split second decision. </p>
<p>In addition, whether to use illegal evidence in the case at hand against the defendant, versus whether to punish the individual that illegally obtained the evidence, are two completely different things. They're mutually exclusive. You can exclude the evidence and also punish the evidence gatherer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to doctor, plant, or otherwise falsify evidence for there to be clear malicious intent. In my educational experience, 9 times out of 10, it boils down to evidence obtained from an illegal search(re. without a warrant). And yes, it is malicious intent, because that officer is very aware of how to conduct proper, legal searches. They willingly choose not to for whatever reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment mistakes fraud, &quot;doctored evidence, falsified records, planted evidence&quot;, for illegal searches under the 4th amendment.  The examples that you give are criminal and the perpetrator would be potentially be subject to prosecution.</p>
<p>An example of an illegal search would be the search of a person's car or home without a warrant.  This type of illegal search would lead to inadmissible evidence in court.  To go further, there is also a doctrine called &quot;the fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; which states that any evidence found based off of inadmissible evidence is also inadmissible.  So if a detective illegally searched someone home and found maps or notes, and then followed that information to find additional evidence against the accused, that additional evidence would also be inadmissible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... what he's saying, in that instance... would be a crime. And the government official <em>would be</em> guilty of <em>that</em> crime.</p>
<p>Thus, jail would be a suitable punishment. I mean, we're talking about throwing out illegally obtained evidence versus punishing the erson that illegally obtained it. Whoever throws it out and whoever knows they threw it out would also be committing a crime called 'tampering with evidence' and should be held as an accomplice to the original crime that was committed aka illegally obtaining the evidence.</p>
<p>It's still a crime that should be dealt with. Just like how in Minnesota, Sunday liquor sales have been reinstated after 150+ years, but only after July 2, 2017. Surdyk's Cheese and Fine Wines opened for business a Sunday in March and now, because they still broke the law even after the bill was passed, they can't be open the month of July.</p>
<p>It's called deterrence, it still requires a punishment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer. I would just like to add that since the world isn't perfect, we have to deal with practical solutions to problems that are less than perfect.</p>
<p>For instance, it is best that our legal system sometimes let guilty people go free. Why is this? Because it is good to have a very high standard of proof required of the prosecution so that innocent people don't end up getting easily convicted on flimsy evidence. Sure, you would like guilty people convicted on flimsy evidence, but there is not good way to reliably tell guilty from innocent, so we try to convict no one on flimsy evidence to prevent as many innocent people going to prison as possible.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is best that our legal system occasionally convicts an innocent person. Why? Because if we held prosecution to such a high standard that no innocent person was ever convicted, we also wouldn't convict very many guilty people. Cases would need to be iron clad with multiple eye witnesses and physical evidence. Most criminals don't leave such an obvious trail.</p>
<p>So, back to the question. It is better to let some guilty people go free because police were sloppy with their evidence gathering than it is to allow police to be sloppy with their evidence gathering on everyone. After all, do you really want police breaking into people's houses looking for evidence without court oversight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, and I can definitely see both sides of this argument. This is going to be a long answer because my opinion is nuanced.</p>
<p>People who are specifically engaged in keeping the government's secrets, like analysts for the NSA, should be prosecuted for revealing those secrets. Basically it should not be left up to the analyst to decide whether revealing classified information is legally permissible or not. That analyst should be completely precluded from revealing that information outside of proper channels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I am not opposed to having some government office designated as the place where whistleblowers can go without fear of prosecution. Of course that office would have to be outside the realm of the top secret world, say maybe one of the offices that reports to Congress rather than to the President ultimately.</p>
<p>The government's interest in keeping secrets is important enough that I'm willing to prosecute that analyst rather than allow top secret information to be revealed without consequences. Even though I may be glad the information was revealed. This would be analogous to saying that the rights of citizens with regard to police evidence gathering are important enough that we will let some criminals escape due to our strict rules about evidence.</p>
<p>Note specifically, I am glad Snowden leaked the information he did and I think the government engaged in unacceptable activity, but I still think he should be prosecuted in order to maintain the power of the government to keep secrets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's how it works in Germany, by the way. No &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot;-doctrine here, for exactly that reason.</p>
<p>Although it's worth noting that criminal prosecution works somewhat different here. In the US, the criminal procedure is <del>contradictory</del>adversarial, with the prosecution working only for the state and against the defendant. In Germany, the prosecution is obliged to help discovering the truth, and to exonerate the accused if possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that the United States has an adversarial system but if it discovers evidence that exonerates or helps the defendants case they're obligated to share it. This is called a Brady disclosure or Brady material. If the prosecution feels that the evidence is entirely exculpatory, then they're encouraged to use their discretion and drop the case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's typically not a prosecutable crime. By &quot;illegal&quot; search they mean unconstitutional which just means it is not allowed under law. Unless you find an independent basis on which to try someone, an unconstitutional search isn't necessarily a basis to prosecute an officer for a crime especially given their qualified immunity. </p>
<p>That said, they're not mutually exclusive. But as our friend above explained the only way to discourage your rights being violated is by tossing the ill-gotten receipts of that unconstitutional action. If you allowed it then what's the point of the constitution?</p></div>		</li>
