			<div class="markdown"><p>However another idea I don’t understand is if we do the opposite. If we weld the last two balls and only raise the first ball. My physics teacher said that ball 1 would rebound because it can’t transfer all its momentum to the last two balls. Why is that so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting... My assumption would be that the last double ball would still move, but only half as much, because transfer of momentum will still occur. But I'm not a physics teacher! Now I want to buy a Newton's cradle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Double the mass, means double the inertia. Those two balls  welded together really don’t want to move, so the energy gets transmitted, then reflected back.</p></div>		</li>
