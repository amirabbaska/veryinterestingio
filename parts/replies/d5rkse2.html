<p>If you remove <em>c</em> here the units won't match up. That could be ignored, but it's useful for checking formulas.</p>

<p>No. At least on a computer and a calculator, it is very easy to save the physical constants and use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the person ranting is obviously not a physicist. Why not define ħ as 1? Why not define the Bohr radius as 1? Why isn't e defined as 1?</p>
<p>The same reason c isn't 1. The magnitude of that unit is not useful in daily life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a general relativist, I often use units in which G = c = 1.  It's very common in physics to make unit choices like this in order to make calculations simpler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although not practical in daily life as you said, you could define the others as 1 as well. In planck units, c, G, ħ and a few others to 1 as well, not just c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E wouldn't be expressed in Joules/ kg per (m/s)² anymore. Everything would get new units or even just be expressed as some sort of fraction. </p>
<p>Although you make a good point, having all those units is very convenient for checking formulas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree, but only with your last personal idea.</p>
<p>1 ml of water, 1 cmx1cm x 1cm, is something we can all visualize. Just as we can visualize and find useful the temperature that water freezes and boils at.</p>
<p>The speed of light in a vacuum? Not so much. Nothing in our ordinary existence gives us any means to compare or visualize. You look in the sky and see stars as they existed millions or billions of years ago. You turn on a light and it just turns on. There's no reference point for humanity.</p>
<p>MAYBE sound would be the better option. After all, given enough distance, you can discern the difference between seeing something happen vs hearing it happen. Lightning strikes, etc. It's not perfect, but at least its something.</p>
<p>Best still, measure speed over how far you travel if moving in a constant velocity for a set amount of time. That's something we all can relate to, walking, crawling, running, etc. We know distances.</p>
<p>If scientists only want to measure things as their fraction of the speed of light, let them do it. I'm sure you could write a excel function and be done with it, I don't get why it causes you headaches. But forcing the rest of us to think about exponents when trying to figure out things, that's just insane!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with using sound would be that it wouldn't actually solve the problems that I attempt to solve with my proposal (it's called Planck units, BTW), which is mostly to simplify a whole bunch of formulas. You'd have to use light. </p>
<p>But yeah, the general public would be like &quot;fuck you, I don't care about mass to energy conversion in nuclear power plants or weird quantum bullshit, I just want to buy a bunch of apples and some milk at the supermarket&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Personally, I believe that the objectively best measuring system would be purely based on physical constants. For example, the speed of light in a vacuum, or c, should be equal to 1. Every other speed would be a fraction of c. 50 km/h would be about 4.6*10-8 c. That may not seem like an improvement until you, until you start looking at various formulas. E²=(pc)². For daily usage, you could just decide that 10-9 c is called a nano-c. The 50 km/h I mentioned earlier would then become 46 nano-c. That seems practical enough to me. And it should be possible to to do the same for other physical quantities. It would make the life of a scientist a whole lot easier. </p>

<p>it is stupid to do that for everyday life.</p>
<p>but it is helpful in science and also done in science.</p>
<p>like for example planck units, where you set c, the gravitational constant,reduced planck constant, coulomb and boltzman constant to 1.</p>

<p>Stoney units are defined by:</p>
