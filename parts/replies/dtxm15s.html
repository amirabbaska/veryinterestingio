			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, you don't die from a fever unless your internal thermostat is gravely compromised. If the fever gets too high or is too high for too long, you go into seizure. Fairly recent research I've read (sorry, can't cite, at work), shows now that these seizures don't harm the brain like we thought but reset the body's internal thermostat, saving itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adaptive response. It's your body's regulatory system, not the infection, that's directly causing it. Your body is intentionally raising the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing. A Symptom is how your body reacts to the chemicals released by the pathogen in response. If it makes you vomit to try and purge the toxin, then vomiting is a symptom. If it causes a fever to try and kill it then fever is a symptom.</p></div>		</li>
