			<p>The supplementary information in this paper <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n10/full/ncomms2104.html" target="_blank">(Zheng, Wang, O'Conner, Zhou, 2012)</a>  has a phylogeny with sternum presence/absence data. It shows paired sternal plates or a fused sternum as present in pterosaurs, Ornithschia minus Pachycephalosaurs which they mark questionable, and sauropods. Theropods are more spotty: Ceratosaurs, Alvarezsaurs, Ornithomimosaurs, Oviraptors, Dromaeosaurs, Scansoriopterygidae, and Aves are marked as possessing sternal elements, no other Theropods are. There seems to be debate <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/pii/S0044523115000145#bib0200" target="_blank">(Lambertz and Perry, 2015)</a> about whether missing elements are absent or cartilagenous. </p>		</li>

			<p>So why do dinosaur diagrams now include sternums (with ribs coming out of them no less, a kind of 'chest plate') if they didn't have them? Even the T. Rex is often depicted with the sternum and front ribs.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd assume they have the same cartilagenous tissues we have in their rib assembly, which wouldn't fossilize as readily.</p>		</li>

			<p>I agree - it seems that while some may have had a similar structure where a sternum would be found, it was also made of cartilage.  Which I do not think survives the fossilization process - can anybody shed some light on this?  I am not actually in this field...<br><br>That being said, I also am having difficulties finding peer-reviewed sources that are readily available to support this.  Instead can only find non-peer reviewed articles or sources. <br><br>Please do take my comment with a grain of salt, it is mainly to discuss what I found, as I am not in the field.</p>		</li>

			<p>Cartilage is a soft tissue and cartilage being found in fossil form is extremely rare because it breaks down much faster than bone. You have roughly the same chance of finding cartilage that you do finding a chunk of skin.</p>		</li>

			<p>Basically, it's like feathers.  You won't find it in fossilized bones, but you could find evidence of it in fossilized mud if you're really, really lucky.</p>		</li>
