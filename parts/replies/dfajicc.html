			<div class="markdown"><p>I know better surface area in the brain is better, but I've never really understood <em>why</em>. What function does the surface do that benefits from the higher surface area more than the internal parts would from the potentially higher volume they could have from a smooth surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cortex, or the exterior part of the brain is made of grey matter, which in turn is made of the neuron's nucleus. The inside of the brain is mostly just fibers, &quot;connections&quot; between the neurons. So it makes some sense to fit some more processors on your brain than more connections.
Hope its understandable, English isnt my first language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a correction, the lungs have lots of little pockets (alveola), not fibres, and the colon doesn't really have a lot of infolding. The small intestine does though (plicae circulares, villi, and microvilli). There is nowhere in the body that cilia are used to increase surface area.</p></div>		</li>
