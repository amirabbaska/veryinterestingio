			<div class="markdown"><p>You can put folks with larger metal plants (heart stents, deep brain stimulators, etc) that are (depending upon the exact model) incompatible with strong magnetic fields.</p>
<p>Since they’re resistive and not superconducting, there is less maintenance and cost from maintaining liquid helium and liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>They’re also a lot cheaper to build. Superconducting wire is way more expensive to build than copper.</p>
<p>Smaller field also means that they won’t have as large a ‘fringe field’ an area which magnetic items will get sucked in. This makes placing them in hospitals or clinics much easier.</p></div>		</li>
