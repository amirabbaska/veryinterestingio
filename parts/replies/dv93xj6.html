Also, super jealous you got to meet Don Eigler.<br />
EDIT: Also, lower temperatures help maintain lower pressures in the STM ultra-high vacuum chamber by adsorbing molecules on other surfaces in the chamber. This prevents other gas molecules from adsorbing on the nickel surface (aside from the already-adsorbed xenon atoms) while scanning.</p></div>		</li>
