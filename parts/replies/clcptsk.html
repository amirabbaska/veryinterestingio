			<div class="markdown"><p>The oil money could come from OPEC, Iran, some private well, ect. All the bank of the refinery sees is &quot;Established Refinery money transfers X dollars to random account in random bank&quot; as part of 1000+ transactions it did that day of the same level. It would be like the bank noticing that you were laundering 3$ from looking at the 50-100 3$ transactions you might make in a month. The receiving bank either a) does not know (ie its a cutout where some shell company &quot;Guns Inc&quot; buys guns from this bank account and ships them over the world b) knows but does not care as it gets a part of the cut or is sympathetic.  </p>
<p>Assume the bank is complicit, that is they know what is happening and are doing it anyway. In what situation would this occur.    </p>
<p>You have a few countries in that location who are hard up for Euro's and US dollars who have weapons for sale (think Syria, Pakistan, Iran, Somalia ect) who would love to have a bank account that is constantly being filled with US/Euro petro dollars that they can take from in exchange for aging weapons/ammo they have lying around from the cold-war/Iraq War. Argentina and Venezuela did this in the 80's and 90's when they needed US dollars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot more banks and a lot less oversight out there than you're assuming. Also, didn't HSBC basically got off the hook for free recently from drug money laundery charges because they're &quot;too big to prosecute&quot;? So there you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a tier 1 supplier to the Big-3 who got caught using conflict minerals just as I was coming on board as an environmental adherence analyst. I got moved to a new division that was set up to figure out/deal with our supply line and how this occurred since due the Dobb-Frank legislation that was passed in 2010 it had become a big deal where manufacturers were responsible for the supply line. IE Companies like GM/Ford ect were responsible if the suppliers used conflict minerals.</p>
<p>Since we were caught we had some extra work where we had to trace how this happened. The example I gave is not precisely what occurred but it is a general description of the events that can lead to grey market resources (such as oil, wood from the amazon, tin/diamonds from conflict regions) ending up in aggregates (refineries, lumber/pulp mills, smelters) that then dump it, legally, onto world markets.  </p>
<p>Current legislation that is being implemented will make suppliers responsible for choosing &quot;conflict free&quot; smelters (Currently there are only 6 conflict free certified smelters in Asia), but even that is just a show of face, you need to go all the way to the mine itself but really it won't matter.  </p>
<p>&quot;Laundering&quot; resources is easy as long as the launderers are willing to take a price cut, people will always be willing to buy. </p></div>		</li>
