			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibodies and other similar antigen-binding proteins like T cell receptors generate their diversity through processes such as genetic recombination. Essentially, you have several different &quot;options&quot; for each domain of these proteins in your DNA, and each cell will randomly assign one of the options to make its own unique proteins. There are several steps to this, based on the type of immune cell involved, but cells usually undergo some form of positive (making sure their proteins bind a targeted antigen) and negative (testing to identify and suppress self-binding) screening. Autoimmune diseases generally would mean that the negative screening broke down in some way, and is often associated with genetic predisposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum, some genes that have been associated with autoimmune diseases (aka genes associated with T-cells that bind self-antigens passing negative selection) are also associated with a higher resistance to HIV and other retroviral infections. So in the special case of being infected with HIV, these genes would actually increase chances of long-term survival. You didn't do this with your response, but I think it's important to add that evolution is non-teleological in nature. Sometimes genes that would be considered &quot;bad&quot; normally would be considered &quot;good&quot; in special circumstances that could increase selection pressures.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Autoimmune diseases are associated with genetics, but at least a handful are supposedly triggered at some point in life rather than present at birth. Could the random generation of proteins be the mechanism for this? Ie: T-cells are confronting disease after disease, rashes, illnesses, etc. Eventually they code for a protein that considers something normal an antigen (and presumably only those genetically disposed can have this play out). Suddenly the body is producing cells that want to eradicate the harmless antigen and the host is now going to experience the symptoms of the autoimmune disorder. Is this possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD in Immunology here:</p>
<p>Because the immune system generate T cell &amp; B cell receptors randomly it makes sense that there would be receptors that will recognize molecules of &quot;self&quot;. But the immune system has methods to eliminate that.</p>
<p>The first is a combination of positive and negative selection in order for a T or B cell to continue the maturation process from progenitor states- like Goldilocks and the 3 bears (not too cold, not too hot). First there is positive selection to insure the receptor can bind target molecules (not too cold). Then negative selection if the receptor binds &quot;self&quot; molecules too tightly (not too hot). If the T/B cell fails one of these steps it dies.</p>
<p>Assuming an auto-reactive receptor passes these two steps, there are other immune cells in the body some of which are call regulatory cells that can suppress immune cells that react against other cell that attack &quot;self&quot; molecules.</p>
<p>An auto-immune disorder can have genetic or environmental features that prevent one or both of these broad mechanisms of control. </p>
<p>There is a link between the immune system and possible mental disorders because we have learned recently that the brain can be infiltrated by a wider array of immune cells than previously thought.</p>
<p>If these immune cell attack the brain, then that can cause a change in mental behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you know how there's a joke about how everything in the TV show House is suspected to be lupus? Its because autoimmune problems like Lupus/SLE can appear as fucking anything, and cause every problem under the sun. Its what makes identifying them so tricky and differentiating their appearance from other things difficult. Here are a few examples of ways that immune problems can appear:</p>
<p>Lupus - Diagnosis requires 4+ of the following: face rash, patchy skin, mouth ulcers, photosensitivity, arthritis, pericarditis/pleuritis (hear or lung involvement), neurologic symptoms, kidney problems, blood problems, other immune problems, or anti-nuclear antibodies</p>
<p>Thats just one immune problem. Others can be totally different. For example, in overweight, older women you can get primary billiarcy cirrhosis, in which your liver bile duct is slowly destroyed. Other disorders attack your vasculature. Other disorders screw with your nerves. Autoimmune can and does present as everything.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The main symptoms depend on which part of the body the immune system attacks, so there isn't a typical manifestation.</p>
<p>There are some symptoms that are common in auto-immune diseases because they come from the immune system itself: The area attacked by the immune system is often swollen, red, and painful to the touch. But it's not universal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very simple answer to a complicated question, but I'll do my best. </p>
<p>Proteins are generated from nucleic acids. In order for a protein to be functional, the nucleic acids have to code for amino acids that a) line up to make a full length protein and b) fold up correctly through electrostatic interactions. </p>
<p>Immune cells start as undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow. As they begin to develop, they receive signals from the body to differentiate. This means that they start expressing a specific set of genes, aka nucleic acid sequences. The sequences code for proteins called antibodies, which have a specific Y shape. </p>
<p>Here's the real nitty gritty of your question: each antibody is generated by an event called differential splicing. All the immunity genes for antibodies come in chunks of sequences, which make up individual parts of the Y shape antibody, known as the heavy chain and the light chain. If you combine the chunks of sequences differently, you get a variety of antibody structures, with characteristic light and heavy chains. This is a random event (the order of the chunks, and which ones), hence the randomly generated antibody. </p>
<p>Now, each cell starts out expressing a certain type of antibody, called IgG. This is characterized by heavy and light chains, which again, correspond to certain sequences within immunity gene clusters. </p>
<p>So now you have a bunch of cells with their own IgG antibody, ready for action. However, before they're let loose in the body, they have to be tested to make sure they function correctly. </p>
<p>A side note about antibodies: proteins bind to each other through electrostatic interactions. Antibodies bind other proteins by their light chains, or the v-shaped part of the Y (the heavy chain is attached to the immune cell). Now, in order for the light chains to bind something (i.e. a pathogen, but more on that later) the electrostatic interactions have to be favorable. In other words, the shape of the light chain defines whether it can bind anything, also known as specificity, or recognition. </p>
<p>Back to your question. Since each antibody is randomly generated, there's no guarantee that the antibody will bind anything, but it's still important to screen them because it might happen that one of the arrangements binds a protein that <em>your</em> cells express. This would basically tell the immune system that <em>your</em> cells are a pathogen, and need to be destroyed. This is the crux of autoimmune disorders- when your immune system can't differentiate between your own cells and foreign cells, and starts attacking your own body, aka bad news bears. </p>
<p>So moving forward, you have your cells and they've been screened for cross reactivity with your own cells and they passed. They're then released into the blood stream to hunt down pathogens. Some cells may never encounter something that their antibodies recognize. But, if a cell does encounter its pathogen (recognition), then, oversimply stated, it tells the rest of the immune system that it's found a bug, and 'rallies the troops.'</p>
<p>This is where the process gets truly complicated. Immune cells basically talk to each other and the cell that recognized the pathogen is told to start proliferating, making more cells that have the same antibody. During each subsequent round of division, the antibody changes a little bit (this is called class switching, where IgG switches to other types, like IgM, etc...those details aren't important though). </p>
<p>So as the antibody changes incrementally, it might produce versions that lose their ability to recognize the pathogen. However, a small amount are produced that do a <em>better</em> job binding the pathogen. They then talk to the immune system, and proliferate, and the cycle repeats. </p>
<p>This whole process takes several days, and is the basis for immune system memory; once a cell that recognizes a pathogen is generated, it and its progeny can circulate in the blood stream for years. So when your vaccinated, it's basically a doctor introducing a tiny, harmless part of a pathogen into the body so that your immune system can generate these cells before you're ever exposed to the real thing. That way, when you do become infected, your immune response is highly specific and very, very fast compared to if your immune system had never seen it before. </p>
<p>So in the context of the thread here, a 'good' immune system has the widest variety of immune genes, which can produce the widest variety of antibodies, which gives the immune system the best chance of recognizing pathogens and destroying them before they destroy you. And you get your variety of immune system genes from your parents. So if your parents' genes differ a lot from each other, then you're going to have a larger variety, as their offspring receiving genes from both of them.</p>
<p>I would link to some cool papers about mate selection being influenced by how different your partners' immune gene are from yours, but I'm on mobile. You could google it though, search for MHC and a study about women smelling mens' tshirts and rating how attractive they found the smell, it's a well known study. </p>
<p>Hope that clarifies some questions in this thread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also made more complicated by the fact that variations in immune response can cause both positive and negative effects simultaneously. For example psoriasis is an auto-immune disorder in which the immune system overreacts and causes skin lesions, but it has also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3343879/" target="_blank">shown to provide greater resistance to HIV</a> and other viral pathogens. </p></div>		</li>
