			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to agree with 1 but not 2. You would be able to take the patients pressure but you would get a single number instead of the familiar systolic/diastolic. Critically ill patients are often managed in terms of their &quot;mean arterial pressure&quot; (MAP) which can be calculated by (Systolic+2*Diastolic)/3. The patient in question would have a single pressure equal to the MAP. </p>
<p>Source: Am a Physician Assistant in a surgical intensive care unit but never get patients like the one in question; they would go to a cardiac ICU. </p>
<p>Edit: brain farted on the formula and fixed it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And from what I've heard, this is the absolute favorite way for attending physicians to freak out their medical students.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MAP). To do so, you need to get a doppler and an old fashion blood pressure cuff. The first sound that you hear on the doppler will represent the MAP on the BP cuff. If the patient is septic or hypovolemic from trauma (blood loss), you need to take the MAP this way to guide the resuscitation. That or put in an arterial line to measure the pressure. </p>
<p>Most LVADs or the BiVacor have only 1 setting, from what I recall</p></div>		</li>
