			<div class="markdown"><p>But you don't know that those things are changing over time. All of your perceptions are just input from the outside and that input is highly flawed data at best so your ability to see/feel/know that input has changed is limited at best. It's based on comparing them memories that are also highly flawed. Heck, we can't even sure we have the ability to perceive all the relevant data.  For all we know we all live in Plato's cave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasnt talking about perceptions but awareness. There is awareness of these changing perceptions. There is awareness of seeing, hearing, thinking, smelling etc. All of those sensory appearances are preceeded by awareness. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Where is your proof for free will? You dont have it because we dont have it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnt claim free wil, thoughts for example just happen, there is no choosing them. But there is awareness of thoughts. Awareness does not do anything other than is aware. It doesnt know about good or bad, good and bad come into play through thinking. The ego identity also is present to awareness only when there is thinking.  But I as awareness am real and being aware is my primary experience, thoughts, sensations and other sensory perceptions are what I am aware of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may also be conflating identity, consciousness, and conscious experience which, while closely linked in most human experience, are not really the same. If I'm reading OP's question and jorn818's response correctly, they're talking about the persistence (or lack thereof) of consistent identity, not anything related to awareness or consciousness directly.</p>
<p>While the questions of how humans maintain continuous consciousness and continuous conscious experience in light of plastic cognitive machinery are certainly interesting and valuable, they're somewhat tangential to the question and answers above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was suggesting that our identity is not our real I since it is not always present in our experience and it changes and relies on thoughts and memory. Awareness on the other hand has been present and consistent always, so it makes much more sense even logically that what we call I is that in experience that stays constant.</p>
<p>What I mean by awareness is the experience of being aware, for example right now there is awareness of writing, of reading, of the phone that is used to write, of the body sensations, of the sounds and visual perception etc. Of thinking. Every experience that is possible to experience is preceeded by awareness of it and this experience of being aware stays throughout all experiences that are experienced.</p></div>		</li>
