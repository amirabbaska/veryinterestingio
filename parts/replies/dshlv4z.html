</blockquote>
<p>It'd be more accurate to call both oxidation reactions, whereby the only difference is the <em>rate</em> of reaction. </p>
<p>Strictly speaking, combustion involves high temperatures, while the redox reactions in the body are catalysed to occur at 36–37°C by enzymes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/delta_p_delta_x explains the qualitative differences in reaction rate well.  I just want to emphasize the tightly controlled part.  Undesired oxidation products are harmful for a living cell but they can't be completely avoided. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_stress" target="_blank">oxidative stress</a>.  Cells breath their 'own farts' because they don't have digestive system and neutralizing the damage is very important (this is how I explain it to the 5 year old).</p>
<p>If you are entertained with science facts, consider this: rate of fusion  reaction (energy to volume ratio) inside the sun is comparable to the rate of cellular metabolism in humans.  Fusion reaction creates images of extremely  violent and energetic reactions, but the fusion inside the sun has  low rate.  The intense heat and brightness of the sun is direct result of the  area/volume ratio of the sphere, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">the square–cube law</a>.  If you could pack  same sized sphere full of living matter, the surface of the sphere would glow as bright as the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Variable. It depends on the length of the fatty acids and the level of unsaturation in the chains. More info on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride" target="_blank">triglycerides</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Variables. You can replace n/m with x/y or a/b if you want. In general, the number of carbons will be somewhere around 50 for a triglyceride fat molecule and the number of hydrogen atoms will be roughly twice as high. The exact numbers vary depending on what kind of fat it is. The number of oxygen atoms is normally always the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body uses a lot of energy to maintain itself. Pretty much all that energy comes from the oxidation of carbon-based molecules such as sugars, fats, proteins, etc. We consume these molecules as food, add in oxygen, and secrete their byproducts as carbon dioxide, water, and in the case of nitrogen containing compounds - urea. Since food is not always available, but since energy needs are constant, our body has fairly large stores of carbon for use when we are not eating. To reduce these stores one simply needs to use more energy than goes in, this can be done by reducing how much goes in (eating less),increasing how much is needed (exercise), or a mixture of both. Regardless of how a net caloric deficit is achieved almost all of the carbon will be lost through exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your body like a car that has an engine always running. If it's parked it will also lose fuel because the motor is running burning fuel. And this lost mass is turned into exhaust. If the car parked will use up more fuel per day than you refuel it will lose weight even if it doesn't drive around.</p>
<p>It's the same way with your body. Your heart and muscles and everything else in your body needs a certain amount of energy to maintain the basic functions. And the &quot;fuel&quot; you use is turned into exhaust, too. Only that it exits your nose not a metal pipe.</p></div>		</li>
