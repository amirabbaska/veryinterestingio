			<div class="markdown"><p>He basically said that cursive worked well because they didn't have to raise the pen from the paper a lot. </p>
<p>Print (or normal writing) adapted this method with the lowercase versions of letters so that you don't need to lift the pen multiple times to write one lowercase letter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing. I assumed the numbering was the order of the stroke. If that's the case, who writes the middle line of the E first? Or the curve of the D first? Or the horizontal lines of the H second. Or maybe I'm the weird one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay another comment just helped me understand. They used the capital letter for some reason to show how you write a lower case e. It's basically an upper case E with the top closed off. So you start at the horizontal part, the middle line, make the first part of the curve going up, and then the curve going down is like the bottom line. It's hard to explain lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know everyone writes differently, but who starts their capital E with the middle horizontal line? That just seems like a weird way to start it. I always start with the vertical line. </p></div>		</li>
