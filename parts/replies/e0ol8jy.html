			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question. </p>
<p>As long as DNA is double stranded and intact, damage on one strand is almost always perfectly repaired, and UV doesn't have the strength to cause a double stranded break so we don't have to worry about that. </p>
<p>But when a cell is splitting, it pulls apart the two strands of DNA to make new copies, and if one strand is damaged as the copy is being made, this damage will be matched by the copy. Now even if this replication error is found, the repair system won't know which is the correct version, making it a coinflip whether it's fixed or not. </p>
<p>If the error isn't detected before the next split, the copy of the damage will have a copy of itself made, which results in a double stranded error, which the repair system won't even try to fix since, if the cell doesn't immediately die, it's probably fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body has a pretty crazy good repair system. Without it DNA replication is already crazy accurate like 1 in million nucleotides is placed incorrectly without it and it only gets better with it. But the DNA repair system is made up of enzymes and proteins which are made by other DNA. One of the biggest problems is when UV or some other mutagen causes damage in the genes coding for your repair mechanism. Once that happens you could get either a completely non-functional protein or one with altered functions. When that happens your cell starts undergoing more mutations even without UV and starts uncontrollably dividing. This could also happen of your DNA loses its stop codon so the DNA doesn't know &quot;hey this is the last nucleptode in the sequence I should stop making protein&quot;. Instead it just keeps going and you get a bunch of crazy protein</p>
<p>But even if your DNA is damaged and you start producing incorrect protein, your cell has a lot of ways to solve it. For one it starts to try to degrade any RNA made from the DNA. Your body's pretty good at recognizing errors, even ones hidden in DNA after replicating. Even more the protein can be degraded the second the cell notices that the protein looks funky. And while this is going on your body's trying to actively destroy that cell. So even with all the possible mutations going outside, your body's system is so robust that a cancer causing mutation is USUALLY unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are not quite complete. </p>
<p>You're correct that the cells have a repair system that works to prevent this. Unfortunately, sometimes that repair is done incorrectly, and the proteins that check the integrity of the DNA (P53 being the most famous one) miss it. </p>
<p>Any one error will not cause Cancer, but it can start a cascade of events that make more errors more likely. Cancer genesis is like evolution at the cellular level - each mutation that promotes cancer-like behaviour makes future mutations more likely, but the cancer needs many such mutations to progress. </p>
<p>For instance, P53 needs to be neutralized before the cancer can progress. If the UV damage deletes one base pair that codes for P53 - that's it. No more P53. </p>
<p>There are also epigenetic changes - while your DNA doesn't change, how your DNA is interpreted actually changes slightly to accomodate your needs. Genes that are necessary for fast growth when you are a fetus or infant get under-expressed, for instance, unless you get seriously wounded, except for some stem cells. So on top of the mutations to the DNA, you have these epigenetic changes that promote cancer, responding to evolutionary pressures that select for cells that are better able to avoid all of the anti-cancer defences your body has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, you need to lose both p53 genes for you to lose apoptotic function. That's why people with genetic cancer syndromes like Li-Fraumini have increased cancer risk. They are born without a copy, meaning that they don't have a backup if that copy gets deleted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By and large I agree and I thought the same. However, a &quot;single hit&quot; can refer to one particle that causes a double stand break or a lethal event. It can also refer to the single hit model or linear quadratic model (single hit kill or alpha). A single particle with high LET (not UV, probably) can cause multiple damaging events on a single track (accumulated intratrack) which could be carcinogenic.  As it is unlikely/impossible that a single mutation or loss of heterozygosity will cause cancer, I don't think a single uv photon has the energy to directly or indirectly cause multiple dsbs. However i wonder if multiple genes lost from a terminal chromosome deletion would be carcinogenic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is right. We constantly regrow all of our skin cells, not only the ones on the surface. Those are just the fastest. The problem involves how our cells make copies of themselves via DNA. If a cells DNA gets damaged(and doesn't successfully repair itself) then that damage will be copied. All of the DNA damage of every cell in a lineage will cumulatively add up. If it happens in unfortunate combinations cancer can result. A single photon won't do it, extended exposure to mutagens does. </p></div>		</li>
