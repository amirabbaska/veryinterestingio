			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those the shapes of the orbits? I took Chem last semester and when we went over those shapes, i didn't understand. I asked a bunch of TAs (grad students ) what it represented and they couldn't explain it. So, what do they represent? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, keep in mind, we call them orbitals, but strictly speaking the electrons aren't really <em>orbiting</em> the nucleus in the same sense, say, the ISS orbits the Earth.  It's all wibbly-wobbly quantum mechanicy probabilities.  The electron is never actually <strong>anywhere</strong> at any given time, except when you measure it.  The rest of the time it's a wibbly-wobbly wave function.</p>
<p>But as you can see in the diagram, the first orbital is the <em>1s</em> orbital.  You can fit two electrons in there, an up and a down.  (Pauli's exclusion principle prohibits any more than that.)</p>
<p>And the second orbital can accomodate 8 electrons.  2 in the <em>2s</em> orbital which is spherical (I'm pretty sure that's where the &quot;s&quot; in 1s and 2s comes from:  <strong>spherical</strong>.)  just like the <em>1s</em>, and then 6 more in the 3 <em>2p</em> orbitals.  The three <em>2p</em> orbitals are barbell-shaped orbitals.  <a href="http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/724/741576/Instructor_Resources/Chapter_01/Text_Images/FG01_01-39UN.JPG" target="_blank">This image</a> makes their shape a little clearer, and also illustrates how we are able to jam <strong>6</strong> electrons in there:  Because the orbital is not symmetrical across rotations, you can have them oriented in the x, y, and z directions.  Three directions, three orbitals, and again two electrons in each, one up and one down.</p>
<p>As you get to higher energies, you get additional degrees of freedom that the electrons enjoy, so you end up with 5 additional orbitals added, once you're in the 3rd electron shell and get past the initial 8 in <em>3s</em> and <em>3p</em>, good for another 10 additional electrons that can fill up that orbital.</p>
<p>Also, note, even though I've referred to the <em>1s</em>, <em>2s</em>, and <em>3s</em> orbitals as if they have identical shapes, they're not <strong>exactly</strong> identical.  They're all spherically symmetric, but there are minor differences.  For example in the <em>1s</em> orbital you're roughly equally likely to find the electron anywhere within the sphere of the orbital of radius R^o, all the way from r=0 to r=R^o.  But in the <em>2s</em> orbital, you're much more likely to find that electron either in the center, (r ~&lt; 0.1R^o ) or on the edges (r &gt;~ 0.8R^o ).  So in that respect it's much more like a hollow sphere than the <em>1s</em> orbital.  In general you find the symmetries remain when going from <em>1s</em> to <em>2s</em>, or <em>2p</em> to <em>3p</em>, but some details may change a bit.</p>

Most explanations of those topics are either for dummies or for people who already studied that stuff.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to what /u/garrettj100 said, The orbitals are probabilities of finding an electron there. To measure something, for example, look at a bacterium in a microscope we need to add energy to it (light) and detect the interaction of the energy and your object (in that case light interacts with cell wall, being absorbed, and that's how you see the wall being darker). If you illuminate something, like your hand, it'll get warm (thus your hand gets extra energy). Now to take it back to the electron, say you want to know its position and movement (impulse). By measuring it, you'll give it extra energy to &quot;fly&quot; around more, so you don't reliably know its original speed. If you measure speed, you won't reliably know its position. So there you get your uncertainty principle of Heisenberg. To solve this problem, really smart people calculated the area in space where you'll have 95% chance of finding an electron. So those orbitals represent an area around the nucleus where if you'd measure 100 times, you'd find an electron 95 times. I hope this sounds somewhat comprehensible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A really interesting thing to note about the orbitals is that they are solutions to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics" target="_blank">Laplace's Equation</a>. Schrodinger's equation states that an electron is actually a wave in the EM field. Putting these two together, when we look at an electron's orbital we are looking at a standing wave solution to Schrodinger's equation.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~fienup/cs188s05/lectures/spd-orbital.gif" target="_blank">Look at the s orbitals in this picture</a>. When you put them side by side like that, it's suddenly blindingly obvious that they are standing waves in three dimensions.</p>
<p>This mathematical perspective makes the question of &quot;why do the orbitals have funny shapes?&quot; much simpler, even though you have to be familiar with Quantum Mechanics to understand why electrons have to have a wavefunction and what that really means.</p></div>		</li>
