			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered about this and totally agree with your points. </p>
<p>If sex always lead to babies, it'd be simple.  It it doesn't. In fact, sex rarely leads to a baby. And given that the vast majority of women would be having sex, and the vast majority of times they won't have babies, it's not a simple conclusion. </p>
<p>According to this famous experiment, as recently as the 1760s scientists were not 100% on &quot;babies come from sex&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't appear to be what that says. He was trying to disprove the idea &quot;that life <strong>sometimes</strong> spontaneously generates from nonlife&quot;</p>
<p>People saw that in some very specific scenarios, life appeared and they saw no evidence of bangin. So the idea was that not ALL species need to have sex to procreate.</p>

<p>The Book of Genesis even talks about the effectiveness of the pull-out method.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In high school we were taught that humans and dolphins are the only animals that have sex for recreation, all other animals do it for procreation.</p>
<p>I asked how animals knew what procreation was, because the implication is that animals somehow know how babies are made and act accordingly. I got no answer to this question. </p>
<p>And that was before I learned about other animals' behavior, like bonobos, who seem to use sex as a basic social tool. Instead of a greeting handshake they give a greeting blowjob or anal sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the possibility of associating the symptoms of puberty with the age women begin to conceive, and connecting that with the interest in enjoying sexual intercourse? i.e. They began to associated the act of beginning to have sex with getting pregnant even if they didn't understand the mechanism and timing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you being fecesious? (I couldn't help myself)</p>
<p>I think your point is valid, but I think OP's original question is still valid. It would have been a very complex process  of recognition of the pattern. </p>
<p>One thing not mentioned is I've heard that some animals, via pheromones or whatever, can sense pregnancy. I don't know whether any credible studies have confirmed this. If so, it's possible that connecting pregnancy to sex occurred very early in human evolution.</p>
<p>I don't have any direct evidence/sources, I'm just trying to expand the discussion with additional considerations. Feel free to discount them if there are sources to the contrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think humans would have recognized the link once they became sufficiently strong at pattern recognition. Of course there are indicators that ancient people knew of the connection. The question is did it come around 50,000 years ago? 100,000 years ago? 10,000? It would be amazing to understand just how complex the cognition of early humans emerge at various stages. We see the use of tools, is that cognition strong enough to recognize a pattern like this? There are indicators that chimps can also fashion some tools like a spear, but do they get the sex to pregnancy connection? Doubtful. </p>
<p>I agree it is an evolutionary question though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel it's all that of a complex pattern tbh. The baby comes out where the penis goes in. That's a strong clue I'd assume, and hominids who are capable of tool making should be able to get it.</p></div>		</li>
