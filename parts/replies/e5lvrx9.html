			<div class="markdown"><p>I know transplants are few and far between because of availability. My mum for example has copd and she hasn't been smoking for 10+ years. Surely if it come to it, that she would be eligible if it was an option, just like someone who has been drinking and stopped. Bad isn't it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom also has COPD. She was told by a doctor that for someone in her condition it would be possible to get a transplant, but that the life expectancy is not that different, after the stress of surgery and mandatory post op stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry your mum as COPD. It's mad how quite a few of my family members stopped smoking years and years ago and now they're ill after they've stopped. They never had a sniff of anything wrong beforehand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you have smoked your whole life, it’s still possible to get a transplant. There was a famous case - a lady named Pam Laffin. She started smoking when she was 10, and had severe COPD by the time she was 26. She got a transplant (probably because she had quit smoking and was the single parent of two young girls), but sadly went into rejection. She was listed for a transplant a second time, but died before she was able to get it (at 31). </p>
<p>She became famous for doing a lot of work with the CDC, anti-smoking PSAs, and she was featured in an MTV doco which can be viewed here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BTTBu59GDEg" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/BTTBu59GDEg</a></p>
<p>It’s a horrible disease, I am sorry your mum has to deal with it. I think you’re right in saying that she could technically be eligible for a transplant, but a lot of other factors come into play such as age, health, blood type, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't realise there were so many risks. I know transplants themselves are very risky, as I have had a family member who rejected a kidney transplant, but I didn't realise how many other complications there were. It's so unfortunate. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably due to his other issues. Being older, and have issues with other major organs it's probably not a solid bet to perform a lung transplant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry to hear about your dad. It's a rough diagnosis. My mom passed from pulmonary fibrosis a little over a year ago at 67. We were told the waiting list for our area (Canada) was five years. She didn't have that kind of time left, and there were children on that list. My mom would have wanted the kids to receive the transplant before her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m so sorry you lost your mother.  It’s horrible what PF does to people, and so quickly. Dad had a little less than two years after he was diagnosed.  My dad said the same exact thing about transplants.  Even if we could have afforded the surgery, it would have benefited a young person much more.  He smoked four packs of kools a day for decades. He had quit about five years before he died, but the damage was done. Do you mind me asking if your mother was a smoker? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad your dad got diagnosed relatively quickly. It's good to be able to process something as heavy as PF. My mom's didn't get detected until she was already in a coma. The hospital kept misdiagnosing her with pneumonia. She was admitted three weeks before she passed and a week and a half in she was in a coma. She never knew what she had. No matter how you slice it, a PF diagnosis suck. There's no better way to put it. My mom never smoked a day in her life, however both my dad and stepdad smoked heavily around her. </p></div>		</li>
