			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are correct! Didn't want to overload with specifics and felt for someone wondering about this question in particular, that I could make a stronger connection by just highlighting the St. Francis Xavier-Pope Francis connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. The holy trinity is a dogma of the Catholic church. It is the belief that God is the father (God in heaven), the son (Jesus), and holy spirit simultaneously. One God in three persons. All three are not just 33% of God but they are all 100% God at the same time and the same God. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the whole &quot;Why have you forsaken me?&quot; part confuses me. If Jesus is 100% God as you say, shouldn't he have been omnipotent enough to know the answer to his own question?</p></div>		</li>
