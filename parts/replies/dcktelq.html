For example there is a gene variant that seems to be heightening the rate of dementia in old age, a trait that would heavily wheigh on a social group as an individual ages but not influence the reproductive ability of the same individual with the trait. Lately <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-01/foas-g011017.php" target="_blank">studies showed</a> that the same gene variant may actually give resistance to certain parasitic diseases and thus actually be selected for. In this way the gene variant is both, &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
