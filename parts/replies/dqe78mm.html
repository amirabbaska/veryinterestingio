			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your answer is answering a different question.  OP seems to be asking a question of the form: why is it that X has quality Y?  Your answer is basically: X has quality Y because if X didn't have quality Y then we wouldn't be able to observe that X had quality Y.  Indeed, in the article you linked, the author begins by pondering, &quot;Why do we live in a universe with three dimensions of space and one of time?&quot; and then goes on to answer it with the anthropic principle.  </p>
<p>But that we wouldn't be able to observe this condition had this condition not existed does not account for the actual condition itself.  Or in other words, that we are able to observe the condition is neither the cause of, nor an account of the nature of, the condition itself.  To further clarify, imagine that we discovered some separate universe in which dimensions were different, but that harbored no internal observers.  From our perspective, we could ask, &quot;why is this new universe the way it is?&quot; without recourse to the fact that this universe did or did not allow for the presence of life. However one answers that question is, I imagine, of a similar form to the answer OP is expecting in his or her question. (And to be clear, I don't know what that answer looks like).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking the infinite universes theory... the answer would be similar to when you look at an infinite seaside beach, point at a random grain of sand and ask &quot;Why does this grain of sand lie in this specific orientation, the sharper corner left, the flatter edge front...?&quot; - It just rolled that way. Interactions with other grains set it that way. Out of the phase space of its orientations, this one happened. And so on, and so on. You might model the beach and analyze how interactions between grains made it turn that way, but no matter how deep you dig you won't find a higher purpose or any profound reason for it lying this way and not any other.</p>
<p>&quot;Because in this case it just happened so&quot; is a valid answer in Physics; it only takes Philosophy to dispute it.</p>
<p>So, our universe just happened to have the 3+1 dimensions. But thanks to it having 3+1 dimensions we exist, to ever ask that question - countless other universes have other dimensionalities, but no intelligent life to ever dwell on them. And there's no more reason behind -this specific- universe being 3+1 than behind a grain of sand on a sea beach being turned that specific way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First off, the infinite universes &quot;theory&quot; is not a theory, it's a fun idea to think about. We have exactly zero evidence that there are universes other ours out there, and whether these actually have different laws of physics.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not really. It's a lazy cop-out that could be applied to literally any question-</p>
<p>It is only a somewhat valid answer in a statistical context, when you have a whole ensemble of items that behave according to a certain probability distribution. But even then, you should be able to describe members of that ensemble and the rules that they follow, ideally even derive the probability distribution from these laws instead of saying &quot;ah well that's just how it is&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not think you correctly described his answer. He said X had quality Y because if X did not have quality Y then it would be far less likely that we could exist to see it.</p>
<p>Disregarding this use of logic as “not answering the right question” is disregarding much of probability and statistics, since observations and the distributions that they are taken from are necessarily linked.</p>
<p>Although I do agree that the usage does require a lot of belief in the impossibility of extra dimensions to support life easily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when we're discussing something like multi dimensional time that we couldn't possibly perceive or conceptualize in anything beyond a cartoonish abstraction, isn't it a bit shortsighted to assume it couldn't support intelligent life? It couldn't support life <em>as we know it</em>, but we're talking about things we do not, and more importantly, cannot know</p></div>		</li>

<p>He's agreeing there. However for more spatial dimensions, we know more about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that nothing is predictable in more than one time dimension. Intelligence is only useful if one can make predictions about the future and take advantage of them. Even life relies on a reliable replication process, which could not exist in multiple time dimensions (if the process were reliable, then one could make predictions about it and we just proved that's impossible).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well maybe, maybe things are predictable in more than one time dimension the same way we predict things spatially in three dimensions</p>
<p>and maybe intelligence can evolve from different angle than predicting, and that's self evident to beings that perceive time in multiple dimensions</p>
<p>I agree what you're saying is intuitive to us, but we are creatures whose existence has been shaped bottom to top within our conception of linear time, I don't think there are many cards we can leave on the table when talking about something so alien to us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to say I'm really not a big fan of the Anthropic principle. You don't learn anything from it, and it's a epistemological dead end.</p>
<p>It could also be applied to pretty much anything:</p>
<p>&quot;Why does this coin fall downwards if I push it off the table?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because if it didn't you wouldn't be asking this question of why it falls down&quot;.</p>
<p>It's a complete non-answer, and feels like a cheap cop-out.</p>
<p>Besides, the Multiverse is an intriguing idea, but that doesn't make it true. Until there is actual evidence of Universes that aren't our universe and evidence that the laws of physics are different in these universes, it's all just philosophy/religion to me, not physics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was using the word why colloquially, sorry. What I meant was &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what caused it&quot; or &quot;what are the conditions where it does/doesn't happen&quot;. These should be the questions physics concerns itself with, but by using the anthropic principle, you aren't giving an answer to either.</p></div>		</li>
