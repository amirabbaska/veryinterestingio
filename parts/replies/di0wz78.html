			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, only in 3D can you have stable orbits. In 2D you get a 1/r relationship, which means all objects eventually spiral inwards [<strong>edit:</strong> wrong, see rantonels' reply]. In 4D and above, objects either escape or fall in, with nothing in between.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is false. Orbits are stable and enclosed between two finite radii, like in 3D. However they do not close up and there is apsidal precession.</p>

<p>My mistake -- I was confusing it with the fact that there's no escape velocity, since the integral for energy diverges when you take the distance to infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now.. is there any object that is in a perfectly stable orbit in which it won't ever fall in or escape? That's a question that should be rather hard to answer imo</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are basically two forces that act on a planet moving in an orbit around the star. The momentum of the planet which tends to fling the planet tangentially from the orbit and the gravitational attraction from the Star which pulls the planet closer. When these two forces are completely balanced, the resulting orbit is circular. The circular orbit is possible in any dimension. But the precise balance to make a circular orbit is highly impractical and hence you never observe an exactly circular orbit in nature. </p>
<p>In 3 d, the elliptical orbit is formed when the momentum is <em>slightly less</em> than the gravitational pull. So now the planet tends to fall towards the star and gains momentum. At a certain point in the orbit, the increase in outward momentum tends to make the planet fly away till it is balanced by the gravity and the planet is pulled back again. The cycle continues in such a fashion that the distance between the planet and the star is not the same and that results in an elliptical orbit. In 4d, the gravitational pull is dictated by the 1/r^3 law instead of 1/r^2 in 3d. Now, if we reconstruct the above example in 4d, the gravitational pull increases faster than the 3d case as the r between the planet and the star decreases and eventually, the planet falls into the star. And it just so happens, that such a balance required to form an elliptical orbit is never possible with 1/r^3 law.</p>
<p>If there is a huge difference between these two forces to start with, the planet either falls into the star(the gravitational pull overwhelmingly dominates the outward momentum) or flies away in a hyperbolic orbit(the momentum is much larger for the planet to pulled by the gravity of the star). These scenarios are similar in both 3d and 4d.</p></div>		</li>
