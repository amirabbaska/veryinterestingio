<p>I remember as a kid feeling the extreme warmth of a car fire that my dad drove past on the highway. We were probably a little too close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IR has a really hard time passing through glass. That's why glass is good for use in windows, why cars get so hot when kept under the sun (light shines in, materials heat up, IR radiation is given off, it bounces in glass and stays in the car), same concept for solar cookers, etc.</p>
<p>A glass panel would shield a noteworthy amount of heat from a bonfire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you specified &quot;very transparent glass&quot;, yes.  There are IR-opaque coatings for glass that leave it clear for the visible spectrum, though.</p></div>		</li>
