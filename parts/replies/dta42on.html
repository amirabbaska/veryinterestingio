			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article about Costco's rotisserie chicken about this, and the fact that they've held steady at $5(?) over the years, even during &quot;downturns&quot; because that price gets people to consider buying it.</p>
<p>A whole chicken is not a whole meal, so customers buy some wine, a side or two, and some bread bringing the whole total to ~$30 without realizing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source: have had whole chicken for lunch several times myself.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the love guys! If only more important matters received as much attention as my flippant comment earlier, the world would be a better place. Eg. <strong><em>why</em></strong> someone has to buy a whole chicken for a meal because they can't afford anything else...</p>
<p>Edit 2: thanks for the gold, stranger! My first gilding, on a post about chicken! I hope at least that it was for my first edit, rather than the original comment! :s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than that, it's also signaling. A lot of the more interesting items you're likely to impulse buy (baked organic pea pod snacks?) don't really have anything to compare to. But, if you know familiar commodities like milk and bread and whiskey is priced well, and you know you can get a decent lunch for $1.50 at the food court, you'll assume that everything is a good value in the entire store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Ever wonder why during Thanksgiving time the grocery stores sell a whole turkey for .69-.99 cents a pound? Because you’re also going to buy potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberries, pies, rolls, sweet taters, brown sugar, nutmeg, beer, whiskey,......all items which get marked up a touch during the season. They roped you in with a bird and robbed you blind. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth having an employee devote a significant amount of time to get you to buy the car, but it's literally not worth paying an employee for the time to let you talk down the price of bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the fundamental answer. Walk into a grocery store and tell them you want to buy several thousand dollars worth of product and they'll negotiate with you, because the profit margin on the order makes it worth someone's time. Lots of stores have large floral and bakery departments that will do large orders - I just had a negotiation with a local grocery store over wedding flowers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source: A vendor </p>
<p>Likely they were “butthurt” from not having any warning about a major purchase. Milk doesn’t teleport to the store. A lead time would’ve satisfied the major purchase, and cash would continue to flow for the existing customers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you walk in and ask to order a couple pallets of soda or a shipping container of bread or whatever, they're usually really lovely.  Even if you're only buying a few cases of meat, they'll happily schedule it for you and have it waiting for you to pick up.</p>
<p>For larger orders, they'll deliver rather than making you go to the store.  They just get a bit frustrated if you give no notice and damage their reputation with the community because of shortages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder to what extent in those cases it's a matter too of the fact that there's going to be at least a couple of people there, so they have the time they have and it's either haggle or stand there. Like, a supermarket sells hundreds of times as much as a stand at a bazaar, but can have a &quot;mere&quot; thirty or forty employees working there. That means that each person's time is much more valuable.</p>
<p>I think there also might be an element of creating excitement and interest. Instead of completing a transaction in seconds and the customer leaving, making it look like your shop is empty, people see other people buying stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just poorer economies. Even in a western farmers market you'll be more open to haggling opportunities.</p>
<p>This comes down to a few reasons, like the market trader being their own boss not tied to corporate policies, like a supermarket worker is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i just want to add, because it seems like a lot of people don’t understand - profit margins are not always great on units either. my particular case are powersports (motorcycles, ATVs, etc). The margins on unit sales are terrible most of the time - the money comes from service, accessories and parts. the sales portion is more to win customers loyalty in order to improve sales in those departments. i don’t know about cars, though. </p></div>		</li>
