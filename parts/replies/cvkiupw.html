			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the trauma. You can &quot;numb&quot; your fingers with ice, certainly. They wouldn't be able to feel the roughness of sandpaper or a needle prick for instance. Smack those same fingers with a hammer though and you will most certainly feel it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, maybe its just about activating the nerves that sense temp so the nerves that sense pain are muffled a bit. Either way it seems to run counter to the top comment... we need a smarty to clear this up.</p></div>		</li>
