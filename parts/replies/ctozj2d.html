			<div class="markdown"><p>So, barring any Great Filter events, we could send a ship out into space that just constantly accelerates closer and closer to c. It'd spend a few dozen years building up time dilation, where it could hypothetically be intercepted by a humans in a faster ship after they've had millions of years of development. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. This is a Lorentz factor of 1/sqrt(1- (0.97) ^ 2).</p>
<p>If it takes 2 million years on earth (it would be more like 2.616 million), then 2000000 / 4.113 is over 480,000 years. And this is assuming you're traveling at a constant 0.97c the entire journey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume 2 million years would have also passed on Andromeda?  </p>
<p>So basically the destination may not even exist any more by the time you get there?  And will certainly be drastically different than what you thought you'd encounter.  And you couldn't go back home again.  </p>
<p>There's not really any hope for space travel is there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not. Even going at 99.999% the speed of light, Lorentz factor is only 223.6:1. So a 2.5million light-year journey would be about 11,180 years to a traveller.</p>
<p>EDIT: However 99.999999993% the speed of light has a factor of 84515:1 which would be about 2.5million light-years in 30 years time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, time dilation is very minimal at 50% or 70% speed of light, and really starts taking effect past 90%, but the real magic happens after 99.9%.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it backwards. At c, the journey would be over in a literal instant. at very close to c, a second, it then takes more time the slower you get. so at say 0.99999c it'd take minutes(?) 0.8c a few hundred years and at 0.97c itd take a few decades.</p>
<p>when youre travelling that fast, lengths contract, for you, the distance to the place seems smaller. it takes 2 million years to get there but your own time is slowed so much you only experience 30. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To be more accurate, an object traveling at lightspeed is everywhere along its path simultaneously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI the Lorentz factor sqrt(1/(1-v^2 / c^2 )) doesn't quite scale that way.  Even .97c is not all that much of a factor - sqrt(1/(1-.95)) = 4-5, so the distance only contracts by 4 times.  At .8c the factor is less than 2.  </p>
<p>To get to a factor of hundreds of thousands, one needs to go to something like .9999999c, which requires accelerating a g for a decade rather than a year.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to boil it down to this: a lightyear of distance costs one year of time. Go one lightyear in a year = zero time for you. Go one LY in 2 years = one year of time for you. Go 100 LY in 101 years = one year of time for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So regarding your last point about the ship aging around you, why would that happen, and how quickly? I'm mainly just trying to clarify if &quot;aging visibly&quot; means it would age 30 years along with you (which I would consider to be pretty visible), or if it would age &gt;2million years (roughly 67,000 years to every 1 of yours, which I feel like would lead to some pretty catastrophic failures within the first year alone). </p>
<p>I feel like it couldn't be the latter, because the ship is traveling at the same speed that you are, but I honestly don't know enough about higher level physics to say that with any certainty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He meant the universe would be aging around you, not the ship.  The ship would be aging at the same rate you are.  Just some awkward phrasing.</p></div>		</li>
