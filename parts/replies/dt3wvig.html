			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the road. If you live near (&lt;1km) heavy traffic (highways/autobahn/similar), bushes wont be enough because particles are falling right from the sky (ive seen balconies and furniture covered completely in black dust even facing away from those roads, so a greenhouse might be a better idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To the extent that it reduced particulate accumulation in the soil, yes. If the soil is already saturated, the greenhouse is sort of a waste of effort. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still have all the particulates in the dirt from before the tarp.  </p>
<p>For example, all the <em>lead</em> accumulating from the years before lead in gasoline was banned.    </p>
<p>So I would at least put fresh dirt in your vegetable garden as well.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, to an extent, but plants actually absorb some of the pollution (gases, VOC's ect) as well as being a physical barrier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about just using the space to grow herbs? They are quite expensive if bought individually from supermarkets, but contribute relatively little biomass to your diet, so would have a lower gross amount of contamination.</p>
<p>For example, fresh Thyme in an Australian supermarket is <a href="https://shop.coles.com.au/a/a-national/product/herbs-thyme-punnet" target="_blank">AUD$200/kg</a>, whereas cucumbers are <a href="https://shop.coles.com.au/a/a-national/product/cucumber-lebanese-loose" target="_blank">$4.50/kg</a>. So, unless you have a huge amount of space and would be growing more herbs than you can use, you'd be 44x better off growing herbs instead of vegetables (assuming the same mass is being produced) in this example.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we'll just have to wait for electric cars to become more widespread. When you eliminate brake dust (replaced mostly by regenerative braking) and combustion, you reduce pollution significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This assumes that cost reduction is the only objective. Moreover, assuming the same mass for identical space is nonsense. There's a reason it is more expensive per kg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like thyme, basil, and oregano do well in little clay pots by the window indoors. I've had a little indoor herb garden going for a few years and it gives me all I need, all I've got to do is remember to give them a bit of water every day or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not cheap anywhere. Click the link - the price seems in line with what you would pay anywhere. A few bucks for a clamshell package with an ounce of stuff, most of which is stems anyway. </p>
<p>Part of the reason for the price is that people buy so little at a thyme, which means it's a lot of work for a small amount of product.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you divide a kilogram into individual 15g retail packages the markup is pretty steep.</p>
<p>This isn't particular to Australia; in the US I can get a little plastic box with less than an ounce of fresh herbs for $1.99, or I can get a big bundle of the same herb (maybe 10 times the amount) from the same store for $.99.</p>
<p>If I wanted a kg of that herb in retail packages, it'll cost over $100 USD.</p></div>		</li>
