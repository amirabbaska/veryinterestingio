			<div class="markdown"><p>If every executive order were obviously unconstitutional, then that’s what they would do. If they just chose to ignore every executive order willy-nilly because they don’t like the President or something, they would not be doing their jobs correctly. I don’t know <em>what</em> would happen (I don’t think justices can just be <em>fired</em> like that) but I’m sure there would be consequences.</p></div>		</li>
