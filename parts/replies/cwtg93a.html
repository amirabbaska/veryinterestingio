<p>They have a very limited set of actions, probably basic things such as &quot;hunt&quot; &quot;escape&quot; or &quot;float aimlessly&quot;.</p>

<p>So, say a jellyfish is damaged by a predator and reacts to the damage with the &quot;escape&quot; instinct. How does it know when to <em>stop</em> escaping?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His characterization of the behavior as &quot;hunt&quot; or &quot;escape&quot; isn't fair.  It's not like you seeing a bear and your fight-or-flight triggering, causing you to run away.  It's not even like taking your hand away when you touch a hot stove.  It's more like the feeling of that stove as &quot;too hot&quot;; to a jellyfish, detecting the danger and moving away from it is a single step--at no point does it decide to react.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No &quot;memories&quot; but its possible they can become conditioned to be more sensitive to one stimuli over another eventually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't one, because brains have evolved independently in multiple groups of animals. For example, both humans and octopi have brains (though an octopus' brain is very different from ours), but our last common ancestor with octopi didn't. Both us and octopi evolved brains separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As ignisDomini said, a brain isn't a synapomorphy. The closest I'm willing to go to classify is to say vertebrates. Because (correct me if i'm wrong here) All vertebrates have brains.</p></div>		</li>
