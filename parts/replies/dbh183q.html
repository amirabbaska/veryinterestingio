			<div class="markdown"><p>The limits on hours were federally mandated in response to hospitals pushing interns harder and harder, compromising patient safety and essentially using them as slave labor.</p>
<p>It is widely reported that interns are expected to fake their timesheets, listing the maximum hours, but work the expected shift. If they don't, they are punished.</p>
<p>The whole continuity-of-care thing is bullshit. The handoffs get fucked up because the handing-off doctor is at the tail end of a shift, not because handoffs themselves are bad. Put doctors on 8-10 hour shifts and I guarantee you'll see handoffs working just fine.</p>
<p>This is purely about hierarchy and money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most (where I've worked) current work limits were set based on studies looking at patient morbidity/mortality. Unfortunately for medical workers, it was shown that more patients died/more mistakes were made by far with hand-offs between staff than a tired doctor (up to a point), so to increase patient safety, work hours are long. Of course, the reason for caring about patient safety on the administrative end is likely money and not wanting to get sued, but the fact remains, in majority of studies more mistakes were made with 8 hour shifts than 24 hour shifts, because it is hard to explain everything that is going on with a patient and needs to be done to an entirely new team every time shifts changes, and the less times you have to do that the better, until shifts hit around the 24 hour mark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, what about surgery? There are procedures that take much much longer than 8-10 hours to complete. Would you want your surgeon walking away from your complicated surgery so a new surgeon can come in and just try to figure out where the previous surgeon left off? Sounds like a great way to die on the surgery table. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously there are exceptions, but for the average intern, cut it between 8 and 12 hours a day with at least 1 day off a week. 6 days 12 hours each is 72 hours, that's more than plenty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't be the same as a plumber coming into your flooded basement and then staying well into the night to make sure the job is done rather than stopping at 5 and coming back the following day?</p>
<p>The doctors on the floor could be set into 9hr shifts with the first hour being shift overlap to talk with the doctor they're replacing while they are on duty. While surgeons are sort of have scheduled surgeries and consultations and then specific days they are at the hospital on call essentially.</p>
<p>Obviously this doesn't work otherwise they would do something other than over-stressing the people who keep us from dying. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does your wife stop taking new patients when she has already been on shift for a specific period of time? (honest question). That seems the only way you could try to have continuity of care as you describe. My wife is a doula, and specifically shifted from solo practice to a group so she could better support long labors. They do 12 hour shifts, and the second doula comes in at hour 10 so there are a couple hours to get up to speed on the situation. They only have one mom to take care of at a time, so they are not faced with another case popping in during that labor. That may be your wife's case as well if she is only taking mom's from in her practice, unless she gets full moon syndrome and has a couple in labor at once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She's a hospitalist, and I doubt they stop accepting patients at a certain time to fence them to the next shift. The goal is more continuous care, full continuity at a public hospital is an impossible goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two hours to handoff a single patient is very generous. My understanding is that most hospitals have a 30-60 minute handoff for the whole floor, which may end up being a 5 minutes each.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're called &quot;resident physicians&quot; for a reason-- they used to live at the hospital.</p>

<p>Maybe that's a better model.  If you have a home at work, you could integrate more effective naps/breaks etc.  Right now, the rest area at my local hospital consists of a darkened room full of cots and other sleeping people - I think many of the residents are not able to experience quality sleep under those conditions.</p></div>		</li>
