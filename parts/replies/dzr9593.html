<p>That's not the only reason you want to wash your fruit and veg.</p>

<p>I don't use any pesticides, and I still wash my fresh garden veggies.  I've noticed that tomatoes have a slightly different look after washing.  It might be due to the removal of sap and pollen from nearby trees.  I worry more about traces of bird droppings or other things from outside.</p></div>		</li>
