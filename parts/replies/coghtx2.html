<p>The page you mentioned links to it, but I thought it deserved a specific mention. The source code is definitely worth a read as well, the comments are easy enough to read even if the code itself is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IME if you're respectful and not outright dismissive of their idea more often than not they will be willing to listen to you. Just have to remember that to those people what they are saying is true. If you dismiss it out of hand then they see you expecting them to take you seriously when you don't take them seriously. It just comes down to that basic  respect I think.  </p>
<p>Not implying you must not respect them of course, I'm just speaking generally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would've thought that they used quaternions but all I see is ugly euler angle code...</p>
<p>Is this just because the math operations would get too heavy with quaternions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1985 is the use in animated computer graphics, interpolating rotations and that sort of stuff. As you might imagine movies and TV commercials would not be pushing mathematical state of the art... The relationship between quaternions and rotation was established back in 1800s, by multiple people independently (Gauss, Rodrigues, and Hamilton, at least).</p>
<p>Quaternions use 4 variables when Euler angles use 3; also, I imagine the direction data would come in form of azimuth/elevation (pointing a scope at a star or something of that kind).</p></div>		</li>
