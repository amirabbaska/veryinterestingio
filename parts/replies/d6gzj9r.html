<p>But the way that these quantities co-vary means that all observers will agree on the value of the spacetime interval. This is why the spacetime interval as defined above is interesting.</p>

<p>This just blew my mind. So that means there really is a constant, non-relative interval between any two events, it's just that different observers experience that interval as more spacelike or more timelike depending on their frame of reference, and that's what dilation/contraction is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Time is <em>subtracted</em> when you calculate the invariant interval, so you actually end up finding that if one frame of reference sees two events as separated by more space than another, it also sees them as separated by more time. You can think of this easily with a beam of light: if one observer sees the distance it travels between two events as being farther, the light (which always has the same speed regardless of frame of reference) must take longer to get there.</p>
<p>Spacelike and timelike have a specific meaning. A timelike interval is one whose value is negative, and it means that you can find a frame of reference so that the two events occur at the same point in space but at different times. In other words, you can make the frame of reference &quot;move&quot; in space at less than the speed of light so that the events occur in the same place. A spacelike interval is the opposite: you can find a frame of reference so that the two events occur simultaneously at different points in space. The intuition here is a bit harder, basically you make your frame of reference move fast enough that the time dilation between the events works out to make them occur at the same time.</p>
<p>If the value is exactly 0, it is lightlike (so called because light moves along lightlike intervals) and there is no frame of reference which can ever make the events appear to be colocated or simultaneous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah, got it. My reasoning would have held if it were <em>added</em>, because then s would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle, but that's not what's going on here. Is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about how you uniquely specify a point in spacetime. For example, when and where you made this comment. You could specify your longitude, latitude and height above sea level, but you'd also need to specify when. </p>
<p>It turns out that if you want to describe this universe that time's contribution to the (squared) &quot;interval&quot; or &quot;proper time&quot; between two &quot;events&quot; (which could be specified by the example coordinates I gave you, including &quot;when&quot;) is negative. So there is a distinction between -ve intervals &quot;timelike&quot;, +ve intervals &quot;spacelike&quot; and intervals of length 0 &quot;null&quot;. </p>
<p>Causal propagation always goes along timelike curves (one example of a timelike path is where you sit still and time advances). A null path corresponds to travelling at c, and a spacelike path is acausal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Provided the two observers are in inertial frames of reference, yes. In full GR, the definition of the spacetime interval is slightly different (it is an inner product with the metric), but the distinction between space- and time-like intervals is the same. (It is necessary to preserve causality.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And on that same note, is spacetime curvature independent of reference frame (invariant), depedent on reference frame (variant), or not measurable?  I am doing independent study on GR (just starting, but I am familiar with SR) and have wondered this for a long time.</p>
<p>If spacetime cuvature is an absolute (invariant) quantity, then it would seem to make sense the space-time intervals in curved geometry would also be absolute.</p>
<p>EDIT: remembered the actual words for &quot;invariant&quot; quantities, was having a brain fart and couldn't remember the word an hour ago.</p></div>		</li>
