			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only ever seen darker pubes on a few blonde guys. Otherwise everyone else has had matching carpet and only about half have been brunettes. I figured those blondes had bleached their head hair. That's the only time I don't match, when I bleach or color my head hair and I'm not a natural brunette. </p>
<p>If those guys didn't change their head hair color, the different hair colors are the rare exception rather than what tends to happen,  based on my personal experience. I wonder what everyone else has experienced. </p></div>		</li>
