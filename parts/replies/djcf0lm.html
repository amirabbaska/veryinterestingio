<p>Because I work with targeted therapies like PD/PDL1, CTLA4, OX40, TIM3, etc , the best marker for if they will have an effect is if they are expressed on the immune cells in the tumour micro-environment to begin with. So if you are treating with gem or cisplatin for example, and you look at the cell population in your tumour and find +PD1 , its kinda the marker we have been using for picking and choosing what combinations of therapies will be effective...</p>
<p>but we also look at Treg populations (FoxP3) as indicators, but that is something already established in the literature and probably something your group is already doing.</p>
<p>Thanks! I am very passionate about science communication. There is so much pseudo-science on the internet and not a great way to tell the difference between it and legitimate research.</p></div>		</li>
