			<div class="markdown"><p>I once made a Braitenberg simulation in a miniature hypertorus space. I wanted to find a closed form solution for the total light intensity at point x,y considering that every light source is repeated infinitely in both dimensions.</p>
<p>I gave up and just included finite repetitions for each light source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">Olbers' Paradox</a>, since infinite repetitions imply an infinite universe with uniform density. If infinite time is added to this (equivalent to infinite repetitions, since the speed of light is finite) then at every point in space there will be light coming from every direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting to think about. You'd think that the intensity would asymptotically approach some value, but the intensity equation doesn't fall off for distance and the space vacuum has a refractive index very nearly 1. I guess in real life there must be a finite number of repetitions possible or just enough junk in space to catch a significant portion of the light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scratch everything, only one piece of information matters: Is there more light absorption or light generation. We're way too soon after the big bang to see any repeated cycles of stars in a torus which is at least 78bn light years across, and while you could do infinite sums across infinitely many iterations of stars, the only question is: how much light is being emitted by stars and how much is being absorbed by other bodies.</p>
<p>I am utterly certain that earlier universe generated more light than it absorbed, because we need supernovae to make the matter to make darker and heavier objects. I am also certain that the balance is going towards darkness, all the light is made by hydrogen and helium and it's made by turning it into heavier and darker things.</p>
<p>Where we are at on the cycle and how bright the universe will get? You need a better physicist than me to have a go at that question. I'd wager there are very few cosmologists in the world who would be confident at making even an astronomer's estimate (I.e. where the length of the number is within an order of magnitude or so of the length of the real answer....)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, because the observable universe is believed to be just a tiny fraction of the whole universe - we wouldn't be able to see multiple images in this scenario anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that you can put a constraint on size of the theoretical torus by observation, but is there any physical reason to suggest that a torus is a likely shape aside from &quot;it can't presently be disproven as a possibility&quot;? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe so, my current understanding is that all current tests have shown the universe to be flat, but because we can't make these measurements with perfect accuracy there is always the possibility that the universe has a different topology that appears very flat from our location. Basically we can only put an upper limit on what the possible curvature of space can be, we can't really show that it's perfectly flat.  </p></div>		</li>
