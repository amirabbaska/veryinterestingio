			<div class="markdown"><p>I once made a Braitenberg simulation in a miniature hypertorus space. I wanted to find a closed form solution for the total light intensity at point x,y considering that every light source is repeated infinitely in both dimensions.</p>
<p>I gave up and just included finite repetitions for each light source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">Olbers' Paradox</a>, since infinite repetitions imply an infinite universe with uniform density. If infinite time is added to this (equivalent to infinite repetitions, since the speed of light is finite) then at every point in space there will be light coming from every direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting to think about. You'd think that the intensity would asymptotically approach some value, but the intensity equation doesn't fall off for distance and the space vacuum has a refractive index very nearly 1. I guess in real life there must be a finite number of repetitions possible or just enough junk in space to catch a significant portion of the light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scratch everything, only one piece of information matters: Is there more light absorption or light generation. We're way too soon after the big bang to see any repeated cycles of stars in a torus which is at least 78bn light years across, and while you could do infinite sums across infinitely many iterations of stars, the only question is: how much light is being emitted by stars and how much is being absorbed by other bodies.</p>
<p>I am utterly certain that earlier universe generated more light than it absorbed, because we need supernovae to make the matter to make darker and heavier objects. I am also certain that the balance is going towards darkness, all the light is made by hydrogen and helium and it's made by turning it into heavier and darker things.</p>
<p>Where we are at on the cycle and how bright the universe will get? You need a better physicist than me to have a go at that question. I'd wager there are very few cosmologists in the world who would be confident at making even an astronomer's estimate (I.e. where the length of the number is within an order of magnitude or so of the length of the real answer....)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess they would not necessarily be billions of light years apart. They could arrive at the same time if they come from a different direction. </p>
<p>Imagine you have a big earth quake that creates a wave on the surface. That wave propagates multiple times around the world. </p>
<p>If the wave propagates westward only, an observer will see it multiple times with a delay corresponding to the travel time around the world.</p>
<p>But, since the wave also travels eastward, it's possible to observe it twice with no delay. In that scenario you would know you are on the other side of the world, and if you can tell how far the quake was, you would know the size of the world. Or in our case, the size of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we've measured the curvature of the part that we can see and it seems totally flat, so either the Universe is infinite, or we're on a fragment that's so small that it appears to be flat (i.e how the earth seems flat from the ground).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lowest estimates I've seen are that it's 150 times bigger than the observable universe just based on its extreme flatness (like looking at the curvature of the Earth at ground level and figuring out how large a sphere it is). That is not even taking cosmic inflation into account which puts upper estimates many, many magnitudes higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe so, my current understanding is that all current tests have shown the universe to be flat, but because we can't make these measurements with perfect accuracy there is always the possibility that the universe has a different topology that appears very flat from our location. Basically we can only put an upper limit on what the possible curvature of space can be, we can't really show that it's perfectly flat.  </p></div>		</li>
