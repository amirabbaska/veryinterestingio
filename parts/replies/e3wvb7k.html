			<div class="markdown"><p>That is brilliant.  You can brand the casks with the buyer's name, and store them behind glass somewhere off the tasting room.  When the buyer calls for the bottling of their product, they can keep the cask for decoration in their bar/ rec room/ whatever or they can order another batch in the same cask.  You can even offer casks in a variety of woods and sizes, getting premium prestige prices.  </p></div>		</li>
