			<div class="markdown"><p>God damn, what a fantastic argument against democracy. I know you didn't mean it like that, but a government can't possibly require 100% of our focus, we have a government so that our society can do some of its own running of itself, so that we don't have to put 100% of our focus into it. But you're not wrong, it does really require more of our attention now. Just a wild thought when you look at it that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see it as a good argument against a democracy, rather as a good argument against a manipulated, passive, uneducated and opressed electorate.</p>
<p>Also, this is nothing new nor it is a symtom of democracy. Actually it's because of democratic values that you can find some resistance. The appropriation and manipulation of every type of new media has been a constant throughout history, be it by totalitarian systems of government, be it by corporate cartel/monopoly.</p>
<p>Print
Telegraph
Telephone
Radio
Cinema
Television</p>
<p>And now the Internet. I would not be surprised if in the near future one has to pay to publish content on the internet, and pay to have it accessible to x or y audience. I would not be surprised if governments and/or corporations start controling what, when and where information circulates. All this is already happening, heavily!</p>
<p>Having a home server with a public IP address will be illegal, and heavily persecuted, as it happened with print, radio and television. It has already happened with the internet in respect to unregulated, free content sharing since the Napster days to Limewire, PirateBay, what have you.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how excited I am for AI...</p>
<p>Business as usual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People aren't &quot;heavily persecuted&quot; or persecuted at all (nor prosecuted, if that's what you meant) for printing books, magazines, papers, nor for operating a radio station (must obtain license and spectrum though), nor for television (same as radio). Those three are also not illegal either. I don't know if Napster is still around, but torrenting and ThePirateBay is alive and well too. Most people who connect to the internet /do have a public-facing IP address/! That's how it works, and isn't going to change anytime soon, certainly not for legal or corporate reasons...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, this is why we're supposed to have representatives that do this full time.</p>
<p>You should really only need to put in maybe 8 hours of research and voting every other year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yeah. But in practice, those representatives are under no obligation to actually do what they promised or what the people who voted for them want. Imagine if you got a job and had free reign to do whatever you want, including make a shitload more money violating your non-compete to make shady deals with people lined up outside your door, and you wouldnt be held accountable for 2 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're hardly a REPRESENTATIVE republic these days. Unless you're a legal construct that somehow gained the ability to speak like a human and was given rights by a corrupt court.   Then you're allowed to speak by throwing vast amounts of money at gov't officials. They call that the commons and the free market it seems</p></div>		</li>
