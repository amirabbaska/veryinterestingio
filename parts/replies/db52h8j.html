			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a breakthrough in that it's the first time that all the countries of the world agreed to do something about climate change. That something are plans known as intended nationally determined contributions. What does that jargon mean? That countries will do something voluntary, but real. So it's a step forward while being nowhere near enough. </p>
<p>I also suspect that if Trump is the keen negotiator  and jobs president he claims to be, he'll realize that there are a whole lot of jobs in the clean energy sector (those turbines he hates don't build themselves, or put themselves up) and he just might be able to use a U.S. commitment to live up to the Paris Agreement as a bargaining chip with China... Just sayin'.</p></div>		</li>
