			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a full-on layman in this department, but wasn't the earth pretty much completely molten when that happened? I feel like if it happened again now, this planet would no longer be a planet.</p>
<p>Edit: I stand corrected. Space you crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine that yes, the collision would have heated up the Earth to become molten. However, this would have been &quot;back in the days&quot; while the Earth was still cooling down from it's creation to a constant natural temperature in the first place.</p>
<p>The moon-making something hit the Earth almost definitely before life was here. There's even a theory that it is what <em>brought</em> life here, but there's really no evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the Earth was molten immediately prior to the impact, but whether the Earth is &quot;molten&quot; or not is more or less irrelevant. Except for the crust which is quite thin comparatively, Earth still <em>is</em> molten. </p>
<p>The impact force was <em>enormous</em>, if it happened again it would just re-liquify the Earth.</p>
<p>Here's a simulation you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2lRpiediP8&t=5m27s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2lRpiediP8&t=5m27s</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth is still by volume basically molten / liquid rock. The crust we live on is extremely thin and small in volume in comparison. In an impact the scale of which you're talking about the the crust would make little difference. Most of it would turn molten in seconds and the majority wouldn't leave the system, eventually coalescing into a planet with moons.</p></div>		</li>
