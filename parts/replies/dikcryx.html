			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is only partially correct. </p>
<p>It is correct that adding solutes will decrease the solvent vapor pressure, and that this decrease in vapor pressure is tied to an increase in boiling point (and to freezing point too!).  But it doesn't really give molecular-scale explanation as to why this is. </p>
<p>The attempt to give this explanation is what is incorrect.  Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is because there are fewer liquid molecules per square inch on the surface because some of them have been replaced by the dilutant. Fewer molecules on the surface means fewer molecules escaping and less vapor pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is a common line of reasoning (and one you can find if you google, probably), it is not correct.  There are at least three ways to see why this cannot be true -- two that are very chemical in nature, and one that is intuitive.</p>
<p>Lets get the chemical ones out of the way and then move onto the intuitive one. </p>
<p>First, there is a pretty decent body of literature that demonstrates that different solutes aggregate towards the surface of water differently.  You can see labs like the Cremer group at Penn State and the Allen group at Ohio State to get started in this area. The point is if we prepare solutions of 1M  glucose and 1M butanol they will be present at the surface in different number densities -- despite the fact that their bulk concentrations are the same.  There is a similar effect for salts, with 0.5M NaCl and 0.5M NaSO4 also having different number densities at the surface, despite identical bulk concentrations.  However, we know that it is the bulk concentration that matters for boiling point elevation, and that all of the above solutions will have the same boiling point, despite having different surface concentrations. </p>
<p>Second, different solutes have different sizes.  If we consider the NaCl and NaSO4 examples above, the anions are clearly of different sizes.  Thus, they must occupy different 'areas' of the surface -- and displace different numbers of solvents at the surface.  IF OP's explanation is correct, it would imply that it is not just the concentration of the solutes that matter, but the sizes. We know this is not the case for collaborative properties, and that we can ignore the sizes of the solutes, focusing only on their bulk concentrations. Thus, surface displacement cannot be correct reasoning. </p>
<p>Finally, the intuitive line of reasoning.  Imagine you had two beakers of pure water that are covered and which are allowed to reach equilibrium vapor pressure at the same temperature and ambient pressure.  They will have the same vapor pressure, yes? Notice that I said nothing about the surface area involved for the water.  If one beaker was a 50mL beaker and one was a 500mL beaker, they will have different surface areas (because the radius of the beaker is different), but the same vapor pressure.  </p>
<p>We can take this even farther, imagine you took one of these beakers and placed a piece of plastic wrap on the water, with only a single tiny pinhole allowing transfer of water between the liquid and vapor phases. You have just drastically changed the surface area between the water and the vapor, but you will not have changed the vapor pressure. </p>
<p>The equilibrium (thermodynamic) vapor pressure has nothing to do with surface area. The vapor pressure (and boiling and freezing point) do not change because water molecules are 'displaced.' </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: This is not really correct, but it's almost there. It's far better than that hands holding version that was at the top when I made this comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you said you are a chemistry major, I figured I would reply to let you know this is not the correct answer.  I am not trying to call you out or anything, but I figured if this is your major you might as well know it is not correct.  I gave a long explanation as to why in a response to the OP. </p>
<p>Anyway, I am seriously not trying to be jackass, but this is a common misconception, and I thought you might like to know why it is wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, okay, I should have said that it's the most correct answer of the answers given at the time. I was feeling bothered that the top upvoted answer was completely off base, so my standards were lowered.</p>
<p>Thank you for commenting :)</p></div>		</li>
