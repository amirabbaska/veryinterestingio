			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's something I've always wondered: Balloons clearly always want to land in a nice open field, but they can't always control where they're going to go. Does that mean that a lot of landings are just spur-of-the-moment trespassing?</p>
<p>If so, what are the laws around that? Clearly no one has a right to go trouncing around people's private property, but it's equally clear that balloons have limited directional control and need safe places to land when available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of it that I'm not entirely sure about. But I think I have heard enough buzz to sort of know;</p>
<p>As far as I understand it, the legality around that is the same as when an airplane crashes. It's no use whining about it being there when it's already happened.</p>
<p>But, the ballon is still a commercial venture. There is money involved.</p>
<p>So, when you land someplace you give the land owner compensation. Typically for damaged crops, and a &quot;yeah, sorry I had no choice&quot;-compensation that most land owners feel is...if not generous, at least not insulting.</p>
<p>The <em>planned</em> landing spot is cheaper to go down on, because when you land there you pay out according to a contracted agreement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's something I've always wondered about ever since I saw what it took to pack up a hot air balloon after it had set down. It seemed like a small crew of people and a big truck, which is a considerable operation to haul onto someone else's property.</p>
<p>If I had a lot of land I'd be excited if someone landed a balloon in my field, but I know some people who would just feel like it was trespassing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Again based on my paragliding experience, I'm pretty sure that ballon (especially professional one) have insurance that cover these case.  But insurance will cover for real damage to property not just for landing exceptionally, on someone's property without damaging anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my paragliding experience (in Europe, as opposite to U.S. we value freedom of movement more than private property and have <em>right to roam</em> -Which does not allow anything but that's another topic- ) : In case of emergency you don't have to put yourself (or someone) in danger in order respect the law (I bet that U.S. have a similar principle). Being low is an emergency and you land where you can without putting yourself (eventually your passenger) in danger period. If you dammage property (generally cultivated field) you knock at the nearest house, they'll call the landowner and you fill an insurance claim (just like if we overshot the official landing field and ended in the neighbourghing field or lost control of the wing and crashed on a roof).</p>
<p>While in the air (Again paragliding, but I assume that sailplane and balloon do the same.) we always try to know where there is a &quot;safe place&quot; to land. In most of the case it will be pasture (in french we talk about &quot;cow landing&quot;), a non cultivated field or a sport field (empty football field and golf course are perfect). So we won't do any dammage to property. Moreover, we tend to aim near a road, it's easier to call our friends or hitchike back. As usual when interacting with the landlords, Smile, be polite, be sorry and in most of the case it's fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response! This is something I've thought about every now and then when I see hot air balloons.</p>
<p>The matter piqued my interest when I saw someone packing up a hot air balloon one day: It looked like it took several people trekking into a field with a truck. That got me thinking about the legality of the matter, knowing that setting a balloon down somewhere committed the balloon owner / operator to do a lot of work on someone's private property.</p>
<p>Personally, if i had a big field and saw a hot air balloon land in it, I would think it would be neat and would just want to go talk to the people. But I know people who would be much less receptive. </p>
<p>I live in the states, but I'm always super interested in hearing how the laws and practices differ between here and other areas.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>not usually. ground crews communicate with the balloon via radio and can secure permissions prior to landing. any regular operation will also have a relationship with surrounding property owners.</p>
<p>even if they did it without permission, &quot;necessity&quot; is a viable defense against trespassing. though obviously any damages would have to be paid for. </p></div>		</li>
