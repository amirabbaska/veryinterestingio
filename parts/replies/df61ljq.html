			<div class="markdown"><p>The sodium also blocks the bitter receptors on your tongue, which helps minimize the &quot;bad&quot; tastes and enhance the &quot;good&quot; flavors such as sweet and savory. This is why salted caramel works so well. It helps reduce the bitterness that comes from the burning of the sugars, so you mostly get the sweet. Also, if a piece of fruit tastes bland, a tiny bit of salt will help. A good example is wrapping cantaloupe in prosciutto. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I mentioned to people at work once that I put salt on tomatoes (cut) if I'm ever eating them raw. They were confused and dumbfounded by the idea of putting salt on tomatoes. I struggled to find someone else who did the same, let alone got why I did it.</p>
<p>Salt on sliced tomato segments that aren't quite sweet enough is seriously a great way to improve them and bring out 'missing' flavour, and I'm still shocked that I'm the only person I know that does this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite summer snacks was a fresh-picked sliced tomato sandwich, salt, pepper, and mayo. Nothing else. Amazing. Whatever slices didn't fit in the sandwich got salted and peppered and eaten like that. Not weird at all, I didn't realize people <em>didn't</em> do this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're certainly doing it right!</p>
<p>If you want to really celebrate a fresh tomato, after impulsively eating the first one immediately, you can slice the rest, then sprinkle with a yummy large grain salt and/or balsamic.  </p>
<p>You can make a really easy and fresh office plate to share with slices of mozzarella, and a sprinkle of good salt.   This is especially good with plum tomatoes that have never been in a fridge, and can be made a very filling snack by putting it on whole wheat baguette slices.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought my brother in law was a bit odd but totally get it now. I knew I liked pairing cheese with tomato but didnt get it was mostly because of the same salty plus veg effect (not just because cheese is amazing).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maillard reactions pertain to browning that involve the breaking down of proteins. Some Maillard reactions involve caramelization, but caramelization itself is not a Millard reaction. </p>
<p>Millard reactions occur mostly in things like meat and diary or the roasting of nuts, whereas caramelization occurs in places where protein is lower but higher in carbohydrates, such as in vegetables and fruit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not be more accurate to say that caramelization occurs because of sugar, which is just a TYPE of carbohydrate? I don't think anyone is caramelizing flour or potatoes. </p></div>		</li>
