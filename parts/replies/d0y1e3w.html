			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends if the circle is just a line going around, or if it's filled. I don't know which you call a circle, I didn't learn geometry in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say it's a hollow loop on the xy plane. A slice of this loop, if your axe falls down from the z-axis, will be 2 points (points of intersection) But I can also imagine an axe slicing in the xy plane and having a line be the points of intersection with the axe.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 points. An n-sphere can be defined as the set of points equidistant from the origin. In 1D this merely manifests as absolute value. (x^2 = r^2 is equivalent to |x| = r)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two points. It's called the zero sphere or <strong>S</strong>^(0). This is because it's 0-dimensional, as single points are. The circle x^2 + y^2 = r^2 is the 1-sphere, because it is 1-dimensional, etc. </p></div>		</li>
