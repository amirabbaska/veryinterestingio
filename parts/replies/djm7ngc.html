			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be curious how this would work for fish.  Aren't most fish fairly ancient species, or at least old in geological terms? As where most lakes are fairly young in geological terms.  If lakes are tens or hundreds of thousands of years old but the fish species is tens or hundreds of millions of years old I don't think the convergent evolution would really apply since the timescale for the evolution is far longer than the lifespan of the lake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a common misconception. Fish have been evolving as long as any other species, because we're all related. For instance, all the Black Mouth Bass species had their most recent common ancestor about 11 million years ago. Chimps and humans first diverged about 14 million years ago.</p>
<p>The ongoing specialization of species continues to happen for all but the most stable of species, such as the Coelacanth. Although, it's entirely possible that that species and the one we find in fossils might simple be extremely similar due to convergence. </p>
<p>But most importantly, the cause of changes to a population is either genetic drift, or environmental factors that affect the individual's ability to survive, factors that can be mitigated by minor incremental mutations to the traits of the the individuals in the population.</p>
<p>Long story short: As long as there are changes to the environment that affect a population's ability to thrive, the population will certainly continue to evolve and speciate. A lot of times those changes to the population come in the form of changes to that population's prey, predators, or niche competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The African Rift Valley is fascinating in this respect. As tectonic plates have parted, they have opened up a series of lakes, Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria being the three largest ones, and they have been populated by fish from the rivers flowing into them. Relatively few species, mostly from the Cichlidae family, were introduced to these lakes and they very quickly speciated to fill the lakes with hundreds of endemic species. <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijeb/2011/620754/" target="_blank">https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijeb/2011/620754/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I am curious about this. Are our current lakes young, or is the phenomenon of lakes in general young?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, it's probably important to clarify that all fish do form a clad. It's not like fish evolved multiple times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a pedant, fish are only a clade if you include all land vertebrates.  The clade would be the common ancestor of all fish and their descendants.  That would include lobed fish such as the coelacanth and all land vertebrates are descendants of lobed fish.  </p></div>		</li>
