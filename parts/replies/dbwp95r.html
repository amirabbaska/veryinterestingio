			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can make some money, usually less than minimum wage for your time. Studies show increasing the amount offered produces worse data and response rates. Most people take surveys because they enjoy it on some level.</p>
<p>The real money in focus groups, $50-100 for an hour of your time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now, it is mostly a branch of statistics and social science. Though computer science is slowly creeping its way in the field.  There are a few Survey Research Masters programs out there. But most people fall into it through their skills with social science research. I started with a BS in Psychology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the odds that surveys tend to not represent certain parts of the society that tend to not respond to surveys? For example, multimillionaires who are too busy and couldn't be arsed or incentivised, most young redditors (lol!) who commented on this post, people who are not literate enough to understand most survey questions, etc? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the kind of survey. If you want to test the new taste of a soda, you won't even care.</p>
<p>For example, for people who are not literate enough (in the survey's language), you could either translate the questions (and sometimes hiring a translator for a benefits of only 5 answers in said language...) or you can have surveyors asking the questions.</p>
<p>For people who don't want to answer, you could call them back several times (some surveys can be mandatory). And if you really can't have answer, give the weight of this person (in the survey) to someone else with similar characteristics. Usually, it's something surveys do quite well.</p>
<p>The real problem is when you don't even know where to find people. Millionaires, redditors, you can find them trought their houses (it depends on the country. Sometimes you select people and then find where they live. Sometimes you select houses and survey people living in it). But homeless people ? That's a new level of difficulty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a pure random sampling perspective. We can calculate this with a formula. Most researcher determine the sample size required so that only about 5% of samples are different than the population.</p>
<p>However, to your question, it depends on the study. We are generally aware of the things you mention and can adjust the sample accordingly to make sure we incentivize the right proportions of people to take our surveys. As long as we get a couple of each target demographic, we can adjust for it using statistical weighting. If don't get any of them, then there is not much we can do.</p></div>		</li>
