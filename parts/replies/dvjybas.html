			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally. Also, look at that gap between the rings and how straight it seems. Yet, you know that's just once small part of a huge circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>French &amp; Nicholson (2000) found that there's very little dust in Saturn's Rings, particles average 2 to 12 metres, and most are 1 cm to 20 metres in size. Their measurements agree with Voyager missions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could use the difference in curvature of the lines to determine the distance from that point in the rings to Saturn's center, but won't learn anything more about Saturn itself other than placing the smallest ring as an upper limit on Saturn's size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the different rings most likely have different origins, which also changes the composition of the different rings. Some of the outer and fainter rings are more dusty with very litte ice and rocks. </p></div>		</li>
