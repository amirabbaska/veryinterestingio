			<div class="markdown"><p>If you took the limit as t -&gt; infinity, you would actually get x = 100, which is why I'm surprised no one in any of the answers has mentioned this. In theory, if an infinite amount of time passes, you would reach 100, just as in this question, you would technically reach the destination assuming an infinite amount of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're technically correct. But for all t in ‚Ñù, x(t) &lt; 100, and the limit statement is defined rigorously and can be intimidating to understand if not well acquainted with calculus and maybe even a bit of real analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this question before and the important answer I'm looking for that I can't find is - say you and a friend are racing 1350 miles to a destination point. Your friend is driving 65 mph the whole time, you are driving 1350 mph when you're 1350 miles away then 1349 miles when you're 1349 miles away, etc., at some point you're going to get to 3 miles away and at that point I would get out of the car and start running. Who would get to the destination point first? </p>
<p>Say I can run 6 minute pace mile </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are describing a situation which is identical to the previous ones, except your initial distance is 1350 units, and you're using miles instead of kilometers. We can therefore use the modified solution </p>
<p>x1(t) = -1350e^(-t) + 1350</p>
<p>Your friend, meanwhile, is traveling akin to the simple linear equation</p>
<p>x2(t) = 65t</p>
<p>The simplest way to compare distances is to check how long it would take you to reach the destination, then check what distance your friend has traveled in that time and see if it is equal to or greater than 1350 (Spoiler: it is not.)</p>
<p>Simply equate your distance equation to the point in position where you would get out of the car, and you get</p>
<p>x1(t) = -1350e^(-t) + 1350 = 1350 - 3</p>
<p>Solving for t, you have</p>
<p>t = -ln(3/1350) = 6.109</p>
<p>where ln is the natural logarithm, or logarithm with base e. You then travel 3 miles at a speed of 1 mile per 6 minutes, which is 0.1 hour, for a total of 0.3 hour. Therefore, your total travel time for the whole 1350 miles is 6.409 hours.</p>
<p>However, in that time, your friend traveling at 65 miles per hour has only traveled</p>
<p>x2(6.409) = 416.6 miles</p>
<p>and is not even a third of the way there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you please explain the differentiation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dx/dt = 100-x</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I understand, this means that you're finding the first derivative of 100-x with respect to t. What I didn't understand is how we got,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>x(t)=-100e^-t +100</p>
