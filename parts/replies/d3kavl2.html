			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is the same everywhere, but my sister raises guide dogs and gets paid nothing. In fact it ends up costing her about 600 bucks per dog because she had to pay for their food. </p>
<p>Of course, she only teaches basic commands and behavior skills, the real tricks of the trade (teaching dogs to retrieve ringing phones/open doors) are done by professionals and I'm quite certain they get paid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This portion is done on a volunteer basis though. I raise the guide dog puppies as well and there is a large community for it. None of us get paid, we're just happy to work with these dogs, meet new people, and see the end result, which is what makes it totally worth. Plus, all expenses are tax deductable because they're for volunteering. If there's any questions about the process I'm happy to answer them :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't do it for the money. It takes many years to get  to the proper level of training.</p>
<p>It's challenging , frustrating , rewarding , and physically demanding. Imagine training 12 dogs at once, one at a time, 3-4 days a week , 10 months a year. </p>
<p>Do it because you want to do good in the world... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I appreciate your ideology, it doesn't pay the rent, the mortgage, the grocery bill, the electric bill, etc. People working in jobs like this deserve fair wage just as much as people in for-profit industries. Sometimes even more so, because jobs like guide dog training is very specialized and it is hardly fair to them not to pay them fairly for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From my POV it'd be a tiny puppy pulling at its harness and getting strategically pulled back, and every week it'd be less pulley until it's just walking straight forward without looking at anything else.</p>
<p>Then a new puppy would appear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am training my own service dog for mobility and other medical problems and I run a FB group for people training their own service dogs of all types. Finding the exit is common not just for guide dogs but for dogs that assist people with psychiatric disabilities. It is common for someone with disorders like PTSD or agoraphobia to have panic attacks, flashbacks, or episodes where they are dissociating, i.e., they're drawn so far into their brain by their disease that they have trouble processing their surroundings. Their dogs are trained to get them out of the triggering situation by leading them to an exit. Some dogs are even trained to recognize on their own that their handler is having an attack and respond by leading them out.</p>
<p>To formally train it, you begin by leading them to a door and giving them a treat in front of the door until they start going to the door on their own during the training session. You gradually start farther and farther away until they are leading you to the door from across the room, then give it a name like &quot;outside&quot;. Since you can't verbally explain to a dog that the important part is that it is A door, ANY door, to the outside, you repeat this process in multiple places until the dog understands that this is a general concept and not specific to the one door you started with. As noted by /u/TheRogueHealer, dogs are like young children in that they will also sometimes pick up on words and phrases through natural daily use. I sometimes forget but it is useful to talk to a dog in training as if they were a toddler and explain the world to them. It is amazing what they pick up on their own if given the chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started with basic words and concepts, like you describe, and through repetition, I have taught my dog to understand a LOT of rather complex ideas, like sharing, patience, even spelling (like he knows that &quot;w-a-l-k&quot; = &quot;walk&quot;, but for several words AND that this entire process is called &quot;spelling&quot;).</p>
<p>What really helped me teach him to this level is, like you say, talking to him conversationally and often. He can now understand in full sentences, and I am teaching him the means to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; using human language, shaking and nodding, so that others can communicate with him like I do. What also helped though, and this is actually crucial, is that every word or phrase has a tone to it, like in Chinese kind of. This helps him be able to distinguish more words and has led to a wider vocabulary than I thought would be possible in a dog.</p>
<p>My pup is very smart. He picks up on things very quickly. Other people notice this also, and are astounded to find out he is only 1.5 years old.</p>
<p>Conversation with kids works the exact same way to get them speaking, sooner. Obviously dogs can't speak like we can, but they can learn to understand on a fairly high level for &quot;lesser&quot; animals. I would argue that they even have an intelligence to rival ours in terms of emotional versus rational. They have much higher emotional intelligence and lower rationale, we have higher rationale and lower emotional intelligence. </p>
<p>People think they are dumb because they cannot speak, just like we once thought about deaf people. It is idiocy honestly, the extent to which people underestimate dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also a good example of how many animals, such as dogs, struggle with intuiting patterns when recognizing complex concepts. If you teach a dog what a chair is using a single reference point... it will struggle to identify a slightly different example as the same concept (a different color or sized chair, for example). You have to continually show it examples, and something that varies too drastically from experience (a stool, perhaps) might not register. </p>
<p>Humans and some other tool-using animals have a unique ability to generate what philosophers call &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge. By seeing a few examples of chairs, you can reliably identify <em>millions</em> of different objects within the category of &quot;chairs&quot;. </p>
<p>Dogs and most animals, on the other hand, tend to learn from a larger breadth of experience (a posteriori knowledge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I raised Seeing Eye Dogs for 10 years, and it's funny to watch them sometimes. As puppy raisers, we got to take our dogs everywhere we went without having too much of a problem. We had ID cards for us and them. Sometimes when we were out, I'd whine to my mom about wanting to go home. The dog, whichever one it was at the time, would usually react to the phrase &quot;go home&quot; and try to leave. It was cute :3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait did you raise dogs for the Seeing Eye in Morristown?  How long ago was that? My family raised 6 puppies for them and we were not supposed to bring them into businesses etc at all. You had the dogs for between 16-20 months and taught them basic commands and bathroom commands and socialized them through the 4H programs, but only the professional trainers handled them in businesses once they went back to the farm. </p></div>		</li>
