			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone understands what you're saying, but calling a flat tax &quot;unfair&quot; isn't exactly right.  Many would consider a flat tax to be the most fair because everyone pays something proportional to what they earn.  A progressive tax scheme is considered fair by some because it takes into account what you mention regarding disposable income.</p>
<p>Nothing is fair to everyone.  The winner will claim fairness while the loser will claim unfairness.  Its really just a bias towards whatever your situation.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that in the US, there are plenty of people who make very little money supporting a flat tax, and plenty of wealthy people who support a progressive tax system.</p>
<p>So representing this divide as a personal win/loss style struggle based on selfish desires is not only detrimental to finding common ground, it isn't even an accurate portrayal of existing biases.</p>
<p>To put it another way, let's say I open a food stand, and a Coke will always cost 0.1% of your monthly income? Given political stereotypes, you might say I'm subsidizing the poor (food stamps for soda) at the expense of the rich. Or perhaps I am a skilled entrepreneur, convincing an elite clientele to buy a 'luxury' branded product that happens to be equivalent to the version in the cheap bottles.</p>
<p>Maybe I should be allowed to try to do this. After all, business is business. And you're right, that when faced with a bill larger than your neighbor, most people cry 'unfair' based on their personal situation.</p>
<p>But really, the difference is that a Coke is a Coke, and we don't like the idea of being 'cheated' out if our money.</p>
<p>This is why u/PM_ME_UR_Definitions has the right idea in their comment. Even though it isn't the real question, the idea of 'I should pay the same for government as anyone else' is tied up strongly with both the question of the value of government, and whether that value should be the same for everyone or not.</p>
<p>Because you can go even further with this argument. Forget a flat tax. The government should just be a store, where you pay a flat rate for any service. And that rate should be the same regardless of who I am or how much money I possess.</p>
<p>There are lots of problems with this setup. But it also holds to an idea of 'fairness.'</p>
<p>So you're right, we need to be clear which fairness we are trying to encourage with our systems. But that doesn't mean we would abolish the term, nor does it mean that the reason we pick a specific brand of fairness is solely due to selfish interests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how one can understand what that person is saying and not find it unfair. Sales tax in my area is nearly 10%, so if I buy 100 dollars worth of groceries, I have to pay another 10 in sales tax, and that is honestly enough to impact my budget. If a rich person goes in and spends the same and pays 10 extra dollars, they probably won't have to give it any thought. I'm not sure what is fair about that at all. I have less money to spend on necessities while other people don't even notice it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that ignores the concept of marginal utility. Money has a different value depending on who owns it. Ten percent of one million dollars is objectively worth more than ten percent of ten thousand dollars. But ten percent of one million dollars is worth less <em>to a millionaire</em> than ten percent of ten thousand dollars is worth to someone on the poverty line. A flat tax is &quot;fair&quot; in the same sense that it's fair for it to be equally illegal for a millionaire and a starving beggar to steal a loaf of bread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why most flat tax plans have a lower limit, under which you don't pay anything. Or also a general equivalent in rebates/deductions.</p></div>		</li>
