			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example:</p>
<p>A friend of mine started sleepwalking. She would make embarrassing posts to Facebook in the middle of the night. She would text her boyfriend to come over at 4am even though they were broken up. </p>
<p>Then it got worse. She would wake up with leaves in her hair like she'd been outside. She'd wake up in the morning with stuff in the house that wasn't there the night before. </p>
<p>One night she posted to her employer's Facebook page and got fired the next day. </p>
<p>Through all of this she tried everything: Xanax, therapy, Reiki healers, hypnosis, cranial massage, you name it. The only thing that seemed to help was having her boyfriend around. </p>
<p>After getting fired, she moved back to her hometown with him and tried to put her life back together. </p>
<p>Eventually they broke up again (they were always on again off again) and she moved in with her parents. She was terrified she would sleepwalk now that the boyfriend wasn't there and hurt herself or her parents. She bought a night vision security camera to record herself sleeping. She started therapy again and made appointments with several well known doctors. </p>
<p>A few days later, she woke up and her parents' house was on fire. They got it put out, thank God, and then noticed the gas can. She'd finally done it. Her worst fear had come true. </p>
<p>She ran inside to check her camera. Threw the SD card in her computer. Brought up the file. Scrubbed through. </p>
<p>She hadn't moved. She'd been asleep the whole time. </p>
<p>Long story short: it had been the boyfriend the whole time, doing all that stuff while she was sleeping to drive her back to his arms. </p>
<p>In hindsight it was obvious that her condition always flared up when they broke up. But he was her support structure. Always there for her. It just never occurred to anyone that he could be so manipulative. </p>
<p>Over the course of two years, she had completely lost faith in herself. Didn't trust herself. Didn't trust her conscious desires, because it seemed her subconscious wanted the opposite. She was a shell of her former self. </p>
<p>He is a bastard.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex is a sociopath. Thanks to this thread I now have a name for this style of emotional abuse. He was masterful at it. And he also came from the &quot;normal&quot; family, me of course the screwed up one. </p>
<p>The fight that ended our marriage was because he was gaslighting me about an event that was happening.</p>
<p>I saw what he was doing late in to our marriage but knowing it was an actually recognized psychosocial abuse tactic makes me feel a little more sure of myself lol. He's a pathological liar to boot, and I'm on the spectrum somewhere so he had a hay day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gaslighting is a hallmark of abusive relationships as well. In its simplest form, one partner gaslights the other by denying something happened (usually to make themselves look/feel better; many abusers aren't consciously planning their abuse). They'll be so adamant &quot;thing&quot; didn't happen that the other person starts to doubt their memories of the argument. When it happens over and over, the partner in doubt slowly loses power and agency in the relationship.</p>
<p>I read a book once where the main character kept finding odd objects in among her belongings for several weeks. When she asked her boyfriend where they came from, he doesn't know or says she brought it home. As more stuff turns up, they're both getting more concerned, and he asks if she's been stealing this stuff, but she doesn't know where these things are coming from. Finally, they're at a party and someone's expensive watch goes missing. The boyfriend gets suspicious and opens her purse to reveal the stolen watch in front of all their friends. She's devastated, thinks she's had a mental break because she's been stealing things but can't remember afterward, and then <em>does</em> have a mental break. Her wonderful boyfriend stays by her side, forgiving her and supporting her, shielding her from the anger/judgement of her friends.</p>
<p>Turns out the boyfriend was planting the &quot;stolen&quot; objects all along, with the end result of her being isolated and completely dependent on him in the end. O.o</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an episode of South Park where they all pretended Cartman died from eating all of the skin off of the fried chicken. It was a good episode. There was also an episode of Duck Tales where Huey, Dewey and Louie convinced Uncle Scrooge that it was Saturday, not Friday, so they could get their allowance a day early and go buy a bicycle (or something like that). He fell for it, but since he was such a powerful business man, the <em>whole world</em> got duped into thinking it was Saturday, so the boys couldn't get the bicycle because the sale ended on Friday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My soon to be ex would do this to me. She'd steal my phone or other belongings and offer to help me look for it. Even when caught, she'd later deny that it ever happened. It wasn't until I caught her on hidden camera hiding my stuff, and kept proof to remind me later - and then I became wise to what was going on. </p>
<p>It's really an insane thing to do. It can make you lose your mind and question your own judgement about every little thing. Whenever she stole something and hid it, she'd point out that my memory is pretty bad, and then she'd be the hero who would find what I had &quot;misplaced&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom likes to try this on me and my dad but we are smart and it just makes her look dumb. For example, we had a blue blanket that was always on the couch because it was comfortable to curl up in. One day, for whatever reason, my mom threw it away without telling anyone. My dad and I didn't notice it missing for a few days, but when we did, we brought it up to her. She claimed we never owned a blue blanket. This one of countless examples. And she wonders why we don't believe her about anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brother example technically is accurate, but not a very realistic one as it would require a large conspiracy. Gaslighting is usually more subtle and hard to prove in any way. Ie: &quot;You didn't give me $50,&quot; &quot;That person didn't compliment you on your outfit,&quot; or &quot;We never agreed on taking a vacation.&quot; One person's word against the other's, ultimately convincing the victim that their own memory is not reliable, and that they may be insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect.</p>
<p>My ex used to lie to my face about things I could prove with receipts he had laying around the house. It got so bad that I got to the point I didn't know what was real.</p>
<p>He had me convinced that I wasn't on the lease and that he could have me thrown out of the apartment if I made him angry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good example to explain the term, but I think this example is so extreme it makes it seem like it wouldn't be very effective.</p>
<p>In politics where u/hamsterberry has said he has been hearing the term, the manipulation is more subtle and can be many small deceptions that build up to an overall loss of grasp on what is real and what is not. Often times when people don't know who or what to believe they can latch on to the people that act the most confident in their conclusions and offer simplified explanations for complex concepts. They'll become especially susceptible to appeals to emotion and biases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>political bullshitting</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Has this ever happened? I can see maybe bullshitting being used to cause people to lose trust in politicians in general, it's been fairly effective vs Clinton and Trump. I'm doubtful anyone has heard a political statement and thought &quot;am I crazy.&quot; Some may think &quot;wow [other party] is crazy,&quot; but that's not being gaslighted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure people understand how impactful this can be. We read your description so we have all the information and it makes sense... but when something similar happens to you, you really lose your marbles because you don't KNOW it's happening.</p>
<p>Doubting your own perception of something that you are confident was real, and honestly not being able to tell if you're crazy or not, can be very very hard on the psychi. It takes a long time to climb out of that mental hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Went through this with a former employer. Over the course of two years I went from being extremely capable and confident, on course for promotions and extra responsibilities, running my own department, etc. After two years I was incapable of even the most basic tasks at which I had excelled previously. I got myself transferred out from under their authority, started working with someone who wasn't mentally abusive and manipulative and was still unable to overcome the damage that had been done. It makes you second guess everything. You'll be positive you're right about something and then that voice creeps in that &quot;you really are too stupid and bad at your job to know this, why bother&quot; and gets more and more persistent the more you try to tell yourself it's not real and your instincts were correct. And then when you do get something right because you went with your instinct, the thought creeps in that it was all dumb luck and you didn't actually know what you were doing. I left that industry almost 6 months ago because I couldn't handle feeling like I was wrong no matter what I did. It's incredible how effective one person can be at getting you to ruin everything you've built up just by slowly getting you to reconsider whether or not your knowledge and abilities are real or just luck/your imagination/ego/etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in a relationship like this for six years. Just got out of it a couple months ago. As far as torture goes, gaslighting has to be in the top 10. <em>especially</em> when they convince others of their lies and you are truly isolated from everyone, even your own friends for years. It's terrifying. Idk if I'll ever even bother with relationships again </p></div>		</li>
