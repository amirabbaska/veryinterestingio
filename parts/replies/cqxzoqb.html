			<div class="markdown"><p>You made some good points but I believe there are a few discrepancies and additions to this that are needed:</p>
<p>The UN does outlaw the use of force as a method of dispute resolution. It outlawed aggressive territorial expansion that ruled the World for centuries prior to its inception. Military action is really only allowed in the case of: 1) UN resolution on military action against a state, 2) in response to attack or to defend from attack by another actor, 3) Pre-emptive action against a clear danger to a states security (i.e. U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and removal of the Taliban government), 4) regional cooperative security concern (NATO in the former Yugoslavia states). </p>
<p>The UN also is not responsible for international laws. Security council votes give international legitimacy to the use of force but that isn't international law. UN resolutions are non-binding upon member states and are considered law. The rule of international law comes from international conventions (Hague, Geneva 4 times, etc.) and inter-state treaties. Any of these only become binding upon signatory states who also must domestically ratify these conventions/treaties as law themselves. It is completely voluntary to bind oneself to these principles.</p>
<p>To delve further into the reasoining behind the creation of the UN and the principles it is founded upon it has to be understood that the treaty of Versailles (end of WWI) caused WWII. The treaty placed all of the blame of the war on Imperial Germany and forced it to pay reparations for the war damage (primarily in France but also required massive payments to the U.K.). Russia was also penalized for their early withdrawl from the war to have a revolution and had large amounts of territory taken from them. Both of these gave rise to the system of economic nationalism in the inter-war period. </p>
<p>Economic nationalism is the opposite of open market. European states implemented economic systems that favored domestic markets over international ones. High import tarriffs, domestic subsidies, etc. all made individual nations more prosporous while virtually eliminating inter-state economics. Each state viewed participation in the global economy as a zero-sum game where there is nothing to gain and much to lose by participating in international trade. This plunged the European economy into the Great Depression and allowed strong nationalist politics to rise to power... blah blah blah... WWII.</p>
<p>After the end of WWII, the U.S. and the U.K. wished to change the rules in which international relations were conducted. By connecting all of the countries in the world to one another economically, states would become interdependent upon on another. This resulted in the Bretton Woods structure that gave rise to the new liberal institutions that have governed international relations since: International Monetary Fund, GTO which became the World Trade Organization, the UN, etc. etc. etc. </p>
<p>This new system is prominently known as globalization. This system incentivizes countries to join the global economy to share in the wealth it creates through free-market trade. It attempts to eliminate the zero-sum game that previously ruled the world (the previous system can loosely be understood as geopolitics). In order for states to participate in the global economy they must adopt these liberal free-market principles; failure to do so results in the economic isolation of that state (North Korea, Iran since the 80's). By creating such an attractive system the U.S. was able to make war so costly it has been eliminated. Indeed, since the fall of the USSR at the start of the 90's, globalization has governed the way states interact with one another. The have been no conventional wars and only been conflict with rouge states or non-state actors (terrorists)</p>
<p>Given the system isn't perfect and has its faults but it is how the world is governed. Russia's invasion of the Ukraine is likely because it still believes in the power of geopolitics and has rejected globalization as the solution to state security. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually pre-emptive action doesn't appear to be justifiable (US arguments not withstanding..) and it certainly isn't accepted generally. You need to either be responding to an attack or have a mandate from the UN..  There is some discussion about when it might be permissible (in the context of an imminent armed attack) but even then it tends to be about actual threats (not perceived ones) and require a proportional response. </p>
<p>And this is actually a pretty good point on the limits of international law. Both the war in Afghanistan and the second invasion of Iraq were illegal under accepted International norms.. If any other state attempted to act in the same way there would be massive consequences, essentially the difference in both of these instances comes down to the fact that the US led the way and no-other great power objected sufficiently to want to prevent US action.</p>
<p>You can make the same argument about Russia and Ukraine now (albeit on a much, much smaller scale..) and it gets interesting if you look at the Russo-Georgian war (the 2008 one..) too - especially in terms of the reaction of other states..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a difference in definitions between us that can be clarified. The threat of imminent attack from another actor is clear justification for the use of force pre-emptively is completely legal. The ability to prevent attacks are intrinsic to the sovereign security of a state. A little bit further out, some argue that a state is allowed to use force against a potential future threat no matter the immediacy. There are very clear examples of each of these.</p>
<p>Using force to combat imminent armed attack is the specialty of one specific country; Israel. The greatest example of when this justification applies is the 1967 Arab-Israel War. The United Arab Republic expelled all UN peacekeeper that had been in place for a decade to diffuse hostilities between Israel and its Arab neighbors. The UAR amassed troops in the Sinai Peninsula on the Egyptian border and to the north on the Syrian border. The Jordanian military formed on the line to the East. The two countries had Israel militarily surrounded. Rather than wait to get forced into the Mediterranean, the Israel defense forces obliterated nearly all of the egyptian forces to the South. It then did the same to the Syrian and Jordanian forces and pushed the militaries back beyond the previous borders of the state in 6 days time (sorry for length, its a badass story). Had Israel not attacked first it would likely have been overran and obliterated. Their legality to do this has never been contested... the continued occupation of the lands gained that week (sinai was returned in the camp david accords) is because states are not supposed to retain expanded territories won through force (that's geopolitics).</p>
<p>Another good example of this is America's invasion of Afghanistan in '01. This invasion is widely regarded as legal and was internationally supported. NATO forces were actually in charge of the occupation since 2003. The UN security council supported the invasion (albeit after it happened and they did not actually vote on it). The Taliban government offered safe haven for known belligerents. The successfully attacked U.S. sovereign soil (African embassy bombings, U.S.S. Cole bombing, 9/11) and vowed to continue to do so. They presented an imminent threat to American security.... it can be debated, but its widely accepted that the U.S. was justified and legal in its actions.</p>
<p>The other more fringe use is to prevent the possibility of a threat from ever arising. Donald Rumsfeld believed the U.S. was justified in attacking and invading any state that posed even a 1% chance of threatening U.S. security. This idea, now known as the Bush Doctrine, is not legal under international law. The culmination of this thinking was the invasion of Iraq in '03 which was widely condemned and viewed as illegal aggression by America. The primary motivation behind the U.S. breaking its own system of world order was the control of the government by neoconservatives (Rice, Rumsfeld, Cheney, etc.). Neocons. wanted to redefine the way national security is examined. The primary strategy and belief has always been that of Realism (supplemented by liberal institutionalism). Essentially, the neocons failed and their beliefs have been discredited.</p>
<p>The Russian invasion and occupation of the Ukraine is by-and-large illegal under international law. The west's response has been to use the liberal institutions prevalent under the system of globalization to impose economic sanctions on Russia as punishment. This &quot;shocking&quot; aggression by Russia is a break from international norm and NEEDS to be PUNISHED according to many in the West. While this reaction sounds good and dandy &quot;you break the law, we starve you&quot;, I believe it is the wrong response and will just antagonize Putin.</p>
<p>Russia has done the same thing under the same guise, protection of ethnics/linguistic Russians, several times before. Transnistria in Moldova; South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia; Nagorno-Karabakh in Armenia. Russia uses internal domestic turmoil like the Ukrainian unrest/revolution to justify their intervention and retention of break away territories. As I said, Russia still believes in the power of geopolitics. In this respect, Russia has 3 historical geopolitical concerns; access to the sea, invasion from the west (napoleon, imperial germany, Nazi Germany), and access to stable food supplies. These are all viewed as vital national interests to Russia that must be ensured in order to maintain their national security in the world of international realism. This leads to Ukraine - the breadbasket, the black sea, and the buffer state. Russia wants and needs Ukraine under their control; to the U.S., Ukraine means next to nothing. </p>
<p>Russia is going to fight tooth and nail for Ukraine and will not relent. Driving their economy to ruin like we have been will either cause Putin to aggress further (the west attempting to ruin Russia... sadly, a lot of people do want to do this just because) in retaliate. We don't want them attacking a balkan, NATO state that we will have to save. With the drop in oil prices and devalued ruble the Russian economy is failing and if it fails completely we create the most unstable turmoilous region in the World ever. 23 ethnic republics and numerous other oblasts will fall into civil war and destroy the entire world as Russia's nuclear arms, spread throughout the country, fall into the hands of God knows who. The ethnic republics Russia has suppressed for centuries will likely use these nukes to target ever russian population in the World and end up obliterating life as well know it. soooo..........</p>
<p>Do we care about Ukraine? no. Do we gain anything from punishing Russia for invading Ukraine? no. Was it illegal? yes. Is punishing Russia worth risking the end of the World? <strong>yes because were 'merica!</strong></p>
<p>edit: sorry, i accidently posted before I was finished.... and I need to shut up about this shit already...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good expansion on the parent post. The issue of Russia going on its own is the major issue as it pertains to the Ukrainian crisis. It is important to note that the sanctions imposed on Russia as a result (in combination with the Saudis shocking oil prices) has had a substantially negative impact on the Russian economy which in turn has caused their people to notice and suffer--this being in line with the morays of globalization. </p>
<p>The problem is the totalitarian hold that Putin has in the Russian media and parliament that has prevented its people from rising against him and thus catalyzing change. Though some suggest this may be happening now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rules of war aren't intended to prevent war, but rather specify what conduct is acceptable in war. Case in point, from WWI: the use of submarines, and the use of chemical weapons. It was forbidden to use poison gas artillery shells, so when they escalated that particular aspect of the war, the Germans simply opened canisters of chlorine while the wind was at their backs so that it blew over onto the French lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But seriously,  why would a country stick to those rules if they are already in a war? If we take WWII as example, who would stop them if they don't play by the rules anymore? And how would they be stopped? I mean, if another country had the force and possibility to ensure the Germans were following the rules, why not stop them alltogether?  </p>
<p>Edit: wow! Thanks for all the replies! Really helpfull!  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the off chance that you lose. Most countries are realistic. It's not 100% that we're going to win this war. If we lose, then our conduct during the war is going to be judged harshly as is. If we overstepped the rules of war set down in various governing bodies, well now we can be prosecuted for war crimes, and the penalties that accompany war crimes are often very harsh. (Though not always carried out to the fullest extent. A lot of the scientists the Germans and Japanese used during world war 2 were given passes for human experimentation and other crimes if they agreed to share the results of their research with the U.S. and Great Britain)</p>
<p>Also, to a lesser extent, propaganda purposes. Being able to prove that someone violated international restrictions on war can often give a country a propaganda (and thus morale) boost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought use of chemical weapons and there ban in combat occurred only after WW I was over.  The way you write your post you make it seem like the Germans during WW I were aware that launching or tactically using chemical weapons was against international war laws.  However the UN didn't exist until after WW II and UN policy banning use of chemical weapons only came after the end of WW I.  Are you saying the Germans used the wind to distribute chlorine gas because they were unsure or aware that it may eventually be viewed as a war crime?  I believe during WW I it was very common for the Germans and its allies to use artillery to deliver mustard gas
(which was not as lethal as chlorine gas).  I am not trying to be nit picky I am just trying to understand the reality behind your statement.  Was chlorine gas already banned and so the Germans in a cruel or last ditch effort delivered it using nature but not artillery?  While mustard gas was okay to deliver via artillery because (while still very bad) was a less lethal chemical weapon? </p></div>		</li>

<p>So what happens when international law is broke? Well, it depends. The UN isn't the most powerful thing in the world by a long shot so the comments about you can break the law and nothing will happen are not wrong. Global politics will always play a part.</p>

<p>To add to this: the five permanent members of the security council  comprise the most influential nations in the world, even today. And there's a significant ideological split between them representing probably the most basic ideological split throughout the entire world. </p>
<p>So when the Big Five agree on a resolution such that none of them will veto it, you can be sure there's something approaching a global consensus on an issue. If not a global consensus, at least  a consensus of the most powerful and influential nations in the world. </p>
<p>And that's where the UN gets the real muscle for the handful of things that it does do, even if it leaves a lot of problems unaddressed. </p></div>		</li>
