			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh, as a stickler for wording in explaining evolution I'd modify your explanation.</p>
<p>It's not that they evolved it to survive, it's that only those that could survive in those conditions were able to procreate and pass on their genes.</p>
<p>Let's say for example that our entire population were subjected to a plague that destroyed our immune systems resulting in our death, except that there is a small percent of the population that survives.  Those individuals did not evolve to survive a plague, but they all shared a genetic mutation that prevented their deaths (an immunity, a counter-agent, who cares - the point is it's in their DNA and they were already born with it).  Now if those survivors have offspring, while we do not know how dominant that gene is (like Brown eyes and Blue eyes), we do know there is a chance their offspring will inherent the dominant version of that gene and also survive (and there is a chance they will only get a recessive version and may still die). </p>
<p>Later on we aren't going to say that humans evolved a way to survive, because that wording (which always bugs me) implies that our bodies are making a choice, but they're not.  We simply get lucky to be born with mutations that allow us to survive/procreate better.  Evolution is simply the process by which only those able to survive their environments are able to produce offspring who in turn pass on their favorable genes.</p>
<p>So that all is to say that frogs/crocs etc have survived the freezing cold because throughout the last millions of years, these types of dramatic climate changes have happened and those that couldn't survive would have died off a lonnnng time ago.  Only those that had genetic mutations such as the ice-binding proteins and antifreeze proteins mentioned above, survived and thus passed on those genes to their offspring.</p></div>		</li>
