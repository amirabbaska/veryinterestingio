			<div class="markdown"><p>let me add from personal experience, the great wall is on top of mountains. even with modern day tourism it's a bit of a hike to get to. What I believe u/WRSaunders is trying to say is that their would be guard towers on the walls to look out upon the different parts of the mountains. Once a guard sees someone or a group of mongols, he'd have more than enough time to sound an alarm to rally people together to defend it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it being somewhat similar in function to the beacons of Gondor in ROTK. They had outposts that could be signaled in multiple manners to convey a message and communicate over vast distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto that, when I visited the guide stressed the importance of the guard towers as any Mongolian horde would be detected easily ahead of time by the dust cloud kicked up by the mass of horses, thus making it infinitely easier to detect a large amount of invaders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. It's not like flat ground with a wall in it, its build on mountains, with rock faces and trees at the bottom, which would make it extremely hard to scale without the defenders of the wall being able to counteract first</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Wall is long but China has a lot of people.  Part of the fun of being a large state is that your perimeter goes up linearly with diameter, but your resources can go up quadratically.  And if your main concern is watchmen to report &quot;help, the nomads are coming!&quot; you can probably get away with sparse guards, maybe 1 per km, which over 10,000 km is 10,000 people, or 2-3x that for shifts.</p>
<p>It'd be a lot harder to man the entire length so as to repel attack at any time, but you don't necessarily try: have people to report attack, the wall slows them down, and you have time to concentrate defenders where actually needed.</p>
<p>Edit: as a side note, a secondary function of the wall may have been to control and tax trade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. The wall would have be manned with enough people to spot threats and signal that units needed to be brought to the area.</p>
<p>From what I understand they would have been able to see people hours or days from the wall. So you wouldn't need every inch manned all the time, just checked regularly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, while 20 people could probably clear the Great Wall in an hour or two if they were prepared and everything went well, an army of thousands of people, with their pack animals, wagons, supplies, etc, etc, would probably take days to accomplish the same feat. Days in which any sort of concerted attack would almost certainly result in enormous losses.</p>
<p>Then, once you have gotten that army over the supply train back home would almost instantly be cut, and you'd be stuck surrendering en masse from starvation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wall was not made to be foolproof against Mongols with ropes and ladders, the main reason was to prevent Mongol CAVALRY from invading as Mongol army without horses is like U.S Marines invading without air support. The reason because Mongols were the most skilled in military horsemanship and one tumen (10 000) of cavalry is enough to breach the defence qnd allow for the larger invasion to follow up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 6ft fence wont stop you from getting into a storage yard, but it will make stealing something from it a bit of a bitch, especially if someone is chasing you down.  Destroying it would take time, as would getting to it, as would scaling it, the mongols were horse nomads, so they would also need to get their horse over, that takes logistics and time.  It made the nomads more likely to attack certain easy to reach spots, or spots where the wall was not built.  </p>
<p>The Persians had in many ways a more superior but shorter wall called the Great Wall of Gorgon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_Gorgan" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_Gorgan</a>  but they called it Alexanders wall.  It was taller, with more towers and the persians response was often more effective vs nomads than either the romans or the chinese.  But none of the walls by themselves ever stopped nomads, only gunpowder finally did that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure it does.  What is this, denialism about gravity and material?   All because the media is trying to pooh-pooh the border wall.  I promise you walls have prevented your movement all your life and you barely think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, gunpowder was fairly ineffective against the nomads.  The Chinese were already using gunpowder-based weapons during the Song Dynasty, but that didn't stop the Mongols much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - the wall also basically functioned as a nice, elevated roadway over rough terrain.</p>
<p>Defending forces usually have the advantage of being able to sit behind fortifications, not having to deal with extended supply lines, being closer to reinforcements, etc. But an attacking force has the advantage of being able to choose when and where to engage, and the ability to concentrate all their forces in that one spot, while defenders must keep watch over hundreds, even thousands of miles. Thus, the ability to quickly concentrate your own forces in response to an assault is a huge advantage for defenders, and that means infrastructure, and that's what the wall provided.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is why Civ5 finally got Great Wall right - instead of the various bonsues it used to confer in earlier games, it creates a movement penalty for all hostile forces in your territory, thus simulating a movement advantage for the defenders. </p></div>		</li>
