			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't try rice for about that long, just because it never really came up. </p>
<p>My parents never cooked rice and most restaurants we went to didn't really serve rice. So as an adult, when I'd see a dish with rice on the menu, I'd just ignore it since I've never had it before.</p>
<p>I first tried it at PF Changs, and wasn't impressed at all. It just had no flavor. So I've had rice a few times now, but don't foresee eating it any time soon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with rice is that it's a blank slate. You can make it have whatever flavor you want. Although, you should try basmati rice. It has a real flavor to it that white rice doesn't really have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  It was just different so I wasn't interested in trying it.  The texture of food was a big thing for me.  Peas are horrible!  Hehe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the bitter taste as an identifier for poison is very dubious. Bitter isn't a desirable flavor in the west, but all across India and Asia dishes with a bitter taste as the main part of the dish are highly favored.</p></div>		</li>
