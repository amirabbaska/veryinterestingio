			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, animals with active camouflage can adapt to their surroundings. The interesting thing is that, for example, an albino creature with adaptive camouflage does not theoretically <em>know</em> that their camo didn't have any effect. So they do recognize that they should've blended in but they can't make sure they actually did.</p>
