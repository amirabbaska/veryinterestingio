			<div class="markdown"><p>So energy is loss via gravitational radiation. But mass usually exerts gravitational waves without losing mass? I am missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, mass exerts gravity normally - static gravity, not gravitational waves. Gravitational waves only happen when gravitational fields change - such as when two objects orbit each other. The objects will lose energy and the orbit will be slowed down. The energy is emitted as gravitational waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the something I am missing is what exactly a gravitational wave is. If its like a tractor beam then would you feel a strong pull from the gravity wave passing by? or would it be like a sine wave, less pull followed by huge increase in pull followed by no pull or even push followed by whatever the new gravitational force of the system is???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I'm in the same boat. What effect does a gravitational wave have? What does one look like, in terms of detectable effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is not a tractor beam. it's a fluctuation in the geometry that is periodic (ie how you measure lengths locally). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the movement of mass that creates the gravitational waves. So for a wave to carry energy away, the velocity of that mass must change, so energy is conserved. For example, the length of the year for Earth changes as energy disperses as gravitational waves as it orbits the Sun. From an earlier thread here, IIRC the energy is something like a 100W light bulb, so hardly measurable, but it will be conserved in the speed we move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to the quantum uncertainty associated with any massive objects location in space, does that not mean, given an extremely long period of time, all mass in the universe will be converted to gravitational wave energy... propagating into the infinite expanse of space forever? :( rip universe, first Donald, now this </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for the black hole merger thing. If you were just sitting idly by in the distance, watching it, close but not mortally so. The merger happens.</p>
<p>What would you experience from gravitational waves? Would it be movement, like floating in the ocean? Or would you have compression/expansion of your body as the waves ripple through you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>User name doesn't check out.  I bet the OP was thinking mostly of photons when OP said &quot;energy&quot;, especially since they implied mass and &quot;energy&quot; are totally different things.</p>
<p>What if a significant amount of rest mass is converted into photons, but those photons aren't allowed to radiate away?  Presumably you wouldn't notice a change in the gravitational field.  It doesn't change because mass changed, it changes because the energy distribution changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that you had enough energy in a small enough space, you would create a kugelblitz, basically a black hole created by the gravity of energy instead of the gravity of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every black hole is created by having enough energy is a small enough space.
A Kugelblitz is just a black hole created due to there being a sufficient density of photons, although being theoretical and it being fairly safe to assume it would never occur naturally, since photons have energy there's no reason why a Kugelblitz isn't physically possible.</p>
<p>The term &quot;a black hole created by the gravity of energy instead of the gravity of mass&quot; is scientifically inaccurate.
Energy and mass are equivalent, the gravitational field created created by a mass will be equal to the gravitational field of the energy equivalence of that mass (given by the fancy form of e=mc^2). </p>
<p>The fact that a black hole can even be created from light energy being confined to a small enough volume tells us that spacetime only really knows, and is only affected by, the amount of energy within a given volume.</p></div>		</li>
