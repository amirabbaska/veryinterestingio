			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it's because you're olfactory sensory neurons get habituated to the scent, and therefore you are less sensitive to smelling it. The sensory systems have this sort of recurring theme of habituation to constant stimuli. This keeps your sensory neurons more sensitive to CHANGES in the world around you. For example, detecting a sudden change in sight, smell, or sound is more important for survival than sensing an unchanging stimuli (like a smell that's been around for a while). </p></div>		</li>
