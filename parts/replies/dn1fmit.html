<p>To achieve black and white vision, you would have to have glasses that make your eyes respond uniformly to all colors.  There is no way to do this with passive systems like simple glasses.</p>
<p>You could do this with active systems which would essentially be video cameras rendering the world as black and white on a screen which would be your eye glasses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to quickly add to why the black and white filtering glasses wouldn't work.</p>
<p>White is what we get from having all wavelengths of light. Other colors appear when wavelengths are missing, and are essentially components of white light. If you create a filter that lets no non-white color pass, it removes every component of white and filters out all light. Letting white light through on the other hand means a perfectly clear screen that filters nothing.</p>
<p>Because there are wavelengths missing, the device has to be able to add light, while filtering only works to remove it. As /u/qutx pointed out, it would effectively have to have sensors detecting every wavelength, and built in white light on a screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your <em>eyes</em> may not respond equally to all wavelengths, but doesn't your brain start compensating if you're only exposed to one colour? I.e., sit in a room with only green light, and eventually it will start to look less green and more white (though I don't know how far it will adapt).</p></div>		</li>

<p>which is not the same as seeing all wavelengths in a way that renders them as black and white. </p>

<p>do you mean they'd be more &quot;saturated&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Saturation would mean it looks more red or more green, but salient means you can see more of a difference between red and green.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're already completely different. Or am I just <em>extra</em> not color blind?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a non colorblind person who has tried them on: Yep, pretty much. To my eye certain reds and greens seemed to pop more. </p>
<p>I also got to accompany a severely colorblind friend who was trying them for the first time. I witnessed him seeing purple for the first time and also going crazy over the fact that trees are not all the same color of green. (He said previously they had all looked the same drab color.)</p>
<p>It was pretty friggin cool. </p></div>		</li>
