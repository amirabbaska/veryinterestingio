			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but that's on earth or similar environnement (or &quot;normal&quot;), right?
What about in the entire observable universe, like on(or in) a star or near a supernova, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>technically possible. We sorta helped this happen once. Basically we crashed a satellite into jupiter. The satellite had a small, very weak, nuclear reactor on board, and the fissile material there got compressed by jupiter's atmosphere until it reached supercriticality and detonated. This was a manmade thing, but since there's places on earth where we got natual fission, it's conceivable that similar material could be ejected by the destruction of a planet, and sent into the higher pressures of a gas giant and detonate there. Indeed, a planet being swallowed by a black hole could easily have a couple of nuclear detonations as it's torn apart and crushed at the event horizon.</p>
<p>The forces needed don't happen on earth without manmade intervention, but on a cosmic scale there are plenty of ways we can see extreme enough circumstances. That being said, in any of those circumstances, the detonation of a small pocket of fissile material will most likely not even be noticeable next to the other kinds of destruction going on. A black hole for example already radiates pretty intense light and radiation from just outside the event horizon, and the fusion in the average star is way hotter and more energetic than some measly fission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the past it may have been possible. And by past, I mean billions of years ago when Earth was in the process of being formed and uranium was more abundant. There is a hypothesis out there (and I stress <em>hypothesis</em> not theory) that the infant, molten Earth may have been rotating quickly enough to separate heavy isotopes of uranium into sub-mantle reservoirs that could achieve supercriticality and explosion (perhaps aided by a meteor strike violent enough to compress material that far below).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got no idea wheter or not earth's rotation would have enough rotation speed to separate isotopes (but possibly, this would not be enough - centrifuges reach &gt;30 thousand rpm, and advanced ones go 60-70 thousand rpm, and even then work only with a gaseus fraction (235UF6 oraz 238UF6 are used to be exact, later processed into pure metalic U235 after separation) - and earth's mantle is still technically solid under pressures involved. As for compression, one sided one won't do - you need equal compression from all sides, and without any losses of compression coming from plumes forming between converging shockwaves - so I think, while meteor strike could generate the pressures needed for compression, it would not generate it properly enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, it doesnt. You need supercriticality for a bomb tho, otherwise its just sustained heating.</p></div>		</li>
