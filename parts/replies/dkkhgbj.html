			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is topical!!! Drank too much last night, had a spew, went to bed, woke up at 4am feeling dehydrated but really good. I've had a big drink of water and Powerade.
Incidentally I googled activity tracker watches because I'd like to know what sort of sleep-wake cycles I'm having, then browsed Reddit for a bit and found this post.
Sleep cycles + hangover cures? Reddit, you read my mind!!!! </p></div>		</li>
