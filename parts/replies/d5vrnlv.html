<p>Nobody in real life actually gets their supermarket shopping in a large brown paper bag with a baguette sticking out the top</p>

<p>Well, that shatters my illusions. I figured Hollywood types were merely parochial and didn't understand that the rest of the country didn't have it so good as to have local shops with fresh-baked bread and environmentally-sound bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, those things are generally <em>available</em> - except the bags always have the name of the market printed on them, and not that many people actually buy baguettes long enough to stick out the top of the bag. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the baguette isn't long enough  to stick out of the bag, it's not a baguette (but maybe a demi-baguette, which doesn't ever really taste right). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Audience has expectations, and film is a language.  The film word for &quot;radiation&quot; is a green (or blue) glow.  </p>
<p>That is, if you DON'T make it glow, they'll say &quot;ah, so the plot is that there's actually no radiation and someone faked it for a reason?&quot;  (Hunt for Red October).  Then 45 min later they're all &quot;I'm confused, there actually IS radiation?  Then why didn't they show it glowing?&quot;</p>
<p>The nuclear physicist kinda has the same expectation when watching a movie.</p>
<p>Where these things come from, the etymology of the film word, is an interesting question.  After the use of color film, someone canonized green as the color of radiation.  Not red, not yellow, not purple. No idea who.</p></div>		</li>
