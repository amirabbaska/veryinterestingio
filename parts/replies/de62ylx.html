			<div class="markdown"><p>Hint: you dont need to have some super suave tookit. Just walk up to girls and talk to them. They know youre interested, you know youre interested, its not a secret man. </p>
<p>Being physically good looking, tall, muscular, all the things that lonely people think are necessities to get a great looking girl are USELESS if you have no confidence, no spirit to go out and conquer.</p>
<p>You're 25. This is your absolute prime. When you're on your death bed, do you really want to sit there thinking &quot;Why teh fuck didnt I just approach every good looking girl and say hello?&quot;. What do you have to lose? Getting rejected? Man imagine your dad got rejected by your mom the first time and gave up, you wouldnt be here. </p>
<p>I hate reading shit like this, it makes me sad. If youre half decent looking, theres girls who pass by you EVERY SINGLE DAY and think &quot;yeah id fuck him&quot;, or even along your lines, &quot;Id give 100 grand to cuddle with someone&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you get that drive to go out and conquer back? I'm not sure I've ever had that. I've only ever really had 1 gf, and that was 7.5 years ago. I've gone out on like maybe 1 date every 2 years since, but nothing ever seems to pan out. About a month ago, a woman I've known for years but had only really been talking to since August broke it to me that a man she had been talking with also and hanging out with asked her to be his gf and she wanted me to know she didn't want to hurt me or lead me on, but she was going to be his gf. I was going to ask her the same thing that weekend, so I was beat to the punch. How do I make myself not hold back on this shit? I should've told her like 2 months ago, but I thought she wasn't ready since she had dated a guy for 10 years up until September when she broke it off. But I didn't, and we're still friends, because she's my brother's wife's cousin, but it still does hurt, even after I finally told her how much it had hurt despite downplaying it at first. And this week a girl on okcupid flaked on me, I just can't catch a fucking break and at 32 years old, I'm just struggling with not being consumed by despair. Between my shitty job, and no social life, it's like I'm not even alive, I don't think very many women ever think &quot;yeah I'd fuck him&quot; about me, and people always tell me what a great person I am, the people I work with and friends and family, but being a great person doesn't seem to get me anything, it's like I'm good enough to be a friend, but not good enough to be a bf. It's driving me fucking crazy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Simple. When you meet a girl and she makes your balls tingle, you don't befriend her as a first reaction. You hit on her and make it obvious you're sexually interested. You don't play it safe, you go for it and if shes not down, then unless you really want her platonic friendship, you let her go and be willing to forgo friendship for getting what you want from her.</p>

<p>I'm not much of an online dating guy, but I hear it can be decent so I won't bash it. Only to say that you should NOT take it personally like that. </p>

<p>They do, believe me. </p>

<p>In terms of winning over females, this is absolutely true. Being a good or great person does not entitle you to anything. Doesn't mean its not worth it to continue trying to be a good person. It just means that you're missing something which will spark the desire from women around you to want to be with you.</p>
<p>You gave a whole story about this girl you really liked but never told. Not sure how you can be around someone you like that much and keep it in.... youre asking how to &quot;not hold back on this shit&quot;.... my question is, how <em>do</em> you hold back on it? I just have the attitude that <em>omg shes incredible, I really want her</em> and then I kind of let that attitude shine through in my actions/words. They want to be chased, they want to be wanted, and they want someone who isnt afraid to go through a little trouble to get to it. </p>
<p>32 is not the end of the road. I have a 35 year old cousin who is quite literally bald, fat, and has the most 'game' out of anyone I know. He is a construction worker who literally picks good looking women up off the street in his work van, lol. So its not so much about having the best job or best looks, its about having the attitude. </p>
<p>That despair you feel is visible to the people you talk to. And probably a bit of desperation too, from the sounds of it. I dont mean to talk shit to you, just being brutally honest. You have to first un-fuck yourself by changing your opinion of your life and yourself. Nobody can find you attractive before you find yourself attractive. Cliche but very true. When you start to feel good about yourself, you'll carry good body language and good energy which will be reciprocated in the conversations you have. If youre walking around despising yourself and feeling hopeless, that will manifest itself externally as well.</p>
<p>This is all hard work. Happiness, confidence.... they are something you recreate on a daily basis, sometimes moment to moment. Sometimes its a blind faith that everything will work out, and you have to just keep believing until it finally does. But then when you start to realize how the whole game works, and once you build up that confidence, itll always be there. There will be ebbs and flows to it, youre not always going to feel on top, but you'll have ways to coax yourself back into action during the down periods and more and more you'll enjoy periods of being on top. </p></div>		</li>
