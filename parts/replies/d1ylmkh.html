<p>Is it though? The top-rated answer makes some extreme assumptions of its own, including assuming that the universe is infinitely old (to allow photons reflected from infinitely distant points to reach your hypothetical eye/camera), assuming there are no light sources (as light emitters above the plane would mess up the nice theoretical model), assuming there's no atmosphere, assuming something capable of seeing an image can exist in this universe without influencing the gravitational field, not to mention the fundamental assumption that an infinite plane is somehow a thing that can exist.</p>
<p>If we assume that there <em>are</em> light sources above the plane, or that the infinite plane has <em>not</em> always existed, or that the universe is <em>not</em> infinitely old, or if there <em>is</em> an atmosphere above the plane, suddenly the effect of gravity becomes much less significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, assuming the hypothetical plane has no gravity (or has gravity that for some reason doesn't affect light). If we assume gravity works normally, then light is affected, and the other answer is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this is a perfect plane it would have no mass therefore no gravity, but that's me nitpicking your statement.
Edit: I goofed and left my phone unlocked on a table with people who don't know what they're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand that line of thinking. However, I'm not certain about how anyone would interpret an infinite plane. It is a very abstract thing and a person is only given a few tools to observe it (especially if it is featureless) While it seems apparent as a thought experiment, I think it's important to remember that people for a long time thought the earth was flat though it's convex. I feel like the biggest giveaway may just be sitting down and seeing the horizon sink with you as it would on a plane or large convex surface, where a concave surface would stay in place (rise in relation to your eyes) as you moved downward. And vice versa of course. This is a lot more philosophy than science though, and my interpretations are likely to differ from someone else's. Plus, this is just a lunch time musing really. </p></div>		</li>
