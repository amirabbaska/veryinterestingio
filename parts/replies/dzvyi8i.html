			<div class="markdown"><p>This here is the real answer, maths doesn't have to apply to the real world, it just has to be self consistent. Thing is, when we try to weed out the axioms that lead to contradictions in maths, we end up with a model that has been shown to accurately depict physical phenomena, thus the whole &quot;maths is inherent to the universe&quot;/ &quot;maths is a product of human intellect&quot; debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I wish I was aware of that debate growing up. I think I brought up these questions growing up and was dismissed so I gave up on math. If someone would have told me that a debate exists I would have given myself more credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. All you need to understand is that’s the way it is. Math is a language with rules. Once you know the rules it’s really simple. Unless you’re getting into theoretical math, don’t question the rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Do</em> question the rules. But <em>don't</em> expect your grade-school math teacher to have a discussion with you in front of the rest of the class about what an axiomatic system is.</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay to invent your own math. But when you're trying to answer math tests in school, or do your business's third-quarter budget, you're expected to use the same math everyone else uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, don’t question the rules when trying to learn the basics. It makes more sense to question things once you understand basics. Otherwise people just get really confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh this is only true if you subscribe to mathematical formalism. Which is a commonly held position but by no means a dominant one among philosophers and mathematicians.</p>
<p>Plenty are platonists or intuitionists or have other more obscure theories about it.</p>
<p>the philosophy of mathematics is a beautiful and complex field</p></div>		</li>
