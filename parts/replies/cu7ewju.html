			<p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> basically does that. Granted it's not a conversation, but it creates sentences and asks you to pronounce them, then detects if you did it right.</p>		</li>

			<p>The detection is pretty rudimentary though (in relative terms). Rosetta Stone and Fluenz do it too but they're expensive and not highly regarded.</p>		</li>

			<p>I thought Rosetta Stone was widely considered a surefire way to learn a foreign language?</p>		</li>

			<p>The sure fire way to say a tomato is resting on a table sure. I tried Rosetta Stone, it doesn't work because you don't get tested or interactive practice. They just test you can say words and sentences based on specific pictures. Moving to abstract thinking and telling people your plans for today, asking beyond basic questions is all out of the scope of Rosetta Stone because it isn't an AI - it doesn't let you practice content not preset in it. So you may be able to say &quot;this apple is blue, why is that?&quot; Because you learnt how to say &quot;this apple is&quot; &quot;red&quot; &quot;blue&quot; &quot;why is that&quot; separately, but never together, and never get a reply. The best will always be a specialized course where you can actually talk to someone. There are online &quot;schools&quot; just like this for many languages now. Very cheap too.</p>		</li>

			<p>Marketed as one, but perhaps not considered so by linguists. From what I have heard, it works for some people, but most need real instructors.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's what they want you to think. They basically make their money on a false reputation. In reality, nothing tends to stick (unless you're additionally using other methods to help drill in the vocabulary).<br><br>It's ok as tool that can be integrated into your overall language-learning journey, as one small part of it - but that's a very expensive part. You're better off saving that money or using it elsewhere (for instance, on an well-designed audio course where you're instructed to speak out loud). Duolingo has a much improved Rosetta Stone sort of approach if you want that sort of thing, and is free.</p>		</li>

			<p>detection is done through machine learning. then the speech is created using a different system to the detection. Each uses the highest probable match in the context of previous matches.</p>		</li>

			<p>Duolingo courses are largely curated and constructed by humans. The test generation is rigid and rather trivial. I believe they use simple prototypes that take on words from a pool designed for the class of test.</p>		</li>

			<p>Except that, if I'm not mistaken, Duolingo doesn't depend on an AI to tell you if you're right, it depends on <a href="https://incubator.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">people translating their coursework</a>.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wow that's a neat idea. Maybe you could just hook one of those speech programs up to cleverbot or something like that. They excel at conversational English, but don't really have any meaning behind them. You could just chat and get a feel for the language. Of course I don't know if anyone's built a cleverbot type application in a language other than English, and it's pretty dependant on the large database of responses it's gotten. </p>		</li>

			<p>Cleverbot isn't really a fair comparison, it does not construct its own sentences. It stores everything that has ever been said to it and does its best to return a suitable response using that database.<br><br>Check out the Radiolab episode &quot;Talking to Machines&quot; if you're interested.<br><br>Edit: you did mention the database. AFAIK it is entirely dependent on the database, not just primarily </p>		</li>

			<p>That's not a problem though, if you want to learn a language what the bot says isn't important, in fact it's better because you'll get synthesized natural conversation from the other people using it. </p>		</li>

			<p>I hear you about conversational speech, but I'm still not so convinced that it would be an effective way to actually learn a language, as it would not even be able to understand or correct you if you make a mistake.<br><br>The &quot;other people&quot; aren't talking to you live, they are just database records. So, if I make a strange spelling error, and it cannot match my phrase to anything in the database, it will usually spit out some nonsense response. If they were actually chatting worth you, maybe you could get some help with corrections, but then we're just back to talking to humans...</p>		</li>

			<p>Well it would obviously be inferior to an actual person to talk to, but I think better than a language course that only has pre-set conversations to listen to. It's less for learning the language than for practicing one. Anyone who's learned a foreign language knows you lose that proficiency without practice pretty quickly. </p>		</li>

			<p>Translation is whole other ball of wax. Look at google translate. It can understand words, but has a big problem with meaning. AI is really not in the picture for either translation or voice recognition. At least not AI in the sense of replicating human thought processsing. It works by a heuristic. It sees patterns that exist and tries to correlate them. With enough data it can make very good guesses without having any true AI at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>What is true AI? The dream of an inference based AI mostly died decades ago. Instead we've seen massive progress using &quot;dumb&quot; approaches that old school AI researchers haven't come close to matching. </p>		</li>

			<p>Google Translate doesn't &quot;understand&quot; anything. It's mostly using statistical MT with Google Books serving as the main reference corpora, since many works scanned there have hand translated versions of the work in other languages that have also been translated. In other words, Google Translate is just using what is commonly translated between language pairs by human translators on a phrase by phrase basis. It doesn't have it's own generation scheme for novel content. <br><br>Although I'm really glad you're bringing up how these technologies have nothing to do with true AI. I wanted to say as much, but I haven't figured out exactly what is the best way to explain that yet. </p>		</li>
