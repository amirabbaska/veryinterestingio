			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> basically does that. Granted it's not a conversation, but it creates sentences and asks you to pronounce them, then detects if you did it right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Duolingo courses are largely curated and constructed by humans. The test generation is rigid and rather trivial. I believe they use simple prototypes that take on words from a pool designed for the class of test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that, if I'm not mistaken, Duolingo doesn't depend on an AI to tell you if you're right, it depends on <a href="https://incubator.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">people translating their coursework</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's a neat idea. Maybe you could just hook one of those speech programs up to cleverbot or something like that. They excel at conversational English, but don't really have any meaning behind them. You could just chat and get a feel for the language. Of course I don't know if anyone's built a cleverbot type application in a language other than English, and it's pretty dependant on the large database of responses it's gotten. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cleverbot isn't really a fair comparison, it does not construct its own sentences. It stores everything that has ever been said to it and does its best to return a suitable response using that database.</p>
<p>Check out the Radiolab episode &quot;Talking to Machines&quot; if you're interested.</p>
<p>Edit: you did mention the database. AFAIK it is entirely dependent on the database, not just primarily </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a problem though, if you want to learn a language what the bot says isn't important, in fact it's better because you'll get synthesized natural conversation from the other people using it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Translation is whole other ball of wax. Look at google translate. It can understand words, but has a big problem with meaning. AI is really not in the picture for either translation or voice recognition. At least not AI in the sense of replicating human thought processsing. It works by a heuristic. It sees patterns that exist and tries to correlate them. With enough data it can make very good guesses without having any true AI at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google Translate doesn't &quot;understand&quot; anything. It's mostly using statistical MT with Google Books serving as the main reference corpora, since many works scanned there have hand translated versions of the work in other languages that have also been translated. In other words, Google Translate is just using what is commonly translated between language pairs by human translators on a phrase by phrase basis. It doesn't have it's own generation scheme for novel content. </p>
<p>Although I'm really glad you're bringing up how these technologies have nothing to do with true AI. I wanted to say as much, but I haven't figured out exactly what is the best way to explain that yet. </p></div>		</li>
