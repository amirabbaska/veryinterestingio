			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize when you say stuff like this, or about your healthcare system, that to some americans your country (and canada) sound like a mythical place where the grass actually is greener? </p>
<p>Which is weird seeing as some of our ancestors fought so hard to leave. </p>
<p>*disclaimer. No I will not help you take back the colonies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They fought so hard to leave because no one liked their puritanical religious views that they were trying to force on everyone else. People were pretty happy they left to be honest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get why everyone seems to think the Puritans/Separatists=the Colonists. They weren't the first major colony, that was Jamestown, which was settled based on the desire for economic opportunity. The Puritans came later, and were never the most major colony. Acting as if the Puritans are the ancestors of America is like saying Americans come from the Dutch settling New Amsterdam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to be fair, England was also war-island, where every century some new religious, political, or dynastic group would take over and murder everyone who disagreed with them.</p>
<p>Which is the reason the founding fathers of America were so against 'factionalism', and the reason the 1st amendment protection of religion exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't come to America to escape the terrible Kingdom. They came for opportunity in the new land. And they became independent because no one wants to be ruled by a country thousands of miles away that doesn't even know what's going on in their colony but still enforces rules that might not make sense there. It wasn't related to them not liking UK.</p></div>		</li>
