In short, when you sleep there is increased flow of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) through your brain, which helps clear built up metabolites and waste (and also amyloid beta, implicated in Alzheimer's). Other papers have actually shown that neurons shrink in size, allowing less resistance to fluid flow and proper clearance. </p>
<p>Sleep has many different functions, and we are only scratching the surface in terms of specific mechanisms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the amazing things about biological systems is very few only do &quot;one thing&quot;.  Almost all biological systems have evolved to have multiple useful and necessary functions, and the more universal to life it is, the more likely it is to have many layers of necessity.  Sleep seems about as basic as you can get for complex life!  It comes with so many obvious dangers but so few species have managed to evolve out of the need for it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I completely agree with you though, in that evolution seems to favor sleeping in macro-scale animals.</p></div>		</li>

By simulating it in your brain, in the form of a dream, and giving you ''sub conscious'' practice for a similar real life event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the implication. It's too early to say definitively if that's true, but it's an interesting possibility. Also, people with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases sleep a ton, suggesting perhaps the brain might be trying to clear amyloid and other toxic compounds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The space between brain cells in mice gets larger during sleep; possibly so toxins can be flushed out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For centuries, scientists and philosophers have wondered why people sleep and how it affects the brain. Only recently have scientists shown that sleep is important for storing memories. In this study, Dr. Nedergaard and her colleagues unexpectedly found that sleep may be also be the period when the brain cleanses itself of toxic molecules.</p>
<p>Their results, published in Science, show that during sleep a plumbing system called the glymphatic system may open, letting fluid flow rapidly through the brain. Dr. Nedergaardâ€™s lab recently discovered the glymphatic system helps control the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a clear liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a couple of things that contribute to that. Most notably, exiting sleep mid-rem cycle is akin to jumping into a pool fully dressed - you still can swim, but you were prepared for other things. Strip your close (activate the other parts of your brain) and you're mostly back to normal in a reasonable timeframe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still find it really funny that we aren't 100% sure why we need sleep, which is something that most of us do literally every night or nearly every night and have done for the entire lifetime of our species, as far as we know. How ridiculous is that? Makes me think about a lot... If we don't know <em>that</em>, what else is there out there that we don't know?</p></div>		</li>
