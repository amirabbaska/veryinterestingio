			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly right. The 'filter' for a tank like this is often a separately attached sump system, like another tank underneath it with lots of cleaning and maintenance stuff (carbon packs/bio balls/algae/protein skimmer/UV sterilizer/water pumps/heaters), and lots of water exposed to air for good O2 exchange (protein skimmers in specific oxygenate the water very well).</p></div>		</li>
