			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the wording is that the rope would &quot;hover.&quot; I saw the question and assumed he meant that as in, the rope would hover 1 meter off the ground, which seemed like a pretty interesting bit of physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such as the rope actually being a steel cable that's being electromagnetically driven to the speed of 8 km/s so that it's centrifugal force cancels it's gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the model of gravity you learn in highschool it totally floats, and most people stop taking physics courses after they graduate. So yeah that makes sense </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm wondering, if earth was a magically perfectly round object with an equal weighting, where would the rope have the slack. If the rope were held 1 m high and then dropped, how would the rope fall?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>all points of the rope circling the globe would move towards the center of gravity.  some areas may have minor &quot;waves&quot; when they touch down, just enough to make up the 6 meters or so of slack.</p></div>		</li>
