			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that's because it often has been sitting for a while. It's quite a slow extraction process and I suppose it goes into a jug until you feed to it people or moderate nuclear reactions with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the taste thing be due to a lack of minerals or a different set of them? There are some bottled water brands I don't like the taste of, for this reason. I would be surprised if our taste buds could actually differentiate between heavy and light water since their chemistry is virtually identical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost certainly. It wouldn't have any of the trace minerals that gives water a slight taste, which is a reason why people dislike the taste of distilled water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The point just about every response here has made is that their chemistry <strong><em>is not</em></strong> identical. It wouldn't kill you otherwise. Whether we could taste the difference is a different matter entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chemistry IS identical. Its the physical characteristic (different mass) that are causing problems such as change in weight distribution. Heavy water reacts exactly the same as normal water, it just has more mass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it would have a different mouthfeel, due to being slightly denser than normal water. Actually, that might affect the perception of the taste, too.</p></div>		</li>
