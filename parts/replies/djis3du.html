			<div class="markdown"><p>A more accurate summary of that would be &quot;dark matter density around supermassive black holes not enough to cause runaway growth&quot;.  The universe today headline is simply wrong.</p>
<p>They say nothing about the ability of a black hole to consume dark matter.  The paper is about the density of dark matter in galactic cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Dark matter has a very low density, it just takes up a huge volume, and that's how it has so much mass. So the Milky Way's gravity is dominated by dark matter, but a black hole will not hit that many DM particles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the other reason why the mass of DM is so huge is because its density is relatively homogeneous?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Universe today is not a good source. I enjoyed their podcast and such but have found their reporting to be wildly inaccurate at times. They're <em>usually</em> fairly on point, but it's more entertainment than a source of facts. </p></div>		</li>
