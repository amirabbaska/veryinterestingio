			<div class="markdown"><p>stand next to a wall with your nose touching it. you have to turn your head to see the whole thing. back up a bit, head doesn't have to turn as much. that is an arc distance.</p>
<p>eyes (and cameras) can see in an arc without moving. one of your eyes, staring straight ahead, can see everything in a ~155 degree sweep. go ahead and see for yourself. square your shoulders, close one eye, and look straight ahead. now move your hand left/right until you can't see it anymore. that's your eye's field of view.</p>
<p>objects will take up part of your view depending on their actual size and how close you are to them. I mentioned before that a meter stick 1 meter away will take up about 53 of those degrees. that means that a meter wide wall a meter away will block about 1/3 of your vision (in one eye). this is what you actually see, not size. 2 objects with the same arc will appear the same size. </p>
<p>you can calculate these arcs by using geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, ask math questions, expect math answers, but I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>Look at some large, nearby object like a couch or bookcase in the room you're in. Point your left arm at the left edge of it and your right arm at the right edge of it. Your arms make an angle. This is roughly the angular size of the object (in order for it to be exact, both your shoulders would need to be directly underneath your head, but close enough). If an object surrounds you, it takes up 360째 of your view. If you're standing with your face up against a long wall, the wall takes up nearly 180째 of your view. The couch or bookcase probably takes up about 10-30째 of your view, so its angular size is 10-30째.</p>
<p>Angular size is how we refer to the apparent size of distant objects. Things like moons, planets, and stars are commonly referred to in terms of angular size, and the reason we have spectacular solar eclipses is that the moon and sun have very similar angular sizes (a little over half of one degree). Even though the moon has only 0.2% of the diameter of the sun, it has almost the same angular size because it is so much closer.</p>
<p>At this point, since we're working with angles and distances and the relationships between the two, there's no place left to go but pure trigonometry. Since you asked for an ELI2 when the previous commenter got here, I'll skip over the why of it and simply say you need the distance and the angular size, and plug them into this formula:</p>
<p>real size = 2 x distance x tan(angularSize/2).</p>
<p>Don't worry about the tan, just use a calculator.</p>
<p>And that's the answer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...Alright, here's why it works that way:</p>
<p>What's the tan doing there? Well, remember SOH CAH TOA: <strong>T</strong>an of an angle is <strong>O</strong>pposite side/<strong>A</strong>djacent side for any <strong>right</strong> triangle. Your arms would form a triangle with the object if they were long enough (this is the isosceles triangle the other commenter mentioned). You can split that triangle down the middle to make two identical <strong>right</strong> triangles; pick one. The opposite side is half the real size, the adjacent side is the distance, and the angle is half the angular size. So you have everything you need. Rearranging the TOA equation gives you the formula above. You can rearrange it in different ways to give you the distance if you know the real size, or the angular size if you know both distance and real size.</p></div>		</li>
