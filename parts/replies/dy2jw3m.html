			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this is a wonderful comment! I do wonder how much is us projecting our own, somewhat societal/cultural fears onto the question. There are very few spiders that actually kill humans, and much of it is culturally taught to fear spiders, when many are actually beneficial. </p>
<p>That said, I'm still not a fan of 99% of spiders, and will try my best to either put them outside, or run away from them because I'm a coward. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://www.aapcc.org/annual-reports/" target="_blank">US Poison Control yearly report</a> and looking at the spider and snake bite deaths over the past ten years. I think it really paints a clearer picture of the risks. </p></div>		</li>
