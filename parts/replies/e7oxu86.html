			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I understand correctly, the bonds simply want to stay connected whenever possible? That pretty much sums up my prior understanding of surface tension.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that the slanted surface makes any difference at all. In my mind, the molecules should break anyway due to the force of the impact. But I didn’t take into account the fact that the bounce would be virtually the same for any object of that size (molecules), so it makes sense that they’d stay grouped together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can reduce or increase the speed of the droplet, by lowering or raising the faucet (so gravity accelerates the droplets less, or more, prior to impact), and you'll see thresholds where the impact energy is not sufficient to overcome the surface tension even for the level surface, and also where the impact energy breaks apart (and spreads out) the droplet even for the slanted surface.</p>
<p>You can also eliminate surface tension and see just the effect of impact forces by using something that has no surface tension:  a teaspoon of dry sand, poured on a level surface vs. a slanted surface.  The way the sand grains spread on impact is similar to what the water molecules try to do on impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you fell out of a 4th floor window, would you rather land on flat ground or a 45 degree slope? Your impact is dampened when the collision object's angle is not perpendicular to your velocity. </p>
<p>Also, the droplet's surface impacts gradually, so the impact is distributed over time rather than all at once.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's sort of in-between chemistry and physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So pressure changes on surface tension is physics and the hand holding, hydrogen bonds, is chemistry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s physics since we deal with forces and momentum (and how these are affected by angles), chemistry since it’s compound particles and bonds (dipole-dipole and hydrogen).</p></div>		</li>
