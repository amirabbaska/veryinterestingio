			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just diagnosed at 27 years old, and starting stimulants changed my life. I’ve read more in the past two months than I have my entire life and I love it. I don’t interrupt people while they are talking, if I think of something stupid I don’t just say it. It’s wonderful! </p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Thanks for the reddit gold everyone. If you have three hours and want to learn about ADHD you need to go on YouTube and watch a lecture by dr. Russell Barkley called 30 essential ideas for parents! That was the video I watched and decided I had to talk to my doctor. I realized I had actually Learned most of the helping behaviours myself, but I was still impaired. This man changed my life and I hope I get to thank him in person one day! </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the one thing I am still finding it hard to get rid of, I am more aware of it, but I can control it if I focus on not doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask your doctor about clonidine if this is seriously impacting your job and personal relationships. It comes in a patch, which I've found to be very smooth. That said onboarding is a bitch, and you might not handle heat and exercise as well as you are used to. Also it will lower your blood pressure, which is great for folks taking stimulants.</p>
<p>I don't take it anymore as I finally found a combination of stimulants that works really well for me. I got the flat affect and dead dick from Ritalin and Adderall, so now I take a combo of Dexedrine and Desoxyn, with a little Cialis to keep the BP in check. </p>
<p>Don't settle for drugs that don't actually help you, or have too many negative side effects to be worth it.  (Don't go straight for the most misunderstood and highest abuse potential orphan drugs either. I tried a lot of other meds before I found something that really put me in the driver's seat)</p>
<p>Different meds for different heads.</p></div>		</li>

There really isn't a magic solution, chemical-wise, for some of these problems. I've come to accept these as personality traits, rather than something that needs to be &quot;fixed&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I forget to take my pill, I can barely function. I forget everything and get nothing done because I can not remember what someone told me or what I was doing. I take it and I can function normally. My issue is the focus boost that does come with it, your fucked if you focus on the wrong things. I also used to get several anxiety attacks when my dosage was much higher. I would prefer to just be normal and not need it. I feel myself getting annoying because I become curious and want to learn as much as possible as I start to become so in tune with what I am working on. I don’t know if you have experienced this or I am just a wierdo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know exactly what you mean. Sometimes I will go to my boss with a question that’s reasonable and she will give me an answer. Then I get so curious and start asking more and more questions about the topic like “what if this?” and “why this?” I can see her eyes kind of say like that’s not important, let’s move on. </p>
<p>I also can get really hung up on a task almost like I want to keep dragging t out and don’t want it to end. If I have to write an important email, I swear I can keep editing and formatting and describing for like EVER. My recent mantra that has been helping is just to tell myself, “finish it!” If I feel myself getting stuck or obsessing over something, I tell myself firmly to just finish whatever I’m doing - to do the next step needed in order to get it done. That can be hard but it’s also been pretty reliable in getting my out of the rabbit hole.</p></div>		</li>

I totally feel you on how if you end up focusing on the wrong thing, the things I need to get done are as good as gone from my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diagnosed at 33. The drugs are awesome and do exactly what they should, however, I don' take them because while my ADHD is a mild hindrance to my life I enjoy my brain as-is.</p>
<p>It sucks for when I need to study or when someone is telling me something important, but the other 99% of the time it's like a fucking constant stimulus-seeking fest and it makes me funny and personable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diagnosed around the same age. I was furious for awhile because I struggled with math and science despite loving it. I was always told &quot;girls aren't good at math, it's okay.&quot;   </p>
<p>No. NO. Goddammit, entire career paths were denied me because of this.   </p>
<p>Anyway, we tried forms of Ritalin but they never quite worked. Adderall though...fucking magic. The fog lifts. The anxiety is significantly reduced. Hysterical panicked breakdowns are no longer a thing.  </p>
<p>Adderall is also how I learned ADHD can set off anxiety and panic attacks. My brain stopped trying to process everything, including what if's, all at once. Treating ADHD does so much more than make it possible to get through school and work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the issue of people overusing pharmaceutical grade stimulants in order to prevent sleep, and to work longer hours. While these kinds of stimulants can certainly improve focus, patience, and cognitive function, the potential for abuse is far too high.</p>
<p>Your answer is great, I just felt like adding this little bit. Pharmaceutical stimulants are intensely abused at the collegiate and professional levels. You can't swing a stick without hitting a user or seller on a college campus or high level business office.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also worth noting that I (as someone who takes proscribed Adderall for ADHD) take only 1/3rd of the average street dose. </p>
<p>EDIT: I take 10mg once a day (I used to take more but lowered it due to side effects)
For those using it as a performance aid 30mg is pretty normal and 50+ isn’t all that uncommon.</p>
<p>I’ve taken 40 by accident before and it sucks (though tolerance is different for everyone) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take 10 mg of Ritalin twice a day (no idea if the dosage is equivalent to Adderrall, as I have never been prescribed it) as a supplement to my antidepressant (40 mg Vybriid, once per day). </p>
<p>I do not have ADHD (as far as I know), but I <em>have</em> been clinically diagnosed with chronic severe depression (since I was 21, retroactively since I was a teenager based on provided evidence). </p>
<p>Stimulants can absolutely help counteract the side-effects of antidepressants (which often include lethargy) as well as active effects of depression (lack of motivation, fatigue, etc). I have found it improves my day to day life drastically.</p>
<p>But even under the supervision of a medical professional, I often experience insomnia and sometimes it can make my anxiety flare up. I assume it has similar, if not more pronounced effects on people who take it recreationally or without a prescription who are not suffering from chronic fatigue at the same time. </p>
<p>On the rare occasion I have been without it (I encountered a circumstance when someone stole some from me, and the pharmacy refused to refill it early due to its classification as a controlled substance), I have experienced severe withdrawal, to the point that I could barely keep my eyes open at work. I can only imagine these symptoms are more pronounced in people who don't actually need it, but take it anyway. </p>
<p>That being said, I have accidentally overtaken it before by mistake, and it has not led to any significant adverse reactions, but I have not done this intentionally, nevermind long-term, so I don't know if that affects it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD can seriously fuck up your energy efficiency, in my experience. During the day I'd be so tired and at night I couldn't sleep well. Taking medication made it so that I was actually awake in the daytime and fell asleep easily at night. Amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started on Adderall in my late 20's.  Besides the fact that I was totally textbook Girl-ADD, at that point in time, I was sleeping a good 14 hours a day if I wasn't working.  On weekends, I would sleep for 10 hours, wake up, eat breakfast, take a 2 hour nap, eat lunch, maybe run an errand or two, then take another nap, dinner, then bed.</p>
<p>My psych explained it as a combo of not enough stimulation to keep me awake and me being exhausted from all the work it takes to function normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the best parts of my vyvanse prescription is the treatment of chronic fatigue. I used to sleep at least 9 hours on weeknights and still want to sleep in on the weekends. To the tune of 12-14 hours. And I was still exhausted all the time. Vyvanse let's me have a normal life with 7-8 hours of sleep every day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the not eating: try to get in a big breakfast either before or right after taking the medication. Protein is specifically important, and if you limit your intake of other stimulants (coffee and cigarettes, mostly; chocolate and soda should be fine), your main effects might be slightly diminished, but the side effects will be greatly diminished. </p>
