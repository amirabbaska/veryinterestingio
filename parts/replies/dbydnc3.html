			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband has daily chronic chest pain. He's been to the urgent care, had plenty to tests to check his heart, X-rays, EKGs, endoscopy as well to check for ulcers, but everything always comes back fine. He gets massages twice a month because he says it feels better but usually by the next day it's bothering him again. We aren't sure if it's his muscles or if it's Costochondritis but it's been over 5 years with no answer and no relief.  Don't know obviously what kind of medical experience you might have but could you shed some knowledge on anything we could check out that we may have missed?? Could he have some sort of nerve damage?? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have exactly the same story. My work is physical so I suspect it is some nerve damage from lifting and holding loads with the left arm for years. Stretches help me a lot, the one where you reach back to grab a doorframe or something and turn across to stretch the pectoral. Also holding the top of the doorframe and bending down to stretch lats and muscles around the ribcage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A physical therapist should be able to diagnose it if it's musculoskeletal. They can help him with things like costochondritis. Also may be a result of bad posture over time, maybe pec tightness. </p>
<p>Go to a good ortho PT.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a former career I was a physician's assistant and today I review and audit medical records. (NOT INTENDED TO BE MEDICAL ADVICE). Chronic chest pain needs to be better defined. Is it superficial (i.e., costalchondritis), or within the chest i.e., pleurisy)? Massage probably wouldn't help either very much. A condition such as a torn intercostal muscle muscle can probably be ruled out, as this is usually acute and relatively short lasting.</p>
<p>It could be a localized muscular inflammation. This can be caused by a number of things such as immune reaction, infection, calcium deposits, etc. They can become chronic due to continuous movement or mechanical stresses. This might very well respond temporarily to massage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any recommendation on what he could do to find out what may be the primary cause? Like an MRI? Or some sort of test to lead us in the right direction to getting him some help? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is heat <em>just as</em> effective as massage though?</p>
<p>Thinking of dropping $80 for a massage, but after reading your comment I'm thinking of just scrubbing the tub clean and taking a hot bath haha</p></div>		</li>
