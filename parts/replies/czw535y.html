<p>There are also matter waves. These are really strange if you're used to classical physics because particles (even large particles like whole atoms and even molecules) can act like a wave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago I've seen a startup developing a camera that records sounds not by sound itself, but by motion of nearby objects.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine there is music playing in an other room and you can not hear it. Now there is a a plant standing in that room and the soundwaves hit the leaves of the plant. The camera would record that motion of the leaves and would generate the original sound from the recordings. </p>
<p>I can't remember the name of the project, but is it the waves we are talking about? The waves that sound generates?</p>
