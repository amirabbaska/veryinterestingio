<p>Free trade is a lot like global warming. The economic science is in and ninety-nine percent of economists agree that free trade is good for countries and beneficial to their citizens, but its a value that is hard to see while the immediate cost in jobs is apparent to everyone. </p>

<p>That's a good analogy.</p>
<p>Here's a good recent, real-world example on how a tariff meant to protect US jobs from competition can have adverse effects on consumers.  In order to save jobs in the US tire industry, the government jacked up a tariff to protect them from competition.  The results for US consumers were disastrous:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their study found that after Obama imposed the tariffs, employment in the U.S. tire industry grew by 1,200 jobs. Hufbauer and Lowry figure that this is the maximum number of jobs the tariffs could have created or saved, a generous assumption given that tire employment was already trending upward[.]</p>
<p>How much did those 1,200 jobs cost? About $1.1 billion, Hufbauer and Lowry found, all borne by consumers who were forced to pay higher American prices for tires, prices which shot up still higher when freed from competition with China:</p>
<p>That's about $900,000 per job, and likely more given how generous the 1,200 jobs saved figure is. </p>

<p>Seriously, it got so bad that people were actually <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/08/business/la-fi-rent-a-tire-20130609" target="_blank">renting tires because they couldn't afford to buy them!</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>But the best estimate is that the resulting growth and price saving generates roughly 100 dollars per US worker per year indefinitely.</p>

<p>Generates $100 for whom?</p></div>		</li>
