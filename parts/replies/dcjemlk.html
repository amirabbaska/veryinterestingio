<p>What is the primary purpose for synthetic cells? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purpose is to have a cell that resembles a natural cell but is simpler, more controllable, easier to study and tweak.
Synthetic cells are used for biomanufacturing, drug developement, studying biological processes, and figuring out how gene pathways come together, as well as biosensors and actuators between natural cells and environment or electronic receivers. </p>
<p>Some good examples of recent reviews on the applications of this technology: www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593114001355 and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856425/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856425/</a></p>

<p>And how do they differ from biological cells?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The synthetic minimal cells build by bottom-up approaches are not alive, so they don't spontaneously replicate (although people working on that bit - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04136" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04136</a>). They're much smaller and much, much simpler than natural cells.</p>
<p>Minimal cells build by stripping down genome of living cell (top-down approach), very successfully done by Craig Venter's group, results in a cell that is still smaller and simpler, but does replicate and is alive. </p>
<p>Both bottom-up and top-down approaches result in a bioreactor that is a model for complex, evolved life processes, and a kind of biological factory that we can re-program and study.</p></div>		</li>
