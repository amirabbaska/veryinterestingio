			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body has evolved to operate in a defined temperature range - all of your proteins and DNA and hormones and receptors and everything that makes you 'alive' instead of 'meat' operate best (or at all) around 'body temperature' or roughly 98F.</p>
<p>If you move away from that temperature in either direction these proteins and receptors change shape and no longer work as well. If you move far enough they stop working - at which point you become 'meat' rather than 'alive'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in this case, that means neurons don't fire at a very low/high temperature, and anywhere between &quot;lethal&quot; and &quot;normal body temperature&quot; the whole process just slows down? That makes sense!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons decrease conduction velocity at lower temperatures so signals do not reach the extremities as well. Muscles are also much stiffer and harder to move when theyâ€™re cold so those things mixed together cause that. Blood flow also decreases and contributes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't most of the muscles responsible for this movement further back on the forearm and connected by ligaments (or tendons, I always get them mixed up)?  For me at least, it seems that even if these muscles are warm and just my fingers are cold that I have thw same problem of loss of dexterity.  Obviously I'm wrong somewhere in my understanding, heh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those muscles control your fingers in response to nerve feedback from the fingers and as noted nerves don't works as well, ditto for tendons, with decreased blood flow the fingers don't move as easily as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscles in your forearm are responsible for moving your whole hand about your wrist, and the strong &quot;primary&quot; movements of your fingers, such as pulling the whole finger backward or forwards, but there are plenty of muscles in your hand too (and even in your fingers!), which are responsible for the fine motor control.</p>
<p>This is why when your hands are cold it's still relatively easy to hold onto things, but difficult to write a text message.</p></div>		</li>
