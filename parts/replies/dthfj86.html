			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. The movie “There Will Be Blood” is based off the book “Oil!”, which is based on the Teapot Dome scandal of the 1920’s where the US secretary of the interior was bribed to offer land to oil companies without competitive bidding. The bribery charges netted the secretary of the interior jail time, was the first time a cabinet level person was jailed, and was considered the most sensational political scandal until Watergate happened.</p></div>		</li>
