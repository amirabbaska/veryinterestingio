<p>It turns out you can find fibonaci sequence in lots of natural occurences - it is not because it is special, efficient or inherent to nature.</p>
<p>It is because there are huge amount of things you can cherry pick stuff from to fit into sequence. And then you can muddle up some numbers to fit stuff that is not really fitting.</p>
<p>Nature can resemble a lot of mathematical stuff - and that math stuff can even be used to suffciently model it, but it does not make that model special rule of nature that governs it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the truth.  The Fibonacci sequence doesn't occur in nature any more than any other sequence.  But because it's famous people can spot it and point it out easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put another way. It isn't that the sequence evolved in because of an efficiency advantage that nature realized. Mutation randomly evolved in an advantage that kept that particular species alive. Nature is dumb-luck trial and error. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fibonacci patterns do really appear with some reason in plant phyllotaxis. Here is a paper which demonstrates that analysis of a biochemical model of phyllotaxis produces the same results as a model based on Fibonacci selection: <a href="http://math.arizona.edu/~anewell/publications/197newell.pdf" target="_blank">http://math.arizona.edu/~anewell/publications/197newell.pdf</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta right but most things that &quot;fit&quot; the ratio or sequence do so inaccurately, it is sometimes pretty close but very rarely exact, naturally occurring perfect ratios are just a myth. Also people tend to present the examples as much more common than they really are. </p></div>		</li>
