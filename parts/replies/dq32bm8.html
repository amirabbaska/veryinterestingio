<p>a shell with the radius of the event horizon containing all the mass of the black hole would have exactly the same gravity field as a point at the centre.</p>

<p>Only if the shell is symmetrical, otherwise you'll have gravitational harmonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it does not. The black hole horizon can &quot;wobble&quot; around, although any excitation will quickly dissipate (exponential decay). If you followed the recent gravitational wave observations of black holes, you might have noticed this &quot;ring-down&quot; at the end of the signal. That's basically the spacetime still wobbling around.
It will be quickly indistinguishable from a regular Schwarzschild  (or Kerr) spacetime. That's what the &quot;No hair theorem&quot; is about: black holes have no additional properties besides mass, spin and charge.</p>
<p>But wouldn't be a exponential ring-down still be technically a distinguishing feature? Given precise enough measurements, couldn't we still get information about the hole's past? Yes, but so can we by just looking at the black hole. You can still see everything that's falling in, only redshifted very strongly. So that's way easier then measuring the miniscule gravitational waves.</p>
<p>The no hair theorem is really about the asymptotic state of the hole, or holes that existed forever. Like in OPs question mentioned, you will never see the collapse of mass to a black hole, only infalling mass redshifted  (also exponentially) with time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.</p>
<p>I saw a video on the Royal Institute youtube channel that pointed out that, owing to the fact that the singularity involves <em>time</em> as well as <em>space</em> (remember that the distortion caused by the gravity is 4D!) the progression of our unfortunate hypothetical astronaut toward the singularity is as inevitable as his progression forward in time. Again, this is within the event horizon, in fact, this is pretty much the definition of the event horizon. Outside of the event horizon, there is a (theoretical) possibility of a future that is <em>not</em> at the singularity (providing you're a photon heading in the right direction!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only information that can't escape the black hole is the arrangement of matter within the event horizon. However, the information about infalling mass has already been communicated to the outside universe before it reaches the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>
