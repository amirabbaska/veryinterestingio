			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. The molecules have a &quot;lollipop&quot; structure with a hydrophilic (water soluble) head and a hydrophobic (water insoluble) tail. When the substance is mixed with water and disturbed by a force such as vigorous scrubbing, the molecules form minature spheres called micelles where the heads face out, covering the surface and the tails hide inside. The grime is more attracted to these tails, and can become trapped inside the micelle and easily rinsed away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I always assumed the bubbles were a sign of reaction, and not just a random useless byproduct of soap film and friction. Even hoped it was a light catalyst (as if air/soap interface improved something)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well air is generally non polar so you can consider bubbles to be micelles of air lined with soap.</p></div>		</li>
