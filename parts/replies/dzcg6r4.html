			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I was on one of these teams for my media production class in high school. Obviously not as complex or skilled as op’s topic, but while three of us manned the cameras in the theatre someone was in the back watching the feeds and swapping between them for recording while directing us where to go to next when our feed wasn’t being used. I’m sure a lot of the cameras now are controlled remotely from the same room so communication and direction is probably easier.</p></div>		</li>
