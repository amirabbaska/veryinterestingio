			<div class="markdown"><p>Supervisors and management are one of two reasons the post office is losing money.  There are too many people standing around (usually people who are too lazy or failed at delivering mail) telling the carriers how to do their job when there are not enough of them to get the job done.  They end up paying the carriers overtime and paying 3 supervisors what it takes 1 person to do.</p>
<p>The other reason is the stupid mandate congress put on the post office to prefund its long-term pension and healthcare liabilities, which I suspect was done to create a big pile of money for when they finally kill the post office and divide its assets up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And out here they actually succeed. :/</p>
<p>They intentionally hire people who aren't part of the union and if they start talking about it they suspiciously end up &quot;promoted&quot; to a part time position. </p></div>		</li>
