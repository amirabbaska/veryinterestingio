			<div class="markdown"><p>What really hurt was the drastic drop in metal prices. Metal recycling was pushing the landfill mining industry. As long as the material was already being reprocessed, the cost for recycling plastics was partially absorbed. Now that metals aren't worth going after, neither are the plastics for petroleum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glass recycling is also not feasible these days either. Big cities that currently collect glass are considering stopping as the recycling process especially when you have to deal with labels and adhesives etc are making it not as cost effective to make new bottles out of old ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mind is boggled because the other day I got to thinking, What are the biggest problems in the world today worth solving? And I thought of all the trash in the world's landfills, started thinking of mining them for metals and plastics, maybe breaking down the organic matter using some kind of bacteria? Anyway, that was the other day, I tarted writing about it, then I get on reddit and there's this whole thread going on. What a time to be alive.</p></div>		</li>
