			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this is ELI5, it should be pointed out what &quot;margin lending&quot; is. Basically, it's when people borrow money to invest, expecting a return that would allow them pay back that borrowed money and make an additional profit as the investment increases in value. When margin lending goes badly, you're screwed in two ways. You lose money on the investment that lost value, and you still have to pay back the money you borrowed to make the investment in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So many people are commenting on what a terrible idea this is, but it's all part of doing business, really. Businesses borrow to make investments to increase their value, people borrow to buy homes hoping the value increases or that their earning potential long term will be enough to pay back the loan. Stocks, etc are not some random roll of the dice. Yes, there are risks that need to be managed, but by and large most of these investments (especially things like well-managed mutual funds, etc) will trend upward over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically those types of instruments are leveraged which means you only borrow part of the money but you take all the risk. If the value of the investment falls to the point where it's worth less than what you borrowed it is liquidated, which means you lose everything but the lender takes minimal loss. This is why people can lose everything when a stock falls just a few percent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, if you don't have to borrow money and can cover the risk then it's not a problem.
Just playing Devils advocate here, people never borrow money to gamble! Your life will only become a Hollywood best seller whilst you go down the plughole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Margin lending was also huge factor in the subprime mortgage crisis. Bear Stearns (as one example among many possible examples) invested $2 billion from investors into suprime mortgages and lost it all. It would not have been the absolute disaster it was if Bear Stearns hadn't used that $2B as collateral to borrow $20B and lost all of THAT money. Not even Bear Stearns can take a $20 billion dollar hit overnight without requiring a bailout. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait I recall reading that unlike the U.S. where stocks are largely held by large institutional money flows, the Chinese market is a much higher percentage of retail investors. Also unlike the U.S. where most retail investors don't utilize leverage, the retail Chinese investor has borrowed on margin to increase their investment size. Now we have a situation where the individual retail investor is going to get stung very very hard by falling stocks, especially since investing in stocks is a brand new concept for small investors since they have never had the opportunity before. The Chinese government is extremely worried that this evaporation of wealth in their people may result in a not-so-pleasant outcome where the Chinese people hold their politicians accountable.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>&quot;It's going to impact the countries that export to China, somewhat.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Correct.
I monitor the value of the New Zealand dollar a fair amount, and it's value has been decreasing. One of the reasons for this has been an over-supply of dairy products that it normally exports to China, which is buying less as its economy slows (I imagine these are industrial levels of buying - powder, maybe?).</p>
<p>New Zealand exports about a quarter of the world's dairy products and dairy accounts for a quarter of NZ's total exports. Its main market for this is China.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
China economy bad = NZ economy bad because NZ relies on milk exports to China.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, my point is more that the vast majority of the Chinese <em>people</em> don't invest. It's not like the US, where the average household will take a hit when the market tanks...Investing is new enough over there, most people still don't do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, also why it is more prone to over and under correction.  Once it does bottom out, it is probably going to be the place to invest, as long as it doesn't have a generational effect like 2000 did on a lot of investors in NA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What /u/workpuppy means imo is that, yes unlike in thbe US where the average citizen holds shares, in China its just a few who do.</p>
<p>Those who do do it, are pretty heavily invested in, also China has a massive population The people that do invest are still a drop in the ocean (figuratively and even then exaggerated by a large mile) compared to the entire Chinese population. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The papers are always really irritating in these situations. If you had a million in stock yesterday, and it's worth 900,000 today, how much have you lost?</p>
<p>Nothing. Not a penny. You have exactly the same amount of stock you had before. It's a paper loss. It's only real when you sell.</p>
<p>But the financial press goes apeshit, and starts scaring the fuck out of everyone, and you get situations like in '08 where people were cashing out 401ks that had lost 60% of their value, thereby incurring another 20% loss from taxes...If those same people had held on another 12 months, they'd have been back close to break-even, and if they'd held on 36 months, they'd have made a yearly average of about 6%.</p>
<p>So, you know, deep breaths. Some people are going to lose their asses, but it probably won't be lasting or systemic. Most of the rest of the indicators are still good, and we were due a correction of some kind (they tend to happen every couple of years, and we were overdue due to the long bull run).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a leveraged investor it is a real loss.  If you borrowed money to invest (called margin investing) you are required to put up money called collateral.  If the value of the shares you bought drops below a certain point, you have to put up more collateral (a margin call).</p>
<p>Anyone forced to do a margin call has to come up with real money now to cover their losses.  This is usually accomplished by selling existing assets (on a day like today those are also probably at a loss).</p></div>		</li>
