			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's because of different growth rates and tension of skin layers, shouldn't that mean you would have prints all over your body? Or is it because the skin on the inside of your hands grows faster or something because it needs replacing more? This is pretty interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a difference in the densities and qualities of skin throughout the body. The approach I take to study this stuff is to use something called Optical Coherence Tomography which looks into the skin by firing a laser and measuring the reflectivity under the skin. If for instance, you look at the skin layer structure on the arm (somewhere without a print) you'll find that the density characteristics of the separate layers are less distinct, whereas on the fingerprint they're very different. </p>
<p>Like I said, this is just a leading theory - I myself am not fully convinced how fingerprints are actually formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how deep is the papillary junction? I sliced off about a mm of my thumb a few months ago, and it's still healing. The skin around the edges has healed and the fingerprints have come back, but the epicenter of the injury still just looks puckered up and I'm curious is it will ever go back to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you also have to factor in scarring, so I can't really answer that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found it varies. It should be +- 0.3mm into the skin, but I've seen anything from half to triple that in the data I've played with. </p>
<p>That said, I actually developed Eczema on my thumbs (ironically GREAT data for me as a researcher!) and was able to analyse before, during, and after (well, after it healed up a bit). There was almost no Epidermis layer - the papillary junction was right by the surface. </p>
<p>I've actually recently presented a paper with these results, if you'd ever like to see it :)</p>
<p>Edit: BASICALLY, if you bleed then there is a good chance the changes are more permanent. This is because the blood vessels are under the papillary junction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cut my thumb with a very thin &amp; sharp blade once 6 years ago. Now the fingerprint is a little mismatched. I guess it will always be this way now. Your explanation helps me understand what happened.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a lot of blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We tend to think of cases like yours as a poorer quality fingerprint. However, you've actually inadvertently introduced more entropy into the fingerprint ridge patterns on your fingerprint and, from a data perspective, you're more unique!</p>
<p>Also, you'll be easier to match to should you commit a crime... so, don't do that... </p></div>		</li>
