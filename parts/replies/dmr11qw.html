			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Black holes are guaranteed by Einsteins field equation. Now many well known physicists back in the day (famous ones, like Einstein, Wheeler and Oppenheimer) rejected that solution as impossible, by saying the universe must have certain ways of preventing singularities from forming. It is like you said, ugly (true, but also read about cosmic censorship principle).</p>
<p>Turns out, blackholes can and do form, the fate of super massive stars that can't be saved in any other way (degeneracy pressures etc). We have modelled this out, from perfectly spherical non spinning stars to highly irregular spinning stars and a black hole is unequivocal in certain configurations. Even Wheeler, who was a denier, switched  to being a black hole advocate. Other than the fact that black holes do form, gravitational waves are also a consequence of the field equation. We knew this mathematically, and now with LIGO, better telescopes and better ways to study the cosmos - we have proof that black holes exist and behave as we have studied for the last half of the century. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens to matter inside a black hole? We have no way of knowing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that the field equation is only an approximation to a certain true law of gravity (perhaps quantum), we'll know what happens in that extreme condition once we have advanced enough to understand and publish those laws.</p>
<p>For now, I think that most physicists agree with 100% conviction that blackholes do form, and exist in our universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other theories about what the &quot;black holes&quot; may be, and most of them are not about any kind of &quot;holes&quot; at all.</p>
<p>Quark stars, Planck stars and other.</p>
<p>All behaving and having effects on their surroundings as we perceive them and think &quot;black holes&quot; do.</p></div>		</li>
