<p>When your head is underwater, your inner ear typically maintain the little amount of air within them, as getting water to your middle ear can cause issues. Anyone who had tubes in their ears already know this.
So in order for you to hear anything underwater, sound has to transfer to air first. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a small thing, but this isn't quite true.<br />
Yes, your middle ear will ideally remain aerated when you're underwater, but the sound doesn't ever actually need to be transmitted to that air.<br />
The sound waves reach your tympanic membrane (ear drum), which subsequently vibrates. This vibration is transmitted directly to your <em>malleus</em> bone, which is attached to the membrane. The vibration is transmitted down the ossicle chain to your <em>incus</em> and <em>stapedius</em> bones. The stapedius is attached to another membrane on your inner ear, called the oval window. That in turn vibrates the fluid in your inner ear.</p>
<p>Air is not involved in the sequence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're underwater, no. The <em>external</em> ear canal would just have water in it (unless a bubble of air got stuck in there, in which case your hearing would be even worse).<br />
The middle ear should have air in it at all times. The muscles, tendons and other structures expect there to be air, and are tuned to work best when surrounded by air. If the vibration of the ossicles is retarded due to being in a more dense medium, such as water, your hearing will sound muddy (which is what happens if you have a middle ear infection).<br />
The inner ear, which is the part that converts mechanical energy of sound waves into electrical/chemical energy that your brain can interpret is entirely sealed and is filled with a fluid called <em>endolymph</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's who I was waiting to hear from. I've had several sonar techs for my Lyft fares and they break down how they can hear a ship with a messed up rudder from a few hundred miles away.. </p>
<p>It makes you think when we test weapons in the water the hell we put marine life through with that kinda noise and power..</p></div>		</li>

<p>Was gonna say, &quot;a little background&quot;.</p>
