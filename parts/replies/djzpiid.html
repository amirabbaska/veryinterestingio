			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the charge is moving and the field is always centered around it.</p>
<p>Say the charge starts in the xyz plane at r = 0 meters. You have a standard radial field centered around r = 0 (E = kq/r^2).</p>
<p>Now the charge starts moving at some constant velocity (ignore the brief acceleration it takes to get to that velocity for now). The charge is now in a new position, so the E-field is no longer centered around r = 0 but r = (velocity) x (time). </p>
<p>The E-field in the charge's frame of reference is the same of course (because the charge doesn't &quot;know&quot; that its moving), but some other &quot;test charge&quot; somewhere else will notice a change in the field. Eventually, as the original charge moves to infinity, the test charge will see the E-field at its position drop to zero.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? I tried to keep it as simple as possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a bit confusing.  Doesn't the moving electron create its own magnetic field by the Biot-Savart law, in addition to the magnetic field created by Faraday's Law.  If there was a uniform line density of charges all moving in the same direction, they would constitute a current that produces a magnetic field, even if there is no changing electric field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there is. Each unit of charge in the line would, by simply existing, create an electric field. Because they're moving, this field has some time dependence.  And it's a consequence of Maxwell's equations that a time dependent electric field necessitates a position dependent magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But Maxwell's Equations work even without particles of charge.  Two opposite and overlapping linear charge densities can form a current without an electric field.  Heck, even a single unbalanced linear charge density can form a current without a changing electric field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The E-fields of the singular charges are constantly changing, but since they are all &quot;changing together&quot; you get a static B-field. Integrating the B-field of single charges over some length will show this too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but I believe that Biot-Savart is only valid in magnetostatic situations. Maxwell's Equations on the other hand are always correct. (<strong>EDIT</strong>: You can of course use Biot-Savart for a single charge at constant velocity, though. Physically, the same thing is going on: a changing E-field is producing a B-field).</p>
<p>Biot-Savart is actually obtained from Maxwell-Ampere anyway:</p>

<p>The magnetic field from the uniform line density are still &quot;fundamentally&quot; the result of all of the changing E-fields of the charges in the current adding up. The total B-field and E-field are static, but the current is still just a bunch of charges moving, each with their own changing E-field. If you look up a diagram of the B-field for a single charge and then line a bunch of them up together, this should become evident. All you need to do is integrate and you get the B-field for a uniform current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that the changing electric field definitely stirs up a bunch of magnetic field, and I missed that.  But there are two sources of the curl of the magnetic field in the Maxwell-Ampere law: the [; \mu_0 \vec{J} ;] term and the [; \partial \vec{E} / \partial t ;] term.  The moving electron should have both terms present in the solution.  The Biot-Savart Law is the solution for just one of them.  The two terms are not equivalent.  Both are necessary.</p>
<p>Solving for the B caused by the dE/dt term seems difficult in this case.  My first inclination is a Green's Function-type method, which would produce something like the Biot-Savart Law, but with the time derivative of the electric field inside instead of J.  Then this can be integrated because E is known.  Sounds like something to give graduate students.  It might be easier to assume a solution (i.e. Biot-Savart) and check it, including the effect of dE/dt.</p>
<p>For a line of moving electrons (especially when screened by stationary protons in a model of a wire), the electric fields are basically uniform.  The magnetic field is entirely generated by the current density, not by changing electric fields.</p></div>		</li>
