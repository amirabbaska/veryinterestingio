			<div class="markdown"><p>It was intense. With regards to these 5 helicopters, the MV-22's are so fucking big that they were shaking the building. In comparison, there are plenty of helicopters that land there all day and I don't hear or feel themâ€“ but the Osprey, felt like I was in a earthquake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as a NYC native, they did a really, really good job of - within the confines of the scale they were working with - making each borough feel almost exactly like their real life counterpart. Heck, even things that were changed (for instance, South Ferry, since Staten Island doesn't exist in GTAIV) still retain the same feel of whatever is supposed to be there. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You never see just one Marine One. You always see two. You see them fly over the head a few times a week if you live here, usually around 1000 meters apart, but you can't tell which the president is in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically there can only be one Marine One / Air Force One, and that is the one the President aboard at the time. </p>
<p>But of course there are multiple planes and helicopters that can serve that purpose. </p>
