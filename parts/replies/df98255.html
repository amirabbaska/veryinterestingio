			<div class="markdown"><p>You are lucky. The competition is stiff.  Many, many people are willing to do the job for free. Meanwhile more MLS students want to be children's librarians than any other disciple. With all this, children's library roles are quickly being converted to part-time or retiree/parent volunteer positions. </p>
<p>Personally, I find public library positions to be their own piece of hell. Especially shelving dirty, smelly kids books that rarely provide enrichment. Very little care is spent on growing and culling a public collection, which is one of the more fun aspects of university librarianship. Let's not forget forget bum's jerking it in public computer workstations... a key role in any contemporary public branch library. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh believe me, I fully realize how lucky I am to have gotten this job.  I am very grateful for it.  I love it and sometimes when I see those who have gotten their MLIS struggling to find jobs, I feel a twinge of guilt.</p>
<p>I rarely shelve-- that's what the pages are for.  I also work in a well-off suburban town with very few bums (though we do have a few) and who greatly value their library and the kids' programs and who have the money to continue supporting my role at least for the next few decades, so I feel as least as secure in my job as I'd feel in any other job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for saying this. Yes, I agree: degree inflation and tradition. I work in a large academic library where about a quarter the people who &quot;just check books in and out&quot; have MLS degrees plus other masters degrees but cannot find a full time librarian position in our city. Libraries should absolutely invest in internship-based learning and growing the staff who already work for them, but this rarely happens. I think it's kind of ironic that the librarians who post here are mostly looking down on the people who support their work in access services while also claiming to want to share their knowledge. Just sayin'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so interesting and helpful to me. I have my Masters in Elementary Education and taught for a few years. I'm now working at an educational non-profit doing curriculum design, but over the last year or so I've realized that being a librarian is kind of a dream job for me. After doing some research on Library Science program, I came to the conclusion that it probably wasn't something I'd be able to pursue because I don't quite have the money to put towards more school right now. Your story definitely made me think this might not be as unrealistic as I thought it would and I may start applying for a few positions just to see what happens...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely!  As I said, some libraries are more strict with the requirement than others, but it's definitely possible.  The library a few towns over also recently hired a new children's librarian with teaching experience but no MLIS.</p></div>		</li>
