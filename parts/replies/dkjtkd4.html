			<div class="markdown"><p>LiDAR hasn't really been used a lot for measuring rates of surface uplift though. It is increasingly used for change detection, but this is usually a differencing of two scans, a pre- and post- survey related to some event (e.g. a ground rupturing earthquake, landslide, etc). To get time series of changes in surface deformation, InSAR and GPS is still largely preferred. I think the main issue is cost, airborne LiDAR surveys are expensive. Certainly launching a satellite for InSAR is also expensive, but there is a single large initial cost (launching the satellite) that is carried by large agencies (NASA, ESA, etc) and then a huge swath of people can access time series of data for years. In contrast, if there is a concerted effort by state or federal agencies to pay for LiDAR, it's usually a single survey to make an accurate DEM for a region, not successive flights to measure change. There is a lot of interest on satellite based LiDAR, so this may change in the future and we may get rich datasets of time series of LiDAR eventually.</p></div>		</li>
