<p>The last bit is him placing the bottom card firmly in his hand with the top 3 cards loose on top.</p>

<p>You are close enough with most of it. The only thing I would really say is you don't put one in firmly and the others loose. That's impossible, when they are all in the same grip between the same fingers. You just make sure the card you want is on bottom. The slap itself will pull the top cards off, and as long as they hold on somewhat firmly and you don't slap the daylights out of it you should still get the bottom card.</p></div>		</li>
