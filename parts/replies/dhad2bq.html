			<div class="markdown"><p>no you cannot reverse it.  The oxidised layer is brittle and separates off.  If you are talking about carbon-treating iron to make carbon steel then again the procedure is more complex as you want to get the carbon to fuse with the iron and this takes very high temperatures and means you have to melt your car down to a pool to fix the rust.
To fix deep rust in cars you cut the damaged area out and weld a matching fresh plate in its place</p></div>		</li>
