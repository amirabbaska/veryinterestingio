<p>(btw, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/income-rank/" target="_blank">here, have a graph</a>) (data is from 2013 but it shows what you were trying to explain). </p>
<p>$300k/year is not that much. It's not owning a mansion. It's not making trips around the world whenever you please. It's definitely not never needing to work. </p>
<p>It <em>is</em> being able to send three kids to whatever university they want without worrying about student loans, it <em>is</em> being able to live in a nice house and a second house and maybe you have enough to buy a house for your kid too without any mortgages, and it is &quot;A trip to Europe is well within our income, even though doing it twice a year wouldn't be.&quot; </p>
<p>I'm probably biased, but I think determining the 1% based on <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/measuring-the-top-1-by-wealth-not-income/?_r=0" target="_blank">net worth rather than income</a> gets closer to our idea of the 1% as the super rich. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think you are a bit out of touch with the working class here. 300k a year is a shit ton of money. i make 25k  a year, the equivalent of a month's pay at 300k/year. with 300k you can sure as hell afford a mansion and to go to europe twice a year. </p>
<p>I think both the 1% of income earners and the 1% of wealth holders both represent the super wealthy</p>
<p>Are you very well off? ( serios question, not being a dick)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're the one who is out of touch with how much mansions and fancy trips cost. I am well off - my family is apparently in the 2%. While I only earn $25k/year, both my parents and my SO's parents are close to the $300k/year bracket. $300k/year is a lot of money, a <em>lot</em> of money, but buying a mansion and regular international trips are <em>even more so a lot of money</em>. </p>
<p>It is absolutely not &quot;own a mansion, have a massive trust fund, etc.&quot; </p>
<p>It is absolutely &quot;no student debt for me or any of my siblings, go to Europe every other year, no mortgage on the nice house.&quot; </p>
<p>To be clear: My family <em>could</em> buy a mansion. We would go into massive debt to do so, leaving us just as vulnerable (if not more so) to financial disaster as someone making $25k/year. It is not possible to do these things <em>and</em> be financially responsible, but I suppose technically it is possible (and I guess some people do. They don't stay in the 1% for long). </p>
<p>(Going to Europe 2x/year is possible even on $25k/year, if you do the trips in a cheap way and don't spend a lot of money on other hobbies. I should probably clarify that I mean having the kind of money that lets you go where you want, when you want, staying a decent hotel, without massive bargain hunting, at least twice per year. My family can't afford to do that, we can afford to do it less often, or we could compromise on the quality of the trips, the 1% by net worth can afford to it frequently without any compromises whatsoever). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends where you live, I got a coworker who makes more than that (well the family does). His house was $750k, which is moderately large, it is NOT a mansion (average house around here is $350-400k). Post-tax you're talking $17k/mo, home taxes are $1500/mo, mortage is $4k/mo. Utilities is $1.2k/mo, two cars are $800/mo for the loan and $300/mo for the insurance, plus $200/mo for the fuel/stuff. Also, throw in two peoples IRAs/retirement at $2k/mo. That gets you to $7k, add in student loans for $3k/mo, daycare, food, vacations, lawn maintenance, and general expenses, etc it's good money, but at the end of the day it's really just buying moderately nicer things and having practically little to no stress on your money if you can manage your spending.</p>
<p>There really is a big difference in how much you're making, from what I understand, you're generally struggling making below $20k or $40k in an expensive area, and you do ok through $200-300k, got bills, but you pay them and have no problems at that level. It really is just a difference in quality at those levels. But once you start going past $500k, it really is hard to find ways to spend that, especially in the million+ range. I mean, it's pretty hard to find a house that's over $10mil, that's $50k a mo, &quot;downsizing&quot; to a $8mil house when you make $1mil gets you down to the spending cash that the $300k/yr family makes, and really you're not buying anything fancier. Higher income levels really just make you run out of ways to spend it, and you become like bill gates or warren buffet, you start charities to higher people to think of ways to spend it, because the interest on your bank account is so high you can't even spend it fast to enough to keep it from growing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1% by income for the nation is $429,000/year for household income.  Given the average effective tax rate for the 1% of 23.5%, a 1% household would be left with $328,000 a year in take-home pay.  A common guideline for what one should spend on housing is ~30% of take-home pay.  That would mean a household in the 1% could spend up $98,500/year on housing.  At current mortgage rates and with 20% down, that equals a house valued at around $2.1M. </p>
<p>There are only FIVE cities in America where spending that much on housing would not get you a &gt;5,000 square-foot house (what you used below to define &quot;mansion): San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, and LA.  </p>
<p>So what should our 1% family do with that extra $229,000 in take-home income?  </p>
<p>How about a trip to Europe?  Our family of 4 will take non-stop flights from NYC to Paris and stay at the Mandarin Oriental for two weeks.  Each family member also gets $100/day for shopping, food, etc. That's $28,000.</p>
<p>Now they're left with $201,000, so let's give them that second Euro-trip you said they couldn't afford.  </p>
<p>Now let's send both kids to board at Deerfield Academy (one of the best prep schools in the nation) and then on to some Ivy League university.  That's $100k/year in combined tuition.</p>
<p>Mom and dad have to get around, so how about they each get a lease for a brand-new Mercedes-Benz S550.  For both cars, that's $29,000/year (and they get new ones every three years!!).</p>
<p>Mom and dad need food, so let's give them a $1000/month food budget...each. (The average American spends $600/month on food).  </p>
<p>After a generous food budget, a mansion (by your definition), two brand-new Mercedes S550 sedans, tuition and board at the nicest prep schools and colleges in America, and two spare-no-expense Eurotrips, our 1% family has $21,000 left to spend on whatever they want.  </p>
<p>That sounds like a pretty fine lifestyle to me.</p>
