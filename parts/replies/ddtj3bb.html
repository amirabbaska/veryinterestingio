			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely convergent evolution.  Birds and mammal lineages split off <em>very</em> early, back near the first amniotes.  Neither line shows evidence of warmbloodedness for many millions of years after that.  Also, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, and probably turtles are more closely related to birds than they are to mammals.  If the common ancestor was warmblooded, all those lines would have had to lose the trait at some point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>or they would've had to all have evolved cold-bloodedness convergently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what sharks and tuna have is areas of their bodies that generate heat to warm specific muscles, but as soon as the blood circulates out from that area it gets cold again. This guy is the only fish found so far that actually circulates warm blood.</p></div>		</li>
