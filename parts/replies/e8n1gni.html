			<div class="markdown"><p>For a number of years now, work has  been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived  idea of a transmission that would not only supply inverse reactive  current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be  capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an  instrument is the turbo encabulator.</p>
<p>Now basically the only new principle  involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion  of conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interaction of  magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.</p>
<p>The original machine had a base plate  of pre-famulated amulite surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing  in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with  the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic  marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side  fumbling was effectively prevented.</p>
<p>The main winding was of the normal  lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots of the  stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible  tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring on the “up” end of the  grammeters.</p>
<p>The turbo-encabulator has now reached  a high level of development, and it’s being successfully used in the  operation of novertrunnions. Moreover, whenever a forescent skor motion  is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn  reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration.</p></div>		</li>
