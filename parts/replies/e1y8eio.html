			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but the research I linked indicates that dogs also identify other dogs through visual cues, including both morphology (which allows them to distinguish nearly any kind of dog breed) and behavior (to distinguish dogs from canines that aren't dogs)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The complicated answer is closer to &quot;yes&quot;, because the size and behavior of the other dogs will be relevant to their social dynamic.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followup question on the above - if size and behaviour is relevant to their social dynamic, what happens if two dogs of vastly different sizes grow up together? I'm guessing behavior would form based on their interactions, but if you have a tiny dog and a massive dog, will the tiny dog tend to view other massive dogs as &quot;friends&quot; and vice versa? And would the tiny dog be more likely to view other tiny dogs as not part of their social circle due to common interactions with massive dogs, and vice versa? </p></div>		</li>

<p>To some extent but it also depends on owner involvement. Take livestock guarding dogs versus herding dogs, for example. They're inherently born trying to follow different patterns. Livestock guarding dogs chase, guard dogs often do not. The dogs could grow up alongside each other with entirely different activity levels, and might not play with each other.</p>
<p>There was a study at some point that put litters of livestock guards and herding dogs together to grow up without much human intervention. They really only played with the dogs of the same breed because of their inherent behavior patterns.</p>
<p>An owner can mold this though, while they're born with a set of genetic blueprints â€” if you discourage a herding puppy from chasing it won't develop the patterns required for chasing into adulthood. </p></div>		</li>
