<ul>
<li>
<p>Show 2 or more images. At least 1 image has a known solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let user solve the CAPTCHAs.</p>
</li>
<li>If the user correctly solves the known CAPTCHAs, accept the user's solution for the unsolved CAPTCHA. Otherwise, discard his solution.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just this - it also used the collection of gathered data and compares it against other peoples solutions.
Statistically some squares will have closer to 100% match rate while others are lower.
One person can do mistakes, multiply it by million and you get valid data in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt they've made it public but, I can think of a few approaches:</p>
<p>The image recognition software is <em>mostly</em> trained so they only require spots that they're, say... 80% certain of.  They give the same image out multiple times so they have multiple people saying what is &amp; isn't a sign.  If the majority of people say something they're unsure of is a sign (or say something isn't a sign), they feed it back into the system (possibly after trusted humans verify it) to improve the training data.</p>
<p>If you've done many of these, you'll have noticed that you can't always get them right on the first try.  They could possibly give you an unknown image for the first one &amp; automatically fail you then give you a known image for the second one (or vice versa) and use your accuracy on the known image to give a value to your answers to the unknown image.</p>
<p>I'm sure some statistician has come up with adequate thresholds to figure out how many people you need to present an image to &amp; what percentage of people need to label something correctly for it to be pretty safe data to work from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of a temp job that I had years ago. The company was scanning in tons of insurance paperwork. The temps would get images on their screens of characters/words that the OCR software wasn't sure of and ask the temps to verify or interpret the character/word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More data is almost always better, even if there’s noise (some bad data mixed in). There are statistical methods to filter noise and clean data, but getting data in the first place can be very expensive. This method allows Google to gather tons and tons of human opinions, and humans are still better at heuristic image recognition than computers, so that’s valuable data. Even better, all these humans are doing your annotation work for free!</p>
<p>Also, they don’t really judge your humanness by how well you answer the image question (or at least, not always) but based on how naturally your mouse moves, how long it takes you to answer, etc. A bot would likely answer instantly or in a regular pattern, or might get fooled by html elements that are invisible in the browser but show up in the website’s document structure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I started getting those occasionally, and they drive me nuts. After each click, it takes like 15 seconds for the next picture to fully form.</p>
<p>It got so annoying, I just started using the audio captchas instead.</p></div>		</li>
