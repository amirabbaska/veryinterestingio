<p>Is pressure as relevant as I initially thought or is it mainly your explanation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to tunneling, increasing the energy that is available to the system always increases the likelihood/rate of tunneling. Providing this energy by increasing the pressure of the plasma is one way to make tunneling more effective. But in the end it's the energy of the system that matters, the pressure of which is already wrapped up in the 15 million kelvin number at the core of the sun.</p>

<p>I mocked up a quick diagram to illustrate. It's an interaction diagram between two protons. One is framed stationary (at the origin) and the other moving from right to left. The two protons on the right depict two different cases. First of all, neither proton on the right has enough energy to overcome the coulomb barrier and make the fusion reaction occur classically. The only way for fusion to be successful (to reach the dip in the graph) is for either particle to tunnel through the barrier. The lower energy particle (red line) must tunnel through a larger part of the barrier - in the graph this is depicted by there being a longer section of barrier to move through. The higher energy proton (purple) has to penetrate a smaller portion of the barrier.</p>
<p>This is a significant phenomenon because the wave function of these protons drops drastically within the barrier. The longer the portion of barrier, the less likely the particle is to make it through.</p>

<p>A visual with wave functions. The larger the amplitude of the wave, the more likely the particle is to exist there. As you can see the higher energy (purple) proton has a larger amplitude in the fusion zone (more likely to happen) because it has to travel less distance through the coulomb barrier in which the wave function decays exponentially. The amplitudes before reaching the barrier are the same (or at least they are supposed to be, barring my difficulty drawing it).</p>

<p>In the final image the green proton represents the lab case where there is sufficient energy to overcome the barrier. the wavefunction is equal in amplitude throughout; fusion will occur when the proton finds itself in that nuclear attraction region, which is much more likely than in the sun (red/purple) because the amplitude of the wave function is larger.</p>
<p>Ultimatly it comes down to two factors - the overall energy of particles within the sun/their likelihood to tunnel through the coulomb barrier, and the total mass of the sun. A small chance of tunneling multiplied by a shit ton of particles is apparently good enough to give us life. A small chance of tunneling and just a few particles in the lab isn't even good enough for a grant. Gotta give it that energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is scale. Cosmic events happen on a scale (of size, distance, temperature, energies, etc) that we can't dream of on Earth.</p>
<p>Things ranging from solar fusion to black holes are just chewing gum for the mind because there is no feasible way we will ever deal with things of such scale.</p>
<p>TLDR; We're curious ants.</p></div>		</li>
