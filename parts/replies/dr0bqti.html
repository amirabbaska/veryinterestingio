<p>If the virus is in the lysogenic cycle, the cell may perform as normal. For bacteria that depends whether the virus induces lysogenic conversion. In animals it depends on how the virus deals with immune mechanisms like interferons. Either way, the cell lives on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, lungs and nasal passages are blocked with mucous, inhibiting gas exchange drastically. This means you'll tire easily after just a little exertion. Lethargy.</p></div>		</li>
