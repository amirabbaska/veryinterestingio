<p>Your body may be forced to enter &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode, but the energy being produced isn't going anywhere, and is typically converted to visceral fat (no matter where it came from) if it's not used.

<p>Can you please provide a source? I am reading this as, when you are stressed, your body &quot;creates energy&quot; as if you were going running, and then when you don't use it somehow that creates energy get prioritized as fat storage, particularly visceral fat?</p>
<p>My understanding of metabolic processes does not accommodate this statement. I have read a few books on the topic but am still a layman, so I could be missing some subtlety.</p>
<p>Where does that energy come from? Glycogen stores in the muscles or liver? Fat stores? What is it converted to? ATP? How can ATP be converted back into fat?</p>
<p>I do know that the presence of cortisol can cause the body to prioritize fat storage but don't know the mechanism.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fight or flight releases epinepherine which causes glucose stores to be released and blood sugar rises in prep for high energy usage. If you dont use it, insulin will eventually store it as fat. I suspect the metabolic difference is pretty insignificant but overtime can add up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks, i didn't realize that stress responses releases glucose into the blood. that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>the net energy in your body stays the same. however I THINK the presence of cortisol from a stress response actually DOES prioritize the creation of visceral fat (more health risks than subcutaneous fat).</p>
<p>so if you weren't gaining weight before, you won't get measurably fatter, but it can cause more of whatever fat you were storing to be stored as visceral fat which is less healthy. If you live a stressful lifestyle then this happens in small amounts all the time.</p>
<p>thanks for knocking my brain loose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not creating any energy. That's breaking down energy stores into useable energy and then packing that unused energy back into its storage form. There's no net gain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an acute stress response its mainly glycogen stores. The glycogen is converted to glucose which is broken down in ATP (&quot;energy&quot;) and water. Acetyl CoA is part of the pathway from glucose -&gt; ATP, but is also the starting material of lipogenesis. This process is stimulated by the release of insulin, which is prompted by a rise in glucose levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stress response converts energy from storage sources (muscular glycogen, fat) into readily-available forms of energy (mainly glucose). If it doesn't get uptaken by cells (since they don't need it) it tends to gets converted into visceral fat (no matter where it came from).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but if you take two Adderall right now your brain doesn't think your thighs need energy too... It just produces enough energy on demand for your heart and anything else with it's rate up.</p>
<p>It does not randomly release way more glucose than needed just because it thinks we were running or something. If you were correct with that wouldn't adrenaline junkies also have higher levels of abdominal fat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so, what if I take aderall AND exercise ? Heart rate increases, oxygen is supplied and even increased heart rate can deliver more blood stream to feed muscles. Sounds like WIN-WIN.</p>
<p>P.S I know it's bad, I want to know what's the theory behind.</p></div>		</li>
