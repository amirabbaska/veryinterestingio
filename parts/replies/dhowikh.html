<p>But cartoons are a better example of OP's point that actual sitcoms. Simpsons, Family Guy (and all the spinoffs), Rick and Morty... any cartoon with a lead family will have the wife/mom being the competent one and the husband/father is an idiot.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree with the assumption that the Roman master/slave relationship was a straightforward one where the masters were obviously smarter, and the slaves were obviously stupid. I thought it was more complicated than that. The expectation may have been there on one level, but the reality was probably that the slaves were competent enough to run the household and the masters were, well - people who <em>needed</em> slaves to do the cooking. Not always competent people, just rich and powerful ones. I suppose that's what makes it such a rewarding joke. It can make the people it's <em>about</em> laugh at it. </p>
<p>I would also like to take time out to note the interesting comparison here. Of all the relationships you chose the master/slave in order to discuss the husband/wife dynamic. I don't think that reflects your personal feelings about the matter necessarily, but I think it might get at an idea inherent in these later stories about marriage. One person bound by their oath to God to clean up after another, until death do they part. </p>
<p>Anyway. The stupid schlubby husband+skinny competent wife schtick may <em>seem</em> like an outrageous pairing based on the template we know we're <em>supposed</em> to have for these relationships. But in reality, a lot of people laugh at these pairings because they know many couples who are exactly that way. I'll bet that you know some long-married middle-aged men who have legitimately never bought their own groceries. I've met more than one couple who fell into the &quot;<em>she's</em> the one in charge, I'm just another kid!&quot; dynamic. Some of them watch a lot of TV, mind you. So maybe the characters have created the people.</p></div>		</li>
