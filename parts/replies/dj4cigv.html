<p>Using GPS (and other things) we can see how the modern tectonic plates are moving, and from present motions and our knowledge of what drives plates we can make guesses at how the continents might be configured in the future. </p>

<p>Do we got any pics of that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely not from space, since the total movement—within the relatively brief period of time we've been able to send cameras out to space—is still smaller than what our cameras can resolve. More recent cameras are within 1 meter/pixel. Meanwhile, the North American and Eurasian plates move <em>away from each other, in the North Atlantic,</em> about 1 meter every 40 years.</p>
<p>Movement from the ground is much more readily apparent: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fault+line&tbm=isch" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/search?q=fault+line&tbm=isch</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where does that &quot;1 meter&quot; happen over the 40 years? Is it spread out over the land extremely slowly stretching it out? It happens in one predetermined line? Or the pressure builds up causing an earthquake?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add - the Atlantic is growing (at about the same rate as a human fingernail) because of seafloor spreading along mid-ocean ridges, and the Pacific is shrinking because of continental plates sliding beneath others in subduction zones.  </p>
<p>Edit:  Also, India may still be plowing into China, Himilayifying the continent ahead of it, so that's another place to look for changes in the far future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that the Himalayan Orogeny is mostly over as the two plates suture together (seen in the northernmost tectonic unit, the Indus Suture Zone). There might still be some uplift (the ISZ being the northernmost of four major tectonic zones), but at some point the two plates aren't separate plates anymore (or, at least, don't really act like it).</p>
<p>Now the Pacific, that's going to be interesting in the geological future, especially when it finally closes - a new supercontinent. Considering the Appalachian Orogeny, I bet the Rocky mountains might be getting significantly rockier in the process.</p></div>		</li>
