			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>All the major carriers in the US use LTE, like the rest of the world. Verizon and Sprint's legacy CDMA networks still exist to fill in the holes where they don't have LTE coverage (mostly rural, sparsely populated areas). Likewise, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have their legacy GSM networks to fill in those holes. Those networks are shrinking in physical size and capacity as the carriers re-purpose that spectrum for LTE. As long as your carrier supports voice over LTE (and frankly, they all should by now), you could get away with a phone that doesn't support CDMA</p>
<p>Also, a smart phone purchased in the last few years will more or less work anywhere in the world. They may be missing specific bands which could result in less than ideal coverage (T-Mobile's bands 12 and 71 come to mind), but I think you'd be hard pressed to buy a smartphone from any of the major manufacturers that flat out will not work at all on any carrier in a certain country. Unless you have an old phone, you don't even need to give compatibility abroad a second thought when traveling. I know I don't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooooo now it's my time to shine I guess. I work on this stuff, and travel. I can't think of pretty much any phone that's on the market in the US right now that's CDMA only. I work for Apple (this has been said repeatedly in my comments) and travel internationally for them going to factories and working on this. My phone uses Verizon in the states, which is CDMA, but I've absolutely switched to a GSM (which is everywhere else, AT&amp;T is GSM, T-Mobile is GSM, etc if you're stateside) many times. </p>
<p>Also, using my still on Verizon iPhone because I wasn't in Paris that long that trip, but I got in an accident and was hurt. Emergency services were called, no problem (other than my really shitty French)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I was thinking I hadn't heard of making sure you had a multi-band phone before travelling in a while, and was thinking it was probably standard these days, but the Wikipedia article doesn't make that very clear (looks a bit in need of tidying up, really).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CDMA phones support a litany GSM standards nowadays, but often not the other way around. I think Qualcomm has a stranglehold on CDMA patents so other companies that manufacture modems can't easily produce CDMA compatible modems without paying Qualcomm a licensing fee or something.</p>
<p>Hence why Apple produces iPhones with both Intel and Qualcomm modems. With the latter specifically for markets with CDMA networks.</p></div>		</li>
