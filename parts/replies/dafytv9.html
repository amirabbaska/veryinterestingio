			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is also selectively focusing on those imperfections that causes them to be memorable. I suffer severe anxiety sadly in a lot of forms and it's common for me to pick apart everything I could've done but didn't. I'd advise looking into some positive reinforcement techniques or similar ways to help ease your mind to better selective focus and to not dwell just on the things you perceive as bad. </p></div>		</li>
