			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been curious--how does being preprogrammed work? Is there just a sequence of genes that says &quot;hey stay away from long and skinny things that move&quot;? And then that gene is triggered whenever the brain goes to assess a situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has figured out exactly how instincts are pre programmed exactly, but it has to be that. </p>
<p>From bees knowing how to run a complex hive, newly hatched chicks boring how to do simple math below 3, or people being freaked out by snakes, things with too many legs, heights, or irregular holes that could indicate disease.</p>
<p>All things we are usually born with, and some people have it way way more. Some not at all. But there absolutely are some sort of genetic sliders at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard about this is some documentary actually, the reason is that we have adapted over time to see these things as danger. Ever since we could draw on rocks there has been distinct recordings of the dangers of snakes (refer to biblical times with satan, mythology and the basilisk, Egyptians etc.) so through this our brains developed processes that make us weary of these developed techniques of a sort of &quot;notion of danger&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The genes aren't directly read each time you see a snake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to say I have vivid memories of myself before my fear of spiders/insects and after. As a small child I would go lift up all the rocks I could to find the centipedes, and rolly polys, and ants and spiders. I would let them crawl on my hands, trap them in jars, tear their legs etc. One day probably when I was about ten I was poking a sac of spider web and what at least seems in my memory as hundreds of baby spiders escaped from the sac and covered my play structure. I remember as their minuscule shapes first started to leak from the tiny white clump of webbing I was amused and but as they continued to flow I panicked and ran into my house thoroughly shaken. I don't know if if I had learned about dangerous spiders just before this point which made me apprehensive or if the experience surprised me and created in me this fear but I do know that to this day I hate even all invertebrates. In fact I think I hate ants the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be an instinctive component which would help explain why the fear is so common, but there are a lot of anecdotal cases of children being basically unafraid of insects until they see the negative reaction of other people and learn that association. I'm not convinced that instinct plays the larger roll in this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In biology, animals can have what we call &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" target="_blank">precocial</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial" target="_blank">altricial</a>&quot; offspring. Precocial species are those in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching. Altricial species are those in which the young are helpless and incapable of moving around on their own soon after being born.</p>
<p>Precocial species receive less parental care and, I would hypothesize that they are more reliant on &quot;instincts&quot; whereas altricial species which receive more parental care are more reliant on learning from others.</p>
<p>We humans (about as far to the altricial end of the spectrum as you can get) definitely learn to fear things from those around us. By three months of age, most infants can distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar faces, but we don't exactly come out of the womb knowing to be wary of strangers. Concepts of spiders and snakes are non-existent to an infant, and they don't magically materialize in our minds when we reach a certain age. We learn to be afraid of them, often indirectly, by observing how others behave around them or in discussion of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still remember my then baby-sister savagely crushing a crane fly which flew around her face before finally landing on her thigh by booping it with her tiny but chubby index finger. Then she gave it a few little nudges and seemed disappointed that it had stopped moving.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure how or when, but as she grew up she suddenly cower in fear whenever she spots an insect crawling or flying in the same room as her</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course there are variations to the fear. But no matter if we have that fear or not, the human brain has a special section from birth for processing the image of spiders and snakes. Then the fear is built upon that or is not depending on the individual. In some cases it probably could turn to a special fascination. But the framework is still there from birth.</p>
