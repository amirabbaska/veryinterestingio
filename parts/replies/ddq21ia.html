			<div class="markdown"><p>I just brushed up on what Perfect Pitch means. You definitely have to be experienced with music as in knowing the note names of course. Microtonal music would definitely come up, but obviously people would say &quot;sounds like a flatter C&quot; if they heard something.</p>
<p>They'd just be able to hear a note and tell you what it is. I know I can tell when my guitar is out of tune by feel of the strings and/or without a reference note. If someone is playing I can usually tell which string is out just by hear a chord or two. But some people can hear a car horn for a moment and say &quot;G&quot; and that's it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example would someone with &quot;perfect pitch&quot; be able to do their thing, in a piece of music of 81 tone scale?</p>
<p>Where is the limit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have perfect pitch and I struggle with quarter tones. I can here the difference but it sounds more like a change in intonation rather than a change in pitch to me. </p>
<p>I also have trouble sometimes if the music is outside equal temperament. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We rather arbitrarily define pitches.  Some people define A as 440 and others as 442 or so, and the definitions have changed greatly over the years. Plus, equal temperament is actually a false system anyway.  Perfect pitch is more the ability to have perfect pitch recall.  You can learn an arbitrary pitch and then assign a name to it, and recall it. That's really all perfect pitch is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend with perfect pitch and what he can do is pretty amazing. He plays a few instruments and is very well trained, but he told the story of how they figured out he had PP. The specifics are a bit hazy (heard it a long time ago) but when he was very young he'd heard a note on the piano. Some hours later that same day he told his mother that a note he'd heard elsewhere in the house was the exact same note he'd heard on the piano earlier. She thought he just looking for attention, but they checked and the notes matched. It was 100% inborn. </p>
<p>So I can't speak to the phenomenon first hand, but it seems like being able to tell the difference in colors. (Most) everyone can differentiate blue and red. The same is true of purple and many shades between red and blue. You wouldn't confuse red for blue and you can think of the color without any real help. I imagine it's the same thing except with sound frequencies instead of light frequencies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Professional musician here, to add something to this parent. It's not actually understood what perfect pitch truly <em>is</em>. Find a room full of musicians that have it and you'll get a room full of disparate explanations for what it is they can do. Some of these will come down to semantics, and others will be clearly distinct abilities. </p>
<p>These discussions usually get bogged down in perfect vs. relative, and whether the ability is learned or innate. Nobody has ever produced a satisfactory answer to either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have what they call perfect pitch. I just remember the note for middle c on the piano and can calculate anything from there. I get that other people can't do it, but for me, it's just memory, like you remember a number or a word. If someone plays a note, I will hum a middle c and count up until I hit their note on the octave and can reliably name the note played. </p>
<p>Almost anyone can do this in the short term. Play a c then any other note and ask them to count the notes between. I just remember what c sounds like long term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that called relative pitch? The ability to understand a note by referencing it to another note? Which in your case is middle c.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't calibrate between notes. I can hum higher or lower but don't perceive clear increments.  When I hear two notes in succession, I can't really tell you which one is higher and which is lower. I have to think about it or maybe even test on a piano to see which way it goes.  I guess I'm what you call tone deaf.  It doesn't prevent me from enjoying music or even singing in the shower.  </p>
<p>Additionally, I have no sense of direction.  I have to use a lot of context clues and thinking to know which way to turn when I go somewhere and back.  Even then, I often get it wrong and have to turn around after I figure it out. </p>
<p>I sound mentally deficient, but actually I'm a bright and successful person by most measures.  </p></div>		</li>
