			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know of my archaeology classes, even digging it out of the ground destroys a lot of information about the thing. The matrix it's deposited in can have a lot of other information important for understanding the context of the fossil/artifact, and you're just never going to get that information again once it's fully removed. Given that, destructive methods of inspection have to be weighed against non-destructive methods present now or in development and how common the find is. Like, if you have a shark tooth or an arrow head and you want to smash them with a hydraulic press, that's going to be less of a loss than taking the <em>only known example</em> of something and even very carefully splitting it open or vaporizing a tiny piece of it for chemical analysis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the fun in bidding during the auction is to strategically drive the price up. Since the income goes to the Society, which in turn goes to supporting the prizes they award each year and other more philanthropic activities, it's seen as a common, and fun goal to make things more expensive on curiosities.</p></div>		</li>
