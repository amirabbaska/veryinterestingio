			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks this was very informative. May I ask then where ppl get the idea of radiation in relation to microwaves from? Also, when you say excite water molecules, how is that done exactly? And by excite, do you mean heat up? </p>
<p>Sorry, hope you donâ€™t mind all the questions, and thanks again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves do use radiation to heat up food.  It's just not the kind of radiation that people generally think of when they hear the word &quot;radiation&quot;.  Remember, light is a form of radiation too, but when someone says &quot;radiation&quot; people think x-rays, UV and gamma rays - in short, all the stuff that gives you cancer.</p>
<p>Radiation frequency and energy are related.  Despite being called &quot;high frequency&quot; radio waves, microwaves are actually very low frequency compared to e.g. x-rays.  The energy imparted by each microwave photon is insufficient to ionize the molecules that make up food - it's not enough to knock an electron out of the EM force well of its host nucleus.</p>
<p>The ionization is what creates problems in living things, because it can mess with DNA, introducing errors that may lead to cancer at some point down the line.  Microwaves don't do that, they simply don't have enough energy per photon.  This has nothing to do with the power setting by the way, and everything to do with the frequency on which they operate.</p>
<p>As for excitation, remember that heat is just molecular vibration.  The hotter your food, the stronger the molecules that make up said food vibrate.  Microwaves &quot;couple&quot; electromagnetically to (mostly) the water molecules in your food, and jiggle them - making them vibrate more strongly.</p>
<p>This by the way is why microwaves suck at defrosting.  They can't &quot;jiggle&quot; the water molecules in ice very well.  So instead, when you put it on defrost, the microwave alternates between heating phases and pauses, giving the outer layers a chance to melt, and then heating up the water, which in turn melts the ice, which can then be heated up, which heats up more water, ....</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the key issue.  Language doesn't distinguish between ionising and non-ionising radiation, and therefore people don't either.</p>
<p>The same problems are associated with descriptors like &quot;theory&quot;, &quot;chemical&quot; and &quot;organic&quot;.</p>
<p>It's a semantic problem easily overcome with a tiny bit of public education.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add that microwaves operate with 2.45ghz waves, which is dead center in the spectrum range for older wifi routers. If you could operate your microwave Unshielded and with the door open, it would probably overwhelm your wifi signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water molecules are excited with Microwave Radiation.</p>
<p>The microwaves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum that have a wavelength such that they easily transfer energy to water molecules, which shows up in the form of heat (something heating up is at the basic level the molecules vibrating, rotating, and jiggling faster).</p>
<p>This is not at all the same sort of radiation as refers to atomic reactions, Alpha, Beta, etc.</p>
<p>The radiation in Microwave Radiation is a similar meaning to heat or light radiating from a lightbulb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the word &quot;radiation&quot;. During the cold war, &quot;radiation&quot; was the word used to describe nuclear fallout - i.e. Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiation. The latter in particular. </p>
<p>Thus when people heard microwaves used &quot;radiation&quot;, the association with instruments of death was forever etched into their brains. </p>
<p>People don't understand the word &quot;radiation&quot;. All they know is &quot;nuclear stuff = radiation = horrible mutations and death&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's not really true. It does <em>irradiate</em> the food because it bombards it with radiation. But not all radiation is the same. Microwaves are high frequency radio radiation and is a type of non-ionization radiation (ionizating radiation emitted by things like nuclear decay is what causes cancer and other bad stuff).</p>
<p>People just associate &quot;radiation&quot; with things like nuclear fallout and assume the worst even though a lot of things generate &quot;radiation&quot; that isn't harmful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat is molecular motion. It's the average kinetic energy of the particles. You can make the particles move and thus increase the heat by adding energy to a system. Heat can be transfered through convection (within the system) conduction (to a connected system) and radiation (through photon emission).</p>
<p>In that third sense, that a hot object will give off higher energy photons in its blackbody spectrum, then yes, heat can be a kind of radiation. </p></div>		</li>
