<p>But honestly, continuing this funny sponge analogy - a sponge with very small cells does leak much less (and takes more time to completely lose the fluid) than one with big cells and that's something easy to check by anyone (fine sponges are harder to get but they're sometimes used as filters). So, if you consider a heart chambers (balloons here) as a sponge cells - they're huge. With big openings through which blood can flow fast - faster than it could &quot;regenerate&quot; or fix in any way (tissues growing together)... In that time liver could probably at least seal itself though it's most likely in reality fixed by the surgeons (those vascular ones if that's good name - English isn't my language) than left alone ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but you want the sponge to leak! at one point of it's functioning working circle, a sponge leaks... leaking for a sponge is not bad, it's just working right, if it leaks under certain circumstances. So the sucking in and holding the water is like the liver taking in the stuff the liver cares about, holding the water, in liver, would mean checking out the stuff and deciding on which of it is good to keep and what to get rid of, and then, it &quot;leaks&quot; out what it wants to keep into the blood and what it wants to get rid of... somewhere  the body is going to get rid of it </p></div>		</li>
