<p>the heated rain run-off (from the hot streets) when dumped into the local body of water can cause explosive growth of certain toxic organism (&quot;red tide&quot; comes immediately to mind)</p>

<p>I don't think that's what causes it.  It's an excess of nutrients that the bacteria feed off of getting washed into the ocean, and a lot of that is due to both fertilizers and soil erosion.</p>
<p>If you think about it logically, you'll realize that all the water from even a very large rainstorm is insignificant compared to the ocean.  Even power plants that use the ocean for cooling, which means they're constantly pouring hot water into the ocean, can only maintain a very localized area of warm water in the immediate vicinity of the outlet.  Runoff on even a hot day won't change the temperature of a bay or coastline for any amount of time.</p>
<p>Global warming, on the other hand, <em>is</em> raising temps of the ocean worldwide and that can favor growth of certain bacteria over others.  Nutrients are still a limiting factor, though.</p></div>		</li>
