			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the exact same thing. I thought for years the alarm in my iPad was temperamental and only worked sometimes, until I got married and was told that I often wake up, grab the alarm device (now a phone) from her side of the bed, turn it off and then go back to sleep with no memory of it. It took me a while to believe her because I have no idea why I would do that and how I couldn't remember it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Got in trouble for being late at work while I was single because alarms didn't seem to be working; could never explain it without sounding super-lame. Later realised I was turning them off unconsciously. For the last few years I've had three alarms set on the phone at ten-minute intervals, backed up by a separate GTFU old-skool alarm clock. It's worked so far, although it's scary the number of times I've unknowingly pushed it to the final alarm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a phone there are alarms that make you do math to turn them off. In my experience they are the most evil thing humanity has ever created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex used to do this, incredibly frustrating to argue 'no, your alarm did go off/I did try to wake you up (5 times!)'. The only thing that made her realize I was telling the truth was living on her own after we split, lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband also can have full conversations with me after waking up, only to claim later that he has no recollection about it. Now when I try to wake him up I sit there like a nagging fool until he actually farts and puts his pants on, because sadly it is necessary.</p>
<p>As a side note, he just got a cpap. Tonight is his first night using it. Hopefully a night of actually oxygenating will create an improvement in this area. He could rattle the windows with his snoring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is antidote to this: cold room with super warm blankets. If that happens, and especially if room gets warmer in the morning, there's no sound or force in the world that can wake you up. </p>

<p>I always sleep like this and I'm a very, very light sleeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too. We keep the room around 62-64. Husband and 3 year old can sleep through a train wreck. I've always been a light sleeper but now that I have been a nursing mother for 3 years it is beyond ridiculous. I can wake up to the sound of my 1 year old sighing or breathing shallow when he is sick. And we have had white noise playing in our room for 3 years straight, on the highest volume setting the machine allows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was just me!  Giving myself mental commands right before bed works great.  If I know I'm not going to get enough sleep but I command myself before bed to get up, then I will.  Every once in a while I'll get into a mood where I want to remember and record my dreams in the morning, and hands down the very best way with a high success rate is to tell myself before bed to remember them.  Whenever I do that I remember the most details.</p></div>		</li>
