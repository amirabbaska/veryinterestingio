			<div class="markdown"><p>While a kugelblitz would be a very, very hot object, it is just defined as a theoretical artificial blackhole created by the energy density of so much light passing through a tiny enough region simultaneously. If you could make one then theoretically you could feed it and use it as a reactor in a spaceship to reach ludicrous speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make much sense. Thermal energy is molecules going very fast - in every direction. They would disperse instead of forming a tiny black hole.</p>
<p>Somewhere I read that we can't form dangerous black holes with the machines we have. Tiny black holes are very small and very short lived. They disspate a lot of energy and cannot collect enough matter to keep up with the losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are technically correct in this, the thing with forming a black whole from energy in this assumes that you can heat matter to insanely high temperatures past the point of fusion all the way past the temperatures of supernova and then even higher  without the particles involved having time to disperse.
It's what is possible in particle accelerators, although they would probably needs to be bigger than the LHC at CERN.
I would try to elaborate more but on mobile atm and don't know how to type everything out on reddit

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tiny black holes are very small and very short lived.  One could theoretically make a very large, long-lived black hole out of light or kinetic energy, you'd just need an insane amounft of energy to do it.</p>
<p>The thing is, once you have a black hole, the escape velocity out out of a black hole is faster than the speed of light.  It doesn't matter how hot or how fast something is moving, if it's within a black hole's event horizon, even just for a moment, it's trapped in there forever, unless the black hole dissipates due to Hawking's radiation, which is entirely unrelated to how fast the stuff inside the black hole is moving.</p></div>		</li>
