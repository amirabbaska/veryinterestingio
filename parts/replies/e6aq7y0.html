			<div class="markdown"><p>You also want some of the natural enzymes to start the process of &quot;maturing&quot;, which is basically the start of the decomposition process. If you freeze the meat you immediately kill this natural process and affect the quality. This is why you pay more for &quot;never been frozen&quot; meat.
I usually hang game for 5 days at 4 degrees Celsius to get optimal quality. Beef is often hung for 28 days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could actually do that, but there are a couple of reasons the carcass is hung. The extent and length of rigor mortis affects the tenderness of the meat, and rigor mortis is effected by tempeture. Hanging will allow air circulation that will cause the carcass to cool faster and evenly, and the goal is to limit the extent of the rigor stage. Some say using the tenderstretch method allows for more tender meat because it allows the muscles to relax when in the rigor stage, I don't really know about the different methods. You will also remove the skin once the carcass is pliable and you don't want the meat touching the ground. Probably one of the main reason to hang them is for sanitary reasons because we need a safe place for the carcass to sit, and hanging them keeps any bacteria and pest from munching your meat. Once the rigor mortis releases, the aging process begins. Aging makes the meat more tender, and hanging allows the meat to safely sit in a sanitary position for the extent of the aging stage and allows for even air circulation.</p>
<p>Before I started to hunt, I always thought they were bleeding the carcass when I saw hanging carcasses. I thought processing animals for meat was brutal and cruel. Then I learned all about meat processing through hands on experience, and I pretty much instantly stopped being a vegetarian once I was able to bridge the gap between animal to delicious steak. </p>
<p>Exsanguintion, or bleeding, is done when the animal is still alive to bring about death. This process occurs when the animal is still alive and once the heart stops beating, bleeding stops due to the pressure in the veins. Cutting the animal open to remove the guts removes any blood that was not lost when it was killed.</p></div>		</li>
