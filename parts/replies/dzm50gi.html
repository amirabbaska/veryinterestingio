			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I've read as well. Currently the most popular model only has a 21 million year uncertainty but that's assuming that model is correct. Like if you are trying to measure the speed of a car there's multiple ways to do it. Just looking at the speedometer, using a speed gun, GPS. The way we measure the age of the universe within 21 million years is similar to only looking at the speedometer. Other methods for the age of the universe predict anywhere from 13.5 billion to 14.5 billion years. Although every model tested so far seems to agree that it's around 14 billion years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only model of universe expansion that is used is the FLRW metric, which comes from General Relativity. The way that the expansion proceeds is determined by the composition of the universe, and the CMB allows us to put some rather precise bounds on that composition.</p></div>		</li>
