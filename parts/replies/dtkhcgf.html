			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps you could point out what I am missing because this appears (assuming the results so far continue, i.e. 100% cure rate for all tested cancers) to be The cure for cancer. What need would there be of personalized cancer vaccines if you can simply directly inject the tumor with a non specialized agent and have the immune system generate its own customized response for that exact cancer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its cured artificially induced cancer. Naturally occurring cancer in humans is totally different  as the cancer has had to evade the individuals immune system from scratch in  most cases. The  human trials will be exciting but to assume this is going to translate to the best treatment in humans would be wildly optimistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article specifically states &quot;The approach works for many different types of cancers, including those that arise spontaneously, the study found.&quot;  You still make a good point that we need to see how well it translates to humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the comparison of success rates in mice trials vs human trials for similar types of treatment give some indication of what we might expect? My vague recollection is that these types of treatments even at the animal testing stage usually boast about 20% or 50% remission in single types of cancer without the added benefit of metastases being also cured. Is that a fair summary, or have there been results this good before that have been thwarted in human trials?</p></div>		</li>

<p>From 1998:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far, the drugs are the only ones ever tested that can seemingly eradicate all tumors in mice, even gigantic ones, equivalent to a two-pound growth in a person. </p>
<p>Until patients take them, he said, it is dangerous to make predictions. All he knows, Dr. Folkman said, is that ''if you have cancer and you are a mouse, we can take good care of you.''</p>
<p>Other scientists are not so restrained. ''Judah is going to cure cancer in two years,'' said Dr. James D. Watson, a Nobel laureate who directs the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a cancer research center on Long Island. Dr. Watson said Dr. Folkman would be remembered along with scientists like Charles Darwin as someone who permanently altered civilization.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what happened there? It looks like this went into early trials, and then what? I can't find anything on outcomes, reason for termination or recent research. Dude just decided to take up banjo lessons instead? Did this not make it to phase iii?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they cure rats with this method, all of them are identical rats with identical cancers. In reality, we are all vastly different in immune system, metabolism, etc. Also cancer comes in an unending number of types and flavors, so the chance for a catch-all cure for cancer is not realistic as we understand it. Personalized care using gene therapy could be tailored for each individual and their exact disease, which is much more exciting to people who have been in the field following every advancement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are trials ever conducted with non identical mice and/or none identical cancers?  Perhaps parallel to the other trial. Given so many variables it would seem prudent though I understand the need for controls. Maybe there is something to be gained by being “out of control”.</p></div>		</li>
