			<div class="markdown"><p>How would one know if their graft was full thickness or split thickness years after the fact? If it's possible to tell anyway. I was scalded by hot water at the age of 13 months (I'm almost 20 now), and am interested in burn injuries, both the pathophysiology of the injury itself, as well as treatments. Also, which graft is more likely in 2nd/3rd degree burns? If I remember correctly, mom said I had some skin taken from my leg (though I can't see any noticeable scar there) and also had a donor donate skin for the deeper scald on my side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably used cadaveric skin as a temporizing measure on your side (look up homograft). </p>
<p>They will occasionally look different. For example, if you see crossmarks on the wound, then it was probably a split thickness meshed graft. Whereas if you see hair from where the graft was harvested from, it's probably a full thickness. I'd venture that they did a split thickness graft. Young children just heal remarkably well.</p>
<p>As for which is used on 2nd/3rd degree burns, the site matters more than the depth. You don't usually graft superficial second degree burns, but deeper second and nearly all third degree burns get grafted. Both can accept split and full thickness. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't the correct term be allograft, or are they interchangeable? Or for that matter, are they simply not the same thing?</p></div>		</li>
