			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, that fidelity issue also plays with the converse.</p>
<p>Someone like Hillary Clinton, who <em>only</em> says she supports whatever issues the Democratic party is supporting at that moment, seems disingenuous.  She has a history of opposing the same things she says she's supporting, which on the one hand could be interpreted as her views rapidly evolving, but the fact that she never supported them when it might hurt her, or that she only supported them once an election where she was likely to be the Democratic nominee popped up, suggests she doesn't so much support them as she panders to her base.</p>
<p>So while you have someone like HW who's labelled a Flip Flopper for ostensibly towing the party line but being forced into a position where he has to break it, you have the extreme opposite in Clinton, someone who only tows the party line because it will get her elected, and whose true motives are largely unknowable because her record reads as a &quot;yes on what we support today but maybe not tomorrow&quot; to do list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's a fine line. The problem is people seem to only understand absolutes. E.g., You have to be for taxes or against taxes, there is no middle ground.</p>
<p>I was listening to a radio show the other day where a guy was saying he believes we need to put a tarriff on everything to protect people's jobs. His reasoning wasn't important as Im not saying he was wrong, but after a call with a person who heads some economic trade policy organization that was saying implementing tariffs would be bad overall, he went off on some crap with another caller about how the economic policy guy said he'd be fine with tariffs IF some other condition was met (namely no income tax).</p>
<p>Well they just went nuts and circle-jerked about how you can't be both for something and against it, and how illogical that is. However the critical point there made by the guy was &quot;Im fine with <strong>X</strong> IF <strong>Y</strong> is satisfied&quot; and they didn't give him a chance to defend or clarify his position, nor try to even understand why someone would think that way.</p>
<p>I thought about it. The reason he'd be fine with tariffs if we had no income tax is because he had a problem with reducing people's purchasing power. You give back purchasing power to people who you took it away from with the tariffs if you remove their income tax. So his argument was just against excessive taxation and the fact the cost of tariffs will be born by the people makes it another tax. </p>
<p>He was against tariffs based on everything else remaining the same, and these guys just didn't bother looking any deeper than the surface at the issue because to them it's either you're for tariffs or against them, there is no grey area.</p>
<p>I got a kick out of that, how these radio talkshow guys are saying a policy professional's argument is logically fallacious when they aren't even deconstructing his argument properly. It was a conditional statement the guy made. You can't just ignore the condition!</p>
<p>Anyway, that's an example but you see the same shit every day with other topics. Abortion, government spending, welfare, etc. People don't often see things outside of a black and white world they invent for themselves because they're intellectually lazy. It's easier to see things that way.</p>
<p>In general though you're going to have a hard time finding a single politician or talking head that isn't a hypocrite sometimes. Ideology can butt heads with reality when they put what they believe in to practice. Sometimes what sounds good in discourse doesn't work because human nature or some hidden variable changes how it works in the real world. For example behavioral economics is kinda showing us people aren't rational actors like many policies assume!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying you're wrong, quite the opposite. But I find it amazing from a British perspective that in the top 5 things around which a political party would draw its battle lines are abortion, religion, and guns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because both parties are actually quite closer on other issues than people care to admit. The &quot;battle line&quot; issues you mention are the ones that people tend to see as black and white, yes or no, good or evil, and so they get talked about the most despite the fact that polling shows most people care more about things like the economy, foreign policy, health care, education etc. that have a lot of gray area. Focusing on the more polarizing issues is what gets people to hardline it to your side even if they disagree with the rest of your platform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest problem is that even if you're aware that this is how the political party system functions nowadays and you want to decrease your partisan entrenchment, there's not much you can do about it as a voter if you feel strongly about one of those issues, because the parties have basically self-organized along those issues and left very few, say, pro-choice Republicans or pro-gun Democrats. It's gotten to the point that it HAS to be a public opinion battle, which makes for increasing polarization and very slow-moving change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the parties add that similar on education, health care, economic issues, etc. It's that that stuff is far more complicated, and achieving real progress tends to cost money. Guns, God, and abortion are far simpler yes/no issues that can be &quot;addressed&quot; for free. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The parties don't have anything of substance to argue about aside from taxation and wealth redistribution. Foreign policy wise the parties are rarely very different (Trump being an exception). Abortion, religion, and guns doesn't really change because for the latter two issue the Constitution is final and on the former the Supreme Court has declared itself the arbiter of (well, also of the finality of the law but that's another discussion), and both of these things render the Congress impotent on them. They can yell and yell and get people worked up and it will never change and both parties know it, but both parties yell and yell. The purpose of this is fear. Fear that without Republicans, the gayness will spread. Fear that without Democrats, your children will all be gunned down in school. Fear that without Republicans, your daughters will spread their legs for anyone since they can just get babies brains sucked out. Fear that without Democrats, you'll be forced to carry your ectopic pregnancy to your death. Its always about how the others are going to make everything worse but in reality neither side can do much of anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depending on where you stand on this issue, you could also write &quot;Republicans&quot;. But I think this is a pretty good analysis (even though we all know that &quot;gayness&quot; doesn't &quot;spread&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former Republican, the majority of Republicans I grew up around voted on those three issues alone, and sometimes only one of the issues. And lest you think I'm being unfair, they'd openly and proudly admit it. I could site 10 studies for 10 different issues and the response would basically be, &quot;well maybe so, but guns.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you, I have a lot of evangelical friends that voted Trump just for the possibility of turning the Supreme Court and hoping for an overturning of Roe v Wade.</p>
<p>I don't know how possible it is, but they openly admit they vote Republican basically just because abortion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hillary's &quot;people on the no fly list shouldn't get guns&quot; comment really cost her.  It was a stupid idea even if it'd had mass support, and all it did was lose her more voters who hadn't abandoned her over her breach of classified documents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's reasonable if possibly selfish. </p>
<p>Gun rights affect them directly. A small change in politics would make it impossible for them to buy replacement magazines, for example. Welfare, abortion, foreign policy could change drastically and they would have no idea if they decided to stop watching the news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flash forward to good ol' GW in the early 2000's and he put us in two wars AND cut taxes...only time in American history where we went to war and taxes were actually lowered instead of raised. Not quite sure how he thought we were going to pay for it but he learned from what happened to his Dad for better or worse, mostly for worse though </p></div>		</li>
