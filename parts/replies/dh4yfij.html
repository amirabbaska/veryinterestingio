<li>Overheating. Whales and dolphins have sophisticated thermoregulatory systems that only function when in the stable ambient temperature of the ocean. Factor in the inches thick blubber whose function is to retain as much metabolic heat as possible in frigid waters and you have the makings of a whale sauna. Heat transfer to the water is an important part of temperature regulation, once beached whales will quickly and almost always fatally overheat.</li>
