			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to write you and say that she probably has some scar tissue from the intubation. My son is a St. Jude patient and the specialists are assuming this is the reason for his respiratory issues. We could find out with a scope but as he is young and has been under anesthesia many times we are waiting to do that procedure. Merry Christmas to you and yours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medic here, I'm almost 100% positive it's due to the vent. Being on a vent that long weakens the muscles in the lungs that your body is use to using every day of your life. It's harder to rebuild the decades of muscular strength that's lost due to vent dependence. Glad everything ended up alright in the end though.</p></div>		</li>
