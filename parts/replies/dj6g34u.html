			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example of a food product that uses high pressure processing (HPP), or Pascalization as you called it, is guacamole. This is how some brands can make guacamole with absolutely no preservatives and it still doesn't oxidize or go bad. Peanut butter has also been studied as a possible candidate for this method of killing bacteria, as a potential way to prevent salmonella contamination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought things like apples or guac oxidizing was an enzyme reacting with air? </p>
<p>does this just kill off the enzymes or something? not sure how else it could stop something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are both correct. Browning of guacamole is oxidation, not spoilage, but Pascalization is used to extend shelf life for packaged guac. I don't think the pressure treatment does anything to stop browning, though. Probably they do something else to deactivate the peroxidase enzymes that cause the color change -- probably adding a little acid to denature them or interfere with their activity.</p></div>		</li>
