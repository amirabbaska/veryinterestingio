			<div class="markdown"><p>40’ walls of a’a lava was in the most recent lava eruption that took over Kapoho. It’s not so far fetched to see a 100’ wall that contains a denser composition than Hawaiian Basalt </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huge fissures in the ground upened up in eastern washgton and north east oregon and west idaho, they were anywhere from a mile to 100miles long and several miles wide. </p>
<p>These erruptions are the super volcano equivelence of yosimite but all the energy goes into poring out lava instead of a big explosion (the mantel plume that created the yosimite erruptions split it half in oregen 15 million years ago, the split plume went north instead of east.)</p>
<p>These erruptions lastes a couple weeks but when the urrepted you pretty much had a wall of lava heading off in every direction, you end up having  a giant pancake spreading over 100,000 squar miles. This was pure grade basalt, exactly the same as hawaii. These erruptions happened around 100 times (most of them in a span of 400,000 years.</p></div>		</li>
