			<div class="markdown"><p>I think all of your points are valid. I'm assuming they are profitable such that they cover all operating costs of their network under some huge number let's say $1 Billion. If the average cost to transmit is around 1 cent per GB, not including these operating or fixed costs and ATT makes $10 Billion then we can estimate profitability a bit better. I want to understand what numbers they are most interested in for their own profitability estimations and the first thing I want to know is the cost of goods sold of data even though there are enormous infrastructure and operating costs factoring in. I believe the sheer volume of transactions puts them well above their cost of development and maintenance of their network even with all of the complexities you mention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What everyone seems to be forgetting is that each tower only has a finite amount of data it can transmit at one time and also no doubt a certain number of phones that can be actively connected to it. Most of the time when you’re connected to a tower you won’t be that one connection that pushes it over the limit but the more data they allow you to transmit, the more likely it is that towers will need to be upgraded, replaced, supplemented with additional towers etc. </p>
<p>You could think of this in a similar way to passengers on a bus. The marginal cost of each passenger is very low (just the cost of the additional fuel for the extra weight) but at some point the bus becomes over crowded and an additional bus service needs to be put on. The marginal cost of that final passenger was very high. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it’s very difficult to calculate the true cost of each Gb of data but I imagine that which towers you connect to on a regular basis and how congested they are play a big part. The best solution for the company would probably be to charge you more based on demand for each specific tower you use but it would be very complicated and probably not very popular. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a number of telecom billing systems. While nothing is impossible, trying to calculate a bill based on minute-by-minute demand would be extremely difficult and require a lot of resources. And considering the consumer response to 'surge' pricing with Uber, I think it's a non-starter. </p></div>		</li>
