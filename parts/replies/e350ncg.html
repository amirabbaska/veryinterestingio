<p>If you want a reference, read JB West's <a href="http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/29/1/11.long" target="_blank">paper.</a> He's a medical doc. Probably the easiest for a layperson to read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How? The mammalian lung has twice the input and twice the output.
Plus, they are redundant, thus allowing the animal to survive with only one. </p>
<p>One avian lung collapses and the bird dies.
One mammalian lung collapses and the mammal still breathes</p>
<p>That medical doc is looking at it from a medical perspective. An engineer wants to double functions and have redundancy, which birds have neither. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are you talking about? Twice the input and twice the output? If I eat food and then vomit it back up, I don't end up with twice the food and twice the poop. The bird lung has air go in one direction, like our digestive system. The mammalian lung has air go to and fro, which does not mean twice the input or output, it means more wasted effort moving air that does nothing to oxygenate or ventilate.</p>
<p>An engineer does not want double function, they want the best solution to a problem. Would your electric toothbrush be better engineered if it had a corkscrew and a spatula on it? And redundancy as an engineering goal? Would your business software be better engineered if someone coded it in both BASIC and C#? Sometimes we engineer redundancy as a safeguard for failure, like on a space shuttle, but often redundancy is, well, redundant.</p>
<p>Your responses are so odd that I think you are trolling, but on the off chance you aren't:</p>
<p>Birds have two lungs and nine air sacs. Bird lungs don't collapse.  Mammalian lungs are suspended open by a low pressure pleural space and can collapse with minimal trauma, including spontaneously. The collapse of a single lung can often be enough of an impediment to be fatal, dying in minutes rather than the seconds of a bilateral collapse. The change in volume of mammallian tidal respiration leads to so many challenges, and consequently so many potential failure points. Alveoli can become damaged from opening and closing (atelectrauma). Mammals are more likely to develop stress failure and pulmonary edema since their lung has no rigid support. They are more likely to develop pulmonary hemorrhage when exercising (seen in race horses). Mammals cannot separate their ventilation and gas exchange systems, while bird lungs allow for separating these functions.</p>
<p>At altitude, the only way a mammal can get more oxygen is to hyperventilate, and it doesn't work that well. A bird doesn't need to hyperventilate in order to oxygenate.</p>
<p>From a bioengineering standpoint, the avian lung is the elegant solution to a challenge. There are more species of birds, and they have greater geographical diversity (in part because of their ability to occupy high altitudes) than mammals.  One could argue that it is therefore the more successful approach, although it's a bit silly to try to apply this to an entire class of animals, and evolution doesn't really rank success in terms of anything other than alive or dead.</p></div>		</li>
