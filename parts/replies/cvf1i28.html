			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be pretty funny.
But to the best of my knowledge even the regional weather reporters speak in a rather BBC accent. Crisp and clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, weather presenters here in the UK pretty much require you to be a meteorologist because when they're not in a TV studio, they're usually working for the Met Office, either on site or on location helping to gather information to send that data back to use for TV forecasts.</p>
<p>I've seen people like Tomascz Schafernaker and Carol Kirkwood in news and lifestyle segments during their day jobs away from the BBC News studios where they're most known for presenting forecasts.</p></div>		</li>

The weather wouldn't be half as interesting without her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately she's not quite the greatest ballroom dancer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuinely haven't seen her on Strictly yet but it's weird watching Breakfast without her presenting the weather forecast. I can't wait for her to return, especially since she'll only have two months to exchange banter with Bill before he leaves the show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the TV, you certainly have to be a metereologist. On radio, the weather's read by the newsreader, except BBC London and 6Music's Chris Hawkins getting Simon King in.</p></div>		</li>
