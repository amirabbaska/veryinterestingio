			<p>What would really make me laugh would be if it turned out he delivered the forecast in Cockney, Welsh, Scottish or another semi-unintelligible dialect.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. But for the sake of my imagination any of the numerous options would have been hilarious.</p>		</li>

			<p>That would be pretty funny.<br>But to the best of my knowledge even the regional weather reporters speak in a rather BBC accent. Crisp and clear.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, weather presenters here in the UK pretty much require you to be a meteorologist because when they're not in a TV studio, they're usually working for the Met Office, either on site or on location helping to gather information to send that data back to use for TV forecasts.<br><br>I've seen people like Tomascz Schafernaker and Carol Kirkwood in news and lifestyle segments during their day jobs away from the BBC News studios where they're most known for presenting forecasts.</p>		</li>

			<p>You have to love Carol.<br>The weather wouldn't be half as interesting without her.<br><br>Unfortunately she's not quite the greatest ballroom dancer!</p>		</li>

			<p>Genuinely haven't seen her on Strictly yet but it's weird watching Breakfast without her presenting the weather forecast. I can't wait for her to return, especially since she'll only have two months to exchange banter with Bill before he leaves the show.</p>		</li>

			<p>On the TV, you certainly have to be a metereologist. On radio, the weather's read by the newsreader, except BBC London and 6Music's Chris Hawkins getting Simon King in.</p>		</li>
