			<div class="markdown"><p>Dawn is best, as dusk risks mold growth. Purely to prevent evaporation, either is fine. Dusk is acceptable if you have some kind of mold or fungal resist soil or treatment. </p>
<p>Honestly, in a lot of cases, if it needs water midday, water it. Many people water in the evening just fine, as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you want to maximize evaporation because having prolonged moisture on foliage can lead to various fungal diseases. Watering in the morning is always a good bet. Watering at night once in a while is ok but you don't want to make a habit of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I believe part of this myth started, because a lot of pesticides will have heat restrictions. If you spray during these times you will often burn or kill the plant. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I just came across <a href="https://www.livescience.com/6017-water-drops-magnify-sunlight-burn-leaves.html" target="_blank">this study</a> which suggests this effect is real for certain types of plants!  I was beginning to spread misinformation based on your post.</p></div>		</li>
