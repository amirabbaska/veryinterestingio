			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats only partially true. Wild bees are dying off yes but commercial beekeeping is not sustainable right now. CCD alone caused roughly 33% of commercial bees in 2016-17 season.</p>
<p>Some areas in the world are even worse. Upstate New York is particularly rough for beekeepers. I know three different beekeepers who lost 75% by January, my dad included. Sure the huge companies can handle the losses but the people with 100-500 hives are going out of business.</p>
<p>Commercial bees are in just as bad shape as wild bees are</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad has had, I think, 5 out of 6 hives in Central Texas die this year. Granted he is a newbie and just learning, others had hives that did fine. But there was a wild hive at the ranch I work at in South Texas that died this winter and I was trying to feed them to keep them alive cause my dad wanted to collect them when the weather warmed up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that being said you can also make really good money if you can get the right pollination contracts. But its really a gamble. One year you can make 100k+ a year and the next year all your bees could die and you could have to burn every single hive and start anew</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, commercial farming utilizes mobile bee hives.</p>
<p>Basically, a family friend of mine owns many beehives. He gets a call from x farmer asking for y number of hives to be placed in his fields for z weeks/days to pollinate the plants. The hives are moved using flatbed semi trucks and left in the open field for whatever length of time, then the beekeeper comes to pick them up and move to the next location.</p>
<p>Even if the local population of wild bees is declining from the farms pesticide use (which is exactly what's happening), the commercial bees come in and everything gets pollinated pretty thoroughly during that time. I assume there's a lot of insurance that the beekeeper buys in case his bees are either killed by pesticides or stolen, and I also assume there's an agreement with the farmer not to spray pesticides during the period which the bees are on site, and likely just prior to that as well.</p>
<p>Also, depending on the location of the farm and the crop being grown, the beekeeper can then sell specialized honey which has a different flavor for different plants in the area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on a apple orchard in Argentina during the picking season.  They had beehives all along the laneway from the road/bus stop.  They were mean sumbitches though.  You basically had to run like Forest Gump down the laneway to not get your shit fucked up.  Picking apples along that edge of the orchard was particularly unpleasant. </p></div>		</li>
