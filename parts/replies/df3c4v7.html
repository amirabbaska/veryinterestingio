			<div class="markdown"><p>at the same time, being under an oppressive govt is still better than no govt at all</p>
<p>before i wind up on /r/shitstatistssay : fuck govt</p>
<p>but govt is a necessary evil in this world</p>
<p>a state of no govt is violence and warlords until govt forms again. in a way, there is no such thing as human society without govt. it always reforms, and the period of no govt in between is nothing but violent horrors that makes north korea look nice. sorry fanboys </p>
<p>to add even more: oppressive govts lead to anarchy. they are so miserable the people prefer a state of violent no govt temporarily <em>in the hope a less oppressive govt forms</em>. rinse and repeat until one actually does</p>
<p>all autocracy is inherently unstable this way. democracy is a shitshow, but its legitimacy and stability is the only reason why it always outlasts autocracy </p></div>		</li>
