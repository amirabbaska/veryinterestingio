<p>again GS1 can't guarantee that a company doesn't accidentally assign one barcode to 2 barcodes any more than other companies can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Duplicating barcodes is actually quite common. Barcodes are frequently re-used by companies so it can be a good thing that GS1 doesn't restrict this. This can happen when a company wants to re-launch a product. It also happens a lot with seasonal products, that are only in stores for a couple of months.</p>
<p>I worked for a company that dealt a lot with barcodes. Barcode reusal created some problems for our system, so we had to include version numbers in our systemcodes. Many years ago they figured that 1 digit would be enough, since barcodes don't get reused that often. But.....you guessed it........there were actually barcodes that got reused more than 10 times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I would agree that people should be able to do this. And they can currently as well with no real restrictions (as long as the store is fine with fiddling with their system a little bit).</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure GS1's official policy would say you can't do it. And they might even try to restrict it if it were possible - but it's really not. Stores each have their own closed system for their own barcode numbers/products and GS1 doesn't have access to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What GS1 teach in Sweden at least is that you are absolutely permitted to re-use barcodes, but the product that used the previous barcode should be a couple of years off the market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not for profit? - technically yes, although it's hard to see how they manage to somehow, spend all of this, if they are not paying massive salaries out to everyone involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quick technical note: there's absolutely nothing to stop a non-profit from paying any salary at all. The thing that makes it a non-profit is that <em>it can't make a profit</em>. Paying salaries is an expense, not the result of a profit. Paying <em>dividends</em>, conversely, is the result of a profit. The thing that makes a non-profit theoretically more-ethical than a for-profit company is that it's harder for people to make money from it by doing <em>nothing</em> (i.e. just being a shareholder): you actually need to be employed by the company. This has implications (which vary geographically) on taxation, transparency, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some <em>kinds</em> of non-profit have further restrictions. In most localities, charities (for example) are a specific type of non-profit that has other limitations, such as perhaps financial transparency and/or being able to demonstrate that they're acting towards a specific public good.</p>
<p>GS1's clearly a little shady, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, people need to stop equating salaries with <em>not</em> being a non-profit. People gotta get paid. Some non-profits are volunteer only, and some pay <em>less</em>, but it's not indicative of a non-profit lying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. But you've got to admit, it's confusing (and made more-confusing by the diversity of non-profits out there, some of whom seem to <em>try</em> to make it more-confusing)!</p>
<p>I probably appreciate it more than most: most of my income comes from my (salaried) work for a registered charity... but I also volunteer with a non-charity non-profit that I run. So in my case... I draw a salary from one of the stricter kinds of non-profit and <em>don't</em> draw a salary from the less-strict kind (of which I'm also a shareholder, but our articles of association and company structure mean that no dividends can be paid anyway!). And if you followed all that, you're smarter on non-profit/charity law than 90% of people on the subject of non-profits!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real short answer is that whatever ecosystem the barcode is intended for will have a governing document that outlines how they are created to fulfill the intended need of the barcode. There are governing organizations who do this over industries, but you can also have specifics within individual supply chains that apply nowhere else.</p></div>		</li>
