			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet, most modern machines are designed to preheat slower than older machines.... Manufactures have said this is because they need lower wattage elements and cycling said element during preheat to save energy...  </p>
<p>Older ovens, turned on, and stayed on until desired temps has been reached.  New machines, cycle between broil, bake, and convection (optional on some machines) elements during preheat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a ton of sense if your oven isn't a convection oven, because you want to heat up all the air with as little energy as possible, so you are going to want to direct that heat efficiently. For example Broil is only the top element so if that part is colder warm it up, and by being more direct you sacrifice speed for efficiency of course.</p></div>		</li>
