<p>To add on to one of your points about going up a scale, the layout of a piano is an especially great design to teach general music concepts, too. The C major scale is &quot;all white keys&quot;. If you only play those keys, sequentially, you already know a scale--boom. The sharps and flats (relative to C Major) are a completely different color. And the repeating nature of those white and black keys makes it easier to visualize the &quot;formula&quot; of scales, in terms of half and whole steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I subscribe to the belief that it's mostly down to the guitar or piano being easier to learn than a wind instrument. I am a Guitarist, so I'm sure I'm a little biased on this.</p>
<p>When I picked up the guitar, I didn't pick it up because I knew it was easier, I picked it up because I wanted to. I'll admit you have a point in that the guitar is easier to play in those ways listed. But, I would argue that most people who pick up the guitar don't know how to tune. It still takes time to figure out getting the desired note, even if it isn't nearly as long. Plus if you add bending and harmonics into the equation I'd argue staying in tune isn't as simple as just placing your finger on the desired fret.</p>
<p>In addition, I'd say polytonal instrument like the piano or the guitar take a lot of time to understand chords, scales, their relationship, and fingerings. I'm not trying to say on instruments that aren't polytonal that doesn't come up, but I don't think its as important when you're starting. I also don't think it's fair to say that learning chords doesn't take a lot of practice. A piano has 88 keys, a guitar has between 72 and 288 locations for a note depending on number of frets or strings without counting harmonics. Learning how to voice chords can be very complicated, especially with other instruments, which matters a lot on those instruments.</p>
<p>I think every instrument is probably equally hard if you want to actually be proficient on the instrument. But you might not spend time on the same things. I really feel as though your post is comparing a classically trained musician to someone who picked up an instrument and figured out the bare minimum. I don't think that's a fair comparison at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree that the level of the mastery on the instruments is not low, but I think what /u/Kai-Mon is trying to say that if you just want to play some chords and make some sound, they're the easiest instruments. </p>
<p>A person with no musical experience won't be able to play much on guitar, sure, and they'll take a while to play a single barre chord, but I'm sure within a few minutes they can strum a C, D, E, A major chords somewhat competently. Even add a few more minutes and they'll be able to do minors and 7ths, even. Compare to that a violin. How long would it take to be able to play a E major triad on a violin? Years. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Ease of use and polyphony are separate reasons for the popularity of the instruments. Ease of use gets people interested in playing, since they can produce simple music without lots of training. You can learn to play a few chord progressions in a very short time if you're not trying to learn the instrument properly. For many people that's enough. And having such a wide range of simultaneous voices available makes the piano and guitar useful in all kinds of ways most other instruments can't duplicate. For committed musicians, that's worth the effort to learn the instruments properly.</p>
<p>Easy to use as a beginner, powerful and versatile for experts with years of experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trumpet does follow a scale, though. No valve is normal, and then every valve after that scales with 0.5. (first is 0.5, second is 1, third is 1.5. Combining them is possible). </p>
<p>You're right about everything else, though. Your technique decided whether you actually follow that scale, as hitting more valves can still produce a lower note than a higher one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fellow brass player, I think they mean that the scale pattern wouldn't make sense to someone with no prior experience and no teacher. You need years or practice to sound good and intune on most wind instruments, while guitar and piano sound good immediately and practice is mostly just getting the technical aspects down vs. tone production fundamentals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but hitting the valves follows the same scale. Like the first valve is similar to the black buttons on a piano, in that you go up half a note. </p>
<p>Like I said, though, he's right about everything elss, mostly for the reasons you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>
