			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert on this but I will tell you what I know</p>
<p>(1) China 100 years ago can be said to be akin to Europe at the tail end of the dark ages (up to just before the renaissance) and to a large extent, China has not moved on alot. Away from the big cities, its still villages only really accessible by foot with indoor plumbing being the exception not the rule. People still mostly live off the land in semi pre industrial revolution sort of way
Anecdotal point: on a boat cruise I took a few months back there was a mother washing her clothes in the river along with her children bathing themselves in the river</p>
<p>(2) While in most western cultures we to a certain extent moved beyond expensive items confering status to people (and largely internalised that money cannot buy happiness or fulfillment etc.) in China luxury goods, from rolexes to german sports cars still get people excited, and elevate the owner to a higher status. Couple this with people with basically infinite money (but without a lifestyle that is expensive) and you have an epidemic of consumerism </p></div>		</li>

<p>Have lived in a couple and visited all the other countries in South East Asia, and this is very common (including in some parts of the towns and cities) everywhere except Singapore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm told from my Chinese friends is that it's because the government has been buying land from rural landowners who had lots of farmland that was pretty much worthless but very useful for building on. These huge buyouts allowed them to become rich while still keeping their old attitudes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Factory owners--&gt;China = World #1 in cheap knock off stuff
Chinese money stays in China--&gt; very little outsourcing or hiring of foreign talent </p>
<p>And rampant corruption in business, government pretty much all walks of life. For example, it is common practice for government infrastructure contracts (building a new bridge lets say) to go not to the most suitable company but to the highest briber
*You know the trend of Chinese people buying up property in Canada, the States etc. thats offshoring illgotten gains </p></div>		</li>
