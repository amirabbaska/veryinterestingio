<p>I can't speak to distillation though, I have no experience with that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Xylitol is processable though. It has 2.4 kcal compared to 4 of glucose , and it's toxic to many caries causing cancers which is why it's used to replace sugar in chewing gum. And it can also cause diarrhea in susceptible persons if consumed in excess. It is still used for energy though.</p>
<p>It's extremely toxic to dogs though, so don't give dogs anything that says sugar free/xylitol on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to fatty liver disease. Chronic carbohydrate consumption can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A fatty liver is one of the signs, or maybe even one of the causes, of type 2 diabetes. A fatty pancreas definitely leads to type 2 diabetes. A fatty liver and a fatty pancreas go hand-in-hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is one of those statistocs that did not care about age of different groups. High alchohol consumprion decreases chances of some types of blood  cancer (cant remember which ones exactly). The trick though is that those people are more likely to die before reaching age group which is most likely to get those tupes of cancer.</p></div>		</li>
