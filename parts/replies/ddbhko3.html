			<div class="markdown"><p>Back during seventh grade in middle school, the class was in the middle of standardized testing, and I hadn't gotten any sleep the night before. I dozed off in my seat. Every time my body thinks I'm falling, I always dream of a series of events leading up to me falling. In this particular instance, I dreamed that I was living through the opening of Majora's Mask, and when I got to the part where Link falls down the pit, I fucking snapped awake and smashed my knees on the bottom of a metal desk. Didn't hurt much, but it made a hell of a racket, which scared the shit out of half the class and pissed off the teacher. Oh, the good ol' days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did something similar in 8th grade during class, but when I jumped, I had a dream that I was falling down a flight of stairs so as I woke up I put my arms out to catch myself and swiped my binder and notebooka off the desk. That was hilarious but the teacher was annoyed, then concerned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With you on it. Just one subtle clarification as I learned it. The brain interprets all that info as a hallucination. Hypnagogic jerk. </p>
<p>Edit: Source whatever neuroscience text we had in Medical School. </p>
<p>Also the converse: some people wake up and have feelings like they're paralyzed for a few seconds or longer. This is a hypnopompic hallucination. </p>
<p>The shiet they teach you in Medical School does come in use apparently. </p></div>		</li>
