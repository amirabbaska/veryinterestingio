			<p>For me it's not about &quot;things.&quot; It's about basics. I don't have any hobbies or interests and don't really enjoy anything. I couldn't really care less if I live an &quot;unexamined life,&quot; because you can't take any of it with you (and I'm an atheist, so I don't believe you rack up &quot;karma points&quot; for the boss level). I just want to be able to afford decent shelter and sustenance. Unfortunately, even that is beyond my reach because I have a history degree and am unwilling to split rent with roommates and/or get married and split incomes.<br><br>I don't really care about being &quot;successful&quot;; I just want to have the basics and not be homeless. That's all. Sadly, humanities majors who simply do not have the brain power required to do math are destined to be homeless and/or die. We're never going to be Denmark, in which case I should probably start planning my funeral now. :(</p>		</li>
