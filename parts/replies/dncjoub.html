<p>It's incredibly rare that a new treatment or prevention method comes out and cuts the mortality rate for a kind of cancer in half or more. More commonly, a new treatment will come out that cuts the mortality rate by, say, 2 percentage points. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to expand on this, a cancer is more of a symptom of a problem than a disease itself. It's what happens when some of the machinery in your cells is damaged to the point it can no longer keep the cells from growing in a uncontrolled manner. In that sense saying &quot;you have cancer&quot; is a lot like saying &quot;the car doesn't run,&quot; there could be any number of reasons why your car doesn't run, and a multitude of different ways to fix it. </p>
<p>Cancer drugs are a little like this, many of them only treat a certain type of cancer and are ineffective elsewhere. Just like replacing an o-ring can stop that coolant leak on your car, but won't make a difference if the line itself is damaged and leaking. Having a replacement o-ring is a big deal if that's the problem with your car, but probably only fixes a small percentage of the &quot;the car doesn't run&quot; problems in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  To people who always say &quot;Why can't they cure cancer?&quot; I point out &quot;Why can't they prevent all car accidents?&quot;.  Cancer is a class of illnesses.  If you find a car that skidded off the road there could be very many ways it could've gotten there.  It could've hit black ice, the driver was asleep, he was drunk, another driver forced him to swerve, the vehicle malfunctioned, etc.  There are not only many types of cancers but many possible types of cells and you are dealing with many possible reasons why it happened which we don't all understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I didn't specialize in oncology, but I learned enough to know that &quot;cancer&quot; is really several dozen, if not hundreds, of different diseases from a treatment standpoint. They just all happen to have uncontrolled cell division as a common symptom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Car accidents are in the &quot;how could this have been prevented&quot; scenario, though.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when people hear the term &quot;cancer&quot;, they interpret that to mean &quot;terminal illness that couldn't have been detected early enough to prevent it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fourth reason is that many of these &quot;breakthroughs&quot; are not actually very interesting within the field, and in some cases are just crap. They make the headlines because of splashy buzzwords that came about either because of an unscrupulous PR person or due to poor communication between scientists and PR people. It's not like all cancer researchers get together and say, &quot;ok this is the one that'll make it into headlines today!&quot; The PR side is very detached from what actual discussions happen in academia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the problem that those early result are often from research in mice, cell cultures etc. They do not necessary works in humans. The might not kill cancer in humans or they have side effect that make them not a viable treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard a few science reporters defending it over the years. And it has at least driven home what someone mentioned about lack of malicious intent. </p>
<p>That said, it's hard to take a stance that someone simply doesn't know any better when the end effect is a public getting their hopes up for the lives of loved ones. From what I've heard the biggest issue seems to simply come down to lack of a proper background in the subject. Someone graduating with a minor in the softest of soft sciences will have a better science background than the vast majority of science reporters. </p>
<p>But more than anything else it just seems difficult for science reporters to come at things from a scientific perspective. It simply doesn't fit into the usual methods by which their field operates. They want a story. And frankly, experimental results don't have much meat there. There's obviously tons when you get into motivations for someone to enter the field, their hopes and dreams, etc. But gathering and testing of data in and of itself is fairly incompatible with the way they feel reporting needs to be done.</p>
<p>I've heard a few science reporters defending the field. And more than anything it just made it clear that they quite literally couldn't wrap their mind around the reasons why experimental methodology exists in the current state. Or what it means when something can't fit into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that this is often not malicious -- a potential avenue for treatment can look very promising in animal models, but then prove ineffective in humans. &quot;Breakthroughs&quot; in medicine often fizzle past the early stages of research for this reason, and so you stop hearing about them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s another reason, and if you’re really interested the documentary/book “Emperor of all Maladies” is amazing.  Focuses on cancer but makes a lot of insights about science in general.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons is (and this is a sort of extension of number 3) that a lot of the breakthroughs were making in cancer are based on our analysis of the genetics of cancer.  And the thing is, we’re finding treatments that work on a certain mutation of a certain type of cancer, not on “cancer” in general(also, “cancer” is as much “a disease” as mammals are “an animal”, cancer is more a classification that describes thousands of wildly disparate conditions, that being the malignant mutation of a set of cells).  Even more importantly cancer isn’t really a disease so much as it’s a natural end state to all organisms.  The biggest reasons cancer rates are increasing is we’re living long enough to get it, and if you lived forever the chance you got cancer would probably approach 100%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer reminds us we are multicellular creatures that are composed of individual cells all forced to adhere to rigorous genetic rules, even to the point of dying on command, for the sake of the macro-organism.  Cancer is like those cells have abandoned that &quot;agreement&quot; and become like bacteria, forming their own colonies, spreading as much as possible, grabbing any resources they can get.  It is like they've plunged back in evolutionary time to their origins.</p></div>		</li>
