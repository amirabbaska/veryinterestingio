<p>A large part of the problem is the current precision of real time sensors, we can't see what's happening on a neuron by neuron basis in real time for either a human being or a bee; however, the technology is rapidly advancing, as well as the technologies granting us the ability to analyse the data.</p>

<p>I agree completely, and unless the question of what consciousness is gets answered, it will come down to personal beliefs on whether or not the emulated consciousness is as aware as a living human being.</p></div>		</li>
