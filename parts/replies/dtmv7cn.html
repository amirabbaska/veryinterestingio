<p>There's still no &quot;inbetween 10 ft line in which the land belongs to both states&quot; even in the case of a river. Either all of the river &quot;belongs&quot; to one state (in which case the line is at the bank) or half the river &quot;belongs&quot; to one state and half to the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 10 feet of land between states is known as &quot;International Waters&quot; where anything goes... or so the legend goes...</p>
<p>I knew a guy back in high school who drove his girlfriend out to the state's border. She dared him to slip into the crevice between the states (this 10 foot gap you're talking about). He did it and suddenly disappeared. As far as we know he is stuck between states. He slipped out of America.</p>
<p>As a sign of respect his girlfriend put up a grave market in the spot he disappeared. And every year she still goes to it and puts down about tree fiddy on the grave. Because that's the amount she bet him, well that... and she's a giant loch ness monster. The boy's mother tried to warn him about the &quot;girl&quot;, but he just didn't listen.</p>
<p>Tragic case if you ask me, truly tragic.</p></div>		</li>
