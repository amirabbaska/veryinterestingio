			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconding this. I'm in ok shape and ok weight, but I'm the sweatiest person around, and so is my whole family.  A few people much thinner and fitter than I sweat more, which is odd, but the majority of people my size and some bigger people I know sweat much less. Honestly it's getting to be a problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm half Philipino as well but I got the opposite half, which I'm not complaining for. As a girl I don't mind not sweating a lot lol. I've always had a seemingly higher tolerance for heat/cold than my sweaty/bundled up friends though, don't know if that's got anything to do with it too.</p></div>		</li>
