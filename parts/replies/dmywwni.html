			<div class="markdown"><p>If it provides a store of bacteria that already populates your gut and lives in symbiosis with you, why does a ruptured appendix cause so many health issues? Is it because the bacteria get into your blood stream when it ruptures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of bacteria in the gut is opportunistic. So inside the gut it lives in symbiosis. Outside of the gut it's a parasitic.</p>
<p>E. Coli and Salmonella can commonly be found in normal healthy people. When outside of the GI tract they can be detrimental to your health. Inside the GI the bacteria compete with each other and usually keep one another in check. </p>
<p>TL;dr you get really sick real fast and die from gut bacteria that normal keeps you healthy</p>
<p>I want you to understand that it's a lot bigger and broader but that's about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a better question would be, why does the appendix swell and rupture in the first place? If it's attached to the large intestine, and I rarely hear of anyone's large intestine randomly swelling and exploding, why does it have a tendency to do that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I was 18 when my appendix ruptured. I waited 7 days to go to the hospital. At the time i was under the impression that no insurance  = you just gotta die. </p>
<p>Essentially I went into sepsis and my white blood cell count kicked up to dangerous levels. Since they're larger than red and stick together more, i was in danger of several things from stroke, clots, and even a heart attack. My white cell count was hundreds of times the normal. </p>
<p>sepsis is extremely dangerous and insanely deadly. Without antibiotics i would surely be dead.</p>
<p>Funny anecdote: The day i went to the hospital i was placed into emergency surgery. one of the doctors from MAYO clinic was there that day to teach laproscopic procedures to med students.</p>
<p>The entire surgery took less than an hour. </p>
<p>I only have a scar less than 2 inches long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lumen (inside tube) of the intestines is designed to accommodate--and act symbiotically with--bacteria without allowing infiltration into the rest of your body.  This is accomplished in a few ways, including maintaining an uninterrupted membrane and via secretions that protect the surface of the lumen.</p>
<p>Most of your body is &quot;sterile&quot;, in the sense that normally no bacteria should be there.  If infected, there is little innate mechanism other than a full immune response to keep the bacteria from growing uncontrollably.  The bacteria may also secrete toxins that would not be a problem in the colon, or could at least be &quot;flushed out&quot; with a little diarrhea.</p>
<p>Infections in the blood stream or in a sterile body cavity may be  grave, causing <em>sepsis</em> which can lead to <em>shock</em>, meaning a lack of adequate blood/oxygen flow to organs like the brain, kidney, and heart.  One example of such an infection is <strong>peritonitis</strong>, the peritoneum being the fancy name for your abdominal cavity.  If bacteria spill out of the colon (including a ruptured appendix), they will enter the peritoneum and cause a terrible infection, often requiring surgery to wash it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a pathology assistant.  We kept all specimens for a few months then separated the tissue from the formalin (formaldehyde) and the tissue went for incineration.  The tissue in dumped together in a large biohazard trash bag.  All our fetal tissue was incinerated with the rest of the medical waste.  Out of the several hundred cases I personally handled involving fetal tissue, I only had one family request the tissue for burial.  Our lab wouldn't release any other specimen types.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is standard procedure or not, but when I got my appendix removed a few years ago it was biopsied. Apparently there was some gross gangrenous shit on the inside.</p></div>		</li>
