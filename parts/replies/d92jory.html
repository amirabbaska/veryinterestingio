<p>Like you said, DNS essentially translates the web address into the appropriate IP address, but if you know the IP address already, you can skip DNS and go straight there.</p>
<p>Realistically, you can't actually go some places, because as you said, most people don't speak internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ip address just tells you where which computer (server) is hosting the website.</p>
<p>The rest of the url is information for the computer (server) on what you're looking for.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>awebsite.com/index.html says &quot;get me index.html&quot;.</p>
<p>In fact the request your browser sends to the server is literally something like:
&quot;GET /index.html&quot;</p>
<p>You might have also seen stuff like awebsite.com/directory/?operation=search?color=blue&amp;model=Ford</p>
<p>The &quot;?operation=search?color=blue&amp;model=Ford&quot; portion is a way of sending some parameters for your request. Like &quot;I want a search with these options&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone else mentioned client-side auto-switching to another DNS, but why isn't there already some client-side program that holds the underlying IPs of the places you go? I feel like this isn't the first time this has happened. Why aren't we implementing a standard similar to what I described to avoid this in the future.</p>
<p>Somewhere the DNSs were compared to a phonebook. It would seem to me that this situation is roughly equivalent to everyone on a block having one copy of the phonebook and someone stealing it or dousing it with water. Why don't we each have our own copy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is. Your ISP caches DNS records in its local DNS server, your router does the same, and your OS and browser then have their own caches. Depending on the OS's, router's and ISP's setup, they can ask each other in turns instead of going directly to a DNS server in the web (in practice, the router and the ISP are sometimes skipped).</p>
<p>The problem is, DNS records have preset timeouts after which each of those links has to ask for the record again, and a stale record can't be served according to the standard (afaik). So when the cached record expires, all these downstream DNS resolvers lose it and have to go to Dyn which is down. The idea is sorta like &quot;maybe the record has changed in the meantime&quot; (again afaik), which is admittedly somewhat silly—but it comes down to a tradeoff between dynamic updates and reliable serving via caching. <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank">Cache invalidation is not trivial, after all</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The source code for one of these types of botnets, called Mirai, was recently released to the public, leading to speculation that more Mirai-based DDoS attacks might crop up. Dyn said on Friday evening that the security firmsFlashpoint and cloud services provider Akamai detected Mirai bots driving much, but not necessarily all, of the traffic in the attacks. Similarly, Dale Drew, the chief security officer of Internet backbone company Level 3, says that his company sees evidence of their involvement.</p>

<p>Since the source code just leaked, it could be anyone. I'm sure there will be more footprints found in the coming days though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've been answered a few times, but I think an important part has been left out. </p>
<p>Basically, a DDOS attack is the result of a bunch of computer &quot;zombies&quot; controlled by sometimes as little as one &quot;zombie lord&quot;. Referred to as bot nets, the zombies are just any PC infected with a hard to detect virus that waits for a signal from the zombie lord. Eventually when there are a sufficient amount of zombie PCs, the zombie lord sends the command to simply connect to some site or server. This is the &quot;hug of death&quot; that someone else said in a reply to your question. </p>
<p>Although, it may be better to refer to the &quot;zombies&quot; as sleeper agents. The PC owner usually has no idea their computer is infected, as for the most part the virus will not effect how the computer runs. So the &quot;bad people&quot; are for the most part unknowing and unwilling participants in the attack.</p>
<p>Edit: Source is I am currently at uni studying for a degree in IT with a focus on networking and security. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only partially correct. Most Distributed Denial of Service attacks actually come from 'the Internet of things'.</p>
<p>Usually mostly dumb devices that the user has no control over like camera systems and thermostats. There are of course home computer systems in botnets but they are high risk low reward since you can take over say a thermostat for forever and no one will really notice or even bother to look.</p>
<p>If your computer starts acting slow, or that particular infection gets caught by a major antivirus competitor all your work becomes naught.</p>
<p>We keep several infected devices running on a cox line at work specifically so we can receive the command and command signals and know what types of attacks to expect and pre-emptively mitigate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally in a distributed Dos it's not actually the bad guys computers who are doing the job.</p>
<p>Infected computers (own referred to as a bot net) are remotely activated by the bad guys. Helps with their own anonymity but the biggest reason is to distribute the attack.</p>
<p>When distributed the attack is normally stronger (greater numbers, often 10's of thousands). Also if you attacked from one location with a super computer with unlimited broadband it might be as strong as attack as the bot net. But if it's all coming from one place it's easier to block one computer from placing requests than half a million from all the countries of the world</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>appreciate your explanation.  forgive my limited knowledge, but when a controversial video gets taken down from [youtube/vimeo/etc] six mirror sites appear shortly thereafter; and when a person of notoriety attempts to remove embarrassing personal content from the internet they are reminded that everything lives forever...in fact popular culture almost scoffs at the ignorance of the individual. </p>
<p>so how is it that this data could be limited to the server side?  couldn't the network of client side machines support this data?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copies of videos appear because some, not too many, people knowingly decided to copy them. These people work on top of HTTP and WWW, implementing their own programs or downloading and uploading stuff by hand.</p>
<p>In contrast, DNS is an old standard that is used by dozens of programs on practically every internet-connected computer. To change anything in how DNS works, you have to get millions of people onboard and update thousands of programs while ensuring that no downtime happens during the migration—which means you have to support two infrastructures for quite some time, 'cause many people won't migrate for years if not decades (see IPv6).</p>
<p>There are certainly some attempts at designing a distributed version of DNS but it seems they're not sufficiently better than the current protocol to justify the migration.</p>
<p>Then again, some client-caching is already built-in in DNS: your ISP, router, OS and browser all cache records from upstream servers, and depending on the configuration, can ask each other in turn for the records. The trouble is, according to the DNS standard, once a cached records expires after a preset timeout, a stale copy can't be served (afaik) and they have to go to Dyn. The idea is sorta like &quot;maybe the record has changed in the meantime,&quot; which is admittedly somewhat silly—but it comes down to a tradeoff between dynamic updates and reliable serving via caching.</p></div>		</li>
