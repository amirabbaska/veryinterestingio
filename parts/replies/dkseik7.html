			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted, they don't drink water the way we do through their mouths and stomach. They also don't pee. They exchange water and liquid waste through their gills, along with oxygen and waste gasses. Their kidneys are extremely efficient at holding onto fresh water so that they actually intake very little water from their environment. Which is good, because the environment is constantly trying to draw <del>salt</del> typo: water out of their cells. Instead, they are thought to get most of their fresh water from their food which, like them, maintains a lower salinity in their tissues.</p>
<p>Marine mammals like dolphins do not drink seawater at all. They get all their water from their food.</p>
<p>I don't know how sharks and crocs do it, but I imagine it's similar. Their digestive system filters out as much salt as possible, keep the water, and their kidneys hold onto the water as hard as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bony fish drink a shitload of water. Therefore the water they consume while eating food is digested just like water when they drink it. </p>
<p>It's no different than chewing food and taking a drink of water to help swallow it.</p></div>		</li>
