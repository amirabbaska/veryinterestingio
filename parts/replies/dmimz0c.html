<p>He said that sometimes when the radar went down, if things were really urgent, instead of checking to see that each tube was properly seated they would simply pull out each rack of tubes a few inches and slam it back in.  Jostled all of the tubes at once and hopefully seated any that were not seated properly and got things working again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. When I was a kid, once a month we would go to the rich neighborhood and take the tv's or radios that were on the curb for the trashman. Open the back and plug them in. The tube that didn't light up we would take to the local hobby shop for a replacement. It fixed it most of the time. Then sold them. It covered the cost of the part and made us a little money. It was also a fun hobby when we were 12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with solid state electronics what you described still applies.  For example, on my old Dodge Neon, the instrument cluster would die randomly.  It was because of cracked solder joints on the circuit board.  If you whacked the dash right above the cluster, it would briefly come back to life.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, came here to see if anyone had mentioned dry joints on a pcb, you are the first.
It absolutely fixes old tv sets in many cases.</p></div>		</li>
