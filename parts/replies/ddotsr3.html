			<div class="markdown"><p>As a law student and armchair historian, I'm almost sure it has more to do with the latter. Neither Britain nor Ireland had a national park scheme as early or as extensive as in the United States. A lot of the national parks (and indeed heritage sites) in Britain were eventually donated or willed to the state by the aristocracy. However, in Ireland, the sad reality is that we just had less spaces worth preserving (if that makes any sense). Ireland is much smaller and flatter than Britain, and much of the land that could be cultivated was. Many of our national parks are in places where it would be difficult or impossible to farm (the Burren and Wicklow Mountains national parks spring to mind). Some estates and parks were given to the state post-independence as the old Anglo-Irish aristocracy emigrated or died off (e.g. Marley Park) but nothing on the scale of Britain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_forest" target="_blank">Royal forests</a> explain a lot of England's current parks. &quot;A royal forest is an area of land with different definitions in England, Wales, and Scotland. The term forest in the ordinary modern understanding refers to an area of wooded land; however, the original medieval sense was closer to the modern idea of a &quot;preserve&quot; — i.e. land legally set aside for specific purposes such as royal hunting — with less emphasis on its composition.&quot;</p>
<p>As to why Ireland doesn't have many I feel constant infighting over land use during the modern era. However, there is a proposal to make Ireland's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourne_Mountains#Possible_national_park_status" target="_blank">first park</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even where I was brought up - inner city London, UK-wide shorthand for brutal, concreted urban ghetto - was in fairly recent history marshes. They still exist in placenames (Lower Marsh, Moorlands Estate) and is one of the reasons I love it so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question, and one I don't really have an answer for. Someone else here corrected me and said it was the Belgae who cleared them, but I'm not sure if they would have had the technology to do so. I have more knowledge of Irish history and geography than British so I don't really know the particulars, just that GB was once covered in marshes and they were pretty much all cleared up by the end of the medieval period AFAIK.</p></div>		</li>
