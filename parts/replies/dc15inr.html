			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it.  Reverse engineering isn't just about being able to replicate someone else's design, it's also about <strong>understanding</strong> their design and the reason for it.  Once you understand how everything goes together and why it was designed that way you have learned far more than just how to make a clone/carbon copy.</p>
<p>Companies don't reverse engineer products to make a simple clone of a competitor's product.  By the time that you can buy and reverse engineer something, then design your own version and get it to market the chances are good that your competitor has moved on to something else.  But if you do it correctly, reverse-engineering can teach you techniques about how to create systems and functionality, and knowing those techniques can allow you to make a better product in the future.</p>
<p>For example, when Acura was designing their NSX they did some reverse engineering of the Porsche 911 GT3 and the McLaren MP4-12C.  It wasn't because they wanted to make a clone of either car, but because they wanted to understand how certain aspects of those cars worked and use that knowledge to design their own solutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the house is a bad example of difficulty. Elsewhere here, a cake is a better example of how difficult it could be. In my career I do a lot of reverse engineering and it's mostly because we are actually using someone else's widget and they won't tell us the specifications. This is also a very important part of hacking (modifying) anything. I'd wager more reverse engineering is done in that vein than anyone trying to make their own.</p></div>		</li>
