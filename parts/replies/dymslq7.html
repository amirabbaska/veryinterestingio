			<div class="markdown"><p>I donâ€™t think they gained all that firepower overnight.</p>
<p>It was probably the means to produce that firepower that Hitler wanted so badly in Czechoslovakia. So when he invaded he simply converted factories that might have manufactured radios and made them manufacture bullets, or guns. Czechoslovakia probably could have fought back, if they were given a reasonable notice of the invasion and were able to mobilize. But at the urging of France and Poland, they surrendered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was actually overnight, the means to produce those weapons was definitely one goal of occupation, but according to German field marshals, when they captured the front trench lines of Czech territory, the Czech line was well defended with literally millions of machine guns and artillery, the Germans did not think they could take these lines without losing most of their military strength. If the Czech had fought, the Germans would have been crippled from the very beginning. </p></div>		</li>

<li>Czechoslovakia had extensive border fortifications, but they weren't all fully finished and invasion ready. In some parts of the country, namely Southern Bohemia, only very basic light forts and bunkers had been constructed. Most of the actual invasion-stopping ultra heavy forts and infrastructure had not been finished by 1938.</li>
<li>Even if the fortifications had been finished, there is one thing Czechoslovakia severely lacked - a proper airforce. Czechoslovakia relied on France for most of its air arsenal, and only had some slightly outdated biplane bombers and fighters ready to fight.</li>
<li>Even if Czechoslovakia had all of those things, there is nothing they could to with the way the things turned out. In the Munich Agreement, to which the Czechoslovak government wasn't even invited, almost all of the Bohemian and Moravian borderlands have been given over under Germany's control by France and Britain under the impression that the Reich's expansion would stop there. By doing that, Czechoslovakia lost practically all of its natural defenses, as the country's borders on the Czech side were mainly defined by mountain ranges right at the border. As a result, Czechoslovakia suddenly lost all of its fortifications and major defensive barriers.</li>
<li>To add insult to injury, the Sudetendeutsche Partei, an anti-Czechoslovak nazi german political party in the Sudetenland had been smuggling weapons in from Germany for a violent insurrection. Sabotage wasn't out of the list either. Even if Czechoslovaks got their military support from France and the USSR  (which was unallowed to pass through Poland, making the alliance ineffective), the Czechoslovak army would still have to deal with armed rebels from within.</li>

<p>No it was not. It was a decent interwar tank that was outclassed early in the war. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it was the best German light tank.  It was better than the Panzer II in every category, 42 km/h vs 40, 250km fuel range vs 190km, 30mm in early version armour plating and 50mm in later models, vs 15mm for Panzer II, and carried a 37mm gun vs 20mm for Panzer II</p>
<p>For the early model Panzer III, it only had 15mm of armour (later upgraded to 30mm), a weaker 37mm gun (in terms of armour penetration) than the Panzer 38 (t) and was slower and less fuel range</p></div>		</li>
