<p>I'm not sure if the lander has the lenses but that is how it works on other space craft. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure this is the main reason why the landing images are grayscale only.  With the large amount of motion, the multiple exposures needed to sample color would not match up when combined.  Operating without a filter also means that all available light is used, and exposure times can be shorter with less motion blur.  If the only issue were bandwidth they could just store the color version to be sent later.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>You're definitely right. Looking at the images at the top of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29482548" target="_blank">this page</a> means that Philae would be smaller than a pixel.</p></div>		</li>
