			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unintuitive things can happen with the temperatures in diffuse interstellar environments due to specific effects which cause cooling to be inefficient. That is to say, the warmer components of the ISM are warm because those are the only temperatures for which a thermal equilibrium exists due to oddities of the microphysics of the system.  This is a weird effect that took me a while to wrap my brain around.  (Nebulae are usually not very warm unless they're being created by stars/star formation though - generally denser things can cool more efficiently.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Any &quot;simple&quot; example you could give?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'll give you an example:</p>
<p>in the ICM, or intra-cluster medium, which is the gasses between galaxies, the average density is 1-2 orders of magnitudes lower than the ISM.  However the average temperature of the gas can get up to 0.1-10KeV, which translates to 10-100 million K, much higher than the ISM.</p>
<p>so why/how does the gas get that hot, and why are higher density gas like the ISM cooler?  so imagine a supernova occurs, and it ejects one particular particle of gas at extremely high speed, and it happens to escape the galaxy without bumping into anything along the way.  now the particle is in intergalactic space where the average density is much lower, which means it's even less likely to bump into anything else.  so by the law of inertia, that particle will keep its energy forever.  so when you have a bunch of these high energy gas particles, the average temperature of the system of gas is how they are so hot.</p>
<p>so only a small number of particles get the chance to escape the galaxy from the supernova, because when you have a higher density environment such as the ISM, most of the ejected particles hit other stuff.  there are a number of different types of scattering events that could occur when an ejected particle interacts with the ISM, these interactions we detect because accelerating charged particles give off radiation.  this is how we measure how hot the ISM and ICM is.</p>
<p>for gasses in the ICM, direct collisions are <em>super</em> rare, so it's hard for the particles to lose energy.  most of the collisions are electromagnetic interactions when two particles whiz by each other and alter each others trajectory, radiating x-rays in the process called thermal bremstrahlung.  and by radiating away x-rays, some kinetic energy is lost by the particles in the process.  the ICM reaches an equilibrium of cooling via this process and reheating by supernovae and AGN's.</p>
<p>in general, you have to carefully consider the different cooling mechanisms available to the particles in different regimes, higher density means there invariably going to be more interaction, and thus more methods of cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really that I can think of, I'm afraid. Essentially the problem comes down to the efficiency of cooling processes - if something can't radiate heat as rapidly as it gains it, it will heat up endlessly until it's in a state where that's no longer true.  This happens to be true for a big enough range of temperatures and pressures for diffuse gas that you can end up with very hot gas.</p>
<p>What you want to do is go read up on heating and cooling in the multiphase ISM.  If you have some physics background you should be able to parse what Google will give you, it's just not something I can illustrate with a two sentence example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of the particles, not necessarily how it feels. So the temperature can be high but if you could stick your hand in it it wouldn't feel that way because there simply isn't much stuff there to transfer the energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would you expect a large object to slowly increase in temperature as the diffuse material slowly transfers incredibly small amounts of energy to it over a long period of time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, I don't know for sure. I would guess though that it would radiate it away at least as fast as it absorbed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the diffuse material is transparent to radiation, so a large dense object will see a miniscule and insignificant trickle of incoming radiation from the hot but very weakly radiating gas around it, while the dense object with many interactions between it's component particles strongly and efficiently radiates it's internal thermal energy into the void of space, with that radiation just passing right through the hot transparent gas around it without interacting with it significantly.  </p>
<p>The result is that if you have, say, a bowling ball sitting in intergalactic space surrounded by sparse million degree gas, the bowling ball will fairly quickly cool down to the 2.7K temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation and on the rare occasions when a particle of the hot gas around it hits it and deposits energy into the bowling ball or zaps it with an x-ray, the energy is lost again almost straight away, or at least on a timescale that is much shorter than the timescale between these packets of energy being deposited in the ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another definition of temperature (there are kind of a lot in thermo) is that if energy gradually moves from one object to another, the first one is hotter. When two objects stop exchanging heat, then they are in thermal equilibrium and have the same temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that’s so weird.  </p>
<p>For example the intergalactic medium contains something like half the total baryons in the universe and it’s damn hot like a million degrees hot.   </p>
<p>But because it’s like one very kinetic proton here and 4 AU later another proton it wouldn’t actually feel hot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really that different to when you pull a pan out of the oven and grab the corner if the aluminum foil with your fingers. That foil is 375° but it doesn't burn you because the mass is so low. The temperature is high but it's still a small amount of total energy and your skin easily absorbs it.</p></div>		</li>
