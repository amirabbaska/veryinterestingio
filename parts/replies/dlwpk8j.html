<p>I was told once that some of these are lightning rods, which I can't speak to except that there's definitely pictures of them being struck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A well designed spire should certainly have a lightning rod (or many, depending on how large the spire is), but the spire itself is nowhere near pointy enough.  A functional lightning rod would have to be too thin to be visible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So in <a href="http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/72581558_1280x720.jpg" target="_blank">pictures like this</a> presumably there's a smaller actual rod near to (/on?) the actual spire?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't something that thin be too fragile to support itself against strong winds or lightning strikes? Also trees are pointy enough to act as lightning rods so a metal spire should have no problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proper lightning protection is more than just a single spire. A network of aluminum rods scattered on perimeter of roof and on any structures like HVAC or water towers. Each rod is connected to the others by braided aluminum, and the cable goes down the walls to stakes driven deep into the ground. Also in some spots, the network ties to building steel, the iron skeleton that forms &quot;ground&quot; for most of the electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Edit. Autocorrect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Architects were vying to hold the title of &quot;worlds tallest building&quot;. What easier way to do that than to stick 180 feet of nothing on top of it, reaching for the sky.</p>

<p>Especially when you can hide it in your building and then trot it out after your competitor finished his.</p></div>		</li>

[99pi did a great podcast on the topic.] (<a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/higher-and-higher/" target="_blank">http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/higher-and-higher/</a>) Two architects who were former partners were competing for the tallest tower.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Van Alen had the 185-foot spire secretly constructed inside the building and on Oct. 23, 1929, the vertex emerged from the building’s core, “like a butterfly from its cocoon.” With that, the Chrysler Building became the tallest building in the world.&quot;</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spires don't usually count towards the &quot;official&quot; height of a building.
There are three measurements to determine the height. Highest occupied floor, Architectural, which includes spires, and height to tip, which also includes antennae. </p>
<p>For most accounts, highest occupied floor is used to determine which of two buildings is taller. </p></div>		</li>
