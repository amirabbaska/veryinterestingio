<p>Is it attempted murder?  Well, no, technically, it's not, but I for one would kick the shit out of someone for doing it.</p>
<p>Let's not put make-up on a turd...  North Korea fired a weapon into Japan's airspace.  Armed or not, aimed at people or not, it's a weapon, and it was fired at another Country.   One would hope world leaders wouldn't just go shooting at other Countries just to show off and/or get attention.  The issue isn't that Japan might declare it an agression, the issue is that Kim Jong Ass is an immature, posturing, spoiled ass brat that isn't fit to lead a damned thing...  You don't shoot weapons at other Countries.  You just fucking don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that Japan literally can't declare war. It's in their constitution. And sure, since 1945, the US hasn't declared war either, though the UN essentially makes unilateral war declarations illegal.</p>
<p>This is a funny little mess we find ourselves in after trying to make sure not to declare war on each other ever again. We didn't deal with the maniac when we had the chance to in 1953 because it would piss off the nuclear-powered USSR, who was backing communist China, even though the latter lacked a UN seat (it was Taiwan's until 1971). Then China got nukes, we let them take Taiwan's UNSC permanent seat, and it's been snowballing since then as the Korean War never technically ended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, IIRC, we're still technically at war with North Korea. The US never <em>un</em>declared war after the Korean War wrapped up, so we've technically been at war for the past few decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>North Korea has fired artillery into South Korea, killing civilians. They've kidnapped people, assassinated people. They've done much worse than fire a missile hundreds of kilometres above part of another country.</p>
<p>Russia has shot down civilian aircraft flying over other countries more than once, killing hundreds, and war wasn't declared on them either.</p>
<p>Acts of war are only acts of war if you want to go to war. We don't want to go to war unless they actually do serious damage. What &quot;serious&quot; damage is depends on how willing Russia or China would be to defend against it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as simple as that. Airspace doesn't extend infinitely above a nation's position on earth - that would be silly, since otherwise satellites would require permission from each country they fly over. The rocket that North Korea fired went well above Japanese airspace.</p>
<p>So it's more like firing a blank up in the sky at an angle, not pointed at anyone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Declaring war is a very serious move, and one would hope world leaders would try to exhaust all avenues of remedy before taking that step.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More than one nation, guaranteed, had a good read on the trajectory, velocity and probable range and destination, pretty fast.  This is within our grasp, probably within Japan's and SK's too.  I'm sure China and Russia were watching too, and they are highly capable.</p>
<p>As to armed or not, that I don't know.  Perhaps they have to assumed it is armed, but in keeping an eye on it, they have a good read on potential consequences.  Again, nations are not quick to call war at the drop of a hat.  It's a historical, dire and world-shaking move, with historical consequences.  It is not done lightly or as a knee jerk reaction (one hopes).</p></div>		</li>
