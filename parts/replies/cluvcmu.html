<p>&quot;Why do we focus so much on preservation of a species that just... doesn't want to live anymore?&quot; Yes, humans took over and pushed their numbers down, but, other than being cute and furry, what's so important about Pandas that we are making all of this effort to keep their species alive?</p>
<p>Is not like they're predators like Tigers; how important is Panda interaction with Bamboo and the ecology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answer is: We don't know. We simply haven't got the data or predictive analysis skills to know how important Panda (or any other organism) are to a huge range of immediate or related environments. A lot of species are being driven to extinction for lots of reasons and we are doing our best to keep as many as possible, just in case. It's a bit hard to 'un-extinct' something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading this article about the megafauna, (mammoths, giant sloths and the like) that used to live in North America. It talked about Dogwood trees and how they have changed since those species disappeared.</p>
<p>Dogwoods apparently grow in wetlands, because their seed pods are so thick shelled that if they fall on dry ground they just sit and eventually rot. Water helps soften the shell so animals can come along and be able to chew through, eat the seeds and disperse them. </p>
<p>Back in the day, all those larger animals were strong enough to chew through the hard shells of the seeds so it wasn't an issue. Long story short, dogwoods likely grew in drier areas back then. Today, looking at the ecosystem we have no idea what the actual natural behavior of some of these species originally was while coexisting with the species they evolved alongside. All we see are the ones who have managed to adapt. </p>
<p>By the same token, when panda are all gone everything else in their habitat will have to change too.</p>
<p>I couldn't find the article in a quick Google search but I found this one, which touches on some similar stuff:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, regardless if there is or is not an ecological importance for pandas(which there probably isn't), if people are willing to dedicate time to their preservation, then power to them.  There isn't really a reason to avoid preservation, especially when people have the willpower to do it, and the panda's definitely benefit from it.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well that's honestly a myth. The only reason Giant Pandas were so hard to breed in captivity is because zoos didn't provide enough communication opportunities between males and females. Luckily today the vast majority of pandas in Chengdu's Research Base <strong>successfully copulate annually</strong> because they allowed for such interaction. (Artificial insemination is performed only to compound the population numbers)

<p>And while reddit seems to love endangered red pandas even more, note that red pandas are the same in many lifestyle respects. Red pandas digest bamboo so poorly that they have to spend 13 hours a day eating bamboo as a result. Not to mention red pandas have a slow metabolic rate to conserve energy. Similarly red pandas are only in estrus once a year too. Worse, they're receptive for only 24 hours. And half of red pandas newborns die in the first month.</p>
<p>The reality is that the Giant panda's adaptive potential extends way beyond the infamous Jim Jeffries &quot;pandas won't fark to save its own species&quot; standup routine that perpetuated across the reddit echo-chamber despite its dated assessment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They mate fine in the wild. They just don't deal with captivity that well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking to a zookeeper at the Cincinnati Zoo, where I think they have a relatively successful program and apparently red pandas are very tricky to breed.  One of the females at the time came from another zoo and she was a couple of pounds overweight and it really affected her fertility.  She was also getting older, so it was more than likely that if they dealt with the weight issue, she would be too old to conceive.  This was a few years ago, but I don't think they've had any successful births since then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like everything in nature, there develops an ecology from every organism. Look at the sloths, creatures that do absolutely nothing for 99% of their lives have complex fungi and organisms in their fur that could have potential uses. We can't just write off species because they seem to have no effect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, we can't just write off species [or insert concept here] simply because it seems to &quot;have no value.&quot; </p>
<p>So much of what humans priorities is currently centered around &quot;economic value&quot;, especially in a capitalistic sense. This is a very dangerous way to make decisions as we are starting to see - human caused global deforestation, depletion of rare non-renewable minerals, ocean acidification and pollution.</p></div>		</li>
