			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem :) I used to always get so God damn frustrated even in my programming classes (even dropped out of one school due to this reason) because a lot of people assume that just because you are interested in the subject, you already have a certain amount of background knowledge on the subject. They don't want to start to explain from the beginning. I can go into some more analogies for other security features, flaws etc if you are interested too. :) </p></div>		</li>
