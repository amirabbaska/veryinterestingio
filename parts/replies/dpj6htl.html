			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting aspect is that deflecting particles will generate additional EM radiation. Breaking accelerated electrons is essentially how a X-Ray tube works. Also particle accelerators are used as very powerful X-Ray sources by directing the high intensity particle beam into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undulator" target="_blank">undulator</a> (essentially a varying magnetic field). Such X-Ray sources are strong enough to vaporize pretty much any sample placed in their path.</p>
<p>So by just deflecting high energy particles you might still get a rather substantial amount of high energy radiation to deal with that was generated from the deflection in addition to any other EM radiation already present.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for clarifying, I have been doing science for a while now and know that photons and magnetic fields don't interact (they are absorbed by matter) and was extremely sceptical reading online when people &quot;smarter&quot; than me said that some EM radiation was deflected by the magnetic field. I try not to be gullible whilst foreging for information on the web.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I can tell, solar wind and cosmic rays are almost entirely massive, charged particles. So you are correct that a magnetic field will not stop a gamma ray, but high energy photons are not of primary concern. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_threat_from_cosmic_rays" target="_blank">source</a></p></div>		</li>
