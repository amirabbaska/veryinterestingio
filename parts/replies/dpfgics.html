<p>You can Google &quot;super massive stars&quot; and find some other articles, but the term can also mean stars over 100 masses and not the early behemoths. &quot;Direct Collapse black hole&quot; is the best bet. Here is a better article on the subject:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was this because the original, progenitor stars were zero-metallicity and just largely composed of hydrogen and some helium?</p>
<p>I think I remember reading that it takes a lot more pure hydrogen to collapse into a star than when there are metals involved, so the original stars were much larger and short-lived. </p>
<p>EDIT: Just read further down and it seems that this has been mostly verified. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but another factor is the overall universe was smaller so the density is greater allowing larger mass stars to form. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The early universe may have has small earth mass black holes the size of marbles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of anything of the sort, can I get a source on that? Currently the limit seems to be around 150 solar masses. I've read that in the past stars could maybe have gotten as large as 300 solar masses but that's about it. From a different perspective, a star with one solar mass has a lifetime of about 10 billion years. Stars that are much more massive have much shorter life spans. By the time they're at 100 solar masses it's more like 10 million years. I don't imagine the above-referenced 300 solar mass star would live more than a few hundred thousand years. I think a star with 100,000 solar masses would be a few thousand years at most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the current limit is thought to be 150 solar masses, some stars are over that limit due to merger.  Here is an article:</p>

<p>You are correct that they would either go nova or direct collapse in a matter of a few thousand years, which would make their detection nigh impossible.</p>

<p>Hydrogen fusion should continue for another million years or so.</p>
<p>Because of its mass, formation of a black hole is inevitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey old friend! Just wanted to add onto a tidbit you put here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it looks like galaxies collide with each other all the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only is this a super-cool fact, but it's even cooler to know that <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/319167/meta" target="_blank">this has happened with our own Milky Way</a>, and probably plenty of times! In addition to Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy merger, there are many globular clusters that we believe to be cores of past galaxies that collided with the Milky Way. Stars are littered throughout our galaxy that were actually formed in an <em>entirely different galaxy.</em> That's just awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So.... During galaxy mergers, do planets/moons just collide with each other or are they just so far apart that it's like intertwining fingers? Or a mixture of both I'm assuming?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is possible for objects to collide. It would be very rare. Even just think of our solar system and the ratio of space to matter. Then think about the space between stars. Stars coming too close to each other can disrupt planetary orbits and even send planets off on escape trajectories. </p></div>		</li>
