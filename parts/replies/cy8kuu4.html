			<div class="markdown"><p>All sound is, is a pressure wave in air. It's most likely the air being moved by the tread as the tire rotates. Anecdotally, I've noticed big, knobbly mud tires are loud as hell, whereas smoother, smaller tires tend to be quieter. It could also be that the sidewall deflecting out as the tire rolls contributes to the noise, but I'm not sure. </p>
<p>Tires squealing around a corner is a result of the tire momentarily losing traction and regaining it, essentially flapping side to side. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I've done some googling, and it seems it's a compounding of factors. The primary originator of sound is air getting squished inside the tread grooves that is released once the tire rolls past it. This causes the tire to vibrate and, since it's a taught rubber thing, it acts like a drum, in much the same way that tapping a balloon is louder than just a tap. These sound waves also hit the wheel, which transfers the vibrations to the mechanical components of the suspension, and then to the car. This is why you hear that duh-duh  duh-duh sound when you go over a bridge.</p>
<p>Some tire manufacturers are designing the shape of the tread blocks specifically to reduce sound generated by rolling, and in some of Pirelli's tires a strip of urethane foam is glued inside the tire to absorb some of the noise bouncing around inside the tire.</p>

<p>tl;dr tread makes noise, tire amplifies it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the noise tread makes, it's basically the rubber slapping against the road. I'd imagine it's  not much different for the rest of the tyre noise on roads that aren't  dead smooth. Anecdotally bicycles are quieter on smooth concrete.</p>
<p>There's  also an element of just pushing a thing through the air as the top of the tyre is moving twice as fast as the vehicle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of interesting because when I'm in my car I don't sense tire noise as being that load, but open the windows at night and you can hear them from a mile away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's a decent amount of traffic on the highway, the sound source transforms from a point source to a cylinder source, and the decay in sound energy in relation to distance for a point source is quadratic of the distance, vs linear for a cylinder, and that's why you can hear highways from so far.</p></div>		</li>
