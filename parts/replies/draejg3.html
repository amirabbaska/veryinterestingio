			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabies has an interesting mind control characteristic.  <a href="https://youtu.be/OtiytblJzQc" target="_blank">Rabies makes you afraid of drinking water</a>.  The rabies virus is transmitted through saliva. If you were able to drink water then the viral count present in saliva would be diluted and the virus would have a harder time of spreading.  So what does the virus do?  It specifically affects the neural groups in your brain and brain stem responsible for generating rhythmic muscle contractions necessary for chewing and swallowing.  The infected neural cells can no longer send signals so attempting to chew or swallow results in painful muscle spasms as the infected cells spout off corrupted signals to the muscles.  Being unable to drink water, the number of viral particles is able to become highly concentrated in the saliva, so transmission is facilitated.</p></div>		</li>
