			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, species accumulation curves are not very helpful for estimating global species richness. This is because we are nowhere near the 'flat part' of the curve that you mention. If you examined the species accumulation curve for all described species, it would look like a positive exponential function. There is no method for estimating the asymptote of a function like this.</p></div>		</li>
