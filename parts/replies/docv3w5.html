			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand it is in both at once, but also understand that it can be measured in the well before it is measured outside.</p>
<p>What I'm wondering, again assume 1 light second barrier, is whether the particle can be measured outside the barrier in less than one second after it was last measured in the well.</p>
<p>So in short, does measuring a particle constrain its future measurements within it's previous measurement's light cone </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, measuring a particule constraints the future. </p>
<p>As an approximation, when the particle is not yet measured, it is in a 'quantum superposition of states', and the action of measuring 'force' the particle to 'choose' a state. And if you measure again, the result will be the same, you've destroyed the quantum state and are now in a classical state.</p>
<p>But in truth, it is even worse than that, since rules of quantum mechanics say that you cannot know with precision both the position and the speed of a particle. So if you find a way to measure the speed, the act of measuring it will mess up with the position and you will no longer know where the particle is.</p>
<p>The whole problem of quantum physics is that it is impossible to measure things without interfering. You cannot say &quot;I measure its position now, and I measure it in 5s, and I will be able to deduce it's average speed&quot; because the act of doing the first measurement will mess up everything and you will not be able to make a second measurement that has a meaning.</p></div>		</li>
