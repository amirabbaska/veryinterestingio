			<div class="markdown"><p>Colorado/Washington and soon Oregon/Alaska didn't just say that they won't use state resources to enforce the law. They voted to legalize personal possession and use of cannabis and regulate it like alcohol and tobacco; they're taking active steps to deal with the introduction of cannabis into their state's legal codes, not just looking the other way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, and this doesn't matter.</p>
<p>In general, federal and state law are seperate. The states cannot command the federal government to make laws the states want, and the federal government cannot command the state government to make the laws the federal government wants.</p>
<p>There are two basic exceptions to this.</p>
<p>(a) one exception is the case where the states pass a law which violates the federal constitution. that's what happened with SSM: the federal courts say the constitution was violated. But - there's no equivalent line of reasoning in the marijuana cases; there's no constitutional right being infringed by the sttes.</p>
<p>(b) another exception is when Congress has &quot;pre-empted&quot; the field, either explicitly or implicitly. EVEN IN THAT CASE, though, Congress cannot compel the states to adopt particular laws - all that happens is the state's law is ruled inoperable by the courts.</p>
<p>The courts have not ruled that Congress has field pre-empted drug legislation, and I think it would be really difficult for them to do so given the history of drug laws (most enforcement has <em>always</em> been done at the state level). They could <em>possibly</em> explicitly pre-empt, but I don't see that law passing out of Congress, and until it does, the courts can't invalidate the state laws on the grounds of pre-emption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other case, when Federal Law comes up against the 10th Amendment and ends up being ruled Unconstitutional.  It is a useful check to federal power, but it is really rare to see the Supreme Court rule in that manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about something like the drinking age where states could lower it to 18, but they would lose federal funding for roads or education? (correct whatever errors are in that). Why doesn't the federal government require all states to have the same laws regarding weed for fear of losing federal funding? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that congress can compel states to adopt certain laws, by way of refusing funding if states don't change their laws. Like what happened with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act" target="_blank">National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but if the DEA decides they want to prosecute people for simple possession in Colorado, they can. The state isn't allowed to try to stop them. They don't have to let them use state police, prosecutors, courts, or any other state resource, but they can't stop them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe because the there's little to no reason why weed is prohibited other than propaganda and corporate appeasement.</p>
<p>Up until 1937, weed was freely grown and sold in the U.S.  It had recognized medicinal benefits and even had some medicinal exceptions in the early years of Prohibition.  <em>Until</em> they started spreading propaganda that black jazz singers will use marijuana to steal white women with &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;, a term coined from the 1937 film of the same name.  The film is commonly used nowadays to point out the misinformation and lies used to convince the 1930s American public to accept Prohibition and it's wild overreach of law into stealing people's birth rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Hell, two of our most recognized founders, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, grew large plots of the valuable and versatile hemp crop.  They obviously didn't see the plant as a threat to the American way of life and one of them <em>drafted</em> the U.S. Constitution.  It's not like saying &quot;they couldn't predict the internet/automobiles.&quot;  Marijuana had been around for ages.</p>
<p>There's only &quot;no constitutional right&quot; to marijuana because of the powers that be who are fighting a movement by the majority of the people to stop jailing and prosecuting non-violent offenders, ruining lives based on a draconian law that makes zero sense and keeps potent, cheap medicinal alternatives away from people who aren't being treated effectively by expensive, harmful pharmaceuticals.  It's clearly a modern-day example of how much our politicians in the 20th-21st century have bastardized our perception of our constitutional rights to serve their corporate interests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, states can do the same thing with marriage that they do with marijuana: they can get out of the game entirely if they stop issuing marriage licenses completely. A few counties have already done this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And soon people who live there will start complaining that legalizing gay marriage has ruined regular marriage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is because they are just throwing revenue from the marriage licenses away while the people who want to get married just go the next county / state over for the license &amp; the morons in the 1st county / state still have to acknowledge the marriage regardless.  They are only going to affect the very poorest citizens in their area, the ones that can't afford a short trip out of the area for a marriage license.  A lot of homosexual couples are DINKS (dual income, no kids), &amp; to them, this would just be a very minor inconvenience.</p></div>		</li>
