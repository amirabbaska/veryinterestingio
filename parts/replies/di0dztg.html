			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, thank you! So, for a fixed radius aperture, it's a (relatively) simple (g earth/g target)^(-1/2) Time multiplier. I would be curious to know how far the target g could increase before hitting a terminal limit, but there may not be a good way to determine that, other than experimentally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the way the setup reads it seems like the assumptions about the variables may begin to break down when approaching terminal speeds. Eventually it doesn't matter how small your particle is and how big your hole is, they're eventually going to be trying to move fast enough to bottleneck it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what would help with this is figuring out exactly what is meant by &quot;large&quot;. Is it a pure numbers comparison, where the H can be just 1 unit larger than D and still properly work, or is there a ratio that H:D has to be over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Describing a parameter <em>ϵ</em> as small (equivalently, describing 1/<em>ϵ</em> as large) is not a precise description. It does not mean &quot;as long as <em>ϵ</em> in this specific range&quot;. It means that <em>ϵ</em> is small enough so that the approximation is valid to the desired accuracy. That's it. It may seem like a tautology but it's not.</p>
<p>More generally, we may have some function <em>f</em> that depends on some vector of variables <strong>x</strong> and some parameter ϵ, so that <em>f</em> = <em>f</em>(<strong>x</strong>, ϵ). If ϵ is meant to be a small parameter, we can find an asymptotic expansion (not necessarily a Taylor expansion!) of <em>f</em> in powers of ϵ. That is, <em>f</em>(<strong>x</strong>, ϵ) = *f<strong><em>0</em><em>(<strong>x</strong>) + </em>f</strong><em>1</em><em>(<strong>x</strong>)ϵ + higher-order terms. (Note that the expansion may not be a power series in ϵ. It may be a power series in ϵ^(1/2) or ϵ^(2/3) or contain terms with negative powers of ϵ.) So when we say &quot;ϵ is small&quot;, we mean that the first few terms of this expansion are sufficient to approximate </em>f* with the desired accuracy. Typically, we just look at the expansion up to the first non-trivial term.</p>
<p>This is a standard construction of applied mathematics.</p>
<hr />
<p>For this problem though, the length scales don't matter when it comes to determining how the flow rate depends on the local gravity. If the flow rate <em>Q</em> is some function <em>Q</em> = <em>Q</em>(<em>g</em>, D, H, r, a), then by dimensional analysis, the flow rate must have the form</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Q</em> = <em>g</em>^(1/2)r^(5/2)<em>f</em>(D, H, r, a)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>f</em> is some <em>dimensionless</em> function of the length parameters. (In particular, <em>f</em> must be a function only of the ratios of those lengths.) In the language of what I described above, we would say that the lowest-order term of <em>f</em>, when expanded asymptotically in terms of the small parameters D/H and a/r, is simply a dimensionless constant.</p>
<p>But the important property here is that the assumptions on the relative sizes of the length scales don't affect the <em>g</em>^(1/2)-dependence of the flow rate. So quadrupling the local gravity should always double the flow rate (and thus halve the time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the hourglass is a lot taller than it is wide, and the hole is a lot bigger than the sand grains, then the flow rate is proportional to the square root of the gravity - so at 50% of Earth gravity, the sand will fall at a rate of about 70.7% of the rate it would fall at on earth.</p></div>		</li>
