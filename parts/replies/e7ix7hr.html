			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it always chromosome 21 that makes an extra copy creating downs? Do other chromosomes do that? Does It just end with a nonviable embryo? Is it a different syndrome? Sorry if I come off as ignorant. I'm really curious but know nothing about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other chromosomal aberrations cause other syndromes (21, 18, 13, X and Y) or are lethal. There's a Wikipedia article on the different ones - it depends on which bits are added/missing.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the details of the issue, but there's basically two possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Something about chromosome 21 makes it more &quot;sticky&quot; so that it doesn't always split in two when sex cells are forming, leading to the 2 + 1 = 3 situation.</li>
<li>When other trisomies occur, they're usually more immediately fatal or cause the embryo to not be able to progress further, so we never &quot;meet&quot; these people.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 18 are also known to occur, just not as often as Trisomy 21.</p></div>		</li>
