			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting study we were taught about extends the specifics of this phenomena even a little further than faces. It's hard to pin down what EXACT mechanism of action is being interfered with in prosopagnosia but two of these studies help narrow it toward, &quot;being able to recognize differences between individuals of any large group that features broadly similar physical features.&quot;</p>
<p>In one study a man incurred a brain injury which gave him prosopagnosia. The interesting bit is that he was apparently &quot;a car guy&quot;; he could tell a, say 67' pinto apart from a 68'pinto as easily as he could tell his children apart. It was found that his ability to recognize cars was interfered with in the same way as faces asfter his injury, at the very least proving that this brain mechanism was being leveraged in his ability to recognize cars to the extent he did.</p>
<p>Another more controlled study involved researchers making a bunch of small statues. These statues were vaguely humanoid but definitely pretty abstract; they didn't have &quot;faces&quot;, but they did have unique distinguishing characteristics like horns and weird appendages n junk. They took a bunch of human test subjects and made them memorize them. They instructed them to memorize the statues and give them names and practice identifying them until they could do it perfectly. When the human subjects were able to they'd sit them down and have them identify the statues while giving them brain scans and sure enough, they found strong activation of the same brain area which governs facial recognition in humans. This suggests that whatever mechanism allows humans to recognize faces can be used to distinguish members of any group that has broadly similar physical characteristics but subtle and unique physical identifiers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is even broader than visual. If you give people who don't drink (wine|beer|whiskey|coffee|whatever) a variety of options to drink, people are very bad at distinguishing them. But if you start drinking regularly, you develop the ability to identify subtle differences between samples, and can identify particular varieties by taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is also likely why people think those of another race they are not familiar with 'all look alike'</p>
<p>They have the same facial variations, but they are unlike what you are used to identifying so you don't notice the differences. You are hard wired to notice very minor differences off the most common features. </p>
<p>And conversely most animals 'look alike' to someone who looks at them now and again, but if you work with them a lot you start to be able to easily identify them from minor differences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the past year, I've been around a lot of German Shepherd Dogs of various ages(I'm talking 25-35 different dogs). I can immediately recognize each dog by face even when they're in a group. I can also immediately recognize features of the dog that identify them such as how far their ears are spread apart, how boxy their head is, how wide their snout is, etc. However, a year and a half ago I was around no GSDs regularly, and thus they all looked almost the exact same to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that it also depends on the race you &quot;grew up with&quot;. Often a Caucasian person raised in the west will think most Asians, for example, look the same, and have a hard time telling them apart. But apparently, if a Caucasian had been raised exclusively around Asians, they would easily be able tell Asians apart but have trouble with telling Caucasians apart.</p>

<p>It seems as I have trouble recognizing newer black or Asian friends, they also have issue recognizing new white friends...</p>
<p>I've gotten better at telling the various Asian ethnicities apart, but it does take practice... And I still make mistakes...</p>
<p>I knew a Korean named Chung, and met another Asian named Chung, and ask if he was Korean... He responded with disgust, and a &quot;no!&quot; and I stopped trying to guess...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few videos on YouTube of Asian people trying to guess the ethnicity of other Asian people in random pictures. They were no better either at guessing than anyone else would be. On a fundamental level it makes as much sense as guessing between other similarly genetic peoples.</p></div>		</li>
