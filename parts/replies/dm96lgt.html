			<div class="markdown"><p>Some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_biogeography#Research_experiments" target="_blank">experiments</a> were done in the Florida keys along these lines, where they tented and gassed entire islands to see how quickly and what types of life returned to them. Some pretty valuable information about insular biogeography was learned, but those types of experiments wouldn't be allowed today, I'd guess (they were performed in the 1960s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah in the vid I talked about the showed grasslands and they were studying diverse grasslands vs homogeneous grasslands.  But then, during the experiment a severe drought hit and the areas with the diversity survived MUCH better than the homogenous sections. </p>
<p>Very interesting and they were saying that the diversity of life helps to support all life because we're all so interconnected even if we don't think we are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done a internship on environment protection and research... And to be honest it's similar to this to this day. We used cups with antifreeze. Did the trick attracts bugs, and kills them but keeps them intact.  </p>
<p>It's a bit crude but who else can you categorize 100s of 1000s of animals and insect while they a moving around noon stop in an area that's 100s of square meters. It's like find wally but times 1 billion.  If they don't do this them we would never know they existed and then when the bulldozer Congress in we can't say&quot;hey stop there is a unique environment here with plenty of undiscovered insects and small animals&quot;.   </p>
<p>It's almost like kill 1 insect to save 1000s type of idea.   </p>
<p>Edit: find a better way to do this and of course we would follow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anybody know if this could be explained in part by how short generations are amongst insects? Insect DNA mixes hundreds, probably thousands, of times more rapidly than our own.</p>
<p>If you repeated this experiment every year, by then the insects could have gone through hundreds of generations right? Where is the line between a newborn being a new new species vs just another offspring of an existing species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still usually takes hundreds of years for any major evolutionary changes to take effect, even on the insect level (think, most mammals today have been exactly as they are for thousands of years!). But you're for sure on the right track - if you repeated the experiment even as soon as every ten years, phenotypic plasticity in rare or relatively unknown species could make it seem to scientists that they were finding &quot;new&quot; species rather than just variations of known species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A new species is determined by mating. If there's significant evolutionary change such that one creature cannot mate with others then it's a new species. This takes several several several generation. For example - Chihuahua are still technically the same species as Wolf (Canis lupus) and could have babies, even though they've been artificially selected farrr out of the gene pool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this kind of parallels the &quot;how did life start&quot; thing. I accept that biology has an answer to it but I'm not a biologist so I need to take their word for it, but I still don't understand it.</p>
<p>If a species is defined by being unable to mate with the species it was previously, how does that new species reproduce (with what?) to keep the new species going?</p>
<p>Maybe it's more of a gradient change than &quot;now you can mate and now you cannot&quot;? Maybe it's like &quot;you lost the ability to mate with 30% of your previous species&quot; or something and eventually it hits 100% but by that time enough reproduction has happened that its self sustainable?</p></div>		</li>
