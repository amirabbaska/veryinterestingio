			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the amount of neurons can be used to make a rough estimation on the cognitive abilities of an animal, the connectivity between these neurons is also an important factor. Increased connectivity means that feedback loops in the brain receive more information. This extra bit of information allows the brain to solve more complex problems. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that the brainâ€™s mass can not be solely adressed to the amount of neurons. There are a lot of other cell types (glia cells for example) in the brain that keep neurons alive and make sure they work in an optimal environment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this last statement is very important- the higher relative numbers of glial and other supportive neural cell types has been of keen interest when studying exceptional intelligence in humans, i.e. Einstein's supramarginal gyrus, and are often lumped into general discussion of gross cell counts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One important clue for &quot;intelligence&quot; is the Cognitive Revolution. There were anatomically modern humans on Earth for a long time, and they left very few artifacts of tools, pottery, burials, art, etc. On an evolutionary timescale, the transition from this state to one where humans were burying their dead, making tools, large campsites, and pottery, was very abrupt. The state transition was very quick, and there is little anatomical difference between the populations (before Smart vs after Smart). This suggests that the genetic changes were very minor, and thus only small adjustments in brain architectures were needed to go from Not-Smart humans and Smart humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such theory would be consistent with what has been observed in the study of artificial neural networks (NN). I think, we know that artificial NNs are more capable if they have more layers not neurons per se. But human brains doesn't have such neat orderly structure, so it's hard to compare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More connective artificial NNs are more likely to make spurious associations. I'm curious if there's any corollary with animal brains. Are human with more connective brains more likely to fall prey to teleological fallacies, for example? </p></div>		</li>
