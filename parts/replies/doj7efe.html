<p>To add on to their last point about vaccines not being able to keep up.  Current HIV vaccine research is targeting what are called &quot;broadly neutralizing antibodies&quot; (bNAbs). Antibodies are immune components produced by your body that target the components of infections (antigens on either HIV itself or HIV infected cells). Broadly neutralizing antibodies occur in less than 1% of HIV infected people and created what is called a natural nonprogressor, which basically means they will naturally never progress to AIDS because they produce a super antibody that can stop all the broad mutations of HIV.</p>
<p>Scientists identified these people and are researching these bNAbs with the main two efforts of HIV vaccine research today being to either manufacture (grow them) or produce them naturally in the body by coaxing the immune system to create them. Neither are a trivial process. The former has issues with cost and delivery as duration/invasiveness of the treatment are issues. The latter is very complex because they need to trace the lineage of how these bNAbs were produced, in other words determine how cells matured over generations to create these antibodies as they form over months and years and cells only have a short lived life cycle, but even so this only occurs is such a small population that determining the population of cells they need to target in order to illicit their creation is very difficult. So scientist right now are performing trials all over the world to determine the right sequence of exposures to trigger their creation. Another issue being that populations all over the world are different and there are different strains of HIV specific to certain regions, all adding further complexity to the situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. I work in vaccine research, although not as a scientist, and your explanation is better than any I've been able to give. I hope you don't mind if I use it in the future when people ask me what we &quot;do&quot; where I work. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe one day. But a more likely approach is to 'activate' the cells in which HIV is latently hiding, causing them to express their HIV payload so they can be targeted for destruction. Alternatively we might be able to use genetic engineering to alter the essential coreceptors on cell surfaces that HIV uses to enter cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For cure research, this is accurate. Also worth noting that the CCR5 delta32 mutation doesn't confer complete protection, as those people are equally prone to infection from CXCR4 viruses... which may be more pathogenic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wish I could answer! I don't know enough about CRISPR.</p>
<p>For it to work, it would have to get rid of the HIV genomes that are integrated in every cell that is infected with HIV - which is probably a lot.</p>
<p>But some people are researching it! Here's just what I've found.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170501112514.htm" target="_blank">Gene editing strategy eliminates HIV-1 infection in live animals</a>.</p>
<p>That's an article based on the paper (behind a paywall unfortunately so I haven't read it, (although it's so not in my realm of interest I'd really rather not read it anyway):</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y93edf8h" target="_blank">Yin, C., et al (2017) In vivo excision of HIV-1 provirus by saCas9 and multiplex single-guide RNAs in animal models. <em>Molecular Therapy</em>. 25(5):1168-1186.</a></p>
<p>And these guys seem pretty optimistic! Although of course they have to, as the enthusiasm will help them get funding for future research :). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you could cure HIV with something like chemotherapy, which kills <em>all</em> immune cells? The only issue being, with chemo, you're given doner cells, and you'd need to find someone with the Delta 32 phenotype. </p>
<p>Theoretically, let's say you found multiple doners with Delta 32. You could put an HIV patient on a few months worth of chemo, pump them full of blood from someone with Delta 32. I wonder what the success rate of something like this is... Asides from the issue of finding Delta 32 blood, are there any other reasons this wouldn't work? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has only been one person who has ever been cured of HIV, and it is similar to the situation you described. The patient had cancer and HIV  and was treated with chemo, also went though a bone marrow transplant, while receiving retro viral therapy. The combination of these treatments eradicated HIV from their system. </p>
<p>The problem is chemo is much worse for your body than taking ART for the rest of your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the post I was replying to mentioned that case. </p>
<p>I figure it'd probably be possible to repeat the process, but either (1) God damn expensive, or (2) worse for you overall than just taking a pill to suppress it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So far the success rate is 1! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Berlin_Patient" target="_blank">Berlin Patient</a>.</p>
<p>It may work to cure HIV. If we don't have to worry about accessing delta32 blood (this hypothetical world is horrifying), then we have just a few problems.</p>
<p>1 - the normal problem with transplants: compatibility. We would need delta 32 blood that is compatible with everyone who might need it. So if you had a factor harvesting blood from a single delta 32 donor, this would not be enough - it would only help those who matched the donor. Also, the delta 32 mutation is found appreciably only in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216086" target="_blank">specific populations, notably in Europe and West Asia</a>. I wonder that we mind find delta 32 donors are only compatible with people from those same populations (e.g. only a treatment for Europeans and West Asians)</p>
<p>2 - chemotherapy is not gentle and will increase lifetime risk for a lot of things, including cancers. This is considered an appropriate risk in the treatment of aggressive primary cancers, but if and HIV+ person can be treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) such that they never progress to AIDS or transmit the virus, why would we increase their risk of getting secondary cancers by forcing them through chemo? This also kind of applies to the stem cell transplant procedure as a whole - transplants are simply less safe than ART regimens.</p>
<p>3 - It worked for the Berlin patient, but who knows how much luck was involved? This isn't a procedure that can be ethically tested (particularly because, as above, the expected damage of this type of treatment would far outweigh the marginal benefit of an HIV cure over HIV control). The Berlin patient might have had some other things going on that helped this to work. (Basically this is my cop-out reason - there may be other reasons this wouldn't work that we just don't know about, because human bodies are complicated).</p></div>		</li>
