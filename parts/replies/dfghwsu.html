			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you call them or save their number in your phone? FB will sync with your phone contacts and recommend them if you're not friends already (you can adjust that in your FB settings). Also, they'll use your location too and see who you're around regularly. Even if you were never close to your guest, they were at your house for a bit, and you're there often. Now they have you both tagged at the same location, you two should be friends! Kinda creepy. Disabling your phone's location setting can help with this. The phone company will still know where you are (they need to to be able to provide you with phone service) but other apps and such won't have access to it. Many apps won't work without your location enabled though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the common threads in those accounts may well be your phone numbers. Plus, location data would tend to correlate it, particularly if you came from a distant location and stayed near where they normally are for a brief period. </p>
<p>Also, there may be location data from phone-based photos that were embedded in uploaded images, plus the same emails may have been used for accounts... Once there are enough points of correlation, Facebook can make a reasonable guess. </p></div>		</li>
