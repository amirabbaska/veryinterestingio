			<div class="markdown"><p>The reaction is moving electrons from one container to another separate container, with the only available path being the wire.</p>
<p>Waiting or shaking the battery might help the small amount of remaining charge get closer to the terminal, helping to squeeze out a bit more of what is left but not adding any extra energy. It is a bit like trying to squeeze out the last of the toothpaste, if you really try you can get a bit more out, but it comes out slowly and there's never any more in there than what you started with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. the materials inside the battery have reacted and changed chemically. you need to reverse the reaction. in most batteries this isn't possible because it generates too much heat.</p></div>		</li>
