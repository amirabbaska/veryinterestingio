			<div class="markdown"><p>Kickass is still alive though? there are several proxies I can think of like katcr.to, they've lost a lot of content, but so has TPB. this is just the unlimited aspect of the internet, you can keep adding new sites if there is demand. Granted I'm saying this as someone in Turkey who uses a VPN when half of everything is blocked so I'm probably not a majority. I like the UI of Kickass far more than TPB it didnt take me long to switch when i started out torrenting, TBT being shut down kinda cemented that, but when KAT was taken down I had just started using netflix :/</p></div>		</li>
