<p>Precisely this. IIRC East Africans (i.e. Kenya/Ethiopia area) are genetically better suited for long distance while West Africans are better suited for sprinting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PS. Not All East Africans.
Kenya itself has 42 tribes. The dominating runners come from one tribe; the Kalenjin. Add in a few Kikuyus and you have the Kenyan marathon roster. I don't know much about Ethiopians.</p>
<p>They are not the only tribes who have lived in high altitude areas but they seem to have gotten the most out of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same thing in Ethiopia - the dominant runners are Oromo (highland) but lots of Tigrayans (lowland) have reached world class levels training with Oromo. </p>
<p>Consider also Mo Farah and Abdi Abdirahman - both born in Somalia, which has zero elite runners, but have become world class runners in UK and USA respectively. Most likely genetics + right environment. </p>
<p>My theory is that all East Africans have a genetic advantage that some tribes have harnessed better than others. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well probably not really, recent discoveries point towards Antola as the area that humanity rose out of, the reason for the greater amount of genetic diversity, is a larger presence of natural barriers, like deserts, mountains, and dense jungle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While it doesn't necessarily disprove the OOA theory, there is mounting evidence of a more dispersed genesis of humanity happening over a larger swathe of land, from everywhere from Siberia, to Cambodia, to Uganda </p>

<p>Let me know how that works out. </p>
<p>Areas suitable for long distance running are wide open plains and Savannahs, where a very viable form of hunting is &quot;run after something until it gets tired, and you haven't&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. </p>
<p>Humans (very fit male East African humans, anyway) are some of the fastest animals over long distances. If the distance is long enough, a man can outrun antelope, wildebeest, etc. Then we can throw spears at it, kill it, cut it up into pieces, cook it and eat it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually mountains are better suited for long distance running than open plains are, because of the altitude and because once you get to a sufficiently high level the cost of running up the hills doesn't matter as much.</p></div>		</li>
