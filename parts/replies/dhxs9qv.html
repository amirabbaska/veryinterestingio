			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking this top comment to pose another related question:</p>
<p>We know that the effects of time dilation increase exponentially as we approach c, with time quite literally &quot;freezing&quot; at C (which we know is impossible for any object with mass). In a theoretical universe where c travel is possible, travel from any two points in the universe is literally instantaneous. With this in mind, and with the obvious understanding that light has no concept of &quot;time,&quot; wouldn't we assume that light emitted from the big bang reached the edge of the current universe... instantly? As in, the age of the universe is 0? How do we meld our perception of time and the measured age of the universe With the fact that the reference frame containing light emitted from the big bang has experienced no passage of time?</p>
<p>I guess a more direct way to ask this question is this: I understand the experience of time is entirely relative, and that in essence the calculated age of the universe shouldn't be thought of in our concept of how &quot;long&quot; a year is-- it's literally the number of times the earth has circled the sun (or would have if it existed), which is objective and measurable. But I just cant wrap my mind around the fact that in existant reference frames the age of the universe remains null</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always hear that, and I don't understand how that is possible. Nothing with a mass can travel at the speed of light, so how did our little earth stayed ahead of the light coming from the big bang. Why, after all these billions of years isn't all that light already way past us? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instantaneous? But light takes time to travel right? Sun to earth is 8 minutes, Sol to alpha centauri is x days/weeks/months?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes time as measured in <em>our</em> reference frame. If we were to somehow accompany that light we would experience no passage of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light actually travels at speeds lower than c (speed of light in a vacuum) very often. This is what causes refraction. As the light moves between mediums of different densities, such as air and glass, it will speed up (moving from glass to air) or slow down (moving from air to glass). This change in velocity causes the light to 'bend' which distorts the image that we see of the object. This is why a straw seems to bend when looked at through the side of a glass of water.</p></div>		</li>
