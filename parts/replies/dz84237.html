<p>Brain zaps went all through out my nerves. Like every time I twitched or move it was like an electric current down from my head to my feet.</p>
<p>Still get them from time to time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both MDMA and SSRI’s affect your serotonin levels, that’s presumably why they have similar withdrawal effects. That’s why you should never take MDMA when you’re on an SSRI, it can cause serotonin syndrome and kill you. </p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>MDMA needs to get into the cell through the serotonin reuptake transporters to work. It can't do this when the transporter is being blocked by SSRIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSRIs make MDMA <strong>weaker</strong>. Dosing SSRIs shortly after MDMA has additionally been shown to protect the brain from neurotoxicity (in rats).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>MAOI</strong> antidepressants are the ones that can kill you when combined with MDMA.</li>
