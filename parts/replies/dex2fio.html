			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I used to stop using sites doing that. But nowadays that'd pretty much mean quitting the internet -.-</p>
<p>Anyway, just search for something like magnesium, you'll see how their site is built, it's really great to find information about nutritional elements without searching for all the studies yourself and even getting a nice conclusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good. The only look at published journals (and books, maybe?) and analyse the results to create their articles. </p>
<p>The website was actually made by a redditor who's active on /r/entrepreneur. If you search there you'll find loads more info on it. </p></div>		</li>
