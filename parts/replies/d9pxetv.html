<p>In short, the reason tankless toilets are generally used in public areas, is because the flushometer (shinny chrome handle thing) allows greater water flow. This allows the unit to reset sooner and accommodate the next user without them waiting for the tank/bowl to fill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically because residential use is limited to one or two flushes at a time so it doesn't really justify the increased water demand (larger diameter supply line). Imagine going to an Airport or rest stop and having to wait for a toilets tank to fill before you flush. A lot of people wouldn't flush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming 3/8&quot; is the standard size for most residential homes? If a homeowner were so inclined, could he hire a plumber to enlarge that to maybe say a 1&quot; line to fill the toilet bowl faster?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't the water lines inside the house, the problem is the water lines at the street. City water lines can be as small as an inch; the line to your house in particular is usually a half inch. </p>
<p>Since your neighbors don't want their showers to go hot when you flush the toilet, the city regulates the size of the water line to your house. You generally can't get a larger one without a lot of work. Therefore, you can't get a one inch line for your toilet. Unless you want to keep a storage and pressure tank somewhere up high like in your attic, that is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I totally misunderstood. I thought the 3/8&quot; line was referring to that stainless steel braided hose coming out of the wall going to the toilet. </p></div>		</li>
