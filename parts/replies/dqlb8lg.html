<p>This generates a magnetic field with changing strength [...] This AC current is then fully rectified and smoothened to a comparatively flat DC current, which charges your battery. </p>

<p>Question - If the magnetic field is constant strength, does that generate a DC current in the receiving coil? If so, why use AC?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope. Like I said, the magnetic field <em>has</em> to <em>move</em> for there to induce a changing current in the receiving coil. This is a fundamental fact arising out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Lorentz force</a>. Out of this is derived the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Maxwell-Faraday Equation</a>, which describes Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction. </p>
<p>I said 'changing' magnetic field, but it <em>can</em> be a constant magnetic field that <em>moves</em>, too. The key idea is that motion, current, and magnetism are linked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per induction law the induced voltage is calculated by dividing the derivatives of the flow by the time. The flow has to be &quot;moving&quot; for a voltage to be induced.
These concepts are actually applied in many fields, not just magnetic chargin Electric motors for example aswell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The really interesting thing to me is, as you say, how simple the the underlying principle is.  We've known about it for what, couple hundred years?</p>
<p>It was really more engineering issue to get it running.  We've known how to do it on paper long before anyone had a cell phone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what's also fun is how the relationship between electricity and magnetism was first discovered.</p>
<p>A guy was giving a lecture (early 1800s), and there was a battery powering a circuit. Nearby there was a compass, right next to a wire. He noticed that the compass wasn't pointed quite right. I would guess they then turn the circuit on and off and really saw the effect.</p></div>		</li>
