<p>I'd like to add Sloths also going to the ground to relieve themselves is beneficial for their mutualistic relationship with a species of moth.</p>
<p>The moth lives, breeds and dies on the sloth, this grows algae on the sloth's coat. The algae provides camoflauge (it's green) and also nutrients. The nutrients created by the algae is absorbed through the sloth's skin and hair follicles.</p>
<p>The moths however don't lay their eggs on the sloth. They lay their eggs in its feces! The sloth heads down to the ground, defecates (hopefully doesn't get eaten), a pregnant moth hops off and lays her eggs in the fresh feces. Newly emerging moths from prior poop hop up on the sloth and the cycle continues.</p>

<p>Edit - Here's a link to an article about the study: <a href="http://science.time.com/2014/01/22/the-mystery-of-sloth-poop-one-more-reason-to-love-science/" target="_blank">http://science.time.com/2014/01/22/the-mystery-of-sloth-poop-one-more-reason-to-love-science/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>What is the name of this algae so I can sell it to people in Portland, LA, and Brooklyn as a skin care product? </p></div>		</li>
