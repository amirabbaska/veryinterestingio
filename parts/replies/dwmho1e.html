			<div class="markdown"><p>Analog fax is still used by several governments, including the U.S.A., to transmit weather charts to ships at sea by shortwave radio.  (Originally it was used to transmit weather charts to all weather forecasting offices, although I don't know whether there was a telephone connection for that or whether they also used the fading- and interference-prone radio.)  I suspect that at least some of the transmitting and receiving is done by computer these days though -- since the signal fits in a 2500-Hz channel, it's an easy job with even the cheapest sound card.</p>
<p>A color analog fax system (they don't call it SSTV, I don't know why, other than it's a continuous strip image rather than a given frame size) is still used by some weather satellites to send down a (relatively) low-res image for the benefit of ground stations that don't have the large steerable antenna necessary for the reception of higher-res and/or digital images.  (You can easily pick up a voice-grade VHF signal from low earth orbit with little or no antenna gain.)  I don't know whether this low-res imagery has any remaining scientific use though, and I keep expecting it to go away with each new generation of satellite.</p></div>		</li>
