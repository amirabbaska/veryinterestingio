			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to endorse this answer, and add the one element that I think is missing: formants. </p>
<p>formants are the timbres that you hear in speech. it's what allows you to distinguish between different words even if they're sung at the same pitch. </p>
<p>however, the formants have pitches of their own. generally, male sings have lower formants and female have higher. this is easier to notice when it's digitally manipulated, as shown in this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/epaoybT2C3s?t=20" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/epaoybT2C3s?t=20</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you!When castrato was still in practice, do you think a castrato voice would be easily told apart from a small child, to a trained ear? </p>
<p>I only know of one recording of a castrato, and if I hadnâ€™t known it was an adult I absolutely would have guessed a child was singing, but I am also not trained in voice. (I played the flute/piccolo until I graduated, so my music education is not helping much here.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <em>castrati</em> is still going to sound different from an actual child. Reducing someone's testosterone will cause them to develop differently, but their vocal folds are still going to grow.</p>
<p>That being said, trained singers are able to alter their vocal timbre and could easily replicate the desired sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although castration would have halted their hormonal development, as they grew up, I would think their voice would have still matured at least a little. Children usually have a very pure and airy tone, so as a castrato had been trained, their sound would have become fuller, more like an adult woman's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main difference between a child and a castrato is that a castrato is an adult so their skeletal structure will be a lot larger than a child's. This affects resonance tremendously. </p></div>		</li>
