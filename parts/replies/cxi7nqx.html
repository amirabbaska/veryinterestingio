<p>Splitting atoms is just an expression - you can't split one atom or a few of them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, when you split an atom you literally do it.  You convert one U-235 nucleus into two FP nuclei and some neutrons.  The nucleus literally is split into 2 (sometimes 3) FPs.</p>
<p>And you can certainly split one or a few atoms</p>

<p>Just adjust phi (or sigma or volume) until the reaction rate is one or a few reactions per however long you want.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But if you hold the uranium together in one piece long enough, the storm of neutrons rages out of control and becomes &quot;critical&quot;. At this point the hot uranium is trying so hard to expand, it can't be contained - this is an atomic blast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know you said this was &quot;full of technical inaccuracy&quot; but just no, this isn't even close, friend.</p>
<p>An amount of uranium that is sub-critical cannot just become critical due to prolonged exposure to neutron bombardment. Nor does the expansion cause or even involve the atomic blast as you said. It just boils off or melts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a critique was inevitable. The purpose was to explain it conceptually  in terms of why you can't &quot;split one atom&quot;, which nobody else seemed to be doing. </p></div>		</li>
