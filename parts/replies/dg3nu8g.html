			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, that is super cool! We use a similar thing called ion Doppler for getting an ion temperature, but it is tricky because there are a bunch of other things that can widen ion spectrum, including density Stark broadening. What exactly is rotational temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For small molecules (larger molecules like proteins follow the same physical laws but it would be more complicated) there are certain allowed quantized rotational states, that depend on the symmetry of the molecule. The rotational kinetic energy of the molecule is therefore quantized, and depends on the moments of inertia of the molecule. The rotational energy of such a state can be converted to an analogous &quot;rotational temperature&quot; by dividing by Boltzmann's constant, k_B, a universal physical constant that relates temperature and energy. The rotational temperature of a molecule is unique to it and thus can be useful in identifying a molecule. In theory it is possible for two molecules to have identical rotation temperatures but it can be a very useful way of identifying a particular molecule in the gas phase. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/e-Chem-nerd gave a great answer!  Just in case you haven't had the courses, I'll supplement it with a little background. When we say a substance has a given temperature, we're saying that it has a distribution or histogram of energies that has a specific shape.  This distribution is like a bell curve that has a high energy tail. The mean of this distribution is known as the temperature.   </p>
<p>Now depending on the type of atom or molecule that makes up the substance, energy is contained differently. If the substance is made of atoms, then only the 3D kinetic energy of the atoms define the temperature. If the substance is molecular and linear like co2, then the molecule can rotate as well.<br />
As echemnerd said, rotational motion is quantized and the distribution of individual  rotational states can be probed for simple molecules using IR spectroscopy. This allows us to determine the temperature of the rotational energy in the molecule. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add onto that, there is another common technique to get a plasma's temperature. If the plasma is confined in a magnetic field and accelerated in a cyclotron, there is a process known as electron cyclotron emission that can give you a fairly accurate measure of the radial temperature distribution within the plasma, as briefly discussed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_cyclotron_resonance" target="_blank">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p>And to shamelessly self-promote, <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-4075/47/10/105701/meta" target="_blank">you can also take the ratios of various X-rays emitted by very hot plasmas</a> to measure their temperature. In this case, the method boils down to taking a ratio of the brightnesses of various spectral lines that are produced when electrons recombine in a hot plasma. This data can be correlated to a given temperature and used as an indirect method to measure the temperature of a plasma in things like nuclear fusion devices or even in distant interstellar plasmas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also use X-ray photodiodes and are trying to do line ratios to get a bremstralung measurement, but are often below 1keV so line emissions are an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a shame, although fortunately I'm not caught in that bit of funding mess. This was a paper I wrote up a few years ago when I worked there over the summer. I'm doing my PhD now in a completely unrelated topic. That should keep me busy for a while! </p></div>		</li>
