<p>Used that site to watch Grave of the Fireflies dubbed.</p>
<p>As far as torrenting: I agree about access.</p>
<p>I haven't pirated a song or film for almost a decade as streaming services improved.</p>
<p>And I have hardrives lying around with 10's of thousands of albums and hundreds of films.</p>
<p>The services have been loaded well enough now that the work involved in pirating the material isn't worth it.</p>
<p>Well.. at least until Nintendo killed the ROM sites. Now I have MAME issues.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nintendo has been known to take down YouTube videos just for saying the word Nintendo or for showing a Nintendo console on screen. Why the fuck would you lay a copyright claim on a fucking product review for a product that you made. It's absolute madness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the best example of this is Netflix. It's taken over the rest of the world, with cheap subscriptions, ease of use and shared accounts. As long as you provide access easier - or as easy as - than through torrents, people will come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Netflix maybes needs to focus on making less crap original movies perhaps... but that's another point entirely. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure the only reason Netflix keeps making originals is that it's the only way they can guarantee that the content is available worldwide. Anything else is liable to have a different company owning the rights in each country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad example. I think the music services like Spotify/GPM/Apple Music are good examples.</p>
<p>Netflix at least in my country is woefully inadequate. Series are often multiple seasons behind which is useless when you want to talk to your friends about the latest episode that just came out. Also too many 'exclusives' exist for different networks. You can't watch Game of Thrones on Netflix for example. Until there is a unified service with access to everything and no big exclusives outside of the platform then piracy will still be rampant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, regional monopolies still exist that prevent distribution of digital materials.</p>
<p>From personal experience: the Total War series was no available on Steam to certain Far Eastern countries because the of distribution rights by a local company.
And netflix itself is really patchy in terms of content as well. Living in Hong Kong I often resorted to torrenting shows that are not on TV or on Netflix.</p>
<p>I think we are still decades away from being region free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a point yes. Although the risk is in those platforms becoming monopolies and those that are supplying those platforms getting shitty about how little money they're making, backing out and trying to make MORE money on their own. It's already happening with Spotify, nobody likes how little money they make from it. You also run the risk of situations like the recent Apple situation with movies being unavailable in regions. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is the original copyright owners need to get their head around and out of their asses on controlling distribution into these little mini microcosms. Worldwide release, same (reasonable and realisitic) price everywhere. It's the only way to do it. The distribution model is easy, website. You don't need a platform. People just need to sit down, google the title, genre, actor, whatever, and go from there. </p>
<p>I know I dream... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was never one to download movies or anything but used to torrent the shit out of music. I'd download entire discographies of basically any band that I listened to. Ever since subscribing to Spotify premium, I haven't torrented a single file. To be honest, I actually prefer paying for Spotify as I have access to listen to basically I want without having to use a computer to then sync it. It's so much more convenient than pirating music. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same story here. I subbed to GPM and never torrented a piece of music again. This is how you properly tackle piracy.</p>
<p>The movies/series business is still a long way off being like this due to so many shows being 'exclusive' to a certain provider. If there was one platform that truly provided everything and worldwide release at the same time for all media then I this would all but stamp out piracy in that area too.</p></div>		</li>
