			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is technically true, I will mention to OP that typically when we take medical history, we usually ask for 2nd degree relatives (so up to grandparents, including aunts and uncles) and we will ask about siblings and children as well if pertinent. What we find is many patients don't have a great memory or documentation about diseases that run in families (we mainly focus on inheritable diseases, cardiovascular issues, cancers, metabolic disorders like diabetes, psychiatric, and a few others). Family history can be very important in assessing patients and their families. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of interest, as far as I know a lot of genetic conditions have only been diagnosed as such in the last century or so. If useful medical records were available for 3rd generation (for example when current teenagers have kids), would they be particularly useful and do you think that they would be useful enough to make it worth requesting them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also thinking along a similar line; going back more than 2 generations I would think that many diagnoses would be not nearly as accurate. So that's another reason why even if conditions of great grandparents are known, it still might not be useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends a lot on context.</p>
<p>&quot;Medical history&quot; is mostly relevant in order to estimate your risk of developing conditions that are known or suspected to have a hereditary element.</p>
<p>In that context, medical history becomes irrelevant for a condition when the estimated risk you have for that condition based on the medical history of your ancestors is similar to the estimated risk for the general population.</p>
<p>I the condition is linked to a dominant gene, then only your parents medical history should matter, but then maybe they didn't live long enough for the condition to develop or maybe the gene is not always expressed even though it is supposedly dominant.</p>
<p>For recessive genes, where you supposedly need the gene from both sides, you would generally assume that any ancestor having the condition would have given it to all of his/her children.</p>
<p>Going from the closest direct ancestor who had the condition, your estimated probability of carrying the gene from that ancestor would then be halved for each generation. Once that number is similar to the probability of carrying the gene in the general population, your medical history on that condition becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>So for relatively common hereditary diseases, medical history becomes irrelevant after a few generations with no occurrences.</p>
<p>For very rare recessive conditions it takes longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell me if the following has any error?</p>
<p>If we assume no inbreeding and a simplified model of genetic inheritance: where we just take a chromosome from each parent to form each chromosome pair, then every generation would lose half the relevant genetic charge. i.e: The half-life is 1 generation.</p>
<p>Since we have 23 chromosome pairs, after 12 generations we have less than 1% of 1 chromosome on average from the original specimen. i.e: There's very little chance any chromosome passed on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to mention that.  Under the assumption a gene isn't explicitly biased for and that the rate of passing it on is a 50/50 gamble then you should expect it to die off at an exponential rate. </p>
<p>While theoretically infinite, it's statistically more likely that after a certain number of generations the likelihood of that gene being around is low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The errors lie in your simplifications. Instead you should talk about gene inheritance not chromosomal inheritance. But the end result is as discussed above, the further generations forward in time the decreased probability of a specific gene from a specific parent will be present. This of course is highly affected by the biological necessity of the gene, but if we assume an unnecessary recessive gene, then the probability would in theory be lowered by roughly 50% per generation for most chromosomes.</p></div>		</li>
