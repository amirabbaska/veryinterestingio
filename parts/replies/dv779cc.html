<p>&quot;so movies showing EMP pulse disabling all electronics etc., but living humans unharmed&quot; is factually in-accurate?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Neurons send signals as an electrochemical cascade, not a current flowing through a wire. They aren't even particularly conductive, are very short, and make bad antennas.</p>
<p>That said, Hollywood depictions of EMP are usually wrong about everything else...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For example, a machine fried from an EMP won't start working again after a few minutes. If the EMP was transient and the affected electronics are no longer operational, they were probably disabled due to destructive short circuiting or overheating.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be confused with a more persistent EM discharge causing interference in the circuitry of less sensitive electronics (especially equipment without microelectronics). Such electronics may only be nonfunctional/dysfunctional due to the presence of electrical noise.</p>
<p>Hollywood also tends to ignore range based effects. Everything within some distance is simply shown to turn off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That should be &quot;orders of magnitude higher than that needed to affect electronics&quot; right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say, need a physicist there who can compare whatever crazy things that an EMP does, with the very specific narrowband things fMRI/TMS do.</p>
<p>i do know that MRI/TMS must be kept at relatively low strengths, too high and you can start to burn/damage tissue. that's why i figure that if the pulse is strong enough to significantly interact with neurons, it will probably also be tearing up the rest of the body. massive burns + seizure and permanent neurological damage?</p></div>		</li>
