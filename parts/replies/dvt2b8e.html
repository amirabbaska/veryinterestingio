<p>I've got some health issues so I am always tired and the idea of getting into bed at the end if the day and not being exhausted is such a strange and foreign idea to me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much the difficulty sleeping that shocks me as the idea that people aren't utterly exhausted at the end of the day. </p>
<p>But I wake up exhausted so I am just having trouble imagining it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for others but I'm 'tired' at the end of my day. Which means I'm lazy, but not sleep tired. </p>
<p>For reference I work at 8am, get home at 5pm, and bed time is 12am. Anything earlier than midnight and I'm laying there for no reason. I never learned the art of making myself sleep in command, I'm either tired enough or it's not happening.</p></div>		</li>
