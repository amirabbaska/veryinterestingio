			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a material scientist working on Nb3Sn superconductor for particle accelerator magnets, and have a colleague who worked on the material for the ITER reactor magnets (mostly central solenoid for those who know ITER).  Even though we can't easily use 14MeV neutrons to test the material degradation, we can model how they cause damage and use other sources to get an idea. Consider that you power up the magnets, and now you have electrons whizzing around in circles, generating a magnetic field to contain the plasma. The thing about charged particles in a magnetic field is that they will undergo the Lorentz force and start to move in circular orbits. It's exactly the same as charged particles coming from the sun, which interact with our Earth's magnetic field, then those particles curve around the earth rather than go through the atmosphere and turn us all into The Fantastic Seven Billion. Now, assuming a standard unit charge, what determines this movement is simply the magnetic field, and the velocity of the particle. What's interesting is that in either case you have charged particles moving near the speed of light, but the Earth's magnetic field is only 0.000050 Tesla, while the ITER central solenoid field is 13T. The difference is that the Earth's weak field has millions of miles to slowly curve the particle, but in ITER you have only a few meters to do the same thing, so you need much more bending power, and for this, you need fancy materials that don't blow apart and can withstand the radiation to generate large magnetic fields like 13 Tesla.
Aside from the plasma undergoing the Lorentz force, the electrons generating the actual magnetic field also become affected and little vortices are created which run around your superconductor and kill superconductivity in that spot where the little tornado/vortex has formed. You can't really stop the vortices from forming, but you CAN pin them down so traffic can move around them. The most effective pinning sites for Nb3Sn are actual the boundaries where the individual grains meet in the material (we're talking nano scale). Now to finally get to my point...when this material is irridiated, it's properties first IMPROVE. This is because it creates &quot;artificial&quot; pinning sites where the little vortices can get stuck.
Here's a good analogy to macroscopic events: If you think about driving on a highway, but suddenly there are tornado's running around every where, it would be quite unsafe and difficult to drive there. Now, if the tornados got stuck in the boundary between lanes, that's not so bad because they aren't moving any more and you can avoid them by going around. Obviously it's not great, but you can still drive. But then more and more tornados are appearing, so the road is becoming almost unusable. But then someone realizes if you dig a pot hole, those tornados will get stuck in there as well. So you dig a bunch of pot holes. You can see though that at some point, you can pin down all those tornados, but no cars can get through because there are so many potholes. So this irradiation is great in the beginning, but then goes sour at some point. We currently design materials taking things like this into account, as well as how long the device will be in use for.
The containment structure aside from the magnet part is much more straight forward to protect, and replace from radiation, and I will leave for a differenet type of engineer to address.</p></div>		</li>

Do you have any suggestions on where I can go to learn more about the physics behind them, and current superconductor development?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have one off the top of my head, but my background is more or less the exact science-opposite of applied superconductivity, and when I had to learn about it (or anytime I have to learn something new), I first learn absolutely none of the actual material, and instead read about the history of the science. I think understanding the historical motivation and progression for what took place makes learning the dryer stuff (equations, laws, etc) MUCH more interesting. Not to be confused with other dryer stuff...like lint, which you may never find interesting. </p>
<p>If you work in NMR, consider that in the future NbTi will likely be ditched for MgB2, 2212, or YBCO, mostly due to higher current densities, and higher Tc's, meaning much less space and cooling will be required (hopsital real-estate is one hell of a premium, especially because you have to consider the magnetic field extending to other floors above and below. Of course this is probably 20-30 years out. What's your specific field/research?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To test material performance over time, you need very high fast neutron fluxes. A fusion reactor's walls will see hundreds of displacements per atom (dpa) over their lifetime. Testing with ion beams to approximate neutrons is easier (and mimics the damage somewhat well). However, testing with actual fast neutrons is more realistic. The fluxes needed are well beyond what a small DT source can do. Something like the Phoenix Nuclear Labs DT driver might be able to do that, but it's still a stretch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think these other folks more or less answered. Ultimately we would want a Dyson Sphere to collect 100% of the energy produced by our sun (read wikipedia or have more fun and watch TNG S6E4: &quot;Relics&quot;) But I was referring to charged particles in a magnetic field only. Neutrons do have spin and can be affected I guess (zeeman splitting?), and then this nut job below has dedicated their life to subatomic particles and is talking about quark charge and QGP... and to that user (I don't post often if anyone hasn't figured out yet that I can't reddit), Can neutrino spin really be any type of consdideration in Lorentz forces applied to Neutrons? I'm guessing they just aren't affected on any scale really...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you had a way to direct them straight up they'd probably make a bunch of radioactive isotopes when they struck atoms in the atmosphere, so that'd likely be a sub-optimal solution.  It's better to let them hit some sort of shielding that you're prepared to deal with radioactivity on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretend that atoms are hard spheres. Now for simple metals (most pure metals are pretty simple crystals) the atoms often would like to stack as tightly as possible. There are therefore two options if spheres want to stack as tight as they can. Without getting into the technicalities of lattice vs. basis vs. crystal structure, these two options are called face centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close packed (HCP). These are the two simplest crystal structures to talk about. FCC is exactly what it sounds like, atoms are arranged with an atom on the corners of the cube and an atom on each face of the cube. HCP is a bit more complicated. Crystallography is cool and the basis for an enormous amount of physics and materials engineering.</p>
<p>Thermal motion allows atoms to move around in the crystal structure. Imagine the FCC structure I told you about repeating on for millions of units. Sometimes (actually pretty often) an atom is simply missing from a spot where it should. These are called vacancies. When a material is not at 0 Kelvin (so always) ab atom which is next to a vacancy can hop over. The hotter it is, the more vacancies there are and the more hops per second. Radiation damage often creates more vacancies in metals, the extra atoms just get pushed towards the surface. At a given temperature a metal will have some number of vacancies per unit volume (this is determined by thermodynamics). The radiation damage is actually non-equilibrium and the atoms which got pushed around will migrate back to remove the excess vacancies which mitigates some of the damage caused. </p>
<p>Not all the damage is vacancy type though. Vacancies can also group together and make large voids/pores which don't disappear without really special materials which probably don't work for this application. </p>
<p>I hope that's helpful.
EDIT: CLARITY</p></div>		</li>
