<p>I've been wondering about this recently. Does this mean that its possible in principle that there could be new fundamental particles that act in new, exotic ways, but that aren't normally created by nature?</p>
<p>In other words, a million years into the future, could an advanced society in theory engineer new weird particles?</p>
<p>Or is it more like, what exists is all that CAN exist - that the kinds of particles we know about already exhaust all the possible spins (or whatever)? Hope this makes sense- I've truly got no idea what I'm talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sat in on a talk recently on this subject. The speaker was a modeler of these &quot;dark quantum field theories&quot; for lack of a better term.  Actually there's quite a lot we can say just from the distribution of observed dark matter and a few constraints given by primordial cosmology.  For example the clustering of dark matter implies that the particles are non-relativistic.  Even if the particles only interact gravitationally there is no mechanism that would explain how dark matter would have cooled after the big bang.  So they predict that there are other dark particles that act as force mediators for the massive dark particles, e.g. something like a dark electromagnetic force.  But these dark forces can't be too strong either, since the clustering is too sparse to form gravitationally bound bodies made only of dark matter.  With considerations from observation like that they set constraints on the strength of the forces involved in a particular model and there are even atomic models of dark matter that interact through this hypothetical dark EM force.  So in some sense they are inventing particles to fit what we observe, but these hypothetical field theories would be extensions of the standard model and are aspects of nature, not in any way man-made artificial particles.</p>
<p>Whether or not we can create an artificial particle with arbitrary properties remains a deep and fundamental question.  I suppose a condensed matter or AMO physicist might say &quot;yes, we simulate new and unusual particles in the lab every day&quot; but really they are emergent phenomenon in a system composed of atoms and light (excitons, phonons, plasmons, the list goes on...) and a high energy theorist would say &quot;no, the fundamental particles of the standard model are all that exist and their properties are a result of interactions and coupling between their respective quantum fields&quot;.  Of course, who's to say the fundamental particles are any different from the quasiparticles of condensed matter?  Maybe they are emergent phenomenon in the same sense.  </p></div>		</li>
