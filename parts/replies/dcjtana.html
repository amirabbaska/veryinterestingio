			<div class="markdown"><p>in addition to your answer, the most important factor is the unsupported span. In both phones and glasses, the perimeter is the support of the glass. In phones, the length of unsupported glass is much longer, while as you mentioned, is also thinner than that of glasses. So if you press a rock against the center of the glass on the phone and the glasses, the phone will crack much much sooner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, the sensor for capacitive touch can extend well beyond the screen (some Samsung phones have had an option to change the sensor depth so you can use the phone with gloves, for example). The reason the screens are as thin is because of aesthetic. You don't want your display to be sitting that recessed into the phone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I bet when your screen breaks, it's because of one of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It landed on its edge or corner, or</li>
<li>It landed on a material that can easily scratch glass (e.g. quartz, granite, another piece of glass, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem is that pure glass isn't possible on a large scale. The real mode of failure is due to defects in the microscopic granulized structure of glass called the <em>lattice</em>, which looks kind of like a jungle gym, except in place of joints there are glass molecules.</p>
<p>Little pockets of air or tiny particles of dirt get inadvertently baked into the glass, and it's extremely difficult to get them out. Even if it were possible, while liquid glass is cooling into solid form, the lattice can accidentally screw up the pattern, a defect where the jungle gym were assembled wrong. The lattice defects are worse on the edge of the glass, because it tries to fit in a certain molded shape and just can't.</p>
<p>Both the inclusions of air and dust, and the inevitable lattice defect, cause an intense amount of internal stresses on the glass lattice, which start invisible microscopic cracks in the glass.</p>
<p>Even a brand spanking new piece of glass has many, many cracks in it. Usually though, they're all spread out, so it's all good.</p>
<p>But when enough stress is applied where the defect is at, the cracks rip through the glass immediately breaking along weak points along the lattice, like electricity trying to find the easiest route to dissipate.</p>
<p>This is why the drops on the edges and corners are so prone to causing breaks: the glass is weakest at those points. So many microscopic cracks exist there that it's easy to start a visible crack from there.</p>
<p>But issues during glass manufacturing aren't the only way to cause defects. Any scratch to the surface of glass can create microscopic cracks to form as well. Typically if a sheet of glass is &quot;pierced&quot; with a material that can scratch it, the glass cracks immediately due to the start of the small crack combined with the piercing force that causes the glass outward. It's too much for the lattice so it breaks.</p>
<p>Lastly, it turns out the glass on smartphones is extremely flexible. You could bend the smartphone glass maybe 15 degrees or more before it starts to break. If you tried bending an eyeglass lens, it'd crack before 5 degrees or so... that is, if the lens is really glass and not polycarbonate.</p>
<p>TL;DR Glass breaks due to defects at the molecular level, not because of bending or unsupported edges.</p>
