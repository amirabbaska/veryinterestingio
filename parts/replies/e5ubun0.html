			<div class="markdown"><p>Not disagreeing, just pointing out that while sticky fish eggs is a theory it does not appear to have been scientifically proven one way or the other.  I.E. These researchers were not able to find any scientific studies that had been conducted to prove the theory.
They do point out that it has been tested on aquatic invertebrates </p>

<p>&quot;Small lakes with a surface area of less than 100 m2 represent the majority of global freshwater ecosystems. Many of these lakes are found in remote, often mountainous areas with no inflow and outflow. Yet in most of these lakes, there are fish. So how do fish reach lakes and ponds that are not connected to other bodies of water?</p>
<p>This question was already addressed by some of the leading natural scientists of the 19th century such as Charles Darwin, Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell, who all came to the same conclusion – water birds must be responsible for fish dispersal.</p>
<p>And they had a plausible explanation for this: fish eggs of some species are sticky and can survive for some time out of water. The theory is thus that the fish eggs stick to water birds’ feathers or feet; the birds then fly from one body of water to the next, where the fish hatch from their eggs.</p>
<p>A study carried out by environmental scientists from the University of Basel has now shown that although the research community considers this to be a proven theory, no studies have been published to confirm it.</p>
<p>To objectively measure the lack of evidence, the Basel research team conducted a systematic literature review. The result shows that no in-depth scientific studies exist to prove that water birds disperse fish eggs.</p>
<p>To rule out the possibility that the unsuccessful search was due to their method, the researchers also used the same approach to look for evidence of the dispersal of aquatic invertebrates. In this case, they found numerous scientific publications supported by experiments and field studies.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It initially seems that the article is supporting the opinion/theory of water birds carrying the eggs, yet focusing on the fact that no studies have been done to prove or debunk that theory.  So the article offers literally no opinion and no explanation for the lack of opinion, ie: it is too difficult to determine which birds might come in contact with which species of fish egg, then track that bird, then find the isolated body of water in which the eggs are released, then track said, specific eggs to ensure they didn't come from another source, and then determine if the eggs are viable and if the species of fish hatched from those eggs are in an environment suitable to that species, etc.  Why not treat it like the theory of gravity?  Eggs and fish can't walk.  Therefore to occur in isolated water bodies they must be carried.  Barring humans hiking into the deepest mountain forests with home depot buckets full of Frye, or bears carrying pregnant fish from lake to like in a bucket brigade, seems birds are the most likely and only reasonable answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is an answer on this topic from archaeologist <a href="https://independent.academia.edu/MorleyEldridge" target="_blank">Morley Eldridge</a></p>
<p>In western North America, there is incontrovertible evidence that aboriginal people were stocking high mountain lakes. The anthropologist James Teit, a Franz Boas protégé, was married to a N’tlakapamux (Thompson) woman in the southern interior of British Columbia, Canada, during the late 19th century. A Scottish mountain man/rancher, he spoke several “Indian” languages fluently. He lived with aboriginal people while working as a packer and big game hunting guide. He was passionate about what we now call traditional knowledge, and wrote reams on this for the next 40 years. Here is a quote I found buried in a text where he rather tediously lists all the superstitions that regulated life after one’s spouse died (this is from memory as I am at home, I’ll edit to put the exact quotes in tomorrow <em>now done</em>):</p>
<p>pg 333 “If a widower transplanted a trout into another lake, before releasing it he blew on the head of the fish, and, after having chewed deer-fat, he spat some of the grease out on its head, so as to remove the baneful effect of his touch. Then he let it go, bidding it farewell, and asking it to propagate and become plentiful.”</p>
<p>pg 348: “Indians have a custom of taking live trout from lakes or streams, and transplanting them into lakes where that are none. Sometimes the fish propagate and become plentiful where introduced. The fish thus treated are supposed to be caught and handled by a person who is clean or not tabood….”</p>
<p>This was published in 1900 in “The Thompson”, a Jesup North Pacific Expedition publication from the American Museum of Natural History. It was written long before any economic claims of aboriginal people gained the legal and political significance they have now. Its not written in his sections on the economy, but in the section on birth, childhood, marriage, and death. He has several other references to this practice. Few other anthropologists spent sufficient time to gain the knowledge he had, and his work is exceptionally detailed.</p>
<p>While glacial isostatic depression or ‘fish rain’ might be possible explanations, its a much simpler and obvious explanation that they were carried live by people and over thousands of years, where environmental conditions allowed the fish to survive, they did. People are exceptionally clever at this sort of environmental modification.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those statements contradict each other. From a scientific standpoint, it only makes sense to believe the theory which has the most evidence supporting it. In this case, since there have been no studies, it is not even a theory, but a hypothesis. Lack of evidence is definitely a valid reason for disbelief.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But we in fact know this happens, there's no shortage of historical examples.  Though it was usually done before home depot buckets were around, they often used milk cans and similar tins in the 1800's for example.  Another good piece of evidence for this is that what you often find are trout...and trout are a fish people love to eat, and also a fish that does not have sticky eggs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eggs tend to stick to, for example, the birds feet while swimming. As the bird flies to another pond or body of water the eggs detach from the bird and are released into the new body of water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that birds constantly have to preen themselves, especially waterfowl to maintain the oils necessary for waterproofing, I find it  extremely unlikely that an egg would stick to a ducks leg longer than one or two cleaning cycles.</p>
<p>So an egg would have to survive that, getting dried out between lakes and somehow be in water at the time of hatching.</p>
<p>Unless there is evidence of it occuring, I think we should leave this as myth spread by the uninformed.</p></div>		</li>
