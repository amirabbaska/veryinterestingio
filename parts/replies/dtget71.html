			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in my case. I tend to all of a sudden think about how I'm breathing, stopping my automatic breathing and making me have to manually breathe, making it feel very uncomfortable and like I can never breathe enough, until something else occupies my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly related story: I was trying out for a law enforcement job a few years back. I had to take a polygraph, which I was super nervous about already (I have never been in trouble or really done anything I had to worry about, I was just nervous). The proctor tells me to not think about my breathing and just breathe as I normally would. I ended up failing because I was trying to breathe normally. He said it was because it appeared like I was controlling my breathing hahaha. Oops. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the aim of the game were to guess at the answer, I might have posted a top-level reply myself. But it's not, and I'm not a psychologist, so I won't waste everyone's time with my intuitions.</p>
<p>Anyway, preaching to the choir...</p></div>		</li>
