			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to think about is the amount of radioactive &quot;fallout&quot; which is the long term threat of nuclear weapons is made by lots of dirt and concrete and other things which get mixed up in the explosion and become radioactive by being hit by the intense radioactive emissions from the detonation.</p>
<p>If you have a nuclear explosion in space there's no dirt or concrete to get mixed up in the explosion and become radioactive and spread over the surface of the planet. The only radioactive particles are just the bomb materials itself. (The core, mechanical and electrical parts, casing, etc...) So the amount of fallout produced by a detonation in space is miniscule compared to a surface detonation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I had no idea that's how it worked.</p>
<p>I mean, it makes sense. Gamma rays just get absorbed, beta particles can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminum or a couple meters of air, and alpha particles can be stopped by skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a child of the 80s MAD was a pretty big subject for those paying attention. I did a lot of research on the subject when I was young. It was probably from one of a number of old 1950s and 1960s stuffy hardbound books I found in the library.</p>
<p>BTW, the Trinity test referred to in your linked article was a ground burst, not a high altitude burst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but how much less depends on how high in the air the detonation was done. If the detonation is low enough to produce ground effect destruction of structures (the primary purpose of a nuclear bomb) it's still going to produce almost the same amount of fallout. If the air burst is high enough that it does not destroy structures then it becomes more like a space detonation.</p>
<p>The primary components of the atmosphere do not become radioactive due to being exposed to a nuclear detonation like solid materials do. (The primary components of the atmosphere being Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. (Even water which is a significant component is just Oxygen and Hydrogen.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regard to the EMP. Consider this. It knocked out power lines beneath it as well as hard wired electricity and telephone systems within a substantial area. This was in the 50s and 60s when sub miniturized and micro electronics were not really even available much less common. The smaller the electronics, the easier they are destroyed by EMP. If the electronic components are not shielded from outside electrical and magnetic interference to a massive degree they would be susceptible to being damaged or destroyed in such a blast, entirely via EMP. </p>
<p>Back in the 1980s I read an article in the magazine &quot;Science&quot; about it. It said that at that time, due to the microelectronics being used in computers and power and telephony transmissions systems, a single blast over Kansas would cripple or destroy most of the electrical and telecommunications infrastructure of the continental United States. At the least it could take years to recreate. At most it would return us to the age before electronics and all that we have come to rely on in our present lives. </p>
<p>A nuclear exchange with space detonations over key points of the planet could likely return the earth to fundamentally the time of the Gutenberg press. Sure, some infrastructure would survive, but a massive amount would not and most networks would not continue to run without the interconnection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. So the report you linked shows that significant degradation to critical infrastructure would occur within the area of the EMP across almost all of the chains of influence. It does indicate that the area of the effects is substantially smaller than the original magazine report that I read that was written some 24 years earlier. it does however suggest that most of the mitigation efforts would be to just remove the damaged devices, systems and vehicles to await replacement and to have certain hardened systems ready to return us to as normal a service as possible. </p>
<p>I concede that they effects would be much less than return to printed word, but I maintain that the effects even if not as catastrophic as that would cripple the infrastructures of several critical systems for what would likely be long periods of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting addition to your point about using the radiation to date things, there are industries that can no longer use steel that was produced after the first atomic blast because it elevated the background radiation level of everything on earth, so they have to find and use steel produced before 1945 (called Low Background Steel). This is usually for applications like testing equipment that needs to be free of the extra radiation to work properly.</p></div>		</li>
