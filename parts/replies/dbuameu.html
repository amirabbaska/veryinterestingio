			<div class="markdown"><p>I can assure you, I didn't. I haven't had any sleeping issues. Yesterday I took a late nap and I thought &quot;Crap, I'll never fall asleep tonight and then I'll get my sleep schedule off,&quot; so I went to Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>No internet searches or nothing of the sort. The only thing involving sleeping meds occurred in my mind and on my debit card.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Facebook has been pretty clear about this no longer being the case. That's a pretty big claim to have no supporting evidence.</p></div>		</li>
