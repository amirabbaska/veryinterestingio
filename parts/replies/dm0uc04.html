<p>If you start talking about things that <em>aren't</em> cartilage, figuring that OP might not know to make the distinction, you <em>do</em> start finding fun things sticking out of birds: a huge variety of wattles, big flaps of skin around the eyes, great big neon-colored air sacs, etc etc. Birds are great! c:</p>

<p>(PS: the groups that cassowaries, chickens, and perching birds belong to are all <em>so</em> distantly related to each other that they actually diverged well before the extinction of the dinosaurs. So, sexy flaps of flesh are plenty old!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's still the subject of debate. We can guess the size of certain muscles based on where they were attached, but without a clear outline from an impression it's nearly impossible to tell with complete accuracy from physical evidence alone. That's where we have to make educated guesses based on things like the size of the animal and its diet; coprolites found nearby, for example, can tell us if it ate grasses or leaves, which tells us what the animal could reach (if the animal was tall but ate grass it would have to bend down repeatedly, right? Likewise if it were small and ate leaves we could surmise the animal spent time in trees). If the skeleton shows that the animal would have had trouble eating grasses without help, but the coprolites suggest it at grasses regularly, <em>and</em> we see that large muscles were attached to the snout, we might surmise that the animal had a protrusion that could help gather grasses like an elephant. But without clear evidence, it could only remain as an educated guess.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember, from back when I used to track dinosaur research much more closely, there was some debate over whether diplodocids had trunks, peeing to the placement of their nostrils on top of their heads and some skull properties that some thought were heavy muscle anchor points. Not sure what the state of the research is now, though.</p>
<p>Edit: wrong sauropod type.</p></div>		</li>
