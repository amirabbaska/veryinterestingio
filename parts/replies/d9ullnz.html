			<div class="markdown"><p>The gap, depending on the location, could be 3 million years, which is far outside the intended scope of reforestation. But it's a very good tool to combat desertification, which was the primary intended purpose of both those projects, not carbon emission. </p>
<p>It's a trade off, of known desired effects and uncertainty. If the sahara all of the sudden become forests, the hydrological cycle of 3 continents would be immediately affected. We also don't know what would happen to the Amazons as a result of that. </p>

<p>For the governments involved, it's always people first, so stopping desertification and gaining valuable arable land is a no brainer. It still doesn't change the fact that there will be changes, and not all of them will be good. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, how do we not know what would happen? Hasn't Sahara spread 250,000 sq miles in just the last 50 years? Wasn't it mostly green just few thousands years ago?</p></div>		</li>
