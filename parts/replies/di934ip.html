			<div class="markdown"><p>We sleep in cycles, yes. These vary dependant on many factors including age, general health, circadian rhythm and sleep inertia. The cycles we go through have different stages of sleep and the cycles are not equally divided amongst these stages. How the cycles are composed (their architecture) is also dependant on factors such as your age and how long you have been asleep. </p>
<p>Most adults receive their largest amounts of REM sleep in the 2nd half of the night, more importantly the last few hours. Because of its physiological implements on the neurological system,  Individuals that are awoken during a REM cycle tend to be groggy due to sleep inertia. When you awake at 430 you are more than likely naturally awakening post a full sleep cycle, your brain feels rested. Once it falls back asleep the cycles are composed of more and more REM you are most likely awakening in the middle of a REM cycle and your sleepiness is the result of disturbing that sleep cycle. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I don't use an alarm clock, if I can help it. During longer days of late spring, summer, and early fall, I just check the clock whenever I wake up, and if it's within 90 minutes of my wake up time, I just get up. If it isn't, I just roll over and fall back asleep. Awesome feeling.</p>
<p>But it also helps if I'm able to look out the window to see how close to time to wake up it is. Winter fucking ruins me. I have no choice but to set an alarm, and deal with the sleep inertia. I don't naturally wake up until dawn, and not a moment before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked nights for 14 years and about 6 months ago did a complete overhaul of my career. I now wake up at 0530 to be at work by 0700. I most often fall asleep at ~2130 - 2200. It doesn't seem to matter what I do (including taking melatonin) I wake up at about 0130 and cannot fall back to sleep until about 0300 therefor feeling like shit at 0530. Is this leftovers from the being on night shift and that maybe with time will go away? Or, is this something completely unrelated that would have to see a Dr. about? PS: Changing careers also means no insurance for a while. So I can't see a Dr. anytime soon, or I wouldn't be asking Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually 7.5 hours that is best but there's some leeway with how long it takes you to fall asleep and your body doesn't go through the cycles every 90 minutes on the dot. That's more of an average </p></div>		</li>
