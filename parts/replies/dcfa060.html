			<div class="markdown"><p>Just in case anyone was confused as to what the term &quot;osmosis&quot; meant, I'll try and explain it and its importance in cell biology.</p>
<p><a href="https://keepinapbiologyreal.wikispaces.com/file/view/osmosis.gif/165682427/osmosis.gif" target="_blank">This is a nice picture to sum it up.</a> What you see in the picture is a container that has been separated into two halves by a mesh (known as a semi-permeable membrane). The holes of the mesh are big enough for water molecules to pass through but NOT sugar molecules. </p>
<p>Each half of the container is filled with a solution. One half has a solution with a high concentration of sugar while the other one has less sugar concentration (and is said to be dilute). It just so happens that nature loves balance and equalling things out (you might've heard of this as &quot;entropy&quot;). The water molecules from the dilute side will travel through the mesh into the concentrated side. This happens until there's equal concentration on both sides. </p>
<p>Osmosis is therefore described as &quot;diffusion of water&quot;. Diffusion is when molecules travel from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. </p>
<p>To understand how this might kill cells, <a href="http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/osmosis-on-cells.jpg" target="_blank">this is a nice picture to show it.</a> In Scenario A, the red blood cell is in a solution that has the same solute concentration as the red blood cell. This means that the same amount of water is going into the blood cell as is leaving the blood cell. This is normal.</p>
<p>In Scenario B, the red blood cell is in a solution that has been diluted. In other words, the solute concentration is lower than the concentration in the red blood cell. This means that water will diffuse into the red blood cell and it becomes swollen. If it gets even more extreme, the cell bursts and dies. This is not normal and kills the cell.</p>
<p>In Scenario C, the red blood cell is in a solution that is super concentrated. This means that water will leave the blood cell to go into the solution. This causes the cell to shrivel. This is not normal and kills the cell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look closer at your sugar, the date on it isn't an expiration date. </p>
<p>It has a &quot;best before&quot; date. What happens is that after a few years it can clump. The sugar itself is perfectly fine to eat.</p>
<p>That said, there is also a major difference in how it is stored. Honey is stored, necessarily, in jars. This keeps out moisture in addition to keeping it relatively air tight. Sugar COULD be stored in this way, but purchased from the store it's generally just kept in a bag, made of paper, without any decent or proper seal. This means that over time you're risking exposure to moisture, hence clumping. It also means that anything else that eats sugar has only a loose paper barrier to getting in and feast. Bugs generally aren't a problem, but you should still be aware enough to check after several years of people ignoring the bag exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure sugar won't expire for the same reasons. The main problems with using old sugar comes from what happens if improperly stored making it hard or impossible to use.</p>
<p>Edit: the same can be said for honey of course. Proper storage is important!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If exposed to water the paper bag will act as as breeding ground for mould. </p>
<p>Otherwise as long as the sugar isn't tainted by other products like you used same cup for sugar and flour. It should be fine    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Properly stored sugar should never expire. </p>
<p>Now, if you don't keep it bone dry it could absorb some moisture (sugar is very good at that) and in turn it could possibly get mouldy because sugar-water is an ideal growth medium for a lot of things. And it of course attracts insects that can get into it and lay eggs. </p>
<p>But yeah, kept in something to seal it against the environment, pure sugar should last essentially forever without 'going off'</p></div>		</li>
