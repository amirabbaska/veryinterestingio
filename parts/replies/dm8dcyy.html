<p>So I think it is important to quote the actual constitution here, because I think most people believe the constitution says that there is a separation of church and state in the constitution which isn't accurate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is correct. The phrase comes from Thomas Jefferson's views and his interpretation of the Constitution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should &quot;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&quot; thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State. [Congress thus inhibited from acts respecting religion, and the Executive authorised only to execute their acts, I have refrained from prescribing even those occasional performances of devotion, practiced indeed by the Executive of another nation as the legal head of its church, but subject here, as religious exercises only to the voluntary regulations and discipline of each respective sect.] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jefferson, unlike both Washington and Adams, did not declare national days of Thanksgiving. He believed that could be construed as establishing a religion. So, arguably there is a precedent of a wall between church and state. But there are also precedents against that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is Jefferson's interpretation, but I would argue that his opinion on the Constitution is no more valid than say Washington's. To quote Scalia, &quot;The Constitution is not an organism. It is a legal text&quot; The Constitution means what it says. If we don't like something in the Constitution then we should come together as a people and change the words themselves. There is a legal process for doing this, and we should exercise it. I for instance would like to have a written out Amendment for right to privacy. Instead we rely today on the Supreme Court rewriting our Constitution for us which I believe is a dangerous practice. Without an actual change to the legal document how do we know that the next court won't take away what the current court has promised?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree with this. </p>
<p>I'll add that Scalia's interpretation of the constitution is only as valid as it pertained to opinions five other justices agreed upon. It's no more valid than Thurgood Marshall calling it a living document.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is accurate if one examines the statements of the founders. Thomas Jefferson states in no unambiguous terms that the establishment clause creates a separation of church and state. He literally quotes the language in the first amendment to claim this. Look at an excerpt of the Letter to Danbury Baptists:</p>
<p>&quot;I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should &quot;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&quot; thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.&quot;</p>
<p>To say the Constitution does not mandate this separation is not taking into account the context of its creators.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot; is unequivocally a separation of church and state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The country was not founded by Thomas Jefferson alone. Hamilton, John Adams, James Madison, and others put their stamp on it as well. I understand that Jefferson saw it as separation of church and state. However, I feel that it is important to note that at the time of the founding most of the states had official religions, and that did not change for most of the states till the mid 1800s. The separation of church and state seems to me to be something that most Americans at the time would not have recognized. They would have seen it as all states are able to choose their own religion, rather than no state entity shall have any religious aspect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the time, you're correct that federal restrictions did not apply to the states, but since then the Supreme Court has ruled that portions of it do, in particular the first amendment.</p>
<p>James Madison and John Adams also have some statements explicitly condemning the mixture of church and state.</p></div>		</li>
