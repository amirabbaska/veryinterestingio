			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Which is exactly why space is seemed black/dark to our vision; it was redshifted to &quot;oblivion&quot; due to the expansion of space. The only visible light left for us was from the stars itself.</p>
<p>Edit - Which, of course, I was referring to the <strong>Cosmic Background Radiation</strong>: is an electromagnetic radiation (literally means light) which is a remnant of an early stage of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are redshifted, causing them to decrease in energy.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why space is always &quot;black&quot;? If there are billions of stars, the night sky should've been lit up. Heres some exciting read - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">Olbers Paradox</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>You can't &quot;redshift to oblivion&quot;. The 'idea' around why it is black is that the objects travelled beyond the speed of light. The light hasn't reached us yet.</p>
<p>That said, they would be heavily redshifted, but still measurable (being in the very extreme end of radiowaves).</p>
<p>ALSO blueshifting would take you to UV and beyond, redshift takes you to IR and R.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to the Cosmic Background Radiation when I was mentioning about the redshift. The light from the big bang haven't reached us and &quot;the edge&quot;won't reach us due to the expansion of space.</p>
<p>Redshift to “oblivion “ was just me using hyperbole.</p>
<p>edit: added &quot;the edge&quot; to avoid confusion.</p></div>		</li>
