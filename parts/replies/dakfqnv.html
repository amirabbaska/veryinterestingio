<p>Lufthansa (in German): “Ground, what is our start clearance time?”</p>
<p>Ground (in English): “If you want an answer you must speak in English.”</p>
<p>Lufthansa (in English): “I am a German, flying a German airplane, in Germany. Why must I speak English?”</p>
<p>Unknown voice from another plane (in a beautiful British accent): “Because you lost the bloody war.”</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to ICAO, English is a recommendation not a law; if both sides of communication prefer to speak in French or Czech, they can and do so.<br />
Just tune to ATC in Shanghai or Beijing airport and see what % of communication is held in English. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That will depend on a lot of socioeconomic conditions which is very hard to predict. However I can see the reasoning behind the prediction. Capitalism tend to move production to where it is cheapest. It was thought that when the Soviet Union collapsed there would be lots of sweat shops in the area but that did not happen. Instead we saw that increase in the quality in Asian factories so they would be able to produce microelectronics. You could already see that in the early 90s as Japan were already a big manufacturer. For developers India have the advantage of being an English speaking country that would easily take advantage of the English literature and cooperation. There is a lot of high quality Indian Universities and a lot of highly skilled technological workers. However the highly skilled Indian workers can be even more expensive then the western worker and low skilled technical workers will only get you so far.</p>
<p>It is hard to make predictions but the issues with high cost education and low salaries in the US can easily cause them to get into a huge technical debt. The central and eastern European countries have done an excellent job educating their citizens and modernizing the society. If you want to see how computers are making the society more efficient you need to look at Denmark and Estonia. If you want to be a high skilled computer developer this is where you might want to end up in a few years. For hardware it is hard to compete against the amount of workers in Asian countries. We might see Africa or South America become a big producer in the future but that would be quite far. However what we are already seeing is that factories are moving back to Europe, specifically north west Germany, where they are operated by automated machinery and a few highly skilled technicians. The savings in work hours required is several orders of magnitude so the salary increase is not a problem. The startup cost is more important and currently Europe is the cheapest place to build an automated factory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This surprises me. Do you have any numbers to back this up? Do you know which countries specifically, or is it all of the EU countries? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My prediction would be that the software developers would be Eastern European (Poland, Ukraine, Belarus) and the hardware from China.</p>
<p>I've worked in several large companies that used to outsource development to India but, now outsource to Eastern Europe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. </p>
<p>The point missing from this discussion is piracy issues. You set up a development shop in Russia and the developers can (and do) one day disappear and set up a new shop with your software. They can do this with impunity, Russian law will not protect you.  Developers doing the same in westernized Eastern Europe would go to jail, so it doesn't happen. </p>
<p>As a result, Eastern Europe is a hot bed of software development, while Russia is not. And the education levels in Eastern Europe are very high compared to India, China, etc. So the quality per dollar ratio is favorable. </p>
<p>Hardware piracy is more complicated. Hardware is not sold on-line. You need distribution, packaging, marketing, sales - you also need software usually multiple pieces of it.   So hardware is simply built wherever it's cheapest. </p>
<p>Also, hardware is made from many individual components. Usually hundreds.  So hardware will be cheapest to build where the components are built and that's China for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>While Eastern Europe might be cheaper to set up manufacturing in small volume (i.e. &lt;10,000 units per order) the complexity and cost of importing the necessary components for large scale production means it will never be a large electronics manufacturing location. </p>
<p>By the way, this is the major problem with Trump's plan to get companies to manufacture in the US by putting tariffs on imports. That means you also put tariffs on each of the components too, which will add up far higher than the tariff on the final product and further discourage manufacturing in the US.  </p>
<p>If you don't put a tariff on the components, every product will become two components that get snapped together for &quot;assembly&quot; in the US and nothing effectively changes. </p></div>		</li>
