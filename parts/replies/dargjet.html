			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment got me thinking about sushi, and wasabi.  Checked wikipedia and sure enough, &quot;Research has shown that such isothiocyanates inhibit microbe growth, perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it talked specifically about that, but you are right those things are used in a preservative aspect, but what I am talking about and preserving foods are very different things. The spices used in preparation of the foods I am talking about are not used to preserve foods necessarily more like kill any microbes that may be contaminating the food just from the simple aspect that they grow so readily. Pickling uses salts and microbes to preserve food which once again goes to show that salt is important in almost all cultures. It also makes sense that storing and preserving foods is important in far northern areas where extreme cold makes access to fresh food year round problematic, so you would need to have food stores on hand as you waited out the blizzards, and cold weather. Also a lot of fish are migratory so you would catch as much as you can and farm during the summer then preserve the food for the long winter. </p>
<p>edit:
In short if I left a piece of meat out in the Amazon versus in Norway I am going to be less concerned about the level of contamination from parasites and microbes just from the sheer fact that the prevalence of parasites and the ability for microbes to grow in Norway is much less than in the middle of the Amazon so I am going to be concerned about seasoning my food in such a way that it kills anything that may be growing in it before cooking it versus being worried about starving to death while trapped inside my home so I need to preserve this.</p></div>		</li>
