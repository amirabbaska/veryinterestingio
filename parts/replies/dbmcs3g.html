			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychologist here. There are many theories, but all of them has to do with how neurons and neuronal networks work. Imagine the memory being designed as &quot;long term&quot;, short term (one part here is working memory or RAM). The short term memories are more easily accessable but the long term memory is a highly compressed vast library. Now imagine you have a person responsible to retrieve stuff from the library (i.e. &quot;The central executive&quot;). Memory is kind of like this.</p>
<p>Now, in the library, aisles and shelves can be retrieved by one or more cues. Memories are integrated through &quot;nodes&quot; in the immense network of neurons.</p>
<p>When a node is activated by searching procedures it also unfortunately &quot;blocks&quot; other pathways that the brain stored in another aisle or section. This is why, once you stop trying to retrieve and continue the conversation, the block releases. The central executive however continues searching in the background. </p>
<p>This is why the name of the actor, singer and whatnot tend to appear once the conversation has shifted to another subject. It was unfortunately blocked in a specifikc section, and only parts of the files were retrieved (=tip of the tongue-feeling).</p></div>		</li>
