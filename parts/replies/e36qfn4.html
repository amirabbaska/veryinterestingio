			<div class="markdown"><p>These genes by the way are called &quot;evolutionarily conserved&quot;.  It means that they are so basic to life or multicellular life that any change or omission of them is very likely to result in a nonviable organism.  </p>
<p>For instance, ATP production and usage is basic to ALL life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this post.</p>
<p>You will get the occasional variance in what base material makes something like ATP (pathway of consuming X, Y, or Z to make energy (ATP)). Or how ATP gets used (its always a fuel source but think eating carbs vs photosynthesis. These minor changes to basic systems is how a bulk of evolution takes place. Final good example is how over time minor changes to our various brain cells and  nervous system components led to basic tool building, more advanced tool building, more advanced social structures etc etc until blamo humans.</p></div>		</li>

Like a bridge and a skyscraper both use lots of steel but look different, work different and have completely different goals in it's construction and function</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this explanation. It's like the explanation the lead detective gets on some crime show after he talks to his nerd scientist in the lab. Her explanation is full of scientific terms and then he says &quot;in English, dammit&quot; and then his partner translates it so the viewer at home can understand</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like getting the same blueprint given to two companies, except company A has 5000 copies, and company B only has 1, and there's a piece missing or added or whited out in all of the 5000 copies given to company A. It's like how you can think you're making an IKEA chair until you put the Krinlga upside down and now you have a backwards facing nightstand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to write a paragraph below. This paragraph could keep going almost indefinitely. The only thing that limits it is my patience and your curiosity.</p>
<p>We both - animals and plants - must perform the same tasks to remain alive. We replicate cells, maintain cell membranes, and produce and recycle RNA in the same manner. We burn carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the same manner to extract their calories into useable form. We all transport certain things across the cell membrane and maintain a purposeful gradient or imbalance of others for one reason or another. We respond to stressors like heat or dehydration in a similar fashion. We perform the same upkeep on our DNA. We regulate each individual cell’s reproduction in similar ways. We bind cells together to form tissues using similar methods. In each cell, proteins need to be tagged and managed so they reach the right destination after they’re fully formed, and we do this using similar mechanisms. </p>
<p>And in other ways, we use the same ancient signaling systems to control what exactly a cell is doing, although we obviously use these signals differently and to different effect. Animals, plants, fungi, and single-celled eukaryotic algae all use the MAPK system to regulate gene expression in response to an organism’s environment. This is the system that some plant-pathogenic fungi use to tell their spores to germinate on a suitable host. It’s also the system that anthrax bacteria interfere with in humans and animals, leading to death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could imagine that an alien, one whose life is radically different might see earthlings as one species with minor variations. Like how we humans see dogs.</p>
<p>Sure, some earthlings walk and talk and others stay put and grow yellow fruit. But it's all just minor variations of base pairs. </p></div>		</li>
