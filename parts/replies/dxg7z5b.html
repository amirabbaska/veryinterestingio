			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it’s basically the same reason superhero movies don’t win Oscars.  Ever notice how the “Best Film” type movies are usually tear-jerker dramas?  And how some years the Oscars get dominated by movies nobody ever heard of?  It’s because these ‘Oscar-bait’ movies were specifically made by and for movie snobs.  A Michael Bay movie might make half a billion dollars, but nobody will remember them as great cinematic masterpieces.</p>
<p>Likewise, guys like Mozart and Vivaldi were music snobs specifically writing for other music snobs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mozart and Vivaldi weren’t even making music in the same time period, so that’s a huge generalization that’s just not true. Composers in the baroque and classical eras often were under the employ of the church or members of a court. Maybe that’s true for modern art music composers, but definitely not true for pre-Romantic era composers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I dunno dude, i think people remember armageddon and transformers 1 than whatever won best film in 2016-2017. The oscar critics are just so far out of touch with the general public that very little of the movies they award actually get remembered by popular culture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Was it? You always picture Mozart for example as a high society court performer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, even though he had a job for the court, opera, which is what he primarily wrote for the Emperor, wasn’t really restricted to the upper class. In the mid-late Classical period spanning through the Romantic period opera was increasingly a middle class art form, which coincides with the growth of a middle class between the peasantry and nobility after the American and French revolutions. If you want an example of a composer who was inaccessible to the common person, think of Haydn, who spent most of his career at the Esterhazy estate composing music exclusively for his patrons. It wasn’t until late in his career that his music was allowed to be published or performed outside of their estate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;It used to be that classical music was the music of the common man&quot;</p>
<p>I'm ignorant here but is this really true? Did common people really go to see the local orchestra? I always thought that rich people would go to this kind of thing or have a string quartet in their mansion, while the common folk would listen to a bard in the local ale house. So &quot;folk music&quot; was for the common people and what we now call classical for the rich.</p>
<p>In answer to the OP, while it's true that there is a lot of &quot;modern classical&quot; in TV and film, people don't really listen to it on its own as they do popular music.</p>
<p>My theory as to why is that recording technology has allowed a single person or small group to be a cost effective way to produce music. Composing a full orchestral piece is a pain in the arse and extremely difficult. As soon as you could simply write a song or tune and play it for millions without leaving the recording studio or radio station, people did. If Beethoven were alive today I think that's what he'd be doing.</p>
<p>The logic works for live music too. Given that's it's very expensive to put on an orchestra, the music had to be long (who'd travel for hours in a carriage and pay handsomely for a few 3 minutes hits?) and the venues big to break even. But now you can have live music every day all over the town with a few people with guitars. Amplification is another important technology here.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that &quot;classical&quot; music in this way died out after sound recording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the very rich would have a chamber ensemble on their retinue, but the orchestra wasn’t that expensive of an event to attend back then. There’s a story of Bach walking a month to hear Buxtehude play a few short pieces, but that might be apocryphal.</p>
<p>Folk music typically refers to the music of the untrained, so work songs and lullabies and the like. While not everyone would necessarily be trained in classical music making, it wouldn’t be uncommon to see the middle class at an operatic performance, and to a lesser extent the symphony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if untrained is the right word. As someone who has straddled the worlds of classical and folk, if you take the time to analyze the works of the great folk musicians you actually start to see it’s just as nuanced and complex and internally consistent, only in different ways. I think the main difference is that western music theory is designed primarily to understand and analyze classical music, so most folk musicians don’t bother with it (or don’t have access to formal music education). They don’t really develop a written standard or pedagogy for talking about these things, it’s just something you pick up by osmosis from listening to and playing with other accomplished musicians over time. Its a different type of training that is primarily aural rather than written, and is very similar to how poetry and grammar have developed in the absence of written language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes common people would listen to classical music all of the time. the piano was one of the most popular instruments actually for a time and was found in many middle class households. Romantic music like beethovens was emotional and people loved it. But Mozart and Beethoven don't scratch the surface.  Franz Liszt was extremely popular for his time and his popularity was similar to the Beatles. look up Lisztomania. Or look at Rachmanioff. He was fairly recent. For nowadays popular pianists Evgeny Kissin is very popular for his amazing technique </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I mean something different by &quot;common people&quot;. I'm not talking about middle class households which owned their own piano. I'm talking about the working class, who remember were much more numerous than nowadays and would be the majority of the population.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thrust of my argument is that is soon as it became profitable to make money by writing 3 minute pop songs, that is what the talented composers started doing, bar a few film and TV scorers.</p></div>		</li>
