			<div class="markdown"><p>Also psychologist, good answer!  </p>
<p>I would add in that there are lots of other psychological processes common to both problems.  (I did work on transdiagnostic variables in grad school).  Rumination is one, as is intolerance of uncertainty (it is what it sounds like), as well as experiential avoidance (you mentioned avoidance coping style).  Anxiety sensitivity mostly predicts anxiety but may have independent links to depression also.</p>
<p>Additionally, we sometimes see temporal-causal links between the two.  The most common direction is anxiety leading to depression, which we often conceptualize like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get anxious</li>
<li>Do what anxious people do, which is avoid stuff in life</li>
<li>End up avoiding enough of life to be cut off from important reinforcers, and/or cause psychosocial problems (lose job, relationships, school performance)</li>
<li>Get depressed about #3</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Life itself!  Physical activity, hobbies that give us pleasure, sunshine, food that doesn't make you feel gross, and most of all: social activity and connectedness.</p>
<p>People often get depressed because something cuts them off from some part of the reinforcers that matter.  Depression, in a cruel irony, involves maladaptive responses by which the sufferer cuts herself off from the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was put on citalopram last year for my anxiety and I see that, online, this drug is often used to treat depression as well. I began to wonder, then, if both these illnesses have low serotonin in common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counseling, if its a money thing you can find either free or really cheap. All the professional psycs I' know volunteer somewhere. Not every one needs drugs most just need to talk. But it is important who you are getting your advice from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I'm in pretty deep with the ACES, I am apparently able to get 6 sessions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy from the NHS, but my missus had that and it was apparently just enough to really open up and then stop before any progress was made.</p>
<p>I have more faith in it, but not a great deal, and I suspect the NHS won't be around to provide such services for much longer.  She's tried three psychoactive medications, and as someone familiar with clinical and recreational drugs the months of weaning onto and dealing with side affects seem debilitating.  I'm just getting on my feet at a minimum wage job, so things are looking up for me objectively, but I feel just awful in a spectrum of ways.  </p>
<p>I'm really getting into light evening drinking, which I figure is precisely the way it starts and doesn't stop.</p></div>		</li>
