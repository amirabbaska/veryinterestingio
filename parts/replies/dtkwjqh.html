			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a Chess amateur, but it sounds like you're implying Ruy Lopez is the only opening played and that the first 11 moves of Chess are always the same at the highest levels.</p>
<p>That just isn't true, though. At all levels of Chess many openings and many defenses are used. Some are just more frequent than others.</p>
<p>It's definitely true that chess players are unlikely to choose unusual openings that haven't been studied before. That doesn't mean they don't have a lot of choices, though.</p>
<p>Interestingly, AlphaZero doesn't seem to prefer Ruy Lopez:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not implying that the Ruy Lopez is the only opening played, just that it is currently the most popular at high levels. If you look at the 2016 World Championships, the final battle between Carlsen and Karjakin, for example, was 16 games with 11 or 12 being Ruy Lopez openings. </p>
<p>There are many openings and variations of openings that are really strong, and there are many to choose from, but high level play tends to reward consistency and patience, and certain openings don't really profit much from that, e.g. the Indian Defense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At tournament levels. </p>
<p>They test out new openings casually all the time, but it's unlikely they'll find better openings than the most common ones. </p></div>		</li>
