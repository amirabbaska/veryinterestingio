<p>and frame dragging was finally confirmed in 2011.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to note that the Gravity Probe B data was famously noisy due to a multitude of issues with the experiment and it took something like ~5 years for the data to be analyzed. I'm unfamiliar with how well the final report was received by the science community, but in my limited view a better experiment can certainly be performed on this topic--though there isn't the political willpower to redo such an expensive experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A rotating massive object entrains other objects into prograde motion (motion in the direction of the rotation). The effect is absolutely minuscule for almost all celestial objects.</p>
<p>However, for a massive enough object (e.g., rotating black hole), there is a surface called the <em>ergosphere</em> inside which the frame-dragging effect is so strong that <em>no</em> object can remain stationary with respect to a faraway observer. So even light emitted in a retrograde direction (against the rotation) actually just ends up having prograde motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very rudimentary example is to imagine a honey dipper sitting in honey, and a little fleck of something next to it. If you spin the dipper, it drags some of the viscous honey along with it, which also drags the little fleck. The honey is like space in this example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Richard Feynman offered a theoretical proof that gravitational waves could be detected in 1957 (this had been in debate since 1893), and they were finally directly observed in 2016.</p>

<p>LIGO's observation was obviously a triumph, but I want to mention that indirect observations were made previously. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/press.html" target="_blank">Famously, the measurement of the orbital decay of a system of two neutron stars due to gravitational realisation won the Nobel prize.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point, yeah. I'd argue that gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein early after he constructed GR. But it wasn't clear for a long time that the solutions were physical. Einstein was eventually convinced by Robertson in 1936.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, that was very short-hand-y. What Feynmann achieved was convincing everyone that gravitational waves could transfer energy. Prior, it was not a settled question whether gravitational waves could contain or transfer energy, which if they could not, might render them undetectable. By proving they could transfer energy to objects they passed, that means they also drew energy from their source, and both should be detectable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, electromagnetic waves are things like radio-waves, x-rays and visible light. Gravity waves can be observed using an elaborate laser interferometer setup where they look for tiny (and I mean seriously, positively tiny) differences between two perpendicular paths. For some background, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO" target="_blank">the wikipedia page</a>, and I really enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iphcyNWFD10" target="_blank">this video</a> about LIGO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were a series of experiments attempted in the first two decades of the 20th century to image stars around the sun during an eclipse, in hopes of demonstrating how their apparent position changes ever so slightly as the sun passes in front, as predicted by Einstein's theory. I think this was discussed in NGT's Cosmos, but either way, it's a fascinating story -- several of the planned early experiments fell through for various reasons, giving Einstein extra time to refine and correct his predictions. </p></div>		</li>
