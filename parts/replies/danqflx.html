<p>Not quite. </p>
<p>It was believed for a long time that the mother was the incubator and that the 'vital force' was provided by the father, because ejaculation is much more noticeable than...er...'not ejaculation'. There was no concept of anything like DNA, but one of the leading theories after sperm cells were identified was that each sperm contained a tiny, but complete, human called a <a href="http://www.christianhubert.com/writings/Epigenesis_Preformation1.jpeg" target="_blank">homonculus</a> - a belief called preformationism. Others thought the mother stored the homonculi in her womb and life was imparted to them by the father's ejaculate. </p>
<p>It took quite a while to figure out that human females lay eggs, as the average spludge of cum is considerably more distinct than a tiny egg which left the body amid the other goopy goings on <del>of a period</del> which are a normal day's work for a vagina. Periods, incidentally, were rationalised as a divine punishment meted out to women for having the audacity to be born a woman.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A major (and obvious) objection to this was that the homunculus would presumably have its own tiny sperm, each of which would have its own homunculus, which would have its own tinier sperm... etc.  This infinite regression did not sit well with certain rational thinkers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand the infinite thing. Just replace &quot;sperm production&quot; with &quot;homobculus production&quot; and that would work. </p>
<p>And technically, it isn't that wrong; half a human is in a spermatozoid. It is just like a seed that has to grow, it is just that the complexity of that growth wasn't known, but one could directly take knowledge from how plant seeds look inside, or eggs. The only challenge is that this knowledge would make you think that the seed contains everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I meant to say they thought all inherited traits came from the father and I used DNA as shorthand for that. The ancient Greeks definitely didn't think about it in terms of genetics and DNA. The homunculus details are interesting too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For ancient peoples, I don't think it was easy to figure anything out after a couple generations. Without any way to transmit large volumes of data across generations, how could you come to conclusions which require several generations of close observation of initially insignificant details?</p>
<p>&quot;Only the people having sex would have babies&quot;</p>
<p>Which is basically everyone.  </p>
<p>&quot;Observing [animals] mating cycles&quot; </p>
<p>We know so much now, so this is obvious to us as modern humans, but I'm not seeing ancients come to this conclusion from WILD animals. Domesticated animals 100%. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A couple generations was hyperbole. I edited that. But &quot;sex causes babies&quot; isn't a &quot;large volume of data&quot; and you don't need several generations since people can have more than one child.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Most people may have been, but certainly there would have been cases where some women didn't at some point (sickness, social reasons, mental health issues, etc.).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It depends on where you are, but if you see herd animals fighting to mate with the female and then see the females get pregnant on a regular cycle, it wouldn't be that hard to figure out. Humans are pretty good at noticing patterns (so much so that we often find them where they don't actually exist).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep seeing people overlook the idea that humans probably were aware of sex being the cause of reproduction before we evolved into modern humans.

<p>Except the ugly ones. Being picky who we mate with isn't some modern trend, it's something nearly every animal does to get the best offspring with the highest survival chances.</p></div>		</li>
