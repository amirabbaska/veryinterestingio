When you could rebuild a car with basically a few screwdrivers and sockets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike now, with old cars it is not the technology (mostly electronics today) that kills them, it is the rust. 70s cars are a nightmare in that respect. Plus even if it would run, a car can be still worn out enough to not make it worth it.
BTW I think the golden age for cars were the late 90s and early 00's (especially e.g. the Audi A4 here in germany). Not built with too many unnecessary electronics, high body quality (galvanized) and right-sized engines. Those run forever if you look after them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a 60's car guy, but can see your point. 50's-60's is more what I see as the golden age. AC Cobra, GT40 were amazing. Yea, the rust sucks, but the gas mileage hadn't really changed by the 90's considering the extra emissions crap/weight. Style had been forgotten on most cars. If you want to take something like an everlasting camry then I can see that as a golden age, but who really wants to drive a camry. </p>
<p>Even today, it's all just small changes from the 50's from my pov. Ignoring high end cars like a koenigsegg, we now have 8 coils instead of 1, we have 2 cams instead of 1 ect. </p>
<p>My first car was a 69 Mustang which I still have and my daily is a 2011 Camaro, the 69 gets better gas mileage, feels like it has more power, and is overall more fun to drive. Doesn't handle as well, but haven't done a suspension upgrade yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything age-related that will kill a car? I.e. If you take a reasonably simple/well designed car, give it maintenance/fluid changes/replacement belts, and don't put too many miles on it, is there anything that will prevent you from keeping the car running well for 20 years or more? Hard to reach gaskets maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counter point. Car repair guides were ubiquitous and relatively cheap. Also, libraries stocked them. The only thing that has changed is that the information is closer and cheaper, and more importantly the users of that information can easily communicate with each other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even well before the 1990s, Chiltons manuals were available in every auto parts store and most public libraries.</p></div>		</li>
