<p>Third, They are able to travel WITH the hurricane, whereas other aircraft are trying to get to a fixed point on the ground and have to fight against the hurricane.</p>

<p>Aircraft can travel into the wind too. And often do: it reduces their ground speed (actual speed over the ground) but otherwise doesn't affect aircraft since aircraft are designed to fly <em>through</em> the air. More wind while airborne isn't necessarily a problem.</p>
<p>At altitude, in the jet stream, I've had 100+ knot headwinds and tailwind before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll bet you haven't dealt with 100+knot crosswinds during a landing attempt.  </p>
<p>I wasn't necessarily speaking about directly with or against the prevailing wind.  I was speaking to the differing objectives between storm research craft and commercial airliners.  Wind gusts, turbulence, rain, lightning, horrible visibility all make for nail-biting flying in general, but when you're trying to line up with a runway? Forget it!  I don't want to be on a commercial plane where the flight crew would even dare attempt it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true, but that's generally due to side forces upon impact of touchdown and the outright danger of trying to land where being blown off the runway is a very real issue. We are actually limited to a 30 knot direct crosswind for landing in my aircraft</p>
<p>Airborne I've had 100+ crosswinds no problem</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no way a commercial aircraft would attempt a landing with a 100 mph cross wind.  IIRC typical certification limits are around 25-30 kts max cross wind landing. </p>
<p>For that matter if there are 100 mph winds I'd think they would divert vs land </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the only modifications the hurricane chasing aircraft have are holes in the floor to drop sensors into the storm. It's just a stock C-130J or P-3.</p></div>		</li>
