			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a 1977 movie called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077294/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank"><em>Capricorn One</em></a> that's based on the idea of NASA preparing a manned mission to Mars, in which Murphy's Law is highly present, and it becomes very much a thriller movie. Great cast, starring James Brolin, Elliott Gould, Brenda Vaccaro, Sam Waterston, Hal Holbrook, Karen Black, Telly Savalas, and O.J. Simpson (yes, <strong>that</strong> O.J. Simpson).  On the one hand, I'd only give it 3 stars out of 5; on the other hand, it's a very cool movie to watch at least once.  (I actually saw it in the theatres when it was released, long time ago.)  There are cool plot twists in it, so if you're planning on watching it, don't go googling or you'll spoil yourself.  :)</p></div>		</li>
