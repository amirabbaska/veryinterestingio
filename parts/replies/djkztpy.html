			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional question then, why do toilets not have a rapid shutoff system for overflow. Is it so difficult to build in a system to shut off the feed of water if it's nearing overflow levels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be very difficult to reliably (and cheaply) detect an overflow. When you flush, water comes out of the rim and touches the whole bowl. I suppose you could design it to cut off the water after X amount has gone into the toilet, but we're getting back to price. I personally wouldn't pay an extra $100+ to avoid my toilet overflowing once every few years.  </p>
<p>Edit: and of course I clogged my toilet while writing this comment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those knobs can be great, but if they haven't been used in years and they're suddenly turned off(or on) there is a good chance they will begin to leak. From experience I recommend shutting them and opening them back up at least once a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But couldn't you and it a hole near the top of the bowl, like on a sink, and have it lead past the &quot;U&quot; in the pipe so the overflow can go straight down, past any blockage, unless the blockage is in the pipe and not the toilet itself?</p></div>		</li>
