			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just their smartness you should appreciate, but also their determination, tenacity, and utter lack of fear. Rocket engines today still are hit-and-miss affairs. Imagine how they were 50 years ago.</p>
<p>One of my favourite reads is Ignition! by John Drury Clark. You can find PDFs of it online. It's... yeah, those guys were smart, but more than that, they were completely bonkers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also another very intresting set of books...well, volume actually, called &quot;Rockets and People&quot; by Soviet rocket engineer Boris Chertok. PDF is available on <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/rockets_people_vol1_detail.html" target="_blank">NASA</a></p>
<p>Edit: link fixed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignition is one of my favourites, too! The engineers from the 50's were mad, using stuff like f**luorine and nitric acid as fuels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to diminish how innovate the engineers obviously were and are, but all of us stand on the shoulders of giants.  It’s inexplicably incredible to realize how layered our modern knowledge really is.</p>
<p>Newton spent years writing his theories on classical mechanics, which are considered relatively simple today. Pascal spent years discovering the mysteries of fluid pressure and flow.  Dozens of other scientists whose names appear largely in textbooks and specific wiki pages contributed oodles as well.  This goes for all fields of science and mathematics!</p>
<p>Today this work continues in the hands of thousands of engineers, all who reference the knowledge of those that came before them.  Modern society is at the top of a rising peak of human genius, and its wondrous to realize how far we’ve come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but even Newton and Pascal didn't just sit down and start doing math and wind up figuring all this stuff out.  They did experiments, gathered data from the experiments and then made the math to model the results.  Same goes for rocket science, or any other science.  You go through the method to get the discovery. And it all revolves around experimental data.</p></div>		</li>
