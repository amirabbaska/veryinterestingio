<p>Otherwise that person wouldn't belong to everyone anymore, making the regime just a little smaller ;) </p></div>		</li>

<p>How do we measure &quot;verifiedness&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Admittedly I was talking colloquially rather than there being a precise term for &quot;verifiedness&quot;.</p>
<p>I was implying that besides the &quot;big&quot; exotic predictions that General Relativity makes and have been verified with Big Science  (e.g. gravitational lensing,  anomalous precession of Mercury, gravitational redshifting, frame dragging, gravitational waves, speed of gravitation versus light ), you also are constantly &quot;verifying&quot; the predictions of general relativity by using your GPS navigation system since any GPS has to make corrections for General (and Special) relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay, and what applications or experiments make the standard model/QFT even <em>more</em> verified?</p></div>		</li>
