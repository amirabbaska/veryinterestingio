<p>Absolutely! That's totally the foundation of what I said. The genes need to come first, though, and the behaviour and the environment work to make the genes more (or less) prevalent. There's no biological or psychological mechanism for behaviour to become embedded without the genes already existing, though. Genetically controlled behaviour evolves in the same way as genetically controlled physiology. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not quite, novel behavior can also become embedded and inherited without any genes coding for it at all by way of cultural tradition. I see my parents do X, they die, I keep doing X, my kids see me do X, I die, they keep doing X, and so on, passed by direct observation, not genes.</p>
<p>Or any other of various possible means of information encoding and transfer. Even something like building a den in a certain way could influence the behaviors of your offspring even if you die before they are born. An animal / early evolution-relevant analogy to something like the written word (which is another example available to us).</p>
<p>Or by dying, your meat might serve as food for your offpspring, teaching them scavenging techniques. Or based on where you laid your eggs, even though you've 1,000 miles away when they hatch, your offspring are forced into a trial by fire of somesort that forges their instincts. Or blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Hell, the parents need not even be involved at all! The mere existence of a characteristic predator could be enough to cause consistent behavior across species. My parents did nothing at all decision-wise to teach me, BUT I see my sibling get eaten soon after birth. Boom, that's a bad guy I should avoid. Same happens for my offspring. Whether you would call that one inherited, I don't know, maybe! (I would personally say yes: you inherit your environment just as much as you inherit your genes IMO), but the end result is similar so long as conditions remain similar: you still have a behavior continuing over generations. And some relevant conditions may continue to be similar enough to continue the behavioral effect for hundreds of millions of years, if said conditions are generic enough. One example might be &quot;plants growing toward the sun&quot; -- that need not be encoded in any genes. Growing toward light might be, but growing toward the sun in particular need not be, yet you would still observe it happening for most of the existence of plants, so long as the sun continues to be the main light source available for most plants. The plants inherited <em>the sun</em> itself and thus also inherited a behavior, non-genetically. Other plants grown in a hydroponic box will not inherit that behavior.</p>
<p>Yet another example: identical genetic rats gestated in space versus gestated on Earth (in the same exact mother) will have a righting reflex in water or not, depending which group they were in. Actual experiment that was done. Effectively, it demonstrated how a behavior is inherited by way of the next generation having <strong>inherited the gravity</strong> around it rather than just their genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have emotion but not understand other emotions. There are people who are unable to empathise like the average population, or don't understand the cues of emotion. </p>
<p>I doubt there's really such a thing as having no emotions as such; for a start, people express their emotions in wildly different ways, and it would be difficult to assess it in some other manner. </p>
<p>Emotions are very hardwired into humans though-- people from entirely different life experiences can find similar emotional ground and comprehend each others emotional states. Emotions don't just spring up out of no where-- there is an inherent seedbed that is built upon by stimuli and experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Emotions as we know them mostly come from the limbic system of the mammalian brain. Non mammals do not have the rich emotional life that mammals do. </p>
<p>As far as intelligent life, sociopaths have much weaker emotions. They are mostly immune to feelings like love, fear, guilt, etc. When they do feel them they are transient emotions, not deep seated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Focus on the part you removed. </p>
<p>You wouldn't have much chance of developing a brand new feature by modulating the expression of existing genes. Most just run our bodies, and they have to be on in the proper pattern to get them to do what we need them to do. Not all genes are epigenetically controlled, either. The message here is only a subset of our genome can be tweaked if we want to have healthy offspring, and only a subset of those are subject to epigenetic control. If you want to train a feature into an organism, you've got a very low likelihood of doing it epigenetically. </p>
<p>What you could do is apply a selection pressure and wait for a mutation to spontaneously arise (as mutations do) that makes the offspring more fit for those pressured conditions. </p>
<p>But still, that's not training something into the genome; you're not embedding a behavioural response into genetic code. There's simply no mechanism for that.</p></div>		</li>
