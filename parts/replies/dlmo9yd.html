Things finally came together while signing &quot;water&quot; and putting her hand under water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly her break through moment was with water. Her teacher kept putting her hand under running water and signing it. Suddenly she had a brief memory of a bath or something from before she lost her ability to see and hear and it clicked. From then on she was able to understand the connection between the signs and the object. </p></div>		</li>
