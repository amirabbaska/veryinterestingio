<p>All materials will disobey Ohm's Law past their dielectric breakpoint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that the definition of dielectric breakpoint, or a consequence of the phenomenon that gives rise to the dielectric breakpoint?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A material exhibits dielectric breakdown when voltage across it exceeds the breakdown voltage, which is the voltage required to make the insulator/semiconductor/dielectric become effectively a perfect conductor. (Note that the breakdown voltage is not a definite value since we are talking about probability of failure. So if you were to look up the breakdown voltage of a given material, it will be quoted as either the median or mean breakdown voltage.)</p>
<p>So Ohm's Law is not mentioned in the definition, but violation of Ohm's Law is an immediate consequence since the resistance properties of the material suddenly change. (The breakdown may also only occur in a <em>portion</em> of the material.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome. I have added a clarification that should put the other comments in this thread in a proper context. There seems to be a lot of confusion with what Ohm's Law says precisely, what a constitutive relation is, and how resistance is defined in the first place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if i may speak for all of the mathematicians and physicists in training out there in grad school or otherwise, we appreciate your contributions to this subreddit. They are always stellar. You're naturally very good at explaining topics which are not necessarily easy to explain - and you're always very careful. I know if I'm reading a post from Midtek, I'm not going to be led astray.</p></div>		</li>
