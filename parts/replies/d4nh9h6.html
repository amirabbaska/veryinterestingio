			<div class="markdown"><p>Metal Gear Solid 2 has one of the best stair animations, and that's because the character changes pace when they're on them. You can feel yourself slow down as you tap tap tap up each individual stair. Very satisfying, and if you're in a hurry, rolling up or down the stairs guarantees you hit your head, every time. Classic Kojima.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GTA V does it pretty well, too. In fact, sometimes it can be annoying when you're in a hurry because your character will slow down dramatically to move down the stairs, and it's faster (though unrealistically safe) to jump down the stairs for increased speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also doesn't GTA V make the character go up two steps if you're going fast? Or is that going down only?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised there can't be several speed animations in place. Realistically, I walk at a slow, deliberate pace on stairs in general, but in a hurry, I can hop up or down 3/4 at a time. It was like the 'look at your elbow to get perfect hi-fives' idea; I always stared intently at my ankle and lead with one foot and always imagine I was a beautiful stallion passing Vronsky at the last hurdle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost vs. Benefit I guess. Each animation would need to be animated in a way that looks good for this approach to make sense. With the current way, you make one set of animations, maybe with some variables to account for different speed or stair height, and try to have that look good enough for all situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uncharted has some great stair animations. Especially with Drake running. Slightly sideways, bracing backwards to not spill down the death steps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been playing the remastered versions lately and even in the first one, it was really impressive. I just got to the third one now, and when you try and run through a level and see Drake have to slow down when you get to the steps because he's trying not to bust his ass, it's really cool to know that the animators valued the importance of every movement that much. Can't wait to see how much better everything is in the fourth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vattic in Second sight does the same. The difference is he doesn't slow down, but this was back in 2004 so baby steps...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some games including older titles (Resident evil 1/2) have put in the effort to have it look realistic, slower atmospheric games in particular. Modern physics engines and animation blending has made it easier for it to be seamless aswell.</p></div>		</li>
