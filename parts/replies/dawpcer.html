			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this part of diagnosis very interesting.  That all these people come to the same descriptions independently based on their own pain and someone paid attention and found the correlations.  And even things like the sudden cessation of pain or the smelling of burned toast.  Just fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Medicine has its roots in observation and scientific testing. The ancient Grecian Hippocrates figured out that certain people were diabetic based on their complaints, and the fact that ants were drawn to the urine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always struggle mentally on how to answer the question of &quot;on a scale of 1-10, what's is your pain&quot;?  I feel like I have to lower the number so I don't look like a pussy, but not to the point where it discredits the reason I'm being asked the question.  And how do I quantify a feeling.  Is it my 1-10 scale, as in 10 is the worst pain I've ever personally felt?  I've seen some shit on tv that's a 10 and I've never come close to it, but does that mean my pain number should be lower based upon the fact that I know a fence post impaling me and going through my sack would hurt more than whatever my ailment is?  And no, that chart with those smiley faces that have been drawn by a stoke patient do not help me in answering this question.  </p>
<p>2 months ago I had kidney stones, in the ER I was asked the question as I was writhing around, moaning and gasping for air.  I'm not sure I even responded to the question, I think I just &quot;looked&quot; at the doctor.  I vaguely remember him saying &quot;you look like a guy with kidney stones.&quot;  I found that to be both refreshing and terrifying.</p>
<p>Day by day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subjective pain is a tough nut to crack. The visual analogue scale (stroke smiley faces) are really more for the doctors and nurses to assess. You can roughly tell how much pain somebody is in based on how their face looks, it just takes some experience and careful observation. Oh, and always asking the person how they feel. </p>
<p>And yeah. When somebody has kidney stones. You can tell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply Doc.  </p>
<p>Follow up:  stone ended up getting stuck on my bladder, had to have surgery two weeks later.  It gave me the sensation that I had to pee constantly, but had an empty bladder.  If any patient ever asks - yes the stent removal is the worst thing ever.  Just thinking about it still makes me nauseous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So i'll throw this at you.  I went home one day and had stomach cramps.  I was sweating, felt like I had a temperature, just food poisoning I thought.  So I went to urgent care a day later since my symptoms were the same.  I thought to myself, I feel horrible...something is definitely wrong since I can not throw up like I should if it's food poisoning. Well the PA at the urgent care saw me instantly and asked to just ignore the wait list and go see her right now.  She checks me out, my heart rate is fine and my temperature and blood pressure all checks out.  She does a few more questions and test and she has no idea why I am feeling the way I feel.  </p>
<p>I told her I left work yesterday with cramps in my stomach, they've  gotten a bit worse where it hurts to even roll over in bed or walk and that's why I am here now.  </p>
<p>She then just reached out to my stomach and grabbed me like I was pregnant and she noticed me flinch suddenly.  I told her that hurt, like a SHARP PAIN.</p>
<p>that's what triggered her!!!</p>
<p>She then reached again on my left side of my stomach and applied gentle pressure with three fingers and watched for my reaction once she lifted.  Once she lifted, I kind of jerked a bit and said that hurts but once you let go it's gone.  At that point she sent me straight to the ER, called PACU and said prep him for surgery.  I said why, she said appendix.</p>
<p>3 hours later I was on a operating room table because it had burst and nearly killed me....</p>
<p>So yeah, it was that 'sharp pain' signal that gave it away and a bit of my reaction too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mhmm. That's a very good example of how the two types of pains meet. The appendix is a visceral organ, so pain sensation from here is poorly identified to the area around the bellybutton.</p>
<p>However, if an inflamed appendix touches the inner lining of the abdomen, then it's picked up by the somatic pain nerves, in which case the pain becomes sharp and easy to pinpoint. In your situation though, he entire inner lining of your abdomen was inflamed, which is a pretty serious condition. The sensation you had when the PA lifted her fingers is called rebound tenderness, and it's a giveaway for peritonitis. </p></div>		</li>
