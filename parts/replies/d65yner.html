			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a followup question!</p>
<p>The regional Combatant Commands are 4-star commands that have designated geographic responsibilities. </p>
<p>But we also have numbered armies and numbered fleets, which are 4-star commands.</p>
<p>How do the two interact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of overlap but essentially there's an administrative chain of command and an operational chain of command. The administrative chain of command is responsible for training and maintenance and readiness of deployable units. This is those numbered fleets and armies. When the units deploy, they are formed into task forces, meaning tailored units for certain missions. This is called task organization. You might notice that units might organized by type of vehicle or artillery or aircraft. That's when they are home. It's like their home unit but when they deploy, they get together with other types of units that are temporarily formed to deploy to a theater of operation: Army brigades, Navy strike groups, Marine expeditionary units, etc. Just as students might have home rooms for the purpose of attendance but then students from different home rooms get together for classes with specific subjects.</p>
<p>For example, a carrier strike group is formed of surface ships, carriers, aviation squadrons, subs, support ships. The surface ships belong to destroyer squadrons at home. The carriers belong to carrier groups, the air assets belong to squadrons and wings, the subs belong to sub squadrons, etc. But each of those organizations take care of the units logistically, administratively, and trainingwise with the aim of &quot;lending&quot; them out to strike groups for deployment. The strike group is just an admiral and his staff until those assets are transfered to their control. Once the group is formed up, they then fall under the combatant commands depending on where they deploy. </p>
<p>The combatant commands have component commanders meaning the air commander, sea commander, land commander, et al. Those component commanders are often but not always those numbered fleets and such wearing a different hat. Other times, they are command staffs that were specifically formed for these task forces. These commanders may have no organic units, only the ones that are on loan from the administrative units back home. In general, the administrative chain is the one that flows up to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the operational is the one that goes up to the President, SecDef.</p>
<p>Edit: This is US and also coming from a naval point of view so particulars may vary.</p>
<p>Edit: used strike group example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that level rank isn't that important. During a period of the War in Iraq, US Central Command had an acting Commander who was a 3 star, but the Joint Task Force Commander running the Iraq War was a 4 star. So we had a 4 star reporting to a 3 star. Job title supercedes rank. </p>
<p>Numbered Fleets, numbered Armies, and numbered Air Forces are actually 3 star commands. They are subordinate to the regional CoCom. Sometimes these units double as Administrative units, for example the 12th Air Force administratively commands all active duty Fighter Wings in the south-western US on behalf of Air Combat Command (the Air Force's main administrative unit for all combat Wings based in the US), operationally 12th AF serves as US Southern Command's Air Force Service Component and the Joint Air Component Commander. Sometimes if there are multiple numbered Fleets, Armies, or Air Forces are assigned the same CoCom (US Pacific Command has 3 numbered Air Forces and 2 numbered Fleets, and a numbered Army solely for Korea) there will be 4 star command between them and the CoCom (US Pacific Air Forces, US Pacific Fleet, US Army Pacific, US Naval Forces Europe) that double as administrative units administering military units permanently based overseas reporting to the service branch, and if needed as an operational command reporting to the CoCom. The US Navy has 4 destroyer based in Spain which form Destroyer Squadron 60, administratively they report to US Naval Forces Europe who reports the US Navy, operationally the Squadron reports the 6th Fleet who reports to Naval Forces Europe who reports to US European Command. It wouldn't surprise me if US Naval Forces Europe was disbanded and 6th Fleet gain the administrative duties reporting to Fleet Forces Command (the US Navy's main administrative unit for US based ships). </p></div>		</li>
