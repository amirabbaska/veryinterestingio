<p>Notice how blindingly obvious that is as a response, yet it's never the response given by advocates of voter ID laws?</p>
<p>Virtually never do politicians advocate for streamlining ID systems alongside or prior to advocating for voter ID laws. In fact, they usually argue against it - often describing universal ID cards as fascist even though we're apparently all supposed to have them if we want to exercise our right to vote.</p>
<p>The fact that this is such an obvious response that occurred to you immediately, yet is almost never offered by politicians pushing for voter ID laws, should tell you what the real aims of the laws are.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that advocates are not truly concerned with the possibility of voter fraud (even if that fear is completely unjustified by all available measures), but that they don't mind that ID laws cost their opponents votes, and they're not going to propose anything to prevent that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best thing to do would be for everyone eligible to vote be registered automatically at 18, and sent whatever ID or forms they will need to vote free of charge. Like the way Oregon currently does it. </p>
<p>Republicans are pretty unanimously against this though, so if accuracy in voter population is their goal, why aren't they implementing this? Because they don't want everyone eligible to vote to be able to do so. Convoluted ID laws, paired with laws/implemenation that make it difficult for 'undesirables' to be able to get IDs, are one way to get what they want. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, this is why you're having such a tough time understanding this. You think of ID as a fundamental thing that everyone has. But that's not true; it's not true AT ALL.</p>
<p>The two most common forms of ID that people have (and the vast majority of people who do have ID only have one or both of these and nothing else) are drivers licenses and passports. Many people who live in cities (where the vast majority of minorities live) have never had, and would never ever need, either of these. They haven't even CONSIDERED getting them.</p>
<p>Couple that with the direct cost of getting them (which can be considered a poll tax, something extra super duper illegal) and the indirect cost in time and lost wages to the hassle of getting the ID, and the convoluted process of getting an ID in some states (which requires additional documentation that minorities may not have, which takes them more time and money to acquire, and more complicated procedures and paperwork to understand) and it's a real problem.</p>
<p>Getting an ID could entail going to over a dozen different government and private offices to get documentation, a week or more's time worth of wasted potential working hours, and hundreds of dollars in fees. And that's BEFORE they have to go through a separate process to register to vote AND another process to actually vote. If you think it's more of a hassle to actually vote than to get the ID then you're deluding yourself. You clearly seem to think it can be a real hassle to just do the actual voting so imagine having to do ALL that other shit first and then think about how many people would just say &quot;fuck it, white people are probably just gonna elect Trump anyway, so I'm not going through all that,&quot; or &quot;Fuck it, I don't have enough time to really look into the issues and they both seem bad/the same to me.&quot; You have to KNOW that would be a LOT of people and would totally sway elections.</p>
<p>Personally, I think everyone should stop whining and just get the fucking ID already, and voting rights organizations should help them pay for it and navigate the bureaucracy. However, I'm not stupid enough to think that my personal feeling trumps reality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I think that's part of the issue, and a fair point. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Okay, I can understand that. So it's more of an issue of having <em>another</em> limit on top of everything else that's the issue, and not <em>just</em> the standalone requirement of having voter ID laws? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shouldn't be the burden of a voting rights organization to foot the bill for that.  If the government (state or federal) requires you to have proof of identification to exercise a fundamental right, the government should be the one footing the bill.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You need a photo id to do all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy alcohol and cigarettes</li>
<li>Open a bank account, or to apply for a job to fill that bank account.</li>
<li>File for unemployment, and to apply for welfare, and Medicaid, and food stamps.</li>
<li>Apply for Social Security</li>
<li>Buy a home, and apply for a mortgage, or to rent a home.</li>
<li>Drive a car, buy a car, or even rent a car. </li>
<li>Get on an airplane</li>
<li>Get married, and check into a hotel room for your honeymoon.</li>
<li>Buy a gun, and apply for a hunting license and a fishing license.</li>
<li>Adopt a pet.</li>
<li>Pick up a prescription, buy certain kinds of cold medicine, and donate blood. </li>
<li>Enter a casino, and buy lottery tickets.</li>
<li>Buy a video game thatâ€™s rated M for Mature, and see a movie rated NC-17.</li>
<li>Buy a cell phone and apply for a coverage plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you really do already need an ID for a host of day-to-day reasons. It doesn't seem practical that you can function like a normal person in society without having one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's funny about all this is:</p>
<p>&quot;Require stricter laws to exercise a constitutional right, in this case <strong><strong>__</strong></strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>If you fill in the blank with &quot;going to vote&quot;, there's a group of people who say &quot;absolutely necessary.&quot; Fill in the blank with &quot;having guns&quot;, and the same people will go apeshit about government overreach and how more laws can't solve problems.</p>
<p>Likely a similar reaction would happen on the other side of the spectrum, but they tend to be less absolute about things.</p>

<p>Overall, according to the <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/publication/voting-law-changes-2012" target="_blank">survey</a>, 11 percent of voting-age Americans did not have current government-issued photo ID. Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said.</p>
<p>In a December 2011 <a href="http://naacp.3cdn.net/67065c25be9ae43367_mlbrsy48b.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, the NAACP mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that factors in individuals not having IDs may include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) or a lack of the documents needed to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which also can cost money to obtain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Folk are trying really hard to make it seem getting an ID in the US is like applying for a business loan.  It's not.  In Michigan, it cost $10 for state issued ID.  You have to have a few forms of identification to prove you are the person.. basically social security card, birth certificate, school ID, a bill, blood donation card.. crap like that.  After you get past the first issuing, you don't have to have all those documents anymore, and instead just pay a renewal.</p>
<p>Every single person driving a car has to have an ID.  It's not like it's some milestone or something.  Having ID is a responsibility like doing your taxes and paying your tax tag for your car.</p>
<p>There are certain, isolated groups that would have a difficult time procuring those items, such as the <em>extreme</em> poor, but even they still need ID for things like assistance and jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a pretty good anecdote for how this can happen. I just moved to TX from TN. I've had a TN driver's license since I was 16. I thought getting a TX driver's license would just involve going to the DMV and giving them a valid state license and maybe my social or something and then they'd just make me a TX version of my TN license. Not even close. </p>
<p>First I had to register my car, which involved me having to go pay to get a safety inspection. The registration itself cost me $200 and it took me forever to actually get to the tax office to do it because they close at 5 every week day and are closed on weekends.</p>
<p>Now to actually get a driver's license you have to go to the DMV with two forms of government issued ID and proof of residency and to pay a fee. I have my social security number card and a TN license so I'm good on ID, but they only accept certain documents for proof of residency. These include a utility bill with your name and address on it, a pay stub with your name and address on it, mail from the government with your name and address on it, or a lease with your name on it. And you have to have two from this list. I moved into a condo owned by my girlfriend's parents and I pay them rent directly. I have a pay stub, but no utility bill with my name on it (that's addressed to her parents and included in my rent), no government mail, no lease, etc. So I can't prove I live here. </p>
<p>You need a TX ID to vote here so I figured I'd request an absentee ballot and vote in the county I'm registered in in TN. I requested one and they claimed they sent it. I never got it. So they sent another one and I never got it. The county election commission kept claiming they were sending me absentee ballots but I never got them despite clarifying my address multiple times. I never got one and I didn't get to vote in the 2017 election.</p>
<p>Now imagine how hard that whole process would've been on someone poorer than me who works two jobs and who maybe didn't have all of the paperwork I did. </p></div>		</li>
