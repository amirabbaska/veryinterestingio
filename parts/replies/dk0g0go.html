			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is somewhat simplistic to just think of it as stress. It is actually pretty convenient that we don't experience a lot of hunger during sustained fasting. It is more likely that it is something evolution gave us for a reason.</p>
<p>Also, the main appetite supressor during fasting is adrenaline, not cortisol. During fasting the adverse effects normally associated with adrenaline, such as elevated blood pressure and heart rate are not seen. Also Adrenaline is the main driver of lipolysis, so increased adrenaline serves to mobilize fat stores, so that we don't have to rely on degrading as much muscle for gluconeogenesis. A number of other adaptation serves to maintain function and tissues. It is actually rather clever design on behalf of evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pangs is the correct term. Growing pains, hunger <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pang" target="_blank">pangs</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>noun<br />
1. a sudden feeling of mental or emotional distress or longing: a pang of remorse; a pang of desire.   </p>
<p>2. a sudden, brief, sharp pain or physical sensation; spasm:
hunger pangs.</p>

<p>It sounds exactly like &quot;pains&quot; and pain kinda sorta describes the sensation, so it's not much of a leap to understand why people think it's &quot;hunger pains&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physical stress and emotional stress are linked but aren't exactly the same thing. For example physical stress is increased during exercise but it reduces emotional stress if you exercise regularly. </p>
<p>There are complicated studies of all sorts on the link between eating and mood and stress. Not totally understood yet. For example depression is linked to either an increase or decrease in appetite. Not clear why it tips people in one way or the other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My body mistakes hunger for nausea all the time. Literally right now my stomach is growling audibly and I'm hungry but if I take a bite of anything solid I'll throw up immediately. My mornings are a mix of crazy hunger pangs on the toilet while I deal with IBS diahhrea. Then I'll go about my day until I get hungry and not nauseous before I eat something. I can't see how people eat for comfort when it's torture for me 5/10 times. Depression is weird man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eating high calorie foods releases dopamine, dopamine makes you feel good. A depressed person can eat a huge, high calorie meal, and feel good for a while thanks to the release of hormones. This is why lots of depressed people overeat. This is also why lots of overweight people stay overweight, not because they enjoy being fat, but because they are addicted to the feeling they get after eating high calorie foods.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't all or most depressed people get that high? I've been depressed on and off for many years (making a lot of progress on that the past few weeks), but I've never gotten addicted to calories, sugar or any type of food. I ate much more seldom instead, and often 'easier' food like Subway, but I never grew to like even the unhealthy alternatives that I ate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot that goes into it, but a part of this can also be that prolonged stress can increase the bodies need for key electrolytes, specifically magnesium and I think potassium as well. This can cause some weird cravings and tied with the other factors that lead to stress binging (emotional eating for example) can attribute to the feeling of &quot;my stomach is a never ending pit&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can actually confirm this. I have a disease and I basically end up taking in over a gram of both potassium and magnesium extra a day more than normal people. If I don't, not only does my heart start having horrible arrhythmia and muscle spasms, but I get the most bizarre cravings ever. I will start craving &quot;I want something so salty&quot; but it's not actually the sodium I want, so I will also start craving random crap to try and help like heaps of mayo(which obviously doesn't help either.) It's really bad if I go off the supplements for even a week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like people have pointed out, your diet has pretty much the same effect as going long period without eating and then just having some candy. </p>
<p>Fruits are really sweet. Sure, you are getting some minerals and vitamins you are not getting from candy, but the effects of the sugar on your mental state is the same. </p>
<p>You go through a rush and then it crashes, with more hunger. </p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>Drink a glass of water</li>
<li>Snack if you haven't eaten in a few hours</li>
<li>Shower if you haven't showered in 24 hours</li>
<li>Get up and walk around even if it's just around the house </li>
<li>Say something nice to someone (online or in person)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't sound right, honestly. Unless you're a still growing teenager, you shouldn't feel hunger constantly, let alone <em>starving</em>! Hunger should be an alert that you need energy/nutrients. If your body is telling you that <em>all the time</em> even after having eaten an appropriate amount? I worry you might have something wrong. Perhaps hyperthyroidism, or another problem.  </p>
<p>As for myself, I am one of those 'mythical' humans. I eat, on average, 4 meals a day, roughly 3-4 hours apart. I get up around 7AM, but am not hungry until around 10AM. I'll eat again around 2PM, and then again around 5-6PM. To finish the day I usually eat a small 'meal' around 9-10PM, most often a greek yogurt with nuts, berries, and a smidge (1/2 tablespoon) of honey. I pretty much don't eat/never crave: Cakes, baked goods, candy, etc. </p>
<p>I have never, in recent memory, eaten until I'm 'full'. I'm equally as baffled as you, in the opposite. I don't understand the idea of how being &quot;full&quot; makes you feel good. It makes me feel nauseous, and honestly the last few times (a number of years ago) I did, I threw it all back up. </p></div>		</li>
