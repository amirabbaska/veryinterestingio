<p>I believe you, but I'd like to read what they define as negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. However, many PVRs have an &quot;energy saving&quot; option that actually switches them off so they comply to this, but then they need a minute to start. Most people don't like that, so they disable that option and let these machines burn about 15 to 20 watts while they pretend to be off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just isn't true. I worked as a cable box engineer for years.  Cable boxes are power hogs.  They use a ton of power and the whole energy star business just made them implement something that causes the hard drive to spin down.  The hard drive isn't even the worst culprit.  The problem with DVR's is they are recording all the time.  So they aren't really in standby.  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-energy-costs-of-your-game-of-thrones-obsession/372950/" target="_blank">Here is an alternative source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not - your PC has active cooling to prevent heat accumulating around the electronics. That'll make it feel cooler but doesn't indicate the total amount of heat produced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to actually put it in standby tho.  </p>
<p>Most ppl don't turn their cable box off, they just turn the t.v. off, the cable box drains quite a bit of juice.  </p>
<p>Consoles and PC do pull a lot of juice too, but those are generally actually put into stand by mode. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caveat, every now and again you'll come across a device that is from the stone ages, or defective, that is still sucking down gobs of power. Garage door openers and hardwired smoke detectors are two devices that still haven't brought their standby power consumption into reasonable range.</p>
