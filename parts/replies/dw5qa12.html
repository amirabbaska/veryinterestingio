We know that Earth has been much warmer in the past- we find 50 million year old palm fossils here in Wyoming, and we have fossils of forests from above the Arctic circle around this time period, too. These forests were dominated by dawn redwoods and swamp cypress, but also contained broadleaved trees in the sycamore, alder, birch, and sumac families (among others). Here's a link to a scientific review paper on the high arctic, and I urge everyone interested to check out the artist's reconstruction in Figure 7.</p>
<p>So how did these forests cope with seasonal darkness? We don't know yet! An early hypothesis is that the plants were deciduous and dropped their leaves during the winter (dark season) to conserve energy and resources. But, great work by Dana Royer, Colin Osborne, and David Beerling showed that the carbon lost during respiration in the winter (which could not be offset by photosynthesis since plants can't photosynthesize in the dark) is minuscule compared to the carbon lost by shedding all the leaves. I would hypothesize that the same holds true for other nutrients and for energy.</p>
<p>Deciduousness may still be an important strategy, but why? To prevent water loss in the winter? Leaves are the main source of water loss for plants, but obviously leaves are also where most photosynthesis happens. Maybe leaf chewing insects also play a role? Deciduous plants put less energy and resources into protecting leaves because they do not need them for as long. So, if insects would continue to eat them during the winter, but minimal photosynthesis occurs, then it might make sense to be deciduous.</p>
<p>This is the great thing about science. There are always new questions for the next generation to answer, and you've raised one that I think is absolutely fascinating!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for such a cool answer! I have similar questions about some reptiles, so I've always wondered if the same sort of seasonal conundrums (conundra?) exist for plants!</p></div>		</li>
