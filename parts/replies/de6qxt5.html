			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a comment on a few things because it seems like you pulled this out of your ass. All passwords are stored as hashes, and if a site didn't store them like that I wouldn't want to use that service. Secondly a character is a character. 'A' is the same as '&amp;' to a computer, it makes no difference. Complex password requirements are so that humans can't easily guess them, but complex passwords are easy for a computer to beat. Computers struggle to beat long passwords because they take ages to generate all the possible combinations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways of increasing password security. Either increasing password length, or allowing for a more diverse range of characters. </p>
<p>A 4 digit pin number has 10,000 possible combinations. Including just lower case letters to this increase the possible combinations to 1,679,616 for a 4 character password. Add upper case letters as well and we blow out to 14,776,336 combinations. </p>
<p>In contrast, a 7 digit password has 10,000,000 combinations. </p>
<p>So no, complex passwords (as you typify them)are not 'easy' for a computer to beat.</p>
<p>The other thing to remember is we are talking about a computer guessing the password after exhausting ALL possibilities. You may luck out and get it within the first 1000 tries of brute forcing. </p>
<p>This isn't even touching dictionary or rainbow hashing attacks, but my post is getting long enough already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick comment because you're not only over-simplifying the process of password cracking, you're also rude as fuck.</p>
<p>Most password cracking tools check common and uncomplicated passwords first, with more complicated passwords taking lower priority, and rarely do they try every possible combination of possible characters because that's just not a feasible method of password cracking; it takes too long. Only using lowercase letters in your 5 character password? God help you. Don't use any at all in your 20 character password? Good on you bud, a password cracking program will take forever to guess it. Well, probably anyway. Password strength is just one part of information security, so in reality there's a lot of factors to consider. Having a good password isn't enough, but I digress.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say your password is &quot;password&quot; and someone gets the hash for your password, and it's not salted. How long would it take a commonly available tool to crack that hash? Pretty damn quick. Now, let's say your password is &quot;password1234567890&quot; According to you, this is a good password because it's long. But actually, it's not; a dictionary attack with a good dictionary file would get this password cracked in a heartbeat. But, what about &quot;Password8361%@($;#&quot;? It would take <em>forever</em> for a computer to crack this because it's 1) long and 2) very complicated, so much so that a dictionary attack wouldn't work.</p>
<p>&quot;A character is a character...&quot; funniest thing I've seen all day, thanks for that. The thing about passwords is they need to be <em>memorable</em> if you're not using a password manager. And, hackers tend to know how people pick their passwords. As a start, they usually use words. Or, sometimes they use l33t speak. Maybe even throw an exclamation point on the end. All these things vastly limit the number of guesses you need to make to crack an uncomplicated password hash. But, if you use a password manager and a good, randomly generated, complicated password, the only way to crack it is by trying every combination of allowed characters. And doing that takes forever, even for a computer.</p>
<p>And I agree, I wouldn't use a site that stores passwords in plaintext either. But the internet is unfathomably massive, not just restricted to the sites you and I use. Many small business websites, for example, are coded by beginners due to budget constraints for the business. Not all beginners know to hash passwords with some salt before storing them. I was one of those beginners once, so I know what that's like first hand.</p>
<p>It's &quot;explain like I'm five,&quot; not &quot;reply to comments like you're five.&quot; Get a grip, educate yourself, and learn some manners. Or go fuck yourself.</p></div>		</li>
