<p>&quot;April has an STD.&quot;</p>
<p>The letters of April begin Avenue, Place, Road, and lane.</p>
<p>The letters of STD begin Street, Terrace, and Drive.</p>
<p>All the APRIL letters go east - west.</p>
<p>All the STD letters go north - south.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just moved to Florida, and this is very much true.   AFAIK blvd's run east-west and st's run north-south.  This is not always true, where I live Park Blvd is parallel to 66th st, making it confusing.</p>
<p>As far as North vs South go (aka &quot;5th blvd N&quot; vs &quot;5th blvd S&quot;),in an idealistic society, &quot;1st blvd North&quot; is the Southern boundary for North streets, and &quot;1st blvd South&quot; is Northern boundary for South streets.<br />
----------- (2nd blvd N)
----------- (1st blvd N)
----------- (1st blvd S)
----------- (2nd blvd S)
More often than not some of these will be private, restricted, or residential, so you'll miss a few numbers here and there.   If you could look at a map in broad (50 mile wide) fine detail (humans cannot) then it would be more clear on the numbering pattern.</p>

<p>If there is no W, E, N, or S, then the coastline is the boundary, and it increases going outward.  Whichever coast is closest, in most cases,</p></div>		</li>
