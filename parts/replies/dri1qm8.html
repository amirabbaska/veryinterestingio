<blockquote>
<p>In mammals, the growth rate of nails is related to the length of the terminal phalanges (outermost finger bones). Thus, in humans, the nail of the index finger grows faster than that of the little finger; and fingernails grow up to four times faster than toenails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, yeah, it's sorta related to the length of the finger/toe because it's related to the length of the <em>last bone</em> of the finger/toe.  I'm guessing it probably isn't necessarily evolutionarily advantageous, just a happenstance due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(biology\)" target="_blank">homology</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would indicate that the amount of nutrients required to grow nails is related to, and comes from, the nearest bone. So a long big bone near a nail is able to supply the nutrients needed to grow...</p>
<p>Look at micky roukes hands: huge hands, really weird nails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May be related, but the question is, &quot;why&quot; do fingernails grow faster? I don't think I've seen a definite answer yet, and now I'll be thinking about fingernails all day...thanks reddit.</p></div>		</li>
