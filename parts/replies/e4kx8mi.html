			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you had your tonsils removed?  If not you may be getting tonsil stones.  Tonsil stones are vile - YouTube that shit if you're not already familiar.   I went through a period that no matter HOW MUCH I was brushing, I would get comments about my breath.  Discovered I had tonsil stones, and that whenever I use Listerine (for whatever reason) it would make things WORSE.</p>
<p>Queue up a viscous cycle of bad breath leading to almost hourly rinse with Listerine, leading to more tonsil stones...   Swapping out the Listerine, and getting a water pick changed my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you're replying to but my theory would be the alcohol killing off good bacteria and then the bad bacteria filling in its place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While Listerine is an antiseptic, the alcohol can also irritate the tonsils.  I've also read (completely anecdotally) the same theory about killing off the &quot;good&quot; bits swirling around in your mouth ecosystem.  Not sure if it is supposed to be healthy bacteria, enzymes, or something else, but think of it as hitting reset on EVERYTHING in your mouth.</p>
<p>I can only give my personal experiences, but I remember being surprised as well when initially looking into why my breath was bad even WITH frequent brushing &amp; Listerine use.  Others' comments is what got me to drop Listerine, and that definitely seemed to help with the stones.  There are several OTHER mouthwash rinses that are recommended for tonsil stones, but I don't remember ever seeing Listerine among them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other than all of the above, I have what I think they call a geographic tongue. Basically the back of my tongue is pretty bumpy and, I may be making this up, but I think it's supposed to be prime real estate for bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that when I was a kid.  It was darker red spots that moved around slowly.  Looked like taste buds were gone.  Maybe one or two at a time, 1cm-ish diameter.</p>
<p>I thought it was made up by my dentist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup same here. My tongue is almost always white because bacteria, anxiety, dry mouth. Super gross! Supposedly a white bumpy tongue means you got a lot of bad bacteria in your mouth. I brush it with my toothbrush which seems to help a lot </p></div>		</li>
