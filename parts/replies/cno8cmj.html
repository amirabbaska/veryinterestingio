			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very hard to overthrow an old but successful data format.  It takes time and effort to convince people that the new thing is better, that it is worth their time adjusting to use it, for service providers to start supporting it, etc.</p>
<p>HTML5 video has been supported in browsers for a while but the majority of sites where people use GIF don't yet support HTML5 video, for example, IMGUR only just started doing so (and I believe they don't do re-hosts as GIFV, only uploads), here on Reddit, RES has poor support for it, etc.  Let alone the thousands of forums or social networks that currently allow uploading GIFs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Embedding an MP4 video using HTML5 video is as easy as:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;video src="foo.mp4" autoplay loop&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, about as simple as embedding an image with <code>&lt;image&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Though, some browsers may not support MP4 in which case you may need webm as a fallback:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;video src="foo.mp4" autoplay loop&gt;&lt;video src="foo.webm" autoplay loop&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
<p>There's no reason that whatever software you use to convert the video can't output both formats for you along with the required code.</p>
<p>That's pretty easy, and provides equivalent functionality to a GIF.</p>
<p>If you want play controls (play, pause, scrubbing, etc) then you need more code, but GIF playback does not have this, so to be equal in functionality to GIF you don't need anything more than shown above.</p>
<p>To exceed the functionality of GIF and have play controls, all you need is one of the many frameworks that provide this for you via simple Javascript commands, which make it no harder than just including some Javascript.</p>
<p>An important thing to note is that people don't edit GIFs frame by frame by hand, and they don't manually FTP into servers to upload files: they use software which makes these processes easy.  There is no reason the exact same software cannot be adapted to use the alternative file format without any change from the user's perspective.</p>

<p>Whether you make your clip into an animated GIF or a video, the process is the same right up until the end where you export or convert it into the format of your choice.  There is no reason this needs to be any more difficult for some formats than others.</p></div>		</li>
