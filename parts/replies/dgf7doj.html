			<div class="markdown"><p>LIGO detects gravity waves, but it detects them using EXTREMELY sensitive equipment.  The detector sends out laser beams and then measures if there is an interference pattern in the lasers.  The distances measured are a <em>fraction</em> of a proton (I believe, talking from memory).  There are even signs at the facilities to drive slow as the beam/measurements are in place.  They have to eliminate some artificial noise, but they are able to.  Incredible actually!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, LIGO can detect changes in position down to about 1/20th of a proton's diameter (edit: actually smaller. This was just the 'size' of GW150914, which was <em>enormous</em> by gravitational wave standards).  LIGO is so sensitive that it can sense ocean waves hitting the shore (over 200 miles away from the Hanford detector). Even someone bouncing a ball in the control room can cause spikes in the data. </p>
<p>The important thing is that we can identify where these &quot;signals&quot; are coming from and flag them as glitches. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I was impressed because it gave a real feel for the scientific method as well as giving a really cogent layman's account of the development pf our understanding of gravity. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08kgv7f" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08kgv7f</a> (UK IPs only, I suspect)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If somehow a fraction of the physical vibrations set off by the motion of the truck makes it to the detector, it can mess with the sensitive equipment.</p>
<p>A comparison is that the LHC needs to adjust for the motion of the moon even though its experiments aren't related to gravity. This is because the tidal effects on the dirt surrounding the tubes is physically displacing the sensors, not because the moon is a source of whatever particles they're looking for at the time.</p></div>		</li>
