			<div class="markdown"><p>This is certainly a catchy punchline... The individual cells are communicating with each other by electrical signals. They have no sensory input. We cannot expect any higher cognitive function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is no sensory input, what exactly do the cells communicate to each other?</p>
<p>IS this not aken to having a computer program which accepts no input and provides no output yet still passes message internally between functions? </p>
<p>What is the &quot;seed&quot; for these &quot;thoughts&quot; or do the cells spontaneously send signals? I would assume that there must be some input, even background interference, which is the cause to create the effect (the impulses)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurons are fairly complex just by themselves, it's a bit of a trap to compare them to computers in a lot of ways. Neurons don't communicate different things to each other. Simplified way down a neuron is composed of a cell body that accepts inputs and an axon that sends signals to other neurons. The signals the neuron can send are binary, either a signal is sent or it's not. Each neuron will receive signals from lots of neurons, and will send signals to lots of neurons.</p>
<p>You're on the money about spontaneous signals. 'Tonic' is the word used for neurons that fire spontaneously (caveat is that I have no idea what the composition of their mini brain is so take that info with a grain of salt).</p>
<p>So probably what's happening is that the 'tonic' neurons are the progenitors of these signals, and they cause a cascade of signals in connecting neurons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to ask this exact same question but with a slight follow on, so instead I'll tag along instead of creating a new one.</p>
<p>Anything that involves living organisms will require ethical clearance from the university. In your case, you're working with &quot;little brains&quot;, corresponding to the first two or three months of development. How did you explain this to the committee, which usually has a layperson? If you had said &quot;we're essentially growing baby brains, doing tests, and then destroying them when we're done&quot;, it wouldn't have made it through.</p>
<p>However, that obviously didn't happen because you got everything up and running; at this stage, they are perhaps still regarded as conglomerates of cells, rather than as functional organs. What are your plans for more &quot;advanced&quot; models? Eventually, the models will reach such a complexity where you can no longer regard them as merely cells, just as you wouldn't regard a human liver as a group of hepatocytes. Where does your cutoff lie? When do you start to think of your little brains as functional organs? What do you think about the ethical implications of such complex models?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Producing neurons in the lab does only require clearance for the cell donation. This little cell balls cannot sense anything and - though I am not a philosopher - can certainly not be seen as conscient or sentient beings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is some very awesome and far out stuff.</p>
<p>I was going to ask a similar question, but after reading the answers the bit about them thinking is super trippy, i cant stop thinking that if they are thinking they must have a form of consciousness... just one we can never perceive.</p>
<p>This sort of science is amazing and what will eventually help humans live a long life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're thinking just as much as a bug is thinking (probably less, actually), that is, we observe neural impulses. But these ones work like our owns, in terms of neural connections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. A bug would actually sense things. This spontaneous firing of some neurons is not a reaction to the world.</p></div>		</li>
