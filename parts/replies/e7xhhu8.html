			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. In substations, we typically use something like <a href="https://www.aflglobal.com/Products/Conductor-Accessories/Substation-Accessories/Bus-Conductors/Aluminum-seamless-bus-pipe.aspx" target="_blank">this tubular aluminum bus</a>. It's lightweight, easy to work with, and an excellent conductor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is great, strong, cheap and works well for what we need.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem with residential wiring being made out of aluminum is the connections. Many devices are copper connections, and simple things like wire nuts are designed for copper. Mix them up and oxidation forms, creating a resistive connection which heats up. This heat would expand the metals, which have different rates of expansion. Now the connection will slowly work itself loose over time, getting even more resistive and hotter. </p>
<p>Very rarely are two dissimilar metals combined like that in the utility side of things, and if they are, there are compounds used to treat the parts which touch, eliminating the oxidation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the fires were from expansion and contraction from heat from current. Aluminum expands more than copper. The substations and power lines have less heat cycles than a house, so aluminum still works well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo! Resistivity decreases as the cross-sectional area increases for most purposes because, as you said, most of our AC is either 50 or 60hz. </p>
<p>You <em>could</em> make hollow copper tubes and use them in a circuit, but they wouldn't carry much current at all... And if you're that worried about weight, you can use aluminum wire instead.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That reminds me of another factor--if we are interested in current carrying capacity, that's a result of the heat generated -- I^2 R  --and the capability to dissipate that heat.  A bigger surface area allows dissipating more heat.  So if you take the same amount of copper and form it into a tube, you actually can carry more current before it overheats than if it's in the form of a wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't that only help with if the ends of the tube were open? Because while heat could dissapate into the center as well as outwards, wouldn't the temperature in the hollow core eventually max out (due to nowhere to there being nowhere for the heat to go) and then it would be the same as solid wire?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know a lot about fluids and heat dissipation, but I’m not sure how much that extra surface area on the interior of the tube would help you. Wouldn’t the air inside pretty quickly heat up to the same temperature as the wire?</p></div>		</li>
