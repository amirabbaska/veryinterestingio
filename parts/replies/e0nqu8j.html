			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the majority of what you are saying, however we do not generally deplete our glucose in the first few minutes before we change to fat utilization. </p>
<p>A typical liver can generally store 100 g of glucose which is 400 calories, which is more than 4 miles for the average healthy weighing person. Not to mention we also have stores in our muscles of around 400 g, even though muscles don’t “lend” glycogen to other muscles, there is that store of energy as well. </p>
<p>It’s a matter of system change rather than depletion, but you may have just been wanting to simplify this for the other readers as you seem knowledgeable on the topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. I've been running for about 15 years now, and I know with great certainty that I don't &quot;hit the wall&quot; or deplete my glucose until about 20 miles. I'm an average runner, nowhere near the best, and nowhere near the worst. For my weight and speed, most running calculators estimate that I'm burning 2,400 calories. </p>
<p>Now... based on 400 calories being 100 grams of glucose, and me burning 2,400 calories before hitting the wall, it suggests that I have around 600 grams of glucose in my body at any given time. That closely matches up with liver (100g) + muscle (400g) glucose that you were saying. The 100g discrepancy probably goes toward my breakfast before each race, which would be counted as straight up blood sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While we're throwing numbers around:</p>
<p>I'm a Diabetic with a <a href="http://www.desang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FS-LIbre-iOS-app-screenshot.png" target="_blank">continuous glucose monitoring</a> device, and I run a daily 5k. During that run, my blood sugar falls by about 400mg/dl (I usually offset that with food, so that number may be slightly off, but not a lot, it matches the amount of Insulin I inject).<br />
400mg/dl with 5l of blood means that about 20g of glucose are delivered to the muscles via the blood stream. That's 4g/km total.</p>
<p>My blood sugar falls by ~5mg/dl/min when I haven't eaten, so that means that my muscles consume glucose from the blood stream at about 250mg/min (=1kcal/min) or with my pace of 5min/km 5kcals/km are delivered from the liver, the rest has to be taken from muscle storage.</p>
<p>Now if you assume that the liver stores 100g of glucose and it can deliver at 250mg/min, that would mean it takes 6-7h before it gets depleted, which seems a bit long to me.<br />
Did I mess up my math or is the liver not depleting itself via the blood stream?<br />
Or is the in-muscles storage depleted before delivering (pun intended) stops?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always with the understanding that the harder your organs have to work the more energy is required/consumed. Before becoming a runner I would walk three miles. Then when I started running three miles I consumed more energy by way of calories. Heart rate and training your body to consume stored fat as opposed to food in your belly or muscle I thought I had a clear understanding of. I still don’t see how walking from point a to b is burning the same amount of fuel as running (faster pace) between those two points. What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are missing energy vs power. You are consuming twice the energy per min(energy/time = power), but running at twice your walking speed means you will get to point b twice as fast, and therefore burn the same amount of total energy.</p>
<p>Side note the power company is really an energy company because the bill in kilowatthours or power*time = energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand what you're asking correctly -</p>
<p>The faster pace is about time it took you to finish. I can ask you to peel 100 potatoes, and you can take your time doing it, or do it quickly (efficiently) and then peel some more potatoes if you feel like it. Or rest. But when the job is done, you have 100 peeled potatoes (or moved 3 miles).</p>
<p>If you ran 5 Kilometers in 30 minutes or walked it in an hour and a half, you have to spend the same amount of energy or potatoes (more or less).</p>
<p>The thing is that the duration (and intensity) of the exercise determines the type of energy used. </p>
<p>Did I manage to make it clearer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving one mile (for an average person) costs 100 calories. </p>
<p>Walking could see you moving at 3mph, or 300 calories per hour burned. </p>
<p>Running, you could see 10mph, or 1000 calories per hour burned. </p>
<p>The key point here is that there's little difference in the amount of energy needed to move a mile. Running just makes you burn it quicker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My gym speed is about 6.5 mph. That's leisurely enough for me to be uncomfortable by the 10 minute mark (muscles feel tired) but it's still pretty fast, i'd say. I also take huge strides (assuming the people who've seen me run and have literally stopped me on the treadmill to tell me this are correct), so i would argue that 8 mph is kinda fast. This is, of course, going off the little number stating my &quot;speed&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use really different amounts of energy if you're looking at net calories. I think this article explains it pretty well. It's geared more toward net calories burned walking vs running, but gets a bit into the mechanical differences to explain those numbers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is funny.  I remember having an argument with my first grade teacher about this - saying you should use the about the same amount of energy for the same distance. </p>
<p>For some reason I can still remember it. </p>
<p>Also the argument as to whether a tall or short glass holds more water.  I argued with her that you can’t answer that question because you first need to know how wide the glasses are. </p></div>		</li>
