			<div class="markdown"><p>The best sleeping pill I have ever found is to watch something I watched multiple times as a kid/teenager with my eyes closed.  Trying to picture what is happening expends more than enough brain power to prevent me from thinking about anything else and if I watched the show multiple times as a kid/teenager means I can kinda see it in my mind.  Even if I can't actually remember the video just picturing a still image of the person currently speaking usually works.</p>
<p>Note that low volume and volume normalization are required.  You can't have a loud noise in the show shock you awake.  I even have the display and half of the volume time out after a while leaving the room dark with barely audible dialog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister falls asleep to The West wing every night. </p>
<p>Apparently she’s been doing this for years, it was quite funny as I’d drift off to sleep and listen to the theme playing in the background. </p>
<p>I can’t think of a better show to sleep to. The pattern of the speech is so musical, it seems perfectly designed for that purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I subscribe to different podcasts than you.  Mine either educate me or anger me.  Neither would help with sleep.</p>
<p>I never had any luck going to sleep with music either.  Either I am into the music and have no interest in sleeping or the music is just white noise that I forget is there until it starts to annoy me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll listen to wrestling recaps after the show goes off. Since I likely just watched the show, I already know what happens, and the commentary review is interesting enough to keep my mind from wandering while not so much that it keeps me awake.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll run across one that keeps me up with the commentary, so I'll listen to it later and pick something else. </p>
<p>If all else fails, my goto is Dan Carlin's Hardcore History.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another one I've been using is Coast to Coast AM. Last night they had on a &quot;psychic&quot; that was trying to contact the deceased. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I listen to a rainstorm sound effect on my phone and set it to automatically turn off after an hour. The rain lulls me to sleep and the thunder sounds cut through any train of thought I was having that distracted me from sleeping, reminding me to just focus on breathing. Works like a charm for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I do the same with a fan. A friend of mine showed me this machine of Amazon he got that just produces a pure white noise sound that helps his whole family sleep at night, I kinda wanna try that because the fan can be too choppy sometimes</p></div>		</li>

Also found focusing on the back of your eye lids work wonders. After a short while your mind will start imagining shapes, helps it stay occupied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My problem is usually that all I can think about is work and the deadlines I have coming up which keeps me awake and sleepy for WORK the next day. It's a vicious cycle. I actually really enjoy my work, there's just a lot of pressure and deadlines to it. </p></div>		</li>
