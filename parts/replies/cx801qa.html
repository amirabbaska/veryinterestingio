			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the math account for the depth of pelagic sediments? </p>
<p>If the oceans were devoid of life there would there be little to no calcareous ooze (0.3–5 cm/1000 yr over ~50% of the ocean floor) or siliceous ooze (0.2–1 cm/1000 yr covering ~15% of the ocean floor). Heberling et al in G^3 (2010) calculated that there are ~200 m of sediments over ocean crust that is 65 Ma and 540 m at an age of 180 Ma. I'm not prepared to do all the math this exact minute, but NOAA also has a map of sediment thickness <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/sedthick9.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/sedthick9.jpg</a>.</p>
<p>The below is rushed and back of the envelope, and math is not my strongest area so I may be off slightly, but very conservative estimates should cover that.  </p>
<p>However if you were to very conservatively estimate that globally there are 100m of pelagic sediments on the ocean floor (~3.6×108 km2) based on the above numbers you can further conservatively estimate that 65% of that sediment is of biogenic origin. From that you would get 65m or 0.065 km of biogenic pelagic sediments on the ocean. So if the oceans were truly devoid of life you could expect a further 65m drop in sea level due to the loose of the biological contribution to pelagic sediments. (Note this does not take into account any biomass associated with life in sediments, or basement rock). </p>
<p>Obviously this depends on for how long the oceans have been devoid of life, so depending on that question different numbers could be used. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't believe so. </p>
<p>&quot;Devoid of all life&quot; makes the question interesting this way. I took it to mean, &quot;we fish it all out tomorrow,&quot; but another equally valid interpretation is &quot;never hosted life.&quot; Biomass figures won't include shells and sediments and corals, etc, but other interpretations could.</p>
<p>Neither is wrong, just different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly why I asked. Devoid of life could mean at midnight GMT yesterday everything that was living was zapped out of the oceans and onto a scale, and we are looking at how much our oceans dropped, or it could mean never hosted life. </p>
<p>I looked at it from the latter angle because I am geochemist studying the deep biosphere, who previously studied pelagic sediments. And if it were always devoid of life our oceans would be vastly different that they are now. </p>
<p>But as you say, neither are wrong, the numbers are just vastly different in orders of magnitude.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if there was no life, the mass of that sediment wouldn't just not exist, life doesn't create it from nothing. it would just never have been turned into organic sediment. wouldn't it all still be there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is safe to say we do not know what exactly would be going on. There would be entirely different fluxes of elements between land, water, and air. If there is no biomass in the oceans, but there is biomass on land, it is possible that a large amount of the element fixing would be transfered to land processes. Alternatively, you would be looking at entirely abiogenic processes related to accretion and weathering which could keep all of the mass within the oceans, but in different forms. Another possibility is that you would have a marked increase in salinity, and a complete change in trace element ratios dissolved in the ocean water. </p>
<p>One thing that can be conclusively said is that if there is no life in the oceans we could have extraordinarily different oceanic chemistry. While the primary subduction and rifting processes would not change, any and all chemistry below the 120 degree C isotherm could be remarkably different. Silica, and carbon which are two major elements in both rock chemistry and ocean life would have entirely different fluxes. </p></div>		</li>

Also, because the surface of the earth is spherical, and not flat, a 5 fold increase in volume would not correspond to a 5 fold increase in height of the paste.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was my first thought. Are we assuming that the water content of the biomass is simply lost with the creature? That seems a little arbitrary to me. IMO we should at least assume that the water is there whether the lifeform is built around some of it or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more definitive than being composed mostly of water, we know that the fish and plankton are neutrally bouyant, neither bobbing on the surface nor stuck to the sea floor. Therefore, they must have a density equal to that of seawater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the density of the fish were statistically lower than that of water then they would constantly be accelerating to the surface. They control their buoyancy around a neutral point. So in this situation, volume and mass are largely equivalent-I'm sure there is some error, but it is not significant enough to change the order of magnitude of the result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The error would be in the fact that most fish maintain buoyancy by having air in their swim bladder (with a few exceptions, notably sharks), so the &quot;solid&quot; parts of a fish are a bit more dense than water, and the air in that bladder compensates to make the fish have a density equal to that of water.</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer would be slightly lower than /u/VeryLittle calculated (but the difference is not very significant anyway!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a five fold increase of volume, it's a fivefold increase of a (very small!) volume delta. So the height would be very, very close to being fivefold as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, 10 billion tonnes of something with a density of 1g/cc has a volume of 10e9 m^(3). So this would be a ball with a ~3 km radius. This is comparable to a normal mountain. Not Everest, but certainly not a hill either. </p></div>		</li>
