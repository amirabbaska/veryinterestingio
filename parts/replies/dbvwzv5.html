<blockquote>
<p>It's what you always get when you tell cells or leaves or branches or scales to just &quot;grow more of yourself.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a very powerful sentence and I want to expand a bit on it:</p>
<p>It's not that nature discovers and uses &quot;magic&quot; numbers like the golden ratio or <em>pi</em> or <em>e</em>. The universe is mathematically consistent and when you look at billions (of people) made of billions (of cells) made of billions of atoms you're bound to find some fundamental mathematical concepts propagate from the molecules in DNA all the way up to the organization of human society. This has two important consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These &quot;magic&quot; numbers are found in nature; and</p>
</li>
<li>if you look hard enough, you will find them almost everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>There's no magic in finding the golden ratio in so many natural classes. It's like looking at round structures and finding <em>pi</em> or like looking at two apples and finding 1+1=2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most cases where growth is proportional to the population you just end up with exponential growth. The model that gives you Fibonacci numbers is usually just slightly too simple, and you end up with a slightly different ratio of 'new' and 'old' cells / creatures / people.</p></div>		</li>
