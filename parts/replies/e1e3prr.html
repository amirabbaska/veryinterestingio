			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for the length of time is to allow the power to completely drain, without it draining, it doesn't forget. Different devices may take longer, so everyone ballparks a length of time long enough to be safe.</p>
<p>Watch the little light on your laptops power brick next time you unplug it from the wall. It will stay on for a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>
