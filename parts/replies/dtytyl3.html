			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting! </p>
<p>Though i don't think this answers the question. I'm pretty sure OP is asking for the length of usage of lenses before you have to throw them out.</p>
<p>But I learned something new, so thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask you if 1 or 2 week contact lenses are safe to wear? As in, putting them on Monday morning and taking them off Sunday night. Would you be able to recommend the best type for long use? I have -5.75 and -5.50 eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only do that with contacts that are made for that like Air Optix Night &amp; Day. If you do that with any other contact you run the danger of fucking up your cornea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you have specific contacts that allow that I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it from experience. </p>
<p>While putting the contacts in initially there’s always a chance you’ve contaminated them with bacteria/viruses. Showering with contacts in is another time when you could introduce an infection.</p>
<p>In normal usage you would take them out overnight and any nasties could be flushed out / fought off. With extended wear contacts they just sit there between the contact and your eye and multiply. </p>
<p>Corneal ulcers are not fun and can seriously screw up your eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this! Also there's a difference in thickness between the types of contacts. Daily wear contacts are much thinner than monthly. </p></div>		</li>
