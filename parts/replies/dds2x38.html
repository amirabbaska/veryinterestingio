			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I guess it might. But you should keep your device cold all the time, not only during charging.</p>
<p>If manufactures employed heat draining techniques similarly with what they do on microprocessors, batteries would last longer.</p>
<p>However, nowadays our battery life expectancy is considered &quot;good enough&quot;. On my old Nexus 4, I used its original battery to its last breath. It took four years.</p>
<p>Also, unlike other critical parts, they're cheap and relatively easy to replace. So that's not really a big deal.</p></div>		</li>
