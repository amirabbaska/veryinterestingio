			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends which way you want the rules of physics to break. If your mass energy was converted to momentum, then the answer would “lots of things very fast and few of them good for you”.
If your mass energy just vanished, then first of all you wouldn’t be affected by gravity anything like you presumably are now, so it’s straight to space for you. You’re also not held together by gravity, so you wouldn’t immediately disintegrate just because of that.
But the question I’m not sure of is if it’s possible for a massless particle to move at less than the speed of light. If we’re going to break a physics rule, this is the most interesting one for you, at least for about a minute. The classical equations for you burning up as you leave the atmosphere don’t seem to apply without classical momentum transfer, and you’re not even accelerating (actually, for the first time in your life).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's very natural here on Earth to equate the word &quot;mass&quot; with the word &quot;weight.&quot; In fact, in our everyday lives, we can usually get away with using the two terms interchangeably. A massive thing is also going to be heavy.</p>
<p>It's actually more accurate to define mass as &quot;how much work it takes to push the thing down the road.&quot; Again, very similar to &quot;weight,&quot; just a subtle distinction.</p>
<p>If I'm trying to push an elephant on roller skates down the road, and attain a speed of, say, 35 miles per hour, I have to do a lot of work. </p>
<p>I can either do this work all at once, maybe by firing the elephant out of a cannon, or I can spread the work out over time, pushing the elephant gradually faster and faster until the desired speed is attained.</p>
<p>Later, I can calculate how much work it took to get my elephant up to speed. (There are measurements for this stuff like joules and newtons.) In the end, I will find that, regardless of my method--either shooting the elephant out of a cannon, or slowly pushing it-- the amount of work required to reach 35 miles per hour was exactly the same. It takes a certain, specific amount of work to get an object of a certain mass up to a certain speed.</p>
<p>With a massless object like a photon, there's no work at all required. The photon does not have to &quot;explode&quot; out of its flashlight as though it was shot from a cannon, it does not have to gradually accelerate over time, it's already there. The &quot;work,&quot; in a sense, has already been done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This view that &quot;it's all theories&quot; etc isn't really valid.</p>
<p>I struggled with similar thoughts. I did GCSE science and they taught me an atom/protons/neutrons were the base building block and couldn't be broken down. They were like planets with the electrons whizzing around in orbits.</p>
<p>That's the bohr model of the atom.</p>
<p>Then I did A-level and we found out that protons and neutrons were made from quarks etc. I got to particle and quantum physics at university and we learned that electrons don't &quot;orbit&quot; anything but hang out in &quot;clouds&quot; of probability (that of course, collapse I'd you look at them).</p>
<p>Slowly, though my education I've gone from thousands of years old knowledge, to hundreds of years old, and eventually at degree level to science discovered <em>this century!</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout a lot of this I leaned &quot;so I've been lied to. They taught me stuff that was <em>wrong</em>. Plain old incorrect, but because it was simpler they thought me it. I became very distrustful.</p>
<p>But then I realised, especially when you learn some of the <em>real</em> quirky stuff like quantum physics, that ultimately all science does is <strong>model</strong> our environment.</p>
<p>Take kinetics. Newton's laws. You learn about them in school. You do experiments that &quot;prove&quot; them. They stood for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The. Einstein ruined it. Newton's laws are <em>wrong</em>. They miss out relativity. They break down.</p>
<p>Except, when I want to solve most day to day kinetic problems <em>I still use Newton's laws</em>. Because it models the situation fine for most purposes. Just like a chemist might use Bohr's model of the atoms just fine <em>knowing that it isn't the most 'true' model</em>, it is perfectly fit for purpose for chemicals calculations etc.</p>
<p>Newton's laws are still a good model. Bohr's atoms is still a good model. We've found more accurate ones, now, but that doesn't invalidate the usefulness of the original ones in predicting what our environment does.</p>
<p>Even if we suddenly discovered that light want non-zero mass... It would likely still be taught as that for almost all students because it's so fun useful that it works in all our modeling and for the super vast majority of calculations, it works damn fine (or we'd have noticed it by now).</p>
<p>When you think about it, these concrete ideas of &quot;truth&quot; in our worldviews is very artificial. You see something green? That's just an arbitrary wavelength of light hitting your eye and being processed by your brain. The object may be transparent to other frequencies. You touch it? Feel solid? It's not. It's almost all empty space, by a vast proportion. But when the atoms of your mostly empty space hand gets close enough there are some wierd forces that push them away.</p>
<p>But your brain has a good model to help explain it. That's a solid green object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question, if they are massless, how can they push a solar sail?  </p>
<p>Also, if E=MC^2 and they have E, how can they not have M (if C is constant) ?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>To accelerate the solar sail, force from the photon is required.  F=MA</p>
<p>If the M of the photon is 0 then the F = 0</p>
<p>Therefore, if solar sails work, (and they do) then either photons have mass or Newton and Einstein were wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E=mc^2 is a simplification of the true equation, neglecting relativistic effects. The full equation is E^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2.</p>
<p>Since photons have no mass (but they do have momentum), that simplifies down to E=pc for a photon.</p>
<p>Basically, you can't take E=mc^2, F=ma, and a lot of the other equations taught in basic physics at face value. They're approximations that only hold true for objects that are either large mass and/or slow moving (not moving at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light). The (truer) relativistic equations are more complex.</p>

<p>Newton was... Einstein must've been also.</p>
<p>Not wrong in the sense they were completely wrong... just that they weren't completely right.</p>
<p>Since people already explained how can photons push a solar sail. (They have momentum) I'll give one simple example about how Newton was &quot;wrong&quot;... but it doesn't matter to our day to day.</p>
<hr />
<p>You probably learned in schools that if you are traveling on a car at 30mph and throw a ball forward at 10mph the ball will travel at 40mph, and if you throw backwards it will travel at 20mph.</p>
<p>Well... this is wrong. The speeds don't add like that. The ball in your frame of reference will be at 10mph... but to a person outside the car. you will be at 30mph and the ball at something like 39.99999999 mph... not 40.</p>
<p>For you to understand imagine you are on a ship at 200.000 km/s (2/3 light speed)... and a small ship detaches from your ship at 200.000km/s. For you the small ship will travel at 200.000 km/s. But from someone outside both ships... the small ship will not be at 400.000km/s (1 1/3 light speed) not even 300.000 km/s. </p>
<p>Newtonian physics is &quot;wrong&quot;... because speeds don't add like you learned in schools. But for all intents and purposes of most people... it is good enough.</p>
<hr />
<p>TL;DR: Everything you learned in schools is wrong. EVERYTHING.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But it does not just appear slower, it does slow down. When Newton blocked the path of sunlight with a prism, the light behaved predictably, continuing to take the path of least <del>resistance</del> time, but a path which happened to significantly differ from the path it had taken before in atmosphere, which is evidenced by the fact that it did refract and result in his observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because materials are made of molecules wich are made of atomes. When a photon enters in collision with that it will get absorbed which will gives the atom to much energy. In turn, this energy will get re-emitted to go back to a stable state. Depending on the materials property, it will emit a specific wavelength. Which is why different objects have different colors. In a transparent object the photons will also get absorbed and emitted. Between each atom, the photon goes at the speed of light. What gives the impression that it is slowing down is the absorption/emission delay on each particles.</p></div>		</li>
