			<div class="markdown"><p>Now of course that would lead to issues when 2 kingdoms are trading with each other (let's take a little detour here). Alpha's soldiers might go shopping in Beta, and Beta shopkeepers say, I don't want to take Alpha Dollars because I don't need to pay taxes to the King of Alpha. So how do they decide who uses what currency? </p>
<p>Well, imagine Alpha Kingdom is by far the biggest strongest kingdom in the area. And the Alpha Kingdom is the only one that grows the apples. Now, the Alpha soldiers might say, I understand you don't need Alpha Dollars to pay taxes. But all the apple sellers in the area are from Alpha, and they will only take Alpha Dollars. So now shopkeepers in Beta and Theta might say, hmm... okay, I wouldn't mind some apples. I guess I'll take the Alpha Dollars from these guys because they're not worthless to me. And I'll take Beta and Theta Dollars from the locals. </p>
<p>This is kind of how, in the world today, we don't have a universal currency. But we do have a very popular currency in the form of US Dollars. Businesses often accept US dollars for large, international transactions because they are not worthless in nearly every part of the world. The USA produces a lot of things that people want to buy, and to buy them, you need US Dollars. </p>
<p>Now back to answering the question. We mentioned that kings printing their own currency would eventually have issues. Let's talk about that for a while because that's another reason we don't have a universal currency system. </p>
<p>So imagine the King of Alpha is busily printing Alpha Dollars. He prints more and more and more. After a while, there are so many Alpha Dollars around that each Alpha Dollar is worth very little, because there are so many of them. This leads to inflation - because every Alpha Dollar is worth very little, shopkeepers want many, many more of them. That causes problems for people who earn Alpha Dollars. Maybe a soldier gets 10 Alpha Dollars on Friday. A bun costs 2 Alpha Dollars. On Saturday he goes to the shop but the shopkeeper says, well, now this bun will cost 4 Alpha Dollars because yesterday night the king just printed a ton of Alpha Dollars.</p>
<p>As a result, people paid in Alpha Dollars can't afford as much. They start wishing they could be paid in pork or apples or buns or something that has value. When that happens, the king loses his power to print money because people don't want his worthless Alpha Dollars anymore. This has happened in Zimbabwe, Singapore under the Japanese Occupation during WW2 and China's Yuan Dynasty. </p>
<p>The opposite can also happen, where the value of your money keeps going up. So today, my 2 Beta Dollars can buy me 1 bun. Tomorrow, my 2 Beta Dollars can buy me 2 buns. That's also a problem because then nobody wants to buy anything. Everyone just wants to hoard their Beta Dollars. Why would I spend Beta Dollars on a boat, when I know if I keep my Beta Dollars, next year I can buy 2 boats? But then the king has a problem because you levy taxes when people buy things as well. Like, your country might have VAT or services tax or whatever right? If nobody buys anything, I can't tax that and I make less money. </p>
<p>But inflation and deflation are not always bad. Imagine, as king, you borrowed 100 Alpha Dollars to build a new road. Now it's time to pay the money back. Well, you could just print lots of Alpha Dollars. Suddenly, 100 Alpha Dollars is almost worthless. You pay back the lenders much less value than you borrowed. This is just one example of the great power that comes with controlling currency and money supply. As long as you don't push it too far, you're in a very, very powerful position. </p>
<p>Now, who decides whether there are too many dollars or too few dollars in a community? Basically, it all comes down to how much people want your currency, which comes down to how useful it is for them. </p>
<p>Remember when the king said, I'll only take taxes in Alpha Dollars? What he was doing was making Alpha Dollars useful so people would want them. Once people started accepting them as payment for many other goods and services like apples and pigs and boats, they became even more valuable. Now, I can use my Alpha Dollars for so many things! I can use them for taxes, or apples, or pigs, or boats! If there's very little to spend Alpha Dollars on, but a lot of Alpha Dollars, you get worthless Alpha Dollars. If there're a lot of things to spend on but few Alpha Dollars, you get very precious Alpha Dollars. </p>
<p>So, this kind of explains why some places DO have a &quot;universal&quot; currency. For instance, the USA is 50 states. But all use the same currency. Because if I had Michigan Dollars, maybe I could only buy cars with them. If I didn't want a car, I wouldn't want a Michigan Dollar. So they become less valuable. But the 50 states have the US Dollar. So with a US Dollar I can buy cars from Michigan and corn from Iowa and lobsters from Boston and cheese from Wisconsin. Even if I didn't want any of those things, chances are I'd find someone who did. So the US Dollar has value because it's useful. </p>
<p>The problem with that is, problems in a few states can affect the value of your currency. So let's say Michigan's car industry isn't doing well. People prefer Japanese cars. Since people don't need US Dollars to buy cars, the value of the US Dollar falls. People in Texas will be complaining - why do we suddenly have less valuable US Dollars because of problems in some other state? </p>
<p>In the USA, that's not so bad because there is a federal government to keep things more or less standard. For instance, it might take oil money from Texas and use it to help car manufacturers in Michigan. One day, the price of oil might drop and car manufacturers in Michigan might have recovered, and then Michigan's money will be used to hep Texas (I'm simplifying A LOT). </p>
<p>But, in a place like Europe that has many different governments but one currency, that doesn't work. Some countries have very strong economies and they should have very valuable currencies. Others have very weak economies and should have less valuable currencies. But they are all stuck with one currency, the Euro. To give one simple example of a problem that causes - Greece is nearly bankrupt and wants to build a road to boost its economy. If it had its own currency it would print money and pay for the road that way. But it can't, because it's stuck with the Euro. If they said, hey, let's print more Euros and make them less valuable so I can build my road, Germany would scream and say, hey, I've saved a ton of Euros, I don't want you making my Euros less valuable. That's just one very simple example of a complex issue, of course. </p>
<p>In summary, we don't have a universal currency because: </p>
<ol>
<li>Different communities evolve different currencies. </li>
<li>Each government wants its own currency to give it a lot of power over its citizens. </li>
<li>Conversely, when a government doesn't have its own currency, it loses a lot of power. </li>
<li>When there's one currency for many countries, each with a different government, it's difficult to make the value of the currency accurately reflect the state of each economy. </li>

<p>This is what every voter should read to understand that the treasury selling a bond isn't &quot;debt&quot; the same way your payday loan is &quot;debt.&quot; If the interest rate is lower than or equal to inflation, and inflation is at a sustainable rate, you should (usually) buy as much debt as the market allows. </p>
<p>People complain about &quot;raising the deficit&quot;, the deficit and all US debt could be erased to 0 instantly by the Treasury just printing trillions of dollars. But that'd be a shitty idea. </p>
<p>Tl;dr National monetary policy =\= personal finance, but political rhetoric equates the two. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to draw the line between a resource and a currency... Probably someone with a true economics background (which I don't have) will be able to explain that.</p>
<p>I know cryptocurrencies are like the currencies in the first theory - they have value because a community comes together and agrees it has value. In fact, cryptocurrencies were created partly to take power away from governments and their ability to print money. They're not &quot;legal tender&quot; - you can't pay your taxes in them, just like you can't pay taxes in cigarettes even though you might be a prisoner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but 1 alpha equals 2 beta then why not pay 1/2 alpha. It’s the same. That is the OPs point. Why does it have to be in one set currency versus another.  The government doesn’t set the market value for corn, the market does. So whether that at one alpha or 2 betas it doesn’t matter. If the government prints more money then it becomes 2 alpha or 4 beta. But regardless the market value is still the same (1 corn equals one apple). So a universal currency would fluctuate to the market that is in place.  I guess the point is that the government can’t get their hands on additional money without forcing people to give it to them via taxes rather than printing it.  To me it is all silly because things are just worth an amount regardless of if there is cash present. There will never be enough dollar bills for everyone to cash out at once...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct in saying currencies have a market value. But that value is changing all the time depending on government decisions as well as things beyond government control (my answer details some of those factors). </p>
<p>So, to use your example, maybe 1alpha is worth 2 betas today. Then there's an earthquake in beta and a lot of farmland and factories are destroyed. The value of the beta should drop. 1 alpha is no longer worth 2 betas. </p>
<p>If the the two countries were using a universal currency, then the currency's value would not reflect the true market value of beta's economy and (hypothetical) currency (see my example of weak economies in the Euro). </p>
<p>What you are suggesting is like pegging currency A to currency B - dictating that this is the exchange rate forever. That has been done many times in the past and has generally ended in tears. </p></div>		</li>
