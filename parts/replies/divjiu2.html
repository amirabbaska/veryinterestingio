			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pilot, I can tell you that this man is correct. The devices themselves are designed to not interfere in any substantial way with aircraft avionics. Operating normally, you could all use your devices at the same time and the only affect up front, during any phase of flight, is the occasional clicking on the vhf voice communications frequencies. All of the avionics in an aircraft are extremely thoroughly tested to ensure they do not interfere with each other and cannot cause a hazard to the aircraft in flight. If a GPS for your car costs 100 dollars, an aviation GPS with the exact same functionality costs upwards of 25,000.00, mainly due to the testing and certification it requires before it will be allowed to be installed on an aircraft. One of the main things they are testing for is &quot; if this device fails, in any way, could it catch fire, broadcast on frequencies it shouldn't or cause interference to other devices. &quot;. Your Samsung Note S7 wasn't tested for these things. </p>
<p>ELI5 - Your cheaply made cellphone doesn't do anything when it works as intended. No one has tested all of the possible ways it could fail and what it could do to the plane. There are literally hundreds of these devices on most flights. It is really cheap, even free, to just turn them off. It is really expensive when they start blasting your Enya in the pilots ears unintentionally and putting them to sleep, causing a flaming ball of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's not correct at all. Plus there's no way to know where EMI was coming from even if the flight recorder did pick it up, so after the fact investigations would never be able to tell that consumer electronics played a part. The airlines don't like forcing those stupid safety checks on everyone. It's the safest form of travel already, but in an actual incident, you are most likely just going to end up dead. The number on incidents where that safety briefing might actually make a difference in saving someone's life is a couple dozen a year, worldwide. That's simply not worth the collective thousands of hours that those stupid safety briefings take up. Airlines are a business. There's no way they would do all that shit if they weren't forced to.</p></div>		</li>
