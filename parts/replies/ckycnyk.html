			<div class="markdown"><p>Some years ago, there was an investigation into two brothers who owned a dry cleaner and simply dumped the chemicals in the storm drain out back.  In court, one of them angrily asked, &quot;If you wear it, it's fine.  But if it's in the ground, it's toxic?  How much sense does that make?&quot;</p>
<p>They were still forced to shut down after being fined into oblivion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an environmental engineer who cleans dry cleaning spills up every day, I'd like to shake these people and tell them it's literally like dumping money down the drain. Environmental remediation is expensive! And lots of people die of liver cancer (and other toxin-driven ailments) due to improper disposal of these solvents all the time. Be responsible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work with grounds that where polluted with tetrachloroethylene from dry cleaners. It's a very difficult task, especially in urban areas, so I hope they got fined into oblivion^2. It's heavier than water and it can spread in reverse from the ground water direction. Its really good at playing hide and seek</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, apostrophes are used in possessives, or to show that an abbreviation has been made. Inverted commas are another name for quotation marks. Since typewriters were invented, the two have shared a symbol, but they are different punctuation marks.</p></div>		</li>
