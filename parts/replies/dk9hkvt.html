			<div class="markdown"><p>So gonna hijack the top comment and say this is true except in the particular example OP gave above. Humans actually CAN regenerate digits up to the first knuckle until about 7 years of age, then the ability slopes off greatly, it's been common knowledge among physicians since the 50's but only recently have we started to study it. I can't find tge source but we read a few papers on it in regeneration biology</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And implying that architects and engineers are speaking the same language is a huge leap. PM me if you know an architectural engineer in the southeast that won't dip out at the first sign of problem.</p>
<p>Because my job has become reverse engineering the dreams of architects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tend to lose that limb in a specific way, so a blueprint is still helpful. E.g lizards that lose a tail lose it in quite a specific way, so that the body knows <em>where to start building the blueprint</em>. That's the main issue, your DNA has no idea about your 3D form, so it can't go creating fully formed fingers because the might be pointing in the wrong direction, and there's no way that the muscles needed to use them could grow up in to your forearm.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Edit, since I'm rustling some jimmies:</p>
<p>Evolution does not strive for complexity. Some of the most evolutionarily successful organisms are simpler in genotype and phenotype, take bacteria for example, simple genome, not evolutionarily simpler. Evolution does not have a direction or a predefined goal. Many plants have more complex genomes than our own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work with Axolotl's though? They're known for regenerating lost limbs and such and on top of that they are virtually immortal. Why doesn't cancer seemingly affect them?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/scienceisprettycool-" target="_blank">scienceisprettycool-</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>This is untrue. Axolotls (mexican salamanders) are by no means &quot;simpler evolutionary&quot; for at least two reasons: 1) they have been evolving for at least as long as humans have, if not longer, and 2) their genomes are 10 times larger than our own, and MUCH more complex and a result (this is generally true for all salamanders). </p></div>		</li>
