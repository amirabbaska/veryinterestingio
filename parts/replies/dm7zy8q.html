<p>Basements are very common in the North East and nearly everyone has their power panels down in the basement. That level of flooding would certainly short out the main breaker panel which are <em>not</em> water-tight by any stretch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense then that your breaker panel could easily be above the flood line.</p>
<p>I had a neighbor in Boston who's home flooded and she had to have the electric company come and shut off her service at the pole as it was too dangerous to go into her basement where the panel was and shut off the main breaker. </p></div>		</li>

Guessing location mostly dictates where the breaker goes, as my area has virtually no chance of flooding high enough to submerge a breaker unless you live within 100ft of the local river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is &quot;relatively&quot; safe so long as your house wiring is up to code. So long as every outlet and appliance is equipped with a good ground wire, any electricity that passes through the water should travel to either the neutral line or ground. You can still get zapped, but it's not like what hollywood depicts where someone throws a toaster in a pool and everybody is electrocuted. Chances are, if  you threw a toaster in the water, it would make a lot of ominous sizzling and that's about it, unless you have it on a GFCI outlet in which case the power would just shut itself off in a second or two.</p></div>		</li>

A girl, in Texas I believe, was recently electrocuted by a fault in the wiring of her family's boat ramp.

</blockquote>
<p>If you look into the cases where people get electrocuted, it is usually because something is wrong with the actual wiring. For instance, somehow the hot wire is connected to a handrail by someone who doesn't know how to do electrical work, then the first time it rains (or someone climbs out of a lake etc.) they get fried.</p>
<p>I lived in a rental once where the entire aluminum sliding door frame was somehow connected to the hot side of a 110 line. I suspect they used really long screws when they installed it and drilled into some romex. You would never know that anything was wrong unless you touched that and a grounded object at the same time. Then it tickled a bit...</p></div>		</li>

Since there was plenty of daylight left, they tried to keep school in session. We only got out about an hour early, and that was because the temperature inside the building hit 50Â°F and was still falling.</p></div>		</li>
