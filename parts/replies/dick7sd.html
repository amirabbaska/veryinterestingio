			<div class="markdown"><p>Some land will become arable, and some land in the high latitudes will <em>not</em> become arable. This is because arability is a complex, multi-factor quality of a particular landscape. Soil composition, microbial communities, endogenous and in-migrating herbivores (both four legged and six legged), increased human activity, elevation, growing season length, and many, many other factors determine whether land is arable.</p>
<p>Most countries span many different ecosystems, and the effects of warming are not uniform even at the same latitude. Some of the nations you mention, for example, have very thin topsoil layers in large parts of their high latitude territories. Even with warming and a longer growing season, thin, rocky soils aren't likely to become productive. Now greenhouse and aquaculture operations, on the other hand, might very well be moving towards the poles in the next century or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna drill down on the soils portion of this. Increased temperatures would open up a great deal of land in the northern circumpolar permafrost region to agricultural exploitation. Hardly any of this would be sustainable. Permafrost soils, by and large, are highly organic soils (histosols) that will start to decompose rapidly and will completely subside within a short timeframe if unfrozen and exposed to aerobic conditions. And all this decomposition will contribute to further climate change. And we're not talking about a small amount of carbon, either. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008GB003327/full" target="_blank">One 2009 study</a> estimates the region's soil (16% of the global soil area) contains ~1700 Pg of organic carbon, which is about half the total soil carbon pool, or roughly double total atmospheric carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why in general is permafrost soil like that? Is soil at temperate latitudes something which has been created over generations? Why can't the same process be conducted in the permafrost areas, or does it just take too long?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, climate change does impact a lot more than just temperature. In the US for example it will lead to more severe weather conditions (like hurricanes for example) according to experts. It also can change precipitation patterns. So even if a region might become warm enough for agriculture, it might at the same time become arid. </p>
<p>And global warming is a global average. It doesn't necessarily mean, that it becomes warmer everywhere. Take the gulf stream for example. Should climate change weaken or even stop it, the average temperature in Europe might very well drop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on, you've got it. The changes in precipitation patterns (both spatial and temporal) are already causing havoc at high latitudes. And one thing agricultural systems really need is <em>consistency</em> in growing season and precipitation: it's hard to grow  your maize if you could have the last freeze of the year in mid-June. April the next year. July about every ten...</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It is premature to conclude that human activities–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. That said, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observational limitations, or are not yet confidently modeled (e.g., aerosol effects on regional climate).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finland, like most of Scandinavia is mostly arable and the temperatures are much higher than in similar latitudes (in Canada, Siberia) due to the Gulf stream. One suggested scenario is that as the climate warms up, the melting of polar ice would weaken the Gulf stream, making temperatures in Scandinavia colder, not warmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know Sweden is projected to get an overall GDP boost due to increasing temperatures, not so much because of the increased ammount of arable lands but because longer summers mean increased yields for the agriculture that already exists. There's not really a shortage of land that <em>could</em> be farmed, it's just kind of inefficient to do so.</p>
<p>Also you save quite a bit of money on heating. A lot of energy goes into heating in cold countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but in that you also need to account for changing weather paterns. For example there's more drought in Sweden now than there was just 10 or 20 years ago which will also effect yields.</p></div>		</li>
