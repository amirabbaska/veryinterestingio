<p>So, in summary it is very promising, however there are still some concerns that need to be further looked at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so nice to see further research progress into things like immunotherapy, compared to the amount of money we have sunk into chemo and radiation treatment, neither of which that guarantees remission is permanent, and both of which have horrible life altering side effects.</p>
<p>I will be watching the news for this one with abated breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it cures 95%, then out of the remaining 5%, a few should be able to manage on immunosuppressive drugs like people with organ transplants. A few others would also still survive longer than if the cancer took over. A few others would also look at via other methods like chemo.</p>
<p>Basically at those rates, almost everyone would be recommended tge procedure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious too.  My guess is that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>it would be used at the point where other treatments had the same risk factor, or there was nothing left to lose</li>
<li>They would develop some sort of test to see if you are in that 5% to further reduce the risk.</li>
</ol>
<p>Honestly, if I had cancer and chemo had a 5% chance to kill me, and this had 5% chance, I'd choose this every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I am understanding this right... it would mean that this could become an effective treatment for even metastasized cancers, correct - since the immune system, being virtually omnipresent in the body, would be able to perform its seek and destroy mission throughout? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its worth keeping in mind that the cancer could evolve to avoid the immune system once again. There are also immune-privileged organs in the body, including the brain, where the immune system operates a little differently, so would be interesting to see whether this would work on those tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting here that the animal study used intra-tumoral injections for the solid tumors, which aren’t an option in most cancers clinically (unless they’re superficial like melanomas) and certainly wouldn’t be an option with multiple tumors as seen in metastatic patients. This is a red flag in general as it is often used when the treatment has a narrow therapeutic range (i.e. the dose needed for the desired effect is very close to the toxic dose), which is very likely to be the case here given the potential dangers of immune-modulating treatments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, hm... if the idea is to trigger the immune response, though, it wouldn't necessarily have to be a large &quot;cross section&quot; of the cancer that is &quot;painted&quot;, would it? Or would it have to be a significant volume to result in the desired change? For instance, pancreatic or breast cancer - if even a small tumor could be injected and stimulate the immune system, wouldn't it then be able to 'seek and destroy' throughout the body? Or would the impact potentially be too small and localized?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be disagreeing with the researchers that conducted the study here and elsewhere in this thread.  You say it will have a narrow therapeutic range, will take a month or more to administer, and will be very expensive, but the researchers are cited in the article thusly: &quot;The researchers believe the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as a rapid and relatively inexpensive cancer therapy that is unlikely to cause the adverse side effects often seen with bodywide immune stimulation.&quot;</p>
<p>You also keep saying insurance would never cover it, but why would they object to a less expensive, possibly more effective treatment than chemo or radiation, both of which are extremely expensive?</p>
<p>EDIT: Reading the actual journal article further, the mice only received a total of 3 injections spread out over 5 days in a single tumor but experienced remission in both the treated tumor and remote tumors.  Why would that necessarily equate to many injections over a month or more?  And why would that mean you wouldn't be able to treat patients with multiple tumors?  They also experienced complete remission after those three injections.  Why would that necessarily indicate that humans would require concomitant therapies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's the interesting part. Surgery basically just doesn't work for metastasized cancer; chemotherapy <em>can</em> work but is brutal to go through and far from a sure thing. This technique seems like a gentler and possibly more reliable treatment for cancers that are beyond the scope of what surgery can handle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence.</p>

<p>Hopefully thymic selection has gotten rid of those sorts of T cells already!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While thymic selection is normally pretty efficient, it's still a worry. Especially if we pick a cell marker that is believed to be specific to cancer but is actually expressed by some normal human cells. Which has happened before and resulted in a death during clinical trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can white cells be cultivated outside the body, trained on the markers and then injected?. I'm thinking of just deploying the necessary number of trained immune cell and if the markers were wrong, these would be easy to remove... or they could also come with an special marker that would make them easy to target in case they get out of control</p>
<p>I wonder if once inside the body they talk to the other white cells and transmit the information which would make this idea/question stupid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thymic selection is good at weeding out the T cells that recognize self-antigen very strongly, but less so at removing those that interact with weak to moderate affinity. We have a lot of peripheral mechanisms to help keep the autoreactive cells that escape the thymus in check (T regulatory cells and activation-induced cell death, regulatory B and dendritic cells, etc etc), but sometimes these safety measures can be overwhelmed or become dysfunctional, allowing autoreactive cells to become activated and cause problems.</p></div>		</li>
