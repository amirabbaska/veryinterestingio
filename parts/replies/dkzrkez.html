			<div class="markdown"><p>This leads to a question I've never thought of before: obviously the universe can't expand fast enough for an object at a finite distance from earth to move away from it at the speed of light, but will the furthest reaches of the universe eventually approach such speeds relative to us? Will that affect how we interact with those parts of the universe?</p>
<p>I'm imagining looking at spectral data coming from an object moving away from us near light speed. Do we lose information? Or is it just compressed into a smaller bit of the light spectrum, limited only by our ability to measure it? </p>
<p>Edit: I seem to have been confused about the c speed limit - while nothing can travel through space faster than c, there isn't any relativistic reason space itself can't expand at a rate faster than c. Thanks for clarification guys! I definitely could use a cosmology course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope, that's exactly what happens. The speed at which two objects are pulled apart by expansion is proportional^1 to their distance, so if they're far enough, it does exceed the speed of light. The laws of relativity limit to a constant the speed at which an object can move within the universe, which we call the speed of light, but they do not limit the expansion of the universe itself. And the effect is actually big enough that there are visible galaxies, right now, that are being moved away from us faster than light. Although obviously, the light that we see from them was sent so long ago that back then they were still close enough to us that they were still moving away slower than light.</p>
<p>^1 proportional at a given time, but the factor is gradually increasing, which is the famous &quot;acceleration&quot; of the expansion, if my understanding is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that we're all traveling through space at a speed &gt;c, relative at least to a random theoretical object far enough away from us? Like, if we're moving through space, and we're 1 mile away from where we just were 1 minute ago. But relative to that theorized object way far away, we just jumped many many miles farther away from each other than we just were in that same minute. We are moving away from the theorized object at greater than light speed, so can we say  that we are moving faster than light? Like &quot;hey did you guys know that we're technically all flying through space faster than light?&quot; and they're all like &quot;what are you on?&quot; type stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So essentially there is a point beyond the observable universe, where there are objects that are essentially not part of our universe in any meaningful sense - they can't interact with us, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that precisely what the &quot;can't go faster than light&quot; meant? Taking any two references, the proportionality breaks apart once you get too close to the speed of light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible for distant objects to be moving away from us at speeds greater than that of light, this is what causes the edge of the observable universe. Light emitted from those objects will never reach us. It might be more proper, and maybe more intuitive, to say that the distance between us is increasing faster than light can cross it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you is saying is that gravity travels at the speed of light? By travel, I mean that if the Sun disappeared, it would take about 8 minutes for Earth to be effected by the sudden loss of gravity. 8 minutes being the light travel time from the Sun to Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is the usually cited example. </p>
<p>If the Sun were to pop out of existence, the earth would continue orbiting for around 8 minutes. </p>
<p>And we've have this weird 8 minutes of &quot;time travel&quot; where we can see and feel a Sun that no longer exists. </p>
<p>I don't believe there are any instruments that could detect this before we can see it. </p>
<p>Then we'd all die in a couple of weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget about Rindler Horizons: there are places in the universe which due to the speed of light vs the expansion of the universe, nothing will ever reach.  This effectively limits any gravity to a pseudo-fixed radius (that is, there is space that hasn't been created that it will reach, but there is matter directly on the other side of that space which it will never reach, barring a big crunch, which would probably be pretty freaking catastrophic almost instantly since light would be doing the same thing from every direction everywhere, if the universe goes down in a big crunch - sort of like the bow-shock that would make a ship dropping out of an alcubieree-style warp bubble obliterate a planet it was going to visit if pointed directly at it, but everywhere.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. Kinda new here and this was very interesting to me. Does this mean that we can still accurately tell how long it would take to get somewhere that we can see because it is effected by our gravity and we know where it is in relation to us, in our viewing area of course?</p>
<p>Or does the expansion make it hard to accurately predict? </p>
<p>I understood what was being said earlier about the objects staying in place, but the area between changing. I guess I am just trying to think about it as how you would be able to now estimate the distance between the two objects in space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how far and what you mean by accurately.  You could accurately predict how long it would take to get somewhere at a given speed and when it would no longer be accessible, or if some distance is already inaccessible.</p></div>		</li>
