			<div class="markdown"><p>In high school I had a face that looked more like a pepperoni pizza before I saw a dermatologist. He set me up with acutane and it dried out my entire face. My mouth to my nose was white and skin flaking off. </p>
<p>I had a very strict diet of low fat and calories during it all. </p>
<p>When it was all over, my face was smooth for the first time since 5th grade. </p>
<p>In one year, I went from being made fun of every day with no friends to winning runner up homecoming king (so, prince I guess?).  I finally got a girlfriend for the first time ever. Got my first kiss. Etc. </p>
<p>It changed absolutely everything. I walked around with a smile and had confidence in everything I did. </p>
<p>I’m now 34 and I have a zit like once a year. If that. And those are usually on my back or neck. </p>
<p>I owe 15 years of my life to acutane. It’s the miracle drug as far as I’m concerned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Works wonders, but I recommend taking it after you're finished growing. I took it during ages 15 and 16, and during the course of treatment, I immediately noticed that it was much, much easier to get the wind knocked out of me during collisions, and my bones felt different when they were stressed. The actual feeling is hard to explain, but it wasn't good. I played hockey and lacrosse at the time, so the effect was less than ideal.</p>
<p>My brother took it in his early 20s, and he didn't experience the same effects. I know it's anecdotal, but there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11606950/" target="_blank">some literature</a> that's been around for a while detailing its effects on bone growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also reduces oil production in your joints so they’re much stiffer after a work out / sports due to less lubrication so that could be what you were experiencing too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chiming in to agree, for anybody reading this post:
Wait until you finish growing before taking Isotretinoin.</p>
<p>Anecdotal, though I took Accutane (Isotretinoin) when I was 14 and am now 23 and 5'2&quot; (same height as when I was taking Accutane) while my parents are around 5'9&quot;.</p>
<p>They'll tell you to not get anybody pregnant but as far as understanding the other potential side effects at a young age, you're basically on your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It pretty much saved my self-image.
It caused some temporary depressions, but was totally worth it.
If you have really really tough acne into your mid 20's, I can recomend it, but please - don't take it lightly, it's some heavy shit!</p></div>		</li>
