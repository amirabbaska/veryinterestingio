			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this be considered sensory adaptation / habituation of those optic nerves? Or is truly that they just get &quot;tired&quot; and stop sending signals in the first place? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is adaptation. Specifically many aspects of visual processing are computed as ratios in the nervous system. Motion detectors (called correlation detectors) are directionally tuned, and velocity tuned, and higher levels of visual processing compare output of these detectors to determine the motion of objects. Prolonged exposure fatigues the cells (fatigue=adaptation) so that after removal of the stmulus, they don't just return to their baseline firing rate but are firing less than baseline. Because the neurons that detect movement in the opposite direction are still firing at the baseline spontaneous rate, the ratio favors the &quot;opposite direction&quot; neurons, interpreted as motion in that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure there is not a rhythm that gets established? And your eyes are just &quot;stuck&quot; cycling. The reason I ask is I have twice experienced a wild illusion. The first time I saw it, I was doing some really hard motorcycle trail riding. You have to be constantly and rapidly refocusing your eyes near, far, near, far. To avoid obstacles in the trail. When I stopped, the world looked like it was shrinking away from me. The opposite of what I had been seeing for about 1/2 hour. The effect lasted about 5 minutes.  I saw it once again, but in opposite. I was riding in the back of a station wagon and was staring at the road for awhile. This time when we stopped, the world looked like it was coming at me. It seems there was muscle memory keeping my eyes rhythmically refocusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is an instance of neural adaptation. Obviously neurons getting 'tired' is an imperfect analogy, but I'm not sure what it would refer to besides adaptation. They would almost certainly not stop sending action potentials altogether, but instead decrease their rates of firing.</p></div>		</li>
