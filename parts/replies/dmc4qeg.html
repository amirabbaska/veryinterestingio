<p>Houston has a large number of bayous and creeks that flow either directly or indirectly to the Gulf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. Water is gonna follow gravity to the lowest spot. The lowest spot could be a pond, lake, or, for the majority of water, the ocean. Water will follow rivers and gullies until it reaches the ocean/lake/whatever the low spot is.</p>
<p>Problem with a hurricane is the storm surge, which forces the ocean to rise into the coastline. I know the shear wind force can push it but there may be other factors (for reference, put water on a plate and blow on it. It will move towards the area you blow). So the ocean, where the rainwater normally flows, is now several feet higher, meaning those rivers/streams/gullies are going to stop flowing once they reach equilibrium with the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the problem when you consider the height of the bayous and altitude of the city. Parts of Houston are 50 feet above water. </p>
<p>The storm surge slows down the bayous I'm sure, but the problem is the sheer volume of water dumped on the city. It's unprecedented. We received over 10 trillion gallons of rain. It takes some time for all of that to drain to the gulf. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say that's what caused Houston flooding. I explained how general flooding works, since the OP was asking where the flood waters go.</p>
<p>But even still, to your point, storm surge is a huge part of why an area will inundate and stay inundated. Water will continue to back up to the level of the storm surge, slowing the flow, causing the amount of rainfall even at torrential levels to flow that much slower.</p>
<p>Yea, Houston got hit with torrential rain. But even where I'm at, in southwest Louisiana, we nearly flooded because everything is backed up. Our rivers, gullies, buyous, and lakes are at capacity and -can't- move due to storm surge keeping the amount they can drain down.</p>
<p>Rainstorms that normally would flood nothing more than a street are now backing into people's homes.</p>
<p>It certainly is a laundry list of problems, not just one or two things. But the 2&quot; per hour or whatever the rate certainly exacerbated the problem much, much more quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>99% of the time it will ultimately be the ocean.  There may be some places where it temporarily pools and evaporates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Storm surge happens by a mix of wind pushing water inland and the drastically lowered atmospheric pressure. Water stays in place because of atmospheric pressure and gravity. With reduced atmospheric pressure, water bulges upwards until reaching equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rain run off finds ways to the water simply by following lower elevation, and depending on force and duration can create cuts in land called Ephemeral streams, leaving behind a path of where the rain followed after the water has flowed out. These are most commonly created from snowmelt, where the depressions in the land are dry all summer snow covered by snow in winter, and are recarved the next spring</p></div>		</li>
