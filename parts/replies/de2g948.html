<p>I am doing some work with a historian and she has a giant collection of documents from about 1600 up to the late 1800s all written by men (ship logs, manifests, trade and commerce and tax documents, etc.) and virtually all of it is more legible than anything I see from first year university students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing with a dip pen or quill also forces you to slow down a lot, which is a major factor in illegible writing.</p>
<p>My uneducated observation would be that it is still more nurture than nature- while girls may have an easier time holding the pencil and forming letters at age 5-6, they tend to get positive feedback for doing things that are 'pretty' from adults and peers, which encourages them to practice further. As a kid I was encouraged to see concern with aesthetics in almost any area as a 'feminine' trait- girls are supposed to take their time and make things look pretty, boys are supposed to 'get 'er done'. Having sloppy handwriting &quot;like a doctor&quot; was a point of pride for guys I grew up with- it meant that they were too fast and efficient, too busy, or that when they grew up it would be someone else's job to figure out what their writing meant. Pretty handwriting was just another decorative skill for girls who were expected to grow up and decorate a house rather than do hands-on labor where results mattered more than aesthetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I buy this,  and would add that boys who had &quot;girly&quot; writing caught shit for it too, at least from our peers. That changes when you grow up,  but by then the reinforcement is pretty locked in. </p>
<p>Source: always had nice handwriting, was a draftsman and illustrator in college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel you man, I basically only write in cursive because I grew up with an artist mom who wanted me to. Only time I can think of when I use print is in bathroom stalls. But anyways, i caught major shit growing up for having nice handwriting. Glad I stuck with it because now in college it's been a full 180 where I get tons of compliments for it. Honestly I think I've met more girls through them complimenting my handwriting than parties or anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was one of those assholes that threw shit at you for it. Even gave my younger brother shit about it, too. I apologize now, because my younger brother has the best handwriting of my generation in my family and definitely looks smarter for it!</p>
<p>EDIT: Wording, because apparently people think I hit my brother purely because I thought he wrote like a girl... Wow folks, just wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a male I had poor handwriting throughout grade school, but by 7th grade or so that had changed and have nice handwriting. I work in a office that is predominantly female and when I turn in notes and things of that nature have had multiple coworkers asked me who wrote them. I think the constant reports from teachers throughout grade school always telling me my writing was &quot;chicken scratch&quot; caused me to be concerned about it. But, I did not catch any shit for it, most people were more impressed than anything, &quot;look at the burly bearded guy and his girly handwriting&quot; lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see this. I'm a girl with sloppy handwriting and I was a tomboy when I was younger. I wanted to get the work done fast. I didn't care how it looked. I always heard the &quot;sloppy handwriting means you think faster&quot; bs, so I never really cared about improving. </p>
<p>Anecdotally I remember one time I was with my girl friends so I tried to make my work look nicer. One of the boys I normally hung out with said something like &quot;you could be so much faster than them why do you have to start acting like them.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this theory and will add my anecdotal data point for fun: I am a woman with legible but unattractive, &quot;unfeminine&quot; handwriting and I, too, was a tomboy. I think I was concerned with practicality at the expense of style when I was learning to write. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another tomboy with messy writing here. I think I just felt like I had better things to do, and didn't care to practice writing of all things. I also didn't care about things being pretty or neat, too busy playing football with the guys at recess. Everyone always wanted me on their team because the boys didn't want to tackle a girl (southern chivalry, haha) so I was the &quot;best&quot; running back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too, I remember in 8th grade a teacher told me how I was the first girl student he ever had that wrote so messy. I took pride into that, because it's something I've known and been told for YEARS.</p>
<p>My writing is not as gross and some guys and is quite legible, but I've always had messier writing than other girls/women.  I too, tried copying girly girls and writing slowly and neatly, but I would eventually break and quickly go back to my ways. I went through mixed feelings of feeling less feminine and having a problem with it. </p>
<p>In high school I went through the same On and off mixed feelings, and now in college I do write neater when it comes to some written assignments, but I'm so used to how I write I hardly ever get self conscious. If anything I get embarrassed with my signature... I'm still working on what signature I should stick with...</p>
<p>But I think writing deals with the brain functions of each person more than anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd further submit that historical records from before typewriters, such as court and business records, were prepared by specially trained scribes who had to have precise handwriting. People with sloppy handwriting wouldn't be employed in such a capacity. Those shipping records OP mentions were probably prepared by some of the finest hands in the country. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Handwriting wasnt a common skill back then so if you were taught how to do it you were learning a special skill that was important to your livelihood.  Now everyone learns how to write and then never uses again save for signing their name and writing a shopping list. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that everyone is focusing on the biology but I think it has a lot more to do with societal pressure than you might think. I'm a 24 yr old woman and as a child my mom would sit me down and make me practice my handwriting because as she would say &quot;your handwriting is too ugly. You're a girl. You should have better handwriting.&quot; Also when I would &quot;play&quot; with the other girls we would color and almost get competitive with who was the best at coloring (like who was the cleanest). Then get to high-school and all the girls would get praised for their handwriting by guys and it made me want to get praised too so I actually tried at my handwriting. I get a feeling that those bad at handwriting never really sat down and tried to improve their handwriting throughout the years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. As a boy growing up, we would see the girls write in <a href="http://www.fonts101.com/previews/515/CK_Plain_Jane_font_preview_44755_2.png" target="_blank">clear, 'bubbly' text.</a> We boys feared &quot;writing like a girl&quot;, which ended up with the boys having <a href="http://www.fontsplace.com/free/images/b/bible_script_plain_font_preview_characters.gif" target="_blank">sharper, faster drawn characters.</a></p>
<p>Once you stop practicing, your style becomes lazy or exaggerated, which makes the sharper font illegible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would kill to have better handwriting. But then I have fine motor skill issues. I did find that a chisel-tip marker produced a line other people were more likely to be able to read - if I block-printed.</p>
<p>I also used millimeter engineering paper. I got special permission to write in pencil - so I could erase and re-do illegible bits. Finally, I just learned to type. This was pre-computer. Goddess, that was liberating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get yourself a fountain pen. Seriously, a few weeks writing with one will do wonders for you. Same benefits as the chisel tip marker, plus a few others. My handwriting in school was so bad that I actually had special accommodations to be allowed to type things up. We actually thought it was some kind of fine motor control issue. Since I started using a fountain pen my handwriting has improved immensely, so much so that I really wonder if there was ever a biological problem to begin with, or if I just needed some extra help early on that I never got.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. It has the majority to do with society. </p>
<p>From personal experience: Us girls would focus on aesthetics and coloring and making things pretty, hence good handwriting would be produced. Them boys would go out and rough around and do sports and not really care about aesthetics, so sloppy handwriting ensued. </p>
<p>And, remember that is from <strong>my</strong> personal experience, it does not apply to everyone.</p>

<p>this could still be, at least in part, biologically based.</p>
<p>to be clear: i don't know enough about biology to say something definitive, just pointing out that this anecdote doesn't necessarily point to a purely social influence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad says that when he was in primary school they'd practice handwriting all the time. A teacher would walk around and study what they were doing. If he saw a mistake he'd tell them off in a deep and  angry tone while patting them on the head repeatedly. &quot;NO! THAT'S NOT HOW YOU WRITE A G!&quot;. This regular exercise which provided the children with instant feedback alongside fear and intimidation scared the kids into getting better. Another difference is that they used ink wells, so they got used to having to be extra careful.</p>
<p>That's what British schools used to be like apparently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the rise of computers which mitigates the need to learn perfect penmanship, most assignments these days for students are online or turned in typed. Many people don't even take notes by hand any more once in college. However I do agree that their used to be increased emphasis on penmanship years ago as well, I just think it was because writing legibly was more necessary</p></div>		</li>
