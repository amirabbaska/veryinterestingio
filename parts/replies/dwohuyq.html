			<div class="markdown"><p>The nuclear winter hypotes is not because of the detonation of the weapons directly. The assumption is that in a large nuclear war there will be strikes on cities and  100 or more city firestorms. Burning cities will result in large amounts of particles in the stratosphere that can cool down the earth. </p>
<p>The idea is because we saw large fires in cities in WWII after both conventional and nuclear attacks.</p>
<p>Another serous result is the nuclear fallout. That will be worse when the fireball of the detonation hits the ground. A problem is if neurons will hit the ground and create nuclear isotopes, if the detonation happens higher the neurons will react with the atmosphere and the nuclear isotopes of atoms in the are is less dangerous then from the ground in part because the will spread out in the atmosphere and don't fall down.</p>
<p>So it is strikes on harden target like nuclear missil silos where you detonate the bombs on the ground that are the most dangerous. In the strikes in Hiroshima and Nagasaki the fireball did not hit the ground.</p>
<p>So in nuclear weapon testing in the atmosphere you test them to minimise danger. You don't test the where large fires can happen and if the test is only to validate a bomb type you can detonate them high in the air top minimise the effect. Most test was done underground and almost all nuclear elements stay down there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>City firestorms are fairly unlikely.  There's plenty of recent work on this.  Catastrophic, years-long effects take getting a lot of soot high.  I believe wiki has a good summary of the criticism, which is well taken.  On the other hand, the radiation effects are nothing to be laughed at, and nuclear war against civilians seems especially unethical, as it always has.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even a large amount doesn't, no?  Even in Pripyat there's still plenty of life.  </p></div>		</li>
