			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely the best answer. Electricity can move very quickly in a wire, but the wires we have attached to our chargers are relatively thin compared to the amount of electricity that the battery can hold.</p>
<p>It's like saying &quot;this waterfall is moving very fast, why does it take so long to fill up the lake?&quot;</p>
<p>Because there's one little river feeding in to a huge lake. How could we fill up the lake faster? Have tons of rivers feeding in to it. And technically we could do this with our phone batteries. If the battery was made up of a bunch of smaller cells and each cell had it's own charger and wire, then you could plug them all in and fill it up very quickly. </p></div>		</li>
