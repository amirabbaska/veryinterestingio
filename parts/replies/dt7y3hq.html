<p>Still, temperature variation is something that's much harder to overcome if you take things into a panetwide perspective. Will we really be able to alter the temperature of a planet and make it suitable for large scale agriculture? It's not habitable if you can't live off the land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP said human habitation, that doesn't have to be outside.</p>
<p>If you want to be outside, the first thing to worry about is the atmospheric composition. We can live in a large temperature range, but we need oxygen with at least ~10 kPa and at least ~15%, but not more than ~50 kPa. We need nitrogen to be below ~300 kPa and CO2 to be below something like 3 kPa.  Various other gases shouldn't exceed various other limits either. It is unlikely that a random planet will satisfy all these conditions by chance, so we probably have to change the atmosphere a lot anyway - that includes the option to change its temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lesser planetary gravity</p>

<p>It's also possible that a planet with lesser gravity than Earth isn't able to retain an atmosphere over a long period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, yes. But gravity isn't the only factor in a body's atmosphere. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon\)" target="_blank">Titan</a> for example has 2.25% the mass of Earth and 14% the surface gravity, but its surface atmosphere is denser and with higher pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, technically? But at that point you're talking more about deorbiting large moons or other such foolery. And the time scale for the planets biosphere to recover is absurd. </p>
<p>If you can do that, you may as well just break the planet down for material in favour of making ringworlds </p></div>		</li>
