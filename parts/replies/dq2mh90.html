			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying I buy this idea at all, but I've known Roger for many years and he definitely never spoke about this project in any kind of certain terms when we've discussed it in person before.</p>
<p>Roger is certainly a colorful character known for going out on a limb more often than most of us, but the man is no hack. He cares about his reputation and believes in the peer review process, and wouldn't be going on record like this if he wasn't convinced his predictions will bear out.</p>
<p>That being said, I didn't expect to see this article... </p>
<p>Edit: If he's around tomorrow I might be able to talk Roger into doing an AMA. I know I'd like to see him respond to the valid points you bring up, /u/tinyp   </p></div>		</li>
