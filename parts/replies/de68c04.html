			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former restaurant manager, all of this.  You're a bit off on the cost of the actual food, but not by a huge amount.  At a place like McD, food cost is about 12% of the total budget.  Labor is 15-22% depending on sales volume.  Rent and utilities account for 5-10%.</p>
<p>And as for the cup of soda, the cup is the second most expensive thing, the soda is third (if you don't count the cost of the person filling and serving the drink).  The most expensive part is the ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me, a friend of mine found out about the ice and realised the ludicrously overpriced drinks at the cinema could be replaced by just asking &quot;Can I get myself a cup of ice?&quot; to which the servers would invariably reply with some masked variant of &quot;see what I care, they pay me less than the cardboard cut-out of Vin Diesel&quot; so she'd get the largest cup they had full of their most expensive resource for free, smug all the way into the cheap seats with a pocket full of peanuts bought at the supermarket.</p>
<p>Good times :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also don't advertise McNuggets as much as other things which decreases the cost to corporate. I also wonder if they have more waste in nuggets than other products. Maybe the average store tosses open bags/boxes regularly and that incentivizes bulk discounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And there was me thinking I'm scoring myself a bargain - more soda - by saying no to ice!</p>
<p>Still, unless it's very hot weather it'll keep cool enough without ice and I still get more soda, so I'll keep doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Food cost was about 30% and labor about 20% when I worked at Wendys.  I would expect McDonalds to be pretty similar.  I don't know how the rest was split between maintenance / utilities / franchise fees / profit.   Granted, this was around 2000 but I doubt it's changed enormously.  Drinks have a higher markup than food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will obviously depend on the nature (and quality) of the food / ingredients / service etc. but ingredients being about 1/3 the total cost sounds perfectly believable.</p>
<p>I heard an episode of &quot;The Food Programme^1&quot; once talking about the markup on various stuff and one of their main points was that any restaurant <em>not</em> making their own ice cream was stupid, the markup from ingredients to sale price outstripped just about everything else...</p>
