			<div class="markdown"><p>I found out that local anaesthetics don't work for me when I was meant to have a mole removed from my back. Being about 9, I didn't have the control to stay still so ended up having it removed under a general anaesthetic. </p>
<p>I know that people with red hair often don't respond properly to local anaesthetics, and the other group I know are people with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (connective tissue disorder that depending on what type can cause hypermobility, stretchy skin and stretchy veins, along with tons of otherwise unconnected symptoms that make it hard to diagnose). It's not known why though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope not at all. Except for those incidents I've mentioned, only had two fillings done as a teenager, and my 2 big toe nails removed with local anaesthesia as young adult. Stupidly played netball with bad tennis shoes. That's it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people is like that, I got my appendix taken put when I was 9 and the doctor was like... OK, count to then... I was like... OK, 10, now what? And he was surprised, tried again and I only went under at about 8. Same thing with the dentist, always have to request extra anesthesia. These couple months I was having trouble sleeping, mostly because I was depressed and as a secondary effect the antidepressant I was taking, my PD gave me some sleeping pills, stopped taking them after two days, three days, they didn't work anymore. I guess some people just get used to stuff way faster than other.</p></div>		</li>
