			<div class="markdown"><p>thank god someone said this. My friend convinced me to buy that shit and I've literally never forgiven him. I buy weed and then immediately lose it, and I still think DayZ was a bigger waste of my money than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  Same.  Same.  I don't preorder, I don't even get hype for new releases.  I always wait a week or so for player reviews now.  This game hurt me, man.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never really got into H1Z1, so I have no idea what they have done to enhance their game, but some games get frequent updates/bugfixes and some don't.  Has there been no patches in all that time?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. The game has even recently been on TV, hosting a $300,000 tournament. Hell, doors don't even open correctly in the game. We need to stop getting complacent and actually keep companies under contract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that title comes from intention more than what will happen.  Should Steam change the tag?  Maybe, but I would hope there is some back and forth between the devs of H1Z1 and Steam.</p></div>		</li>
