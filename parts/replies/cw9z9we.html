			<div class="markdown"><p>The curriculum and methodology required for meeting state standards is so specific that schools rely on textbook publishers to provide that curriculum. And while the tie of Texas Instruments to the textbooks is long-standing, the schools really pick the textbook, not the calculator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pssh. All it took was writing the formulas into a program and archiving it. When the teacher checked to see that your memory was 'erased', restore the program for use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I sat my A-levels, the teachers went around and pressed the reset button on all of the calculators or asked you to do a memory wipe etc. before the exams.</p>
<p>Mine had a reset button, but I took it to the electronics section of the tech lab and removed the button's clicker. Press that bad boy all you want, it didn't do a thing!</p>
<p>Edit: To answer some of the PMs I have been receiving, I know that it was cheating. What I will argue though, is I don't believe memorising a load of equations and definitions, and then sitting down for 3 hours regurgitating them back onto the paper is an effective way to learn or demonstrate ones knowledge. If it was truly a demonstration of intellect and ability, why do all professors have bookshelves overflowing with textbooks and journal articles they can look up and reference from?</p>
<p>I believe that the same kind of outside the box thinking that led me to figure out how to turn that button off when I was 17, was the same kind that led me to study physics at university, to keep me driven during my Masters degree and ultimately led to me undertaking the PhD I am doing now.</p>
<p>Peace</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit, when I was in highschool (99-03) our teachers were so technologically illiterate that they didn't even realize you could save stuff in the TI calculators.  I would enter all of the formulas into it and just pull them up during the test and no one ever had a clue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My HS math teachers loved it if we programmed things into our TIs.  They figured:</p>
<ol>
<li>A great way to memorize things is to write them out, and we were writing a lot of things out while programming them. And more importantly,</li>
<li>Learning to program was a fucking amazing skill to have and they actively encouraged us to write programs to do the work for us.  Not only were we learning math, but getting the foundations for a phenomenally useful skill.</li>
<li>We've got to show our work anyway for a lot of it, so we're going to have to write out the answers anyway, even if the calculator is showing us the steps, which also helps with understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>We had some great math teachers in my HS, and consequently a lot of great math students.  For reference, I was in HS...um..the exact dates aren't important, but it was well before your span.  Our teachers were pretty forward-thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a TI-84 in high school. Teachers would always wipe our calc memory before a quiz/test, but a friend developed a devilish program to fix that issue. You ran it, and it would simulate all the functions of the calculator, even down to the &quot;delete memory&quot; function. Once they were done with your calc, you'd just quit the program and have all your stuff still there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the formulas, but you don't have access to the internet where you can find examples of the problems exactly solved out, nor do you have access to your friends who can text you answers in real time.</p>
<p>Teachers/professors know you can input the formulas, and they rarely care. If you know how to <em>use</em> them, it's usually no big deal that you need a reminder. For classes beyond Algebra 1, it's all about whether you can look at a problem and know <em>what</em> to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FTFY</p>
<p>Had some professors that understood this, and had much better success at student retention. Also had professors that didn't, and by the end of the semester it was very obvious how effective they were at their 'profession'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Your calculator has whatever formulas you thought were relevant for this class -- I actually had a physics professor who <em>encouraged</em> this. You were allowed to write a very small amount of notes, just enough for formulas.</p>
<p>What you didn't have was Wolfram Alpha.</p></div>		</li>
