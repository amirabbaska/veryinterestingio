			<div class="markdown"><p>Suggestion: Instead of a grain mill, what about a watch?</p>
<p>I mean, grain mills are easy. You've got the axles, a big chunk of rock, and a fan to keep it spinning and rolling. You could understand it just by looking at it. It's not a bad example of something that's hard to reverse engineer, but it doesn't really &quot;sound&quot; like something that's hard to engineer.</p>
<p>Now instead, imagine taking apart an old piece of clockwork. You'll end up with literally hundreds of parts. They're tiny, there are many different ones, and while they can fit into the shape of a watch in a million different ways there's only one that will work. Each individual gear can be compared to software - they're all different sizes, and each has a unique function in the watch. You can probably fit them together in any order but to make the watch work you need to know what they do.</p>
<p>I'm not very good at explaining things but I think this is a better example of something that is too complex for most people to reverse engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good grain mill is actually more complicated then you think. The wheels have elaborate designs on them to grind different grains in different grains. If you blindly copy the grindstone you might be using the wrong stone for the wrong type of grain making your bread weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There also the hardness, polishing resistance and chemical reactivity if the stone. You really don't want to be using a stone that crumbles I to your grain as you mill or one that reacts with it to create toxic or bad tasting by products</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but you don't take it apart and give all the pieces to a different person: you would take very detailed notes as you take it apart explaining how each piece fits into the greater whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you have a watch. Sure, you can figure out how many gears there are and where they go, but all you can do is measure the dimensions of the gears in your hand. Engineers work with tolerances. So the gear is 0.061&quot; in diameter. Was that intentional? Is 0.062&quot; okay? What about 0.055&quot;. The engineer who designed it would have the information. Maybe 0.061 is the upper limit for the diameter, and your copy is 0.062&quot; and it seizes. Now repeat this exercise for the thickness of the gear, the tooth height, the tooth angle. And that's for 1 gear. Repeat that for the hundreds of parts in a watch. </p>
<p>What about the material? Some parts have their hardness controlled so that certain parts prefentially wear over ones that are more expensive or difficult to replace. So you measure hardness, but what's the tolerance on that? What's the chemical composition? You sent it to a lab? Great, carbon content was 0.1%. what's the tolerance on that? Was that small titanium addition intentional or was it a contaminant during the steelmaking process? Was that gear cast or forged, or cut from rolled plate? Does it matter? Was there a surface treatment, such as carburizing, or was it case hardened? What was the heat treat condition? Normalized, or quench and tempered? What's the grain size? What's the tolerance on that? </p>
<p>Say you go through this exhausting and hugely expensive process and have it all figured out, except all those pesky tolerances. Now your manufacturing and quality control has to be perfect, otherwise you could have a very large reject rate, at least until you learn those tolerances empirically. Or you could repeat all that testing on hundreds of that same component from your competitor until you get an idea of the variation.</p>
<p>It's possible, but simply not cost effective for all but the most simple parts.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if you did so, it would still be impossible to manufacture without the correct manufacturing processes. Having complete knowledge of how an item works and all its parts, doesn't mean you can make the machinery needed to make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The goal of reverse engineering something is to understand something, not to learn how to replicate it. If you gave someone a watch, you would want the person to learn how to make watches, not just that one watch. Someone who only notes down which part fits where wouldn't be able to make more than just that one type of watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from analytical skills, reverse engineering is not plain old copying. </p>
<p>Most countries have strict laws on copying, and if discovered, those who did can be sued extensively. </p>
<p>Reverse engineering, with a clean room implementation that would survive lawsuits involves one team that tears down an existing product, analyse it, and draft detailed requirements. Said requirements are sent to a different team, who should have no access to the original product, and implements it. And they might continue to refine and iron out bugs. </p>
<p>Aftermarket car parts in a sense is an example of reverse engineering. Body panels from aftermarket providers typically will never fit quite the same and requires work. Aftermarket parts may have problems- ETCG was replacing a valve cover on a Nissan, tried to do it with an aftermarket one only to find out that they didn't do it quite right and the valve cover broke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this story. It has a good beginning, middle, and end, as well as a nice plot twist to keep things interesting. Plus, the typo and incomplete sentence structure help the story feel &quot;alive,&quot; and allows one to really step into the shoes of the narrator, which only increases the effects of the dramatic, sad ending. I find myself on the edge of my seat waiting for a sequel, but also worried one will undermine the artistry of the original. </p>
<p>Overall, 9/10. If I had to make one criticism, it would be the lack of elaboration disrupts the immersion of the experience slightly. For example, how did you <em>feel</em> about Galaxy Quest being removed from Netflix? Why was your day at work so horrible?</p></div>		</li>
