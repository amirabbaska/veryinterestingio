			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a valid issue. But let's say an experiment requires some sort of  &quot;validation&quot; (by replication) making the overall experiment cost higher but improves the trustworthiness of the experiment, isn't it worthwhile? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the point is that the expense to reward is low for the replicator. Universities and researchers rely on grants, and new discoveries, important publications etc are a great way to improve the university's access to funds. If there was some lav making massive strides in genetics research, and somebody has some money to fund some research into genetics, where are they going to put it?</p>
<p>Nobody 'cares' about those who replicate the results. </p>
<p>So if you are the original publisher, the cost is probably worth it if the research topic is good, as you spend money in the hope of publishing a paper that has lots of acclaim and impact.
If you want to replicate, the cost is the same as for the other guys, but you pretty much know that anything that comes from it will not earn you much. Unless you believe you can prove false some landmark study that is seen as credible, you spend a lot of money to maybe at best be some footnote whenever the original publishers are cited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Requiring the original publisher to carry out the replication / validation sort of misses the point.  What if it's some systematic error in the experiment - incorrectly calibrated equipment or a user error in reading a dial?  We need <em>independent</em> verification, and that's simply not going to happen with the jacked-up incentive system driving modern academia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know, so the fee would actually be worthwhile. </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Who does the replication?  If it's the authors themselves, that's really just another way of asking for bigger sample sizes, and the same systemic errors will be in place.  If someone else, who?  Is it compulsory?  If so, who does the compelling, perhaps granting agencies?  There are many perverse incentives, where this would become the boring 'scut work' relegated to the least competent/ambitious investigators.  This would create a lot of doubt about negative results from these replications, as many techniques require specialized skill.  There's also the equipment needed; I can think of dozens of papers off hand published by colleagues that could only be done in about 2 or 3 places worldwide because of the facilities needed; advanced greenhouses, powerful microscopes, advanced sequencing facilities, etc.  </p>
</li>
<li>What constitutes a replication?  Do you just re-analyze the data, or do you collect new data?  Do the authors get to 'assist' in troubleshooting the experiments?  Something often overlooked by 'outsiders' to science is the simple fact that most things don't work, at least the first time you try it.  Getting a protocol to work in a new lab is <em>always</em> a challenge.  A universal experience for post-docs to new labs is troubleshooting techniques that they used extensively in their old labs.  There's a gallows humor that surrounds this, but it's true!  Beyond credibility, the exact same reagents and investigator, in a new setting, might just stop working for any number of reasons.  And this is for experiments with very good controls, so it's not that the technique was suspect to begin with, it's just that science is hard.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it would be great to have undergrads trying to replicate studies, but at the end of the day, it's almost a laughable notion.  It takes a new undergrad perhaps months to get decent at running a simple PCR reaction.  It's years before I trust one with something more complicated, but still fairly basic (they do it right away, but I'm talking about <em>trusting</em> the results; a lot of their work gets 'replicated').  It takes about a decade of training (PhD and post-doc) before people make decent independent investigators (the 'stars' that are great even during their dissertation work tend to have more experience, so the metric roughly holds).</p>
<p>This doesn't even get into how everything would cost twice as much (really three times as much, to break a tie), so half as much work would get done because resources are very finite.</p>
<p>I think the real solution will lie in publishing incentives, and for some select fields to do some 'soul-searching'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the &quot;What constitutes a replication?&quot; is a big one. Some people seem to treat &quot;I re-ran your code on your data&quot; as replication. That's a pretty low bar. For epidemiology, ideally you'd see the same effect in an entirely different population, but you're now talking about running an entirely new, just as expensive study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hehe, look at Computer Science. People publish results, if you ask how they got them, they will tell you that it was using a prototype they throw away after they generated the results and even if they had anything, they couldn't give it to you. So you basically can spend 3-12 months re-implementing everything or, just ignore their research.</p>
<p>This is what just killed my PhD. I crossed paths with another research group and therefore needed to build on top of their work to get published, but for that I needed to re-implement everything they done in the last 4 years.</p>
<p>Current research practices are complete nonsense. Pretty much impossible to publish anything actually significant (my best rated paper is actually a short commercial blurb for our institution, that's insane).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some places this is happening with undergrad psychology students for example. I think it would be great if there were more incentives for replication, and if we got over the notion that replication studies tell you things you already know - clearly they don't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another great example of replication studies is in the field of organic chemistry. There is a journal, Organic Synthesis, where before a paper is accepted for publication, it must be replicated by other scientists. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>All procedures and characterization data in OrgSyn are peer-reviewed and checked for reproducibility in the laboratory of a member of the Board of Editors </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is considered one of the most reliable publications in the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you have labs created specifically for replication though with consistent and viable funding though, I don't think this is happening anytime soon.  There's no incentive, nothing to keep a lab afloat, in terms of replicating someone else's work unless it's to specifically snipe something big.</p></div>		</li>
