			<div class="markdown"><p>serious question. with airlines penny pinching, is the price of the service that reasonable? </p>
<p>like i can see them just tacking it on if its like a buck per passenger. </p>
<p>it just seems odd they get and are willing to pay for new premium content and give it to customers included in the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The biggest problem for airlines is fuel cost.  One figure I was provided by Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) was that on a 747, one paperclip, left on board for one year, is an additional $100 in fuel costs.  Everything else doesn't quite come so close in the cost of your ticket... (some other costs being fees paid to airports as landing costs, certification fees).  This is why you are seeing such a massive push to get wireless on the airplane... fact is, my job has a shelf life of &lt; 5 years... because everyone has a laptop, phone, tablet, etc... so if you glue an antenna to the top of the A/C and a couple misc. LRU's and brackets... you're looking at &lt; 100lb's.  Most IFE's including monitors, remotes, excess equipment to run it will run as high as 1000 lb's... so the savings in fuel costs are enormous... so you can expect that in the next few years, they WILL start charging for a flight that has that excess equipment, and about 20% of the fleet will accommodate.  The other 80% will likely have no IFE, monitors, etc... but they'll charge you $9.95 - $19.95 for internet so you can watch your own movies.  I am already seeing now that for single aisle (short hop, single aisle aircraft like A320, A330, 727, 737) they have no IFE at all any more... they just make you make do!</p></div>		</li>

<p>747: 900,000 lbs</p>
<p>Paperclip: 0.0012 pounds</p>
<p>747 in paperclips: 750 million paperclips</p>
<p>$100 per paperclip per year: 75 billion in fuel per year. Per plane. That's $2,400 in fuel per second, 24/7.</p>
<p>Real numbers: A 747 going 5,000 miles uses about 0.4 lbs of fuel for every additional pound it carries. It can do two 5,000 mile legs a day. So it burns 0.8 times the weight of the paperclip in fuel every day. It can fly about </p>
<p>0.8 <em> 0.0012 </em> 365 = .35lbs of fuel a year. Jet-A is $4 a gallon, and weighs 6.8 lbs. </p>
<p>So the answer is a paper clip left on a 747 costs 21 cents a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. In-flight magazines must be very lucrative from an advertising POV, then. They must add 200lbs to the plane. </p></div>		</li>
