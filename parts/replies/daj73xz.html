			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the better question would be what's the theoretical maximum energy density? Like it's pretty clear no matter how far we advance we aren't going to power an airplane with a button battery unless we learn to harness a black hole. </p>
<p>So the question becomes, with our current understanding of physics, what is the maximum amount of power that can be provided from a measure of matter? </p>
<p>From what I understand gasoline provides the highest density of energy per gram but that may be incorrect.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh snap. Wikipedia to the rescue: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add. Everyone's heard of Li ion batteries right? We actually don't use the full potential of Li because it can short circuit the battery and could cause harm to people using it. So to keep people safe the batteries use a carbon graphite electrode which makes the battery safe, but reduces the cells potential an extreme amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well energy storage in super-capacitors is one that is not a means of chemical storage. Using super-caps to store surge power in conjunction with higher energy density batteries with a lower but more constant discharge rate is a more efficient way to power an electric vehicle. </p></div>		</li>
