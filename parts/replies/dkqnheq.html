			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to see this take hold. However, from what I've seen the few places that do go from tipped to non end up switching back because of backlash from EVERYONE servers, customers, the community. (Joe's crab shack is the most recent one I can think of)</p>
<p>Its hard to fathom this because to most of us living on $2.35 an hour seems insane but in my time waiting tables I made A LOT more there than $2.35.  This was almost 20 years ago (when tipping culture was still 10-15% from my experience its now graduated to 15-20%) and I averaged $12-14 at a pizza joint. Will a server get stiffed sometimes? Yes. And it feels AWFUL! you wonder what you did wrong, were they an asshole? Did I offend them? But if your restaurant is in anyway busy its followed up with your other 4 tables tipping and you might have still made $25 that hour. </p>
<p>Honestly the only way that tipping will become not the norm is if they literally outlaw it on either the state or federal level with a graduated minimum wage.</p>
<p>I'd love to see it, it would be fantastic if they could move us to dome type of system where everyone is paid a fair wage (even when it is slow) and a customer knows how much the bill is going to be without having to pull out a calculator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also worked as a server but during my college tenure. Only way I was able to pay off a lot of my loans. If I had made a flat $15 an hour, I wouldn't have done it. Not worth the shit you go through and the long hours. I personally like tipping. Obviously it can suck adding an additional 20% to your tab, but you are already eating out which used to be something you were lucky to get to do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get it. Its basically commission sales but paid out every night.
Hell I remember a lot of 8 hour shifts if make like $300 on.  Restaurants are also the only place I've ever worked where people were willing to pay to take shifts.
&quot;I'll pay you $50 to work for me Saturday&quot; uhhh yeah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So $15 an hour if more than the VAST majority of waitstaff are paid.  Not everyone works in a high priced steak house.  Even in places like New York and D.C., seventy percent of tipped workers are actually women, largely working at casual restaurants, like Applebees, IHOP , and Olive Garden, earning a median wage of $9 an hour when you include tips. These people suffer three times the poverty rate of the rest of the U.S. workforce, use food stamps at double the rate, and, the worst part, suffer from the absolute worst sexual harassment of any industry in the United States.
Maybe college you could afford to walk away from a $15 an hour wait job, but most people in the service industry can't.  </p>
<p>Also, you might not like tipping so much if you were an overweight, female server of color.  Study after study has shown that only 4% of tip fluctuation has to do with the service given.  The rest is based on attractiveness, sex, hair color, if you touch the customer, if the restaurant has candy out, etc.  If you're ok with paying 20% more, why not pay it to the restaurant directly to insure that everyone is paid fairly instead of being paid based on the racist and sexist whims of the customer?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends on area, and if you have to do side work. Sure, I managed to make average $8.00 an hour on a shift if I was lucky, but doing three hours of side work at my server pay and no tables brought me down hard. I constantly had to be compensated up to minimum wage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Joe's Crab Shack after they switched to the No-Tip model.  It fucking sucked. </p>
<p>The waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything, I never got any refills.  To get my check I had to stop another server and asked when ours was.  That server was an asshole about it too. </p>
<p>Seriously, it's like they were going out of their way to be shitty because they knew the customer had absolutely no recourse.</p>
<p>So, I stopped going there.  Once they went back to the tipping model, I decided to go back to see what it was like.  The wait staff was friendly, prompt, and checked on us regularly. </p>
<p>When you give people what they want, you don't necessarily get the results you'd expect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is crazy because the value you provide in the kithen is so much higher. Generally a waiter is just a nuissance to me. I'm paying to have someone cook something for me that would be very difficult or expensive to make on my own, not to have some fake person pretend to be friendly while asking what i want to eat (and often not even carrying my food or refilling drinks).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. The overly fake-nice service standard seems to be a very American thing. I've learned from friends who've traveled a decent amount that it's quite different and service is more straightforward, and less annoying, in many other countries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. I was a cook for a year and we will work all day almost everyday. But the waitresses that made tons of money will show up on weeknights and made as much as I made the whole week. And they got the nerve to tell me about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many places have a tip share with the kitchen staff included. </p>
<p>Edit: Also your tips often don't go only to the server. A majority of restaurants have some tip share system. Where I work I tip out 30%. 15 to bussers, 5 to food runner, 5 to bartender, 5 to drink runner. So ultimately you are tipping on your overall experience. Also our kitchen staff is paid very very well. Dishwashers start at $3 above minimum wage as an entry level position. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Uh, that's super illegal.  If your place does that, they're ASKING to get hit with a lawsuit.  In 15 years, I've never seen a place tip out the kitchen.  don't just make stuff up.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the biggest issue for me. A customer bases their tip not only on the server's attitude, but the quality of their meal as well. How is it fair that kitchen staff - who often are only making minimum wage as it stands - only get 5% (or less) of the tips?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Legally, the kitchen staff shouldnt be getting any tips.  They are non-tipped employees and tip pools are extremely protected.  Tips can ONLY go to server, period.  The kitchen gets 0%, not 5%.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why I'm glad to see tipping culture is going away. Servers should get paid the same wage as kitchen staff - there is no way they deserve to make twice as much as the people who are cooking the food. Pay everyone in the restaurant the same and then if tips are still implemented, split it evenly with everyone involved. </p></div>		</li>
