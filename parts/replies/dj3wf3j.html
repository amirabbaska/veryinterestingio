			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a mild concussion eight years ago, followed by light and noise sensitivity, constant brain fog, mental tiredness and depersonalisation.</p>
<p>My life has been turned upside down, doctors haven't been able to find anything (MRI, PET scan, CT, blood tests, etc.), and worst of all, none of my friends or family are all that supportive.</p>
<p>I feel like one of those homeless drug addicts that needs years of re-adjustment and help to get back on their feet, but society looks at me like a normal person who just needs to get on with their life, so I have to do all the normal things, although I'm constantly suicidal, tired and depressed.</p>
<p>I wish that I could, at the very least, get a diagnosis of some kind. Like &quot;this guy has autism, therefore we need to help him in this way&quot;...</p>
<p>I agree with you that doctors don't know much about the brain, or at least about brain injuries. Many of the doctors I've gone to contradict the &quot;latest&quot; (1-10 years old) research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with people with brain injuries specifically.  To me it is a challenge that the word concussion is still so widely underrated and seen almost as a small, short term inconvenience.  It's promising seeing more research with mild brain injury to hopefully help people with these same horrible symptoms you mention.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa that sounds terrible. Hope at the very least that you can receive some help for your depression and suicidal thoughts. It's not a diagnosis that could capture everything that happened to your brain after the concussion, but it's easier to get services for depression and completely understandable that you have it at this point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what other symptoms you have or how your migraine manifests, but there's been some recent research that some severe chronic migraines seem to be caused by subclinical CSF leaks: <a href="http://www.mdedge.com/neurologyreviews/article/132780/headache-migraine/when-suspect-csf-leak-patients-headache" target="_blank">http://www.mdedge.com/neurologyreviews/article/132780/headache-migraine/when-suspect-csf-leak-patients-headache</a></p>
<p>If the rest of that article seems relevant to you, the epidural blood patch that treats it is pretty straightforward if you can find someone willing to act on Dr. Carroll's (rather new) work.</p></div>		</li>
