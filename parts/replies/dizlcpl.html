			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that exactly the end state of communism? From my understanding the end goal is just that, and political leaders are only needed during the birth of the communist society. The &quot;leaders&quot; are needed to guide a people unaware of classes and class differences, first to make them aware, then to help the revolution. After this there will be leaders to help establish the new society, but after this they'll to a communal leaders, and finally to a leaderless society as the one you described. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists in any historically significant way. They are on the libertarian right side of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>I don't know of any other groups that call themselves Anarchist, but none of them fall on the authoritarian side of that axis.</p></div>		</li>
