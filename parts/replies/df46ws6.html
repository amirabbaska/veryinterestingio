<p>I covered an entire toenail with permanent marker once, as a child, to see how long this took. It was neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing that happens when hair grows... it just keeps going. More cells pack in behind it, and the cells that formed the nail die (nails and hair being dead), and the whole thing rises up and away. It's like... building a cake from below, layer by layer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, it's not just &quot;sliding forward&quot; it's not just &quot;Growing up&quot; from the base. It's a combination of growing from the nail bed, and the nail bed itself growing &quot;forward&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
