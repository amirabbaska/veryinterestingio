			<div class="markdown"><p>The density of a fish which is at rest in water is equal to that of water - 1 kilogram per liter. If it were not, buoyancy would cause it to float or to sink unless it swam against that force.</p>
<p>Fish with swim bladders can adjust their buoyancy. You can too: if you inhale a large breath and swim to the bottom of a pool, you will float.   If you exhale that breath you will sink. (Assuming normal lung volume, muscle mass and BMI.)</p>
<p>To generalize, most animals are largely composed of water, and have a density about equal to that of water.</p></div>		</li>
