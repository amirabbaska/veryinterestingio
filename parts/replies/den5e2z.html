			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading how you could smell cancer or dying people. Probably due to dying flesh.</p>
<p>Well, some time after that, this old regular couple came in but the wife smelled really...sharp, pinchy, and sweet. It was horrid and overpowering. The color behind the heavy make-up looked unnatural (maybe a tinge of purple or dark, idk). Maybe that's why there was a pungent sweet smell: their effort to mask the odor.</p>
<p>It was hard to act normally as I took her order. Felt so bad for her and the husband.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is like blowing my mind because three times now I have predicted the death of a family member within a year. Looking back I have attributed it to the look in their eyes and skin (I call it a balloon full of light slowly deflating) but now I wonder if I could smell it on them instead...</p>
<p>I really want to have a study of smelling peoples clothes everyday and seeing when they die compared to how I and others rate the smell...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, that's not entirely it.  My grandparents nightly application of Bengay and my memory of my great aunts affinity for mothballs certainly contributed to &quot;old people smell.&quot;  </p>
<p>When you're entire house smells like mothballs, you may be using too many mothballs. </p></div>		</li>
