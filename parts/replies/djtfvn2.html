			<div class="markdown"><p>But we ARE sexual throughout our entire lives. I've personally been masturbating since I was 5, and I have a feeling every pediatrician has had to tell a concerned parent that their child was only doing so. As for the sperm thing, I don't think making it as long as possible is an advantage. If I remember right, after a certain point (I think the article I read stated around 60 or so), every year past that point increases the chances of severe genetic breakdown during gestation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say we aren't sexual all our lives.  But...there is a difference between having an erection and being sexual.  Even in psychological terms, pursuit of physical pleasure isn't the same as &quot;being sexual&quot;.  But..thats a digression.  But, yes...even 5 year olds have these full dimensions to some degree.</p>
<p>Of course that makes it an advantage.  I'm not really sure how to respond to that, but a larger population of males capable of producing offspring is always good, especially in a social structures where male death is more common.</p>
<p>And...yes, it becomes riskier.  Doesn't mean it's not advantageous. The human value of &quot;healthy baby&quot; isn't the same as the evolutionary value of reproduces-or-not.  But...imagine a society where the young men are killed off. That society will either survive or not based on the availability of male sperm.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>But masturbation IS sexual. If I'm not mistaken, it's the earliest sexual thing people do. Now I will say though, there is a difference between being sexual and expressing sexuality (which is what I think you're getting at?)</p>

<p>Yeah, men have higher death rates  than female last saw. We also have a few years less in our life expectancy. But I did not consider that last point. Being able to reproduce, even if the most stringent of circumstances, would be a massive evolutionary advantage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also been masturbating since age 5 but it was not until close to puberty that it became a sexual thing for me. For years and years I had a climax that had nothing to do with sex at all. This was possible because I was a child, a non sexual being, I wasn't touching my genitals directly, and I had no idea that what I was doing was called masturbation or that what I was having was an orgasm.  All I knew was if I put pressure in this area (while fully clothed) after a bit, it felt really good. That's all. It wasn't until years later that I learned what it was that I was doing. </p>
<p>I was a 5 year old girl, masturbating and having orgasms and I wasn't a sexual being. So I have to disagree with the statement that humans are sexual their entire lives because I know I wasn't, even while conducting solo acts that most would assume are only sexual in nature. I know they can be non sexual.  I discovered it accidentally and entirely on my own. And touching myself directly never happened until I became a sexual being. </p>
<p>Masturbation is not always sexual. I believe most times it is, but I have years of experience with it not being sexual. </p></div>		</li>
