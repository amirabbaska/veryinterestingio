			<div class="markdown"><p>Now that you know that your primal brain has a negative bias you can use your thinking brain to rewrite or reframe said memories. If no positive can be seen from it then you can use the stop stop stop method and immediately redirect to a positive thought or just distract ( ie count in multiples of 3) and eventually over time that memory will prune away. Remember that what you resist, persists. </p></div>		</li>
