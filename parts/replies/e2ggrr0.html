<p>Even your edit doesn’t really help much. Every branching point has two offshoots, each of which have the same age, and both of them are going to keep branching.  </p>

<p>I see what you're saying.  What I meant was &quot;earliest branch that does not include humans.&quot;</p>

<p>The wiki page you linked that image from states &quot;All life on Earth is part of a single phylogenetic tree, indicating common ancestry.&quot;  Does that not imply a &quot;trunk?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It shares a common point, but in the metaphor of the tree, that point is where the tree meets the ground. A &quot;trunk&quot; implies one main branch, which all other branches are subsidiaries, which is not really the case.</p>
<p>Imagine one of those trees where two or three equal &quot;trunks&quot; (I would say primary branches) split off immediately above the ground. <a href="https://www.moonvalleynurseries.com/application/files/cache/fa49597573137d23b57059f647442be7.jpg" target="_blank">Sort of like this</a>, each with ther own branches. That'd be a somewhat more accurate metaphor.</p></div>		</li>
