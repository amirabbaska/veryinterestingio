<p>A lot of people are confusing closed captioning with subtitles. Subtitles only mean the lines of text on the movies for reading, and when used alone, generally only for spoken sentences.

<p>Some people, myself included, use the terms interchangeably because we think the difference is trivial - no confusion involved. If you leaves important sounds out of 'them', you're not producing this as opposed to that, you're just plain ol' <em>doing it wrong</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Outside the US and Canada, the English-speaking world generally does not draw this distinction between captioning, be it open or closed, and subtitling. </p></div>		</li>
