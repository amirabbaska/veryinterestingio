			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, it's best to remove yourself to a quiet place so that you have less distractions. You're more likely to skim the page when you have other things going on around you. Read slower, constantly recall information, and in the case of anything technical, always try to relate the material back to other real life examples. However, if you don't feel a connection to what you're reading or you feel bored, it will always just be harder to stay focused. Practice makes perfect!</p></div>		</li>
