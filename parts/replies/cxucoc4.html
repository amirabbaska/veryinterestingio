<p>If you do end up with a chip on the edge, it is flex (rather than another point load) that will propagate a crack.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to be a little nitpicky, because AFAIK it's the other way around.</p>
<p>A chip/crack would be a <em>stress</em> concentrator.  The same force applied to that point would create more stress than other places in the screen; this increased stress is more likely to cause a screen fracture.  At least that's the way the stress/force relationship is taught to mechanical engineers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah that's correct. It cracks at the same stress regardless (ideally, at least), stress concentrators just cause that stress to be reached at a lower force. Note also that stress concentration is really only a factor when considering brittle materials or brittle failure modes (like fatigue) - you don't have to worry about stress concentration as much when you're dealing with ductile behavior because the material will just deform plastically in a local area and then be fine. </p></div>		</li>
