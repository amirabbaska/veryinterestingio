			<div class="markdown"><p>My son has the vascular kind - commonly called port-wine stain - across his nose, eyelid and temple. He's recently had has 1st laser treatment for this, which breaks down the malformed capillaries under the skin. It's reduced its 'redness' by around 80-90%; it's incredible. He has a few more treatments to go but the treatment seems very effective</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My vascular ones are strawberry hemangiomas - raised and bright red! Around 2 weeks old 16 of them developed - 3 on my face, 3 on my scalp, chest, back, and arms. At 6 months old they were cauterized with a laser - standard treatment in the early 80s. They were particularly worried about the one on my eyelid growing bigger and impacting my vision and the ones on my scalp being bumped and bleeding easily. They all faded to white and bumpy after that. </p>
<p>Around age 10, I had cosmetic surgery on the one on the tip of my nose that had a resulted in a lopsided appearance. They also removed excess tissue from the large one on my arm (3 inch diameter raised circle) to make it lie flat. At 18 I was supposed to go back and have a skin tightening procedure on my nose to make the skin lie flat, but they changed the process to a skin graft and it didn't bother me enough to go through that hassel.</p>
<p>Now at age 35, the ones on my face are visible but don't cause me any issues, except once every 6 months someone will think I have powder on my face. Also, I choose not to wear makeup because I can't get the texture right in those places. The biggest one on my scalp has a sort of soft spot that hurts when a hairdresser aggressively combs over it while getting a haircut. </p>
<p>I sometimes wonder what the treatment would be today. My mom had a large hemangioma type that was deeper and along her jaw line. In the 50s they cut it out. I'm about to have my first child and I wonder if he or she will have any - even though I know they're not genetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to hear the laser surgery is working for your son.  I had about 12 laser treatments growing up, until it's started losing its effectiveness. You look into getting a cat scan just in case.  Also look at seeing a specialist to look into issues with development as I had a few medical problems </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, he had an MRI quite early on (he's only 2 and half now) and was cleared and sees an opthalmologist too, since it can be associated with pressure on the brain and/or eye. So far, he's clear. </p></div>		</li>
