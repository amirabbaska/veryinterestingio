<p>We aren't dolphins, we don't operate semi on semi off sleep by brain region. It would be more accurate to say your brain never really turns &quot;off&quot; per se, but instead runs in a very different, specific manner whilst you sleep. A variety of functions continue running just as before (heart-beat management, respiration, things of this nature). </p>
<p>Now this does include things like noise detection, acceleration, smells, temperature, bladder fullness etc, but its not because that part of the brain &quot;isn't asleep&quot;. Its just that sleep isn't like a computer that's turned off. It's like a computer you're playing a fullscreen video game on, but occasionally if its vital the computer can still interrupt the video game to grab your attention. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't wake up from alarm clocks if they are the same for longer then a week and I'm a 40 year old that would love a nice and high bed that's easy to get in and out with a nice mattress, but I can't because I keep waking up next to my bed at least once a week.</p>
<p>And when I don't fall out of bed, I'm sure to wake up orientated completely differently from how I went to bed.</p></div>		</li>
