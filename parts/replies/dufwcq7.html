			<div class="markdown"><p>There are advantages and disadvantages. Not undergoing drastic life stage changes definitely has the advantage of requiring less energy. Many primitive insect-like groups (Collembola, Diplura, Protura) undergo &quot;<a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/488421/bgimage" target="_blank">ametabolous metamorphosis</a>&quot; which means that the immatures look and behave pretty much exactly like miniature versions of the adults, with the only real difference being that they lack fully developed reproductive organs.</p>
<p>Most insects undergo <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/488419/bgimage" target="_blank">hemimetabolous</a> or <a href="https://bugguide.net/node/view/488420/bgimage" target="_blank">holometablous</a> metamorphosis, though. Changing life stages, while energetically costly, allows each stage to specialize on its own niche, potentially reducing intra-species competition between adults and immatures. Furthermore, the evolution of flight is one of the key characteristics that have made insects as a whole so successful, greatly increasing their ability to disperse and locate mates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good for surviving in that one body of water. Having a flying stage that reproduces and can lay eggs anywhere is
<strong>very</strong> beneficial for spreading out, making the species much more resilient against climate and environment changes.</p>
<p>Basically, this transition lets the mayfly get both the benefits of living underwater and the benefits of flight, without the disadvantages that normally come with trying to do both at the same time (like diving birds do).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest. All the answers are focusing in that because that was the question. Not saying that you are wrong. Of course what you are saying is correct but still</p></div>		</li>
