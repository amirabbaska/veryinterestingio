			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother makes a pot of chili that is so spicy, it makes most people beg for death to rip them from their cruel torment. At the same time, it is so good, you could use it in a sex dungeon for the masochists. When I first started eating it, I had never experienced such a conflict of interest. Actual, measurable pain from the spiciness was only furthered because I couldn't stop from eating it. My nose runs so hard, it stays clear for days. </p>
<p>My mother has ruined chili for me while clearing my sinuses. :c</p></div>		</li>
