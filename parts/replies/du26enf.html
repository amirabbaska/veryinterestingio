			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, a lot of the entertainment from games and shows comes from studying and learning just in a different way. If somethings is predictable, the brain quickly gets bored and stops caring. Games and shows are designed to always keep you thinking about something. That's why people hate spoilers so much, they get deprived of that organic learning experience.</p>
<p>Things like studying and housework on the other hand, can be quite a lot more predictable and uninteresting. You're not going to need to think too hard to clean your room for the 1000th time, or even to memorize facts from a book.</p>
<p>There's a huge difference between learning organically and forcing yourself to know or understand something.</p></div>		</li>
