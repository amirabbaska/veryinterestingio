<p>Think about if you had both objects in a wind tunnel. Which is easier to push with air, a lead ball or a Styrofoam ball? The Styrofoam will start to roll first.</p>
<p>When it's falling reletive to the ball, the air is pushing it like wind. That force pushes back against the ball as it falls meaning it goes a bit slower than it would in a vacuum.</p>
<p>This is also why there is a terminal velocity on any planet with an atmosphere. If you think about the speed of the ball falling as the speed of the air hitting it (it functions the same, since air is hitting it in the same way) then the faster that wind speed is the more it will push against the ball. Well eventually the force of the air against the ball will reach an equalibrium when gravity and air drag are equal. That doesn't mean the ball stops mid air, it means it stops accelerating naturally from gravity, but at that point it's already going very fast. It just stops speeding up because every time it gets a push from gravity air drag pushes back with the same force, meaning the ball will stay more or less at a constant speed. That is until it hits the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the height of the fall.</p>
<p>If you drop them next to each in a classroom, the balls would hit the ground at the same time (they would fall at the same speed).</p>
<p>If the balls are dropped from a significant height, like out of a plane, then the balls would initially fall at the same speed, but eventually they will accelerate to their terminal velocity (the point at which they stop accelerating and fall at a constant speed). Due to the nature of drag forces, the lead ball will have a greater terminal speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big problem with your explanation: <em>drag</em> is not the same as <em>friction</em>!</p>
<p>There's two kinds of drag: skin drag, which is friction, and form drag, which I believe is momentum being imparted to the fluid (can someone confirm?  I don't remember whether this is a pet theory or actually something I learned.)  For a blunt object like a skydiver, form drag dominates.  For a streamlined body, skin drag becomes more important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also induced drag, wave drag and interference drag.</p>
<p>Form drag or pressure drag is just the resistance to air flow (or any fluid for that matter) due to the object's shape. I've not heard it described as momentum being imparted to the fluid, and I wouldn't say that's correct as that would imply a stationary object would have no form drag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A stationary object still modifies (in this case, reducing) momentum to a fluid moving around it.</p>
<p>There's no physical difference between an object moving in a fluid and a fluid moving around an object; momentum varies based on where you choose your frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The acceleration due to gravity is independent of mass and is not affected by the lead weights.</p>

<p>I'm not liking this explanation at all.</p>
<p>Terminal velocity is achieved when the net force on you is zero. Drag vs force of gravity.</p>
<p>Mass increases the force of gravity. (Very confusing to say that the acceleration of gravity is not affected then not talk about a force balance)</p>
<p>Drag force is increased by increasing speed.</p>
<p>That's why increasing your mass increases the speed at which drag catches up to the force of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass does not affect acceleration due to gravity. Acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth is always 9.8 meters per second squared.</p>
<p>Terminal velocity is a function of the mass of the and the projected area of the object. By wearing a weight belt, you increase the mass of the object while changing almost nothing about your projected area, making your terminal velocity higher.</p>
<p>Think of it this way; if you were to drop a feather and a bowling ball inside a perfect vacuum, they would both accelerate at 9.8 m/s/s until they hit the ground and hit the ground at the same time. However, outside of a vacuum, the feather will reach its (relatively low) terminal velocity almost instantaneously, while the bowling ball will continue to accelerate for a long time before reaching it's terminal velocity, causing it to hit the ground long before the feather.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But mass <em>does</em> affect the <em>force</em> of gravity.  There is no acceleration involved in terminal velocity, just balanced forces.  The force of gravity is increased by the dense weight belt without adding any significant surface area, so faster airspeed is required to have enough drag to balance out the force of gravity, and you have a higher terminal velocity.</p>
<p>The guy saying &quot;What is affected is drag&quot; is giving a confusing explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so what if I jumped out of a plane and a clone of me jumped out at the same time but my clone had a 100lb dumbbell in his stomach. Who would hit first? This is also assuming out exterior shape and surface area is identical so friction would be the same.  </p></div>		</li>
