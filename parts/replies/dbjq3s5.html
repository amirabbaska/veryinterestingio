			<div class="markdown"><p>The color is called chartreuse; and yes, I believe that's why they go with that color.</p>
<p>Fun side note, Washington State Patrol had a bunch of ford tauruses one year that were a god awful shade of purple. And they are goddamn invisible if you aren't looking for them, they are the exact opposite of chartreuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good guess, but no.  We've evolved to pay special attention to red.  At some point in the 70s, we thought that green or yellow would make good fire trucks since our eyes are most receptive to these colors.  But it turned out to be a disaster.  We psychologically pay special attention to red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned doing an OHS course that this is why emergency exit signs etc are green, because in times of poor visibility or duress, green is the last colour to disappear. So say in a fire, you're half out of it from the heat and smoke inhalation, and you can't see because fire, my workshop teacher said it'd be &quot;the last thing you see before passing out&quot; lol.</p>
<p>Also learned that yellow is actually the first colour the human eye notices, hence caution signs and a lot of traffic signs. </p>
<p>Red is supposedly the worst colour for visibility in poor conditions, and also isn't so hard on our eyes, being why you can buy a lot of red torches/lights for hiking/hunting, because it doesn't ruin your night vision like a normal light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At low light levels, we're actually concerned with the scotopic (not photopic) luminosity function, which trails off in the red, so red light won't cause your rods to bleach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also use blue light to maintain night vision.</p>
<p>The goal is to choose a wavelength that is oustside th sensitivity of the rods (which are the prime source of scotopic vision - as stated by u/kjbenner).</p>
<p>Fun fact, this is why &quot;averted vision&quot; works at night.  Don't stare directly at something in low light.  Look just to the side of it and let your rods do the work as they are designed.</p></div>		</li>
