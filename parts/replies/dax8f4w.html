			<div class="markdown"><p>Spirit, Frontier, and Allegient are the main US &quot;ultra-low cost carriers&quot;  that have intentionally copied a lot of RyanAir's practices in an attempt to undercut Southwest, which has dominated the low cost carrier segment for years.  The non-reclining seats that RyanAir pioneered drive me crazy, since I like to sleep on planes.  </p>
<p>IMO, Southwest has just enough amenities to satisfy me.  And their ads bragging about their lack of baggage fees have been very successful.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I liked Spirit too until a late arrival made me miss a connecting flight.  They told me they'd just book me on the next one...in 48 hours.  No hotel, no compensation, no anything.  It took me at least an hour of complaining before they paid for a ticket on another airline.</p></div>		</li>
