			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny, I was going to write almost the exact same explanation, but replace New York with San Francisco.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that most American Chinese food comes from San Francisco which has the original China town in the U.S. , many of them came in for the Gold Rush from Canton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think sf is more accurate. Being from NYC, I've never met Chinese grandparents that spoke perfect English until I visited my friends in SF. It was surreal to say the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It SOUNDS right though to say NYC. Especially if you are from the east coast. I think there is kind of a trend of downplaying the west coast contributions to things especially lately, especially when it comes to California.</p>
<p>California doesn't have nearly as much history or culture as NYC, but it's not exactly a slouch either on the scale of the U.S. there is more to it than the film industry.</p>
<p>I think it's very similar to the relationship that the US has had with England or Europe. </p>
<p>In the scenario specifically, most people don't realize the mixing pot that NYC is with Europeans on the East Coast, SF and LA are with Asia on the West Coast. Chinese residents in SF have longer roots there than most white people there. At the turn of the century much of Orange County was flooded with Japanese immigrants largely coming to farm fruits and berries which were all the rage in Japan. Korean and Vietnamese influxes happened nearby during their perspective U.S. Wars/Conflicts. Much more recent, but they still have major cultural impacts on the surrounding areas. </p>
<p>Asian food especially in the US is very often a California interpretation of Asian Food. Modern Chinese American food largely comes from SF, Japanese and Korean are largely LA's interpretation. Vietnamese food in the U.S. Comes mainly from Orange County versions. This is a lot like how when you have Italian food in the U.S. It is normally NY Italian. </p>
<p>Of course much of Hawaii has had a big impact on American Asian food as well, especially with Japanese food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the original Chinese immigrants who came to California and built the transcontinental railroad married Mexican American women, since it was very difficult for Chinese women to immigrate. I went to school with a bunch of chicano Wongs, Fongs, and Wings who'd had a Chinese great, great, great grandfather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The S.F. Bay Area Chinese population is huge, with Chinatowns in San Francisco and in Oakland. The city of Millbrae has recently become something of a mecca for Chinese restaurants, serving mainly Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Shanghai, and Sichuan cuisines. There's some wicked dim sum to be had here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Most Chinese-Americans prior to the current wave from (almost) post-industrial China were mostly from the Southern provinces. Mainly Guangdong and Fujian actually. A lot of Americanized Chinese food originated from Cantonese (Guangdong) cuisine and then developed from there into the Panda Express-like stuff you see nowadays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Itâ€™s also why Cantonese is the predominant language of Chinatowns in North America despite Mandarin being the more widespread language spoken in Mainland China. </p></div>		</li>
