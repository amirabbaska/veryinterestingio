			<div class="markdown"><p>Calvin Harris asks Ellie Goulding if she wants to do vocals in his song. She agrees if she gets paid for it or less paid if he includes her in the title (name recognition). He releases song in his name because he did most of the hard work.</p>
<p>Rihanna pays for the melody/lyrics, and releases it under her own name because she bought the melody/lyrics allready.</p>
<p>And then there's the fact that [these two]( <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/10/04/your-favorite-song-on-the-radio-was-probably-written-by-these-two/" target="_blank">http://nypost.com/2015/10/04/your-favorite-song-on-the-radio-was-probably-written-by-these-two/</a>) would probably have their name in a lot of songs if everybody involved was to be credited.</p>
<p>BMWs and Mercedes could've been called BMW/Mercedes feat. BOSCH because there's a lot of parts made by BOSCH inside them, but they pay for being able to use them without mentioning their brand in their name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Marketing. It's simpler and more lucrative for a label to market a record with whoever is the face of the tour (i.e. Beyonce, Adele) so customers can make the connection more easily. If you really like a Beyonce song that you saw in concert or on heard on the radio, it's easier if you can go to iTunes and type in Beyonce than try to guess the producer or whoever else helped make the track.</p></div>		</li>
