			<div class="markdown"><p>Related question: How do they determine it was lightning?  </p>
<p>Answer: The <a href="http://www.vaisala.com/en/products/thunderstormandlightningdetectionsystems/Pages/NLDN.aspx" target="_blank">National Lightning Detection Network</a>. The NLDN consists of 300 sensors spread throughout North America, monitoring all lightning activity from the Mexican border to the Arctic circle. Each sensor is a LF radio receiver connected to a signal processing computer with time keeping from atomic clocks. Detected events are relayed to a central processor.  </p>
<p>This central processor knows the precise location of the sensors and the precise time the signal arrived at each sensor. It then does a bit of geometry to determine the lightning bolt's location. For added fun, the geometry is performed on an oblate spheroid with local deviations. Now that it has a location, it can use the signal's amplitude at each sensor to work out the stroke's amperage and it's polarity. That information is then stored in a database. The entire process, from sensor detection to solution, typically takes under a second.  </p>
<p>Investigators can then query this database for information about lightning activity at the right time near where the fire started. Other uses of NLDN data are power companies wanting to know just where the lightning blew out the transmission lines and arson investigators trying to figure out if a building fire was natural or man-made.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But is that a fresh strike or an old one? It could be hard to tell if the area mostly burned down. Trees are struck during most storms, but very few result in fires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a BS in Physics and another in Computer Science. I was also fortunate (for the time) that my school actually had a class in computational methods of physics. The fact that I know a fair amount of EM is occasionally useful as well. In computer science, lower level courses in assembly and operating systems have been the most valuable. Not because I use assembly, but because since I do dive into driver-land on occasion, I really should know what the OS is up to.  </p>
<p>If I'd known at the time, I would have doubled up on signal processing coursework. Right now, I spend my spare moments at work reading through a textbook on it.  </p>
<p>In a sense, I'm just another programmer. I take algorithms scientists develop and implement them. On the other hand, understanding just what I'm implementing and why lets me create more efficient, faster code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get into forestry. Oregon State is a phenomenal school for it, as are a lot of schools in the pnw. Possibly double major in business or something along those lines. While in school spend a summer doing line work on fires, you'll be doing insanely hard work and you'll have to take a few classes with a company. The classes are generally 2-3 days and paid for by the company. Call about the job a lot. The more you call the more likely you are to get called out to a fire. Working the line is hard work but it'll get you into the best shape of your life. Work up your core strength! </p>
<p>Next summer take a higher up job at ICP(command post) if possible. Once you have the degree you can do just about anything with experience.</p>
<p>There are a myriad of jobs at ICP though. Communications, logistics, maps, clerical, accounting, etc. ICP is basically a small town so there's a lot to do.</p>
<p>Be persistent. If you want the job keep calling and getting ahold of people. Ask for anything. Promotions are fast in wildfire work. The turnover rate, depending on the positions, can be quite high. </p>
<p>Source: I did line work for 2 summers, got a job doing clerical work for Oregon fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also have fire dogs that are trained to smell accelerates. I work in insurance and have been to multiple cause and origin training's at the fire academy. The dogs are incredible they can smell where the fire started and what was used. I saw them do lighter fluid, gas, alcohol, thinners. Every time the dog had it figured out in seconds. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dogs are incredible. I know it's different but I took a class with search and rescue dogs once. We had four students hide while the rest just stood in the rubble. The dog knew that the ones standing didn't need to be found and located the other four within about fifteen minutes. This was a rubble pile at least a quarter the size of a football field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only vaguely familiar with that case but I know that we still have to investigate all fires. And even though a regular company officer can investigate 99% of all fires and get it right, we use our specialists that are also peace officers to investigate the complex, deadly, or ones we know are complex and gonna end up in court. Much like any investigation you can't prove anything with just one or two little pieces of evidence. </p></div>		</li>
