			<div class="markdown"><p>So to be able to reproduce a species have to be able to divide its chromosomes evenly, and a hybrid have an odds chromosomes. That's why they can not reproduce. Right?</p>
<p>But let's say if the father have 23 and the mother have 25. The offspring will have 48, which can be divided evenly. Can this happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it’s not the number per se, it’s that all of the necessary genetic data is included but not duplicated. If two species have different numbers of chromosomes, chances are the information on those chromosomes doesn’t match up well enough to get a complete amount, yet at the same time not have too much. Having too many chromosomes is a problem. Like if a human has an extra chromosome #21, they’ll have Down syndrome. But with an extra of any other chromosome (with the exception of sex chromasomes X and Y), they’ll probably die before being born because there’s too much genetic data and it causes problems in the fetus that are usually fatal except in very rare cases, and in those cases, the person probably has major health problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic answer is no, for the offspring to be fertile it doesn't just have to have an even number of chromosomes, they also have to be matched.  Order matters, so the mother gives Xsome number 24 and Xsome 25.  Those have no match, and in reality not all of the rest will either.  Without that match the haploid cells can't separate and reform properly during gamete production and fertiliztion.</p>
<p>More complex answer.  Very, very rarely something unusual happens where all of the gametes of a diploid cell end up in a sperm, if that sperm then fertilizes an egg where that extremely rare occurance also happened that could produce a viable zygote.  And if the female is able to carry the zygote they could potentially drop an offspring.  That offspring will be a tetraploid (4n) and because all the chromosomes now have a match will be fertile again.  Entire species have been created that way, especially among plants.  The sundew Drosera anglica is one naturally occuring example (a hybrid between Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera linearis) and is thought to have happened several distinct time, leading to distinct lineages.  A lot of crop plants have been created that way, too, since certain chemicals can increase the odds of the process happening.</p>
<p>There are other more complex fertile polyploids, too, such as the triploid Ambystoma salamanders of the great lakes.  The mechanism for how they are fertile without chromosomal matching is known, but I admit is a bit beyond my cell and biochemical knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any human without exactly 23 pairs in infertile, because only 46 chromosomes overall code for a fertile human. This is the case for people with any sort of monosomy (one less chromosome) or trisomy (one more chromosome). As an example,  Downs Syndrome is Trisomy 21, meaning that a person with the syndrome is not able to create a 23 haploid cell, because they have 47 chromosomes all together. The mother with 25 chromosomes would most likely be infertile. This is almost the same idea of how we get seedless fruits: growers have found a way to intentionally make the plants infertile so that they cannot produce seeds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seedless banana and watermelon fruits are produced on triploid plants, whose three sets of chromosomes make it very unlikely for meiosis to produce fertile gametes.This is because one of the three copies of each chromosome can't pair with another appropriate chromosome before separating into daughter cells, so these extra third copies end up randomly distributed between the two daughter cells from meiosis 1, resulting in the (usually) swiftly lethal aneuploidy (meaning irregular chromosome count) condition</p>

<p>A really crude way to think about how chromosomes work is how a computer doesnt allow you to open up the same file in two programs, because the changes in one would then affect the other and so on. You can think about the DNA as similar: there is more information happening than the cell knows how to handle and so problems end up occuring in some way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Admitting my ignorance of genetics.  Does a mule diploid divide into a 31 c haploid and a 32 c haploid?  If so, why cannot two 31 c haploids combine to make a 62 c diploid?  Is diploid division irregular, i.e. if two 62 c diploids divide will their individual haploids contain different arrangements of chromosomes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more because when that split happens, neither of the sex cells end up getting all the chromosomes needed to operate a new human. While theoretically two mules could mate, and the two sex cells could happen to be 31 each, there is no way to ensure that the 31's contain the right pairings of DNA. You get 23 chromosomes each from your mom and dad, but they are still able to match up when theyre in you (i.e. your moms #1 is the same as your dads, they just have a few different lines of code in them). When you start unevenly dividing up which goes where, you will lose some of that pairing opportunity, which means fertility is extremely unlikely, but not impossible, because genetics have an infinite amount of possibilities</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of October 2002, there had been only 60 documented cases of mules birthing foals since 1527.[18] In China in 2001, a mare (female) mule produced a filly.[19] In Morocco in early 2002 and Colorado in 2007, mare mules produced colts.[18][20][21] Blood and hair samples from the Colorado birth verified that the mother was indeed a mule and the foal was indeed her offspring.[21]</p>
