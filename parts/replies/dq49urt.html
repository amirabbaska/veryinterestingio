			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's another point- people are so confident companies like Apple/Google are good for the money that they'll lend it to them at rates well below 5%. So low that it's a cinch for those companies to make a higher return than that by investing their cash in growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I think the interest paid on the debt is a deduction which further reduces the <em>effective</em> cost on that debt, which furthers the point. This is why it drives me bonkers hearing people talk about zero debt being the smartest way to live. It's not. Not all debt is bad. Bad debt is bad! (credit cards, for example) But good debt allows one to expand operations and/or increase returns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is especially true for corporations, interest paid is  deductible from income. For homeowners, mortgage interest is deductible as well. </p>
<p>Some people don't see this as prudent, but with today's low interest rates- my current mortgage is under 3%, I am delaying paying my mortgage off early and instead investing in blue chip dividend paying stocks with a blended yield of about 5%. We are talking telecoms and utilities, not very risky stuff. Thus far its working out well...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its so stupid, because when we deal with people and lots of money, corruption is going to happen. </p>
<p>Saying they are too big to fail, gives them unlimited get out of jail free cards.</p>
<p>And its the reason subprime loans are being dished out under a new name all the time, and among other factors will inevitably end in another financial crisis before 2050</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohh let me try to understand this since I’m not so well versed in economics.</p>
<p>Basically it’s as if borrowed $1 mil and use that money to make money. They charge me maybe $50,000 a year or so interest.</p>
<p>But I use that money to make say $300,000 so I make a profit of $250,000 after paying the interest.</p>
<p>But if I paid back the $1 mil I would have trouble making the money I made before so I just say, “fuck it, that’s just too much trouble.”</p>
<p>Or something like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That pretty much summarizes the concept. If you hear the term <strong>opportunity cost</strong> being thrown around in finance it is generally related to this sort of scenario. Specifically it considers what potential future value has to be traded off to invest in one direction or another. If you can make more value by having the money available to use than the interest will cost you, then the 'opportunity cost' of paying off the debt would be the potential profit, or the $250,000 in your example. </p>
<p>It's less that it's too much trouble and more that the role of finance and accounting in business is to work out all the math in advance as accurately as possible, so they know what they are doing with the money and how much they expect to make back over the interest before they ever accept the loan. </p>
<p>It essentially never happens that a large company just 'stumbles' into a profit over the interest, and therefore decide not to pay back a debt sooner. They have a <em>really</em> good idea exactly how that money will be used over the entire loan period and how much they are likely able to make before they ever get the money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the same boat as you. If I understand it correctly, they then reinvest that 250,000 they made to earn even more money the next time. Rince and repeat till they come at the end of the term?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what you haven't mentioned is that the investment could fail, and you'd be out 1mil as well as the interest.</p>
<p>A large corp (or a rich dude) can afford to take this risk - a poor person can't, and therefore, poor remains poor due to lack of opportunity to invest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They eventually do end up paying back their loans over long periods of time, they just basically take them out again or different ones ('roll over' the debt), and because they are so reliable in paying them back and take out such large loans they can get great rates. And why wouldn't they, if they have such a great track record. In fact, competition makes it almost impossible for them not to because it makes their return on investment that much higher, they need that to compete with the other companies that do.</p>
<p>Only to a point though, where it becomes too dangerous, sometimes limited by legislation but in a lot of cases it's basically when the free market decides it's too much (if you step way out of the industry standard and have way too much debt compared to your earnings it doesn't look good). But the free market can also allow massive crashes to happen, debt levels tolerated by the free market can also be extremely dangerous in certain circumstances, at least a lot more than the free market realizes.</p>
<p>So you can end up with a shockwave that runs through the entire economy and basically bankrupts entire industries (and the banks that provide the loans, see the mortgage crisis of '07-'08) because all the loans become due and no one has the money to pay them. Leverage means you earn that much more when you are able to make money off of your debt, but lose that much more when you can't. And because everyone in the banking and say housing or commodities industry does it, everyone gets hurt by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. There are pretty much no real world situations where they would want or be able to 'loop' the money by reinvesting indefinitely, and even if there was the amount reinvested would have more to do with the totals of all a companies operations and likely have very little to do with any one specific loan or investment.</p>
<p>Realistically a company will have many different debts with different interest rates and end terms. It is safer to think of each individual loan/investment as its own standalone money making event. Someone see's an opportunity to make some money, the finance and accounting people work out all the relevant math to figure out how much they need and if it will be able to profit more than the interest rate for a loan. If it will clearly make money with little risk to lose, they go and make a deal for the loan they want and launch the investment. The entire plan and exactly how much money they expect to make over the period of the loan where all figured out before any loan was ever taken.</p>
<p>It's generally more about having access to the money needed to start some money making venture without having to actually have the money themselves, or take the money they do have out of other areas. A large company will have all kinds of loans out associated to all kinds of specific projects. Whether money was reinvested back in, or payed out to investors or whatever year to year, would be more likely to be decided based on the totals across all the projects a company was operating.</p></div>		</li>
