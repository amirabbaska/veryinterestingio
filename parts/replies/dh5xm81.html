<p>And I believe that list does not include private ones. For example my university has its own DNS, as far as I know its primary purpose is to manage access to the networked printers but it's a fully-functional DNS. Anecdotally, it's not very reliable but if the local ISP's default DNS stopped working for some reason, the internal one would might still be working at that time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, you can even set up your own DNS Server with a Raspberry Pi. So even if the main ones go down, you can still find web sites. Just depends on that they never change IP. But it would bridge until they are back online.</p>
