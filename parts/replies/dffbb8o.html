			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely get her doctor to refer her to a headache specialist. </p>
<p>Once you have a specialist doc, experiment with different abortive meds. There are a bunch of different medications and even different delivery mechanisms. I've found sumatriptan shots to be the most effective for me. </p>
<p>If she has migraines for than 15 days a month (even mild ones) she might be eligible to get botox injections. Those changed my life. I still get a lot of migraines but the severity is much less. Talk to the neuro. </p>
<p>There are also some vitamin supplements that doctor can recommend that might help. Magnesium supplements stopped my auras. </p>
<p>Keep a food/migraine journal and look for correlations. Be as scientific as possible to try and isolate potential food triggers. Calcium propionate is a preservative in bread products that pretty much guarantees I'll get a migraine. It was tough to figure that out, but now I can avoid it. </p>
<p>Be supportive. The only thing worse than having a migraine is having it when there's a ton of stuff to do around the house and my wife gets stuck with it all. I always feel bad, but I can't do anything about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got her to a doctor. She's currently on some anti-migraine pills. After 4-5 days she told me that besides when waking up, no headaches are present and feels fine. But I'd rather not sit around and get caught by surprise when one arrives. </p>
<p>I always try to make sure she's stress free and has nothing anxiety-inducing to think of. The thing I've found working the most is taking a water vaporizer, and put towels over the burning vapor created. It gets the towels hot in less than  10 seconds, and are ready to be put to use over any limb you need. </p>
<p>Plus, it creates a humid environment which for some reason makes her feel better.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sumutriptan!!  Those things are a life saver for me,  When my attacks come, they last 4 or 5 days, and we're looking at up to 10 shots.</p>
<p>Just think for a moment.  If the idea of stabbing yourself with a neede is it attractive, you have to be in some kinda shape.  Some people just don't realize how bad these things are, and how little of the problem is the literal migraine pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have been getting bad headaches and migraines for almost 20 years. </p>
<p>OTC painkillers. Ibuprofen 600-800 helps me most of the time. ASA blew a hole in my stomach in my early 20s from taking too much and acetaminophen does nothing. </p>
<p>Hot/Cold. . Hot pad/bag on the forehead/ face and ice pack of the back/chest. </p>
<p>Head and neck massage.  Can help or depending on the type of headache can feel awful. </p>
<p>Dark room. Very very dark room.  But that's just because I get very photosensitive. If she doesn't the this may not matter. </p>
<p>Comfort. I get visual aura to the point where I lost 70-90% of vision for up to an hour. It's scary as shit even though it's happened dozens of times. My wife really helps keep me calm now. </p>
<p>Distraction. If I turn down the backlight on the tv or laptop I can usually watch a movie or something to keep my mind off it. Or a podcast. Just something other than concentrating on how much my head hurts. </p>
<p>White/brown noise also helps when trying to sleep. </p>
<p>Edit: also high sugar fruit like pineapple, peaches, etc. Processed sugar doesn't have the same effect. This might be just me though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes a hot shower in the dark helps me. I start as hot as I can stand and then keep increasing the temp as my body adjusts. It rarely eliminates the migraine but usually helps reduce the pain and auras--and sometimes gets me okay enough to either sleep or vomit. Those are my gateways to relief. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot showers definitely help me with pain management during a migraine. Sometimes they get to be super long showers, though. When moving, I actually will heavily take into consideration the size and type of the hot water tank when evaluating a new home. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Injury or tightness in the upper neck muscles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is my problem. I get extremely brutal migraines that narcotics barely help when it hits hard.</p>
<p>The pain is the back of my head and right through one eye. To the point that I could jump at it if a Dr said removing the eye would fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know it was common for fellow migraine sufferers to want to drill their head, at least I know I'm not alone. </p>
<p>I get this other non pain thing where I can feel it come on and I slowly lose vision in my eyes, but yet I can still sort of see. It's hard to describe, but it's all blurry and fuzzy, and there's like one little space on &quot;the top of my eye&quot; that can sort of see though by then my eyes are watering and the light feels weird. </p>
<p>First time it happened I was naturally terrified. I still feel very uncomfortable when it happens. Only happened once when I was driving, but the moment I felt the sensation I was able to pull over safely and wait for it to pass. </p>
<p>A couple of times it's happened it's like my blurry, fuzzy eyes rotate to a 45 degree angle and everything is lopsided. I've had numerous MRIs and seen an ophthalmologist but have found nothing.  </p>
<p>Edit: I just noticed what you write about concussion. Holy crap, when younger I was concussed several times. </p></div>		</li>
