			<div class="markdown"><p>So there’s still some gas, and generally when people say space is cold, they are talking about the temperature of that gas. This isn’t very useful for getting rid of heat, though. The larger issue is the heat from being in the sun, or coolness from being in the shade. In the shade, you can radiate a lot of heat without absorbing much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold is the absence of heat. Nothingness is as cold as cold gets. Heat can radiate out into empty space just like light can.</p></div>		</li>
