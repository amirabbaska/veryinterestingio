In the gums at birth your teeth are being formed by building cells which construct and shape calcium phosphate into teeth, this construction finalizes once your second set of teeth come in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question: I chipped my teeth in a fall around 8 years ago. It made a very visible dent on my upper buck tooth. Now however, the tooth looks normal, the chip appearing to have completely healed. What has happened here?  </p>
<p>Is it due to the wearing of the surrounding material that made the dent go away?</p></div>		</li>
