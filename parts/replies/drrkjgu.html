			<div class="markdown"><p>LED screens are really just LCD screen that use LEDs for the backlighting, instead of the florescent tube they used to use.  If you remember the transition for LCDs from when they were sort-of-thinish to Holy-crap-that-is-really-thin, it was because of LEDs for backlighting.</p>
<p>OLED is different because they are literally tiny LED-type lights for each pixel. Conventional LEDs could not be produced small enough to be used in that manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly only know the basics of screen tech but I know LED TVs  use an led backlight behind the LCD panel( the pixels themselves do not produce light) whereas on OLEDs there is no backlight as the individual pixels produce their own light( how, I don't know haha) which allows for individual pixels to be switched off leading  to really deep blacks as opposed to dark  greys on LED LCD tvs.I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will tell you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an interesting tidbit, Samsung is the industry leader in AMOLED displays for many years now, they've been manufacturing their own AMOLED displays, using them in their own flagships and selling them to their competitors too for almost a decade now. They also have the best quality AMOLED displays (Currently the Note 8 seems to have the best display of any phone) in the market, LG being the only other company that's even remotely close to them. </p>
<p>Reports came out this year that Google has almost a Billion dollars invested in LG's OLED operation, and that Apple is also going investing upwards of 2.5B dollars in LG's OLED division. The purpose for this is to help LG break Samsung's 'monopoly' on the AMOLED business.</p>
<p>Apple has been putting off moving to AMOLED displays (They used IPS LED displays in all their previous phones) for their iPhones because no company could handle their requirement until this year when they finally started using Samsung's AMOLED displays in their iPhone X, which also meant paying a much higher price. Samsung is reportedly making over a $100 per iPhone X sold, because of the AMOLED display, while Apple only paid around half of that when they used LED displays. </p>
<p>Google didn't opt for using Samsung's AMOLED displays in their Pixel 2 devices this year, went with LG's OLED panels instead and there have been many reports of various kinds of issues with those displays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I should have specified that. When I wrote 'Pixel 2' I meant 2XL only as I wasn't even thinking of the Pixel 2. Honestly, most people who are going to buy this phone are going to buy the 2XL only. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The luminescent molecules that are used in Samsung’s display are patented. You can’t use them without licensing them. In an oled everything comes down to the organic layer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lg has been rated best in class by multiple sources. Samsung is not better, this is an opinon. Samsung doesnt even bother making oled tvs because lg owns the market. Cell phones are a very small part of the display pie. </p></div>		</li>
