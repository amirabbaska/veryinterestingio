			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope - none. You can use Paint.net (great free image editor) if you don't have something like photoshop. </p>
<p>Zoom into the photo until you can see the individual pixels and used the &quot;colour picker&quot; tool (eye dropper) to select them. They're grey/green. Not a single red or pink pixel in the bunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The RGB value of the sample linked and expanded above is (181,179,185).</p>
<p>Actually, if you check the values around some of the most &quot;obviously&quot; red parts of that image, they're actually more blue or green, with values often going as akew as (140,180,180) or something in that neighborhood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you're seeing red because of the contrast between the warmer gray pixels and the sharper green tint.  the human brain doesn't see colors individually, we see them in context against their surroundings.  so the same color will take on different hues based on whether it's on a black, white, or tinted background.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't get though is that isn't the filter removing information about the original image? Aren't there multiple colors that those strawberries can be that would result in the same image as shown when the same filter is applied? I'm not sure what that other possible original color would be, maybe grey? If that's the case, I don't know why it would be interpreted as one color vs. the other, but maybe it's not.</p></div>		</li>
