			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have been giving only a partial answer as to what wall street does</p>
<p>At its core Wall street firms are service companies!</p>
<p>A lot people think wall street firms are guys sitting around buying stocks and selling them at a profit ala Wolf of wallstreet</p>
<p>In reality, those people aren't the biggest players on the street. &quot;Wall street&quot; is divided into two halves. The popularly known side are buy side investors such as hedge funds, who use the money you give them to make you a return. </p>
<p>However, the biggest firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanely, ect, work mainly in the other half: Sell-side Investing</p>
<p>Essentially, they provide all the services a company need financially. </p>
<p>Wall street firms like Goldman Sachs make most of their money from &quot;Institutional Client Services&quot;, basically helping companies get the money/assets they need.</p>
<p>When tesla needs $1billion to build a new factory, they will go to Goldman Sachs and ask &quot;Hey, how do you think I should get this money? I certainly don't have that much cash on me right now.&quot; and GS will help them find the funds to finance it (as companies such as Tesla will never have $1billion). They will help Tesla borrow money from people. Another way GS makes money from Client services is by making markets, or selling people stuff. If the guy from Wolf of Wall street wants to buy $10 Million dollars of Tesla shares, GS will sell (Hence, sell-side) it to them (GS has a lot of money and has $40 Million dollars of Tesla shares in their pocket!). </p>
<p>The second major service wall street firms offer are Investment Banking services. Now, you might be like &quot;woah, I thought Jordan Belfort was an investment banker&quot;. Not exactly - Investment Banking is simply a set of SERVICES a bank provides to companies/high-net worth clients. </p>
<p>Examples of these SERVICES: </p>
<p>IPOS: If a company wants to go public, it must issue shares to the market, a complicated process. GS is familiar with the process, and will do the paperwork/ advise the company through the process. </p>
<p>M&amp;A (Mergers and Acquisitions): If Tesla wants to buy SmartCar, they will ask GS how much GS thinks SmartCar is worth, and GS will help Tesla strike and complete a merger. </p>
<p>These are just a few services that a wall street firms offer - there are many many more! But I hope people don't think that the only thing wall street does is buy stocks and sell them at a higher price. The financial markets are very important on wall street and impact every decision, but there's much more that the firm's create. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the people of wall street provide services to help other companies run! Except instead of providing these services to ordinary people like you and me, they provide them to companies and really rich people! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Firms like GS also do the underwriting of the IPOs, probably the most important part of the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all correct and neutral. If you are critical of Wall Street, you can talk about how they take advantage of regulatory capture and oligopoly power to make their services a necessity. If you are praising Wall Street you can talk about some Ayn Rand nonsense or something. Point is, this post is the best ELI5 answer.</p>
<p>One thing to add though is derivatives -- something folks don't often understand but which we know a bit about because of the role they played in 2008.</p>
<p>At its most fundamental, a derivative contract is just an agreement to pay someone else money based on the price of another thing (like a stock, a cow, a house, etc.). The price of this contract is <em>derived</em> from the cost of another thing. This can be really valuable to companies and people who buy or sell a lot of one thing. If you grow corn, you can buy contracts that let you sell corn for a certain price when your harvest comes in. If you know how much you are going to get for your corn, it helps you plan for the future.</p>
<p>The famous example is that Southwest locked in the price of jet fuel before the mid-2000's spike in oil prices, and it helped them keep fares low and out-compete other airlines.</p>
<p>However, it is important that you know what the price of the underlying thing is. If you've seen &quot;the Big Short&quot; (or read the book, it's excellent), then maybe you remember them fighting with the banks over the price of the Mortgage Back Securities that they held derivative contracts on. The problem is that when something is only bought and sold by the biggest Wall Street banks, then the market price is almost whatever they want it to be.</p>
<p>But now I'm straying away from neutral and towards critical, so I'll stop there.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Derivatives can be good. Derivatives can be bad. But they definitely serve a purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything, and it's extraordinarily complicated. For example, money poorly invested in the early 2000s created a &quot;dot-com bubble&quot; which negatively impacted internet startups for some time afterwards because nobody wanted to invest in what could turn out to be another bubble.</p>
<p>In 2008, money poorly invested in subprime mortgage securities created a housing bubble that, once crashed, collapsed the US housing market and led to the failure of very large banks which caused a domino effect across the entire economy and could've led to very catastrophic circumstances had the government not bailed them out.</p>
<p>I would disagree with OP in that I do believe Wall St is important to the economy, since generally the negative impacts we feel from such events happening comes from Wall St not investing money after losing confidence in the system. (Which shows it's importance).</p>
<p>But, getting back to your question, repeat after me: <em>Any business or system worth a significant amount of money is affected by Wall St.</em></p>
<p>So a giant lawnmower business worth $100,000,000 is impacted by them. A shipping company worth $15.5b is impacted by them. A window &amp; glass installation company worth $250,000,000 is impacted by them. A construction company worth $100b is impacted by them. An underground ivory piano key supplying market worth a total of $150,000,000 is impacted by them. An arms manufacturer worth $80b is impacted by them.</p>
<p>Do you now see how this can affect pretty much anything? Markets aren't separate things, they're intertwined with eachother even when not related. When one fails the others can shake. It's far too complex to list all that could happen, but consider the fact just about anything could.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed effect to affect. Additionally, because investors on Wall Street have a diversified portfolio, major failure from one investment will undoubtedly leak into others. With investment banking, which can afford billions of dollars in investments, you can see how this is a problem with their failure.</p>
<p>Consumers affected in those market price fluctuations (for example, losing $100k of the purchase price on their home), will have less money to spend overall. So every available market will feel this depression in the economy, even illegal ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How are they affecting each other? Your explanation is excellent until the second to last paragraph where you don't really explain the interconnectedness of things before getting to the &quot;do you now see?&quot; conclusion.</p>
<p>Also, easy mistake, but <em>affect</em> is the verb and <em>effect</em> is the noun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best arguments for the &quot;sub-prime infection&quot; story are from Amir Sufi and Atif Mian, and even they have walked back their causality claims. There is more evidence that change in housing induced lending, rather than vice versa, and that's partly why housing recovered despite a heavily segmented, lagging mortgage market. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wall Street provides different services. Ilikeditthewayitwas referred to moving money, which might include things like bond sales and equity issuances. You also have risk distribution, for example netting interest rate derivative contracts so that counterparties that have never met can nonetheless exchange variable rate exposure for constant rates. Then you have direct lending to institutions, and custodial and processing services. These are usually big bank activities and are referred to as &quot;sell side&quot; because they are not primarily focused on taking principal risk. Something like market making, which roughly represents narrowing liquidity premiums in matching buyers and sellers, might be provided by big banks, or other institutions like Citadel Securities. </p>
<p>Then you have the &quot;buy side&quot; that takes principal risk, and includes private equity, hedge funds, mutual funds, and venture capital. Here the &quot;moving money around&quot; explanation is iffy because you are actually claiming a stake in business results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very bad explanation, and the fact that it is currently the top response to this post is symptomatic of the kind of financial/economic illiteracy that allows the financial sector to run rampant. People don't know what &quot;Wall Street&quot; does, so they cant make informed decisions on their own finances, much less cast an informed vote. </p>
<p>On a very, very basic level, Wall Street is all about connecting lenders with borrowers. A share of stock, or a corporate bond, or most other financial instruments, is essentially a way for a company to raise money. They get immediate cash flow, and the buyer an IOU. The terms of the IOU differ for each kind of security, but that's the core of it. This is good and useful to society because businesses need money to pay workers and build factories, and raising a little bit of money from many people is easier than finding one person with all the cash you need. It's the original crowdfunding. </p>
<p>Where things get weird is that when you operate on the scale of Wall Street or other major financial markets, the values of the IOUs tend to get a bit divorced from the values of the actual borrowers. Lenders can trade IOUs, which doesn't directly benefit the borrower, though it affects the value of future sales of IOUs. This means both initial lenders and borrowers have a vested interest in keeping the theoretical value of the IOUs high, leading to... Fraud may be too strong a word, but it's not that far off. This can be exacerbated by deregulation which allows borrowers and middle-men to package the IOUs in interesting and misleading ways that can cause lenders (shareholders and buyers of financial instruments) to think they're getting a good deal when really, they're buying crap. People can and have put their whole life savings into worthless IOUs and lost everything when everyone else realized they were worthless, too.</p>
<p>Basically, Wall Street isn't pure evil, but it's not unmitigated good either. We need to understand what's going on in order to make sound financial and political decisions, and glib responses to questions like this serve no one but the people who profit from manipulating our ignorance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wall Street is neither good nor evil, it's neutral. Just like guns, abortion, prison, politics, or most other things with a negative connotation. </p>
<p>It's the people that deal with those things that make them bad or good.</p>
<p>The problem people have with Wall Street is that it's heavily susceptible to corruption, so it gets seen as this thing that steals money and makes elites even wealthier. Plus they aren't physically producing anything, so an average person doesn't have a tangible object to associate with Wall Street. Most people let their minds wander about Wall Street from the things they hear on tv or talked about in a political setting. </p>
<p>It's all kind of silly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally untrue that it doesn't &quot;serve society&quot; and it's really a shame to see such an overly simplistic and flat out wrong description be the top answer. </p>
<p>I'm a flaming progressive but even I recognize that Wall Street helps society. </p>
<p>Wall Street helps &quot;the market&quot; have liquidity. Aside from being the backbone of the financial system with buying and selling of corporate debt, bonds, and stocks, which all helps companies grow and develop and have enough money to take risks, grow, and make the wheels of commerce move, Wall Street also helps ensure that smaller banks and investors will almost always be able to get out of an investment position that they are in. Which helps banks and investors know that they can often cut their losses and get out. Without that ability, they would need greater returns, which makes capital
More expensive and drives down the amount of investment. </p>
<p>Also you can't underestimate how many regular people aside from the stereotypical traders work on &quot;Wall Street&quot;. Tens of thousands of not more regular hard working educated people make a good living...people who then consume, spend, invest, etc... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that kind of a contrived argument? Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're essentially saying that &quot;more liquidity&quot; --&gt; &quot;more investments/companies can grown &amp; develop quicker&quot; --&gt; &quot;wheels of commerce move&quot;, right? </p>
<p>But 1) is it necessarily the case that each part of that sequence leads to the latter, or might all of them mean the same thing at the same time (which would then be the equivalent of saying &quot;X leads to X which leads to X, and that final X is a good thing&quot;), and 2) why is the final conclusion necessarily a good thing/benefit to society?</p>
<p>If the means are the ends and the ends are &quot;a good thing&quot; for society, doesn't that also lead to an argument supporting a fallacy of extremes -- e.g., &quot;it's always better that the economy is more liquid&quot;? But what does the end of that tunnel even mean, is there some &quot;ideal&quot; level of &quot;hyper-liquidity&quot; that unequivocally benefits society?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/festess" target="_blank">festess</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Answer to (1) is yes, more liquidity necessarily leads to companies being able to develop quicker. The reason is, lots of people/companies in this world have money lying around that they want to invest (otherwise it's sitting around and losing value). And lots of other new and fledgling companies need money in order to develop themselves. Liquidity means the ability of the former to connect with the latter. Wall Street is currently essential to this process, without wall Street there is no liquidity, and those smaller companies don't have the money to grow which would stifle the economy and lead to less money in everyone's pocket.</p>
<p>(2) It's a good thing for society because (a) when all the worthy companies are allowed to get funding and to grow, wealth is created that everyone can participate in. It's not just one guy wins and one guy loses - the overall amount of wealth increases. E.g. if a company has the funding it needs to pull iron ore out the ground, or to improve computing speed, this actually gives society on the whole more time (efficiency from faster computers) or more resources (e.g. iron ore) this means goods and services to become cheaper which improves your quality of life as a consumer.</p>
<p>As to your third question, I suppose there's two levels of the extreme end point of liquidity.. the academic/theoretical end point and the realistic end point. I say this because liquidity has two components - the human psychology side (I.e how safe do people feel investing vs holding onto their money for a rainy day) and the technology side (how easy is it for someone who wants to invest to arrange said investment). Obviously the human psychology side is almost impossible to envision a realistic solution for.</p>
<p>But anyway the theoretical extreme would be - a world where wall Street manages the economy so well that everyone is happy to basically have zero savings (since they're so secure in their job), and we have perfect robot algorithms that continually invest all their spare money in the market at zero cost to the consumer.</p>
<p>The realistic end point is - one click investing with zero fees/charges and everyone has enough financial literacy to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Hope that helped answer your questions! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're way overthinking it. </p>
<p>Banking leads to liquidity and more investment opportunities. Investment opportunities are good because they help companies do things like hire people, invent medicine, technologies, get us food, create infrastructure, etc. </p>
<p>If you want to have a discussion about whether we would be better off living in a pre industrial style world that's a different conversation. I've assumed that society being able to build roads, bridges highways, hospitals, cancer treatment, power plants, and factories is overall a net benefit. All of that happens because of banking, and &quot;Wall Street&quot; is the backbone of the banking system. </p></div>		</li>
