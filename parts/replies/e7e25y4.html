			<div class="markdown"><p>My last comment was poorly worded - but what you've described isn't tidal locking, it's a synchronous orbit. </p>
<p>A synchronous orbit is where the orbital period of the satellite matches the rotational period of the body it is orbiting (like GPS satellites).</p>
<p>Tidal locking  is a <em>consequence</em> of synchronous orbits, where the satellite's rotational and orbital periods are equal. This means the satellite presents the same face to the body which it is orbiting (e.g. the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth). Our moon is tidally locked, but it isn't geosynchronous. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Your definition is wrong.  A synchronous orbit is where the orbital period of the satellite is a harmonic of the rotational period of the body it is orbiting.  GPS satellites orbit at twice the rate of the Earth's rotational period: two orbits in one sidereal period.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pluto and Charon are both tidally locked to each other. Charon appears to hover over one spot of Pluto and vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This bothers me. Is the moon rotating? From the earth, no. From the sun, yes. What if it rotated once per year, keeping one face toward the sun. Is it rotating? What even does rotating mean? We once thought that Mercury didn't rotate, but even if it kept one side toward the sun, it would still be rotating from a galactic perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is rotating from earth. We'd see different sides off it if it wasn't rotating relative to earth.</p>
<p>Like if you hold your first in front of you, and orbit it around your head. If you don't rotate your fist, you'll eventually see every part of it (assuming you could). In order to only see one side of your fist during orbit, you'd have to rotate your fist at a specific speed.</p></div>		</li>
