So yes, your ISP will know that you play MyLittlePonyOnline if they dig, but not that you were browsing RealPony doll websites. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One could always live deep in some jungle or cave somewhere far from civilization! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but you don't need to be &quot;totally invisible&quot;, you just need to hide from an ISP. Accept that the NSA is up in your shit, and live with it, because odds are you wont' do what it takes to get them out of it. Anything short of that however, is going to have trouble with what I described, which is why they're trying to criminalize it in the UK and elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
