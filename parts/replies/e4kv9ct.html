			<div class="markdown"><p>You just spit out the excess, and let the rest sit in there. When I brush for like 2/3 minutes, there isn't much foam left at that point. Keep in mind that I'm an idiot on the internet that read something a dentist said one time, not a dentist. Take my advice well-salted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, I believe that the ama dentist person said you should brush in the morning (no rinse), use mouthwash in the middle of the day (no rinse), and brush your teeth at night (no rinse).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you're not supposed to rinse your mouth out with water after using mouthwash. I always use mouth wash and then spit and then take a sip of water, gargle, and spit. When my SO saw me she was like &quot;nobody ever reads the instructions&quot;, and when i did , it said to not rinse after using. WTF life changed. </p>
<p>Apparently, you're supposed to use the mouth wash, then spit but leave the residue in your mouth to continue working. </p>
<p>Changing morning habits is hard though. Good luck. </p></div>		</li>
