			<div class="markdown"><p>It’ll kill some of the bacteria it comes in contact with, but no it won’t sanitize your mouth unless you intentionally swish it around for an extended period (like Listerine). Even then, it won’t kill all the bacteria in your mouth because there are so many nooks and crannies that will protect whatever bacteria are lodged there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dentist here. Just to clear up the misconception that the alcohol on listerine is the antiseptic. It's used at low ~20% to dissolve the essential oils. Listerine is an essential oil mouthrinse. It's those that give the burning sensation. Just like menthol gives you a cooling sensation. You need a way higher alcohol percent to act as disinfectant, much higher than listerine has. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too much alcohol will do several things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It'll kill off USEFUL bacteria in addition to bad bacteria.</li>
<li>It'll dehydate you, compromising your immune system.</li>
<li>It'll dehydrate your mucus membranes, giving bad bacteria a good environment in which to thrive.</li>
<li>It'll tax your liver, slowing down the filtration of all sorts of things that aren't good for your bloodstream, not just the alcohol itself.</li>
<li>It'll increase your risk factors (by varying degrees) for everything from gastrointestinal distorders to heart disease and cancer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not drinking alcohol by itself is no guarantee of perfect health, but its risks far outweigh any perceived benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more true for high-proof than high volume. Small beers are sanitized by other means than sheer alcohol production (they are generally boiled for long enough to kill most things), and at 2-4%ABV you are consuming more than enough liquid to compensate for the diuretic effect of the alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why yes, there is! In fact, it's better than theoretical, it's actual.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain viruses have reduced susceptibility to ethanol disinfectant due to the lack of lipid envelope, like norovirus (the common 48h stomach flu). This is part of the reason that we are advised not to use ethanol-based disinfectant after toilet visits (I work in a hospital). Disinfectants are actually removed from bathrooms.</p></div>		</li>
