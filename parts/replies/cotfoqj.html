			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind (for english at least), it's not just the 'ee's' we stress. Think about a mother saying, 'can you say 'Maaah-mah'? Can you say 'DAH-Dee'. The 'mah' 'bah' 'mo' 'ah' are all fairly common phonemes in English on top of the 'ee's'. We're cueing babies in on what to listen for by talking to them like that. Even before they're born, they're listening to people talk all around them while they're in the womb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher up! There's lots of great info about diminutive linguistics but the OP also asked why we use it more with kids. Adults instinctively speak in a way that helps children learn the language. Funnily enough deaf parents adopt 'motherese sign language' although I don't know what specifically makes it more baby-like.</p>
<p>I'm curious if that contributes to the frequent &quot;eee&quot; sounds. Dunno if they're easier to pronounce without teeth or not, but kids voices sure are squeaky.</p></div>		</li>
