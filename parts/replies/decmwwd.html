			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to add something from a Biology major's perspective. Deserts ≠ barren wasteland, and I can guarantee a lot of ecosystems would be heavily impacted by a large solar array cutting across it. I think this is a fact often lost in the discussion as people tend to take it for granted that the desert is a lifeless useless resource, just waiting for someone to come, and exploit it. Such an attitude, if we're not cautious, may very well result in a reduction of some of the very vibrant biodiversity observed in desert ecosystems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few other parts here too with sand issues. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dunes are not static, they can move and shift overtime and would require monitoring and expensive excavation if they moved. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sand storms/wind carrying sand is essentially sandblasting. Over a short amount of time they would likely erode the surface of the panels (and everything else) but this would drastically reduce the efficiency of the panels and require expensive resurfacing/maintenance. </p>
</li>
<li>Deserts have a huge range of temperature from day to night. This could cause damaged parts to break even faster. </li>
</ol>
<p>Great post btw^</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, you bring up some great points too. I really like number 3 there, going back to solar panel heat. Heat and any kind of components do not mix well, as heat seems to be the ultimate destroyer of everything. Given that you have enough of it for a sustained period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for a great description. I just wanted to pick out one point which I think is not entirely accurate:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solar I don't believe sells well in Canada or states and countries along the same latitude as Washington or Oregon state.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solar is doing pretty well in both The Netherlands (my country) and Germany. Both are (a bit) higher than Washington state. It's also growing in countries like Sweden, although production there is definitely limited compared to more southern countries.  </p>
<p>Sure, the closer to the equator you'll get, the more you can benefit of solar, but in The Netherlands a solar array of ~€10k can power most average homes. Granted, the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3" target="_blank">average American home consumes 10kWh of power per year</a> which is three times as much as the average energy use of our households.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually appreciate you coming to me about this. To be honest with you too, I've had the thought of moving out to the Netherlands for solar but I wasn't able to figure out who out there I could work for. What are your opinions of the overall state of solar in Europe right now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm definitely not an expert by all means, just an informed consumer I guess. I recently bought a bunch of solar panels in a solar farm near our house to power our small household (two adults and an infant in a small apartment, we consume about 2100kWh/year.)  </p>
<p>We've looked into getting an array on our apartment building with our HOA to power the common area, this is feasible and return on investment is something like eight to ten years. I haven't been able to convince the HOA majority yet because there's some maintenance due first but I hope we'll do so in the next few years.  </p>
<p>As for the 'state of solar', I think it's still going pretty slow but it's been ramping up the last few years. Some of it was due to subsidies on solar panels (which are becoming less) some of it was due to Chinese manufacturers making the panels really cheap (which, if I remember correctly, has been dampened a bit due to EU import regulations.)  </p>
<p>I think the last (maybe half?) year I've seen a lot more utility companies jumping on the solar bandwagon. Providing panels 'for lease' and/or helping people buy them with a loan to the utility company (basically 'forcing' you not to switch utility companies for ten years to pay off the loan), helping nonetheless.  </p>
<p>I personally think countries as high as ours are in need of affordable battery storage solutions and in the end the average household needs a combination of solar, wind, and batteries to be sustainable year round.  </p>
<p>As for the rest of Europe, the countries that could benefit the most from solar (Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece) all seem to have some economic troubles so I'm afraid it'll take some time before they invest heavily into new infrastructure at the moment.  </p>
<p>As for who to work for, my guess is a large energy company like Eneco is the easiest path. Other than that I had contact with a decently large installation company called <a href="https://www.samangroep.nl/duurzame-energie/" target="_blank">Saman Group</a> that I know are looking for technicians but I'm not so sure if they would work with expats and how easy that would be for you.</p></div>		</li>
