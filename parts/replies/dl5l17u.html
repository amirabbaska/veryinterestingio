			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why ice cream scoops are dipped in water between scoops, it warms the metal and un-freezes the ice cream on the next scoop.</p>
<p>If you try to scoop multiple scoops you'll freeze to the spoon on the second or third attempt.  Depending on the thermal mass of the spoon and the temperature of the ice cream, i.e. newer containers just pulled from deep freeze will need to be dipped in water after every scoop, and even then will sometimes still freeze to the spoon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also why the best ice cream scoops like the Zeroll have a hollow handle filled with a conductive fluid to quickly move heat from your hand to the scoop and keep the scoop moving quickly through the ice cream.</p></div>		</li>

I was kind of amazed and sad to read <a href="https://www.zeroll.com/pages/en/products_scoops.php" target="_blank">&quot;The Original Zeroll Ice Cream Scoop creates a bigger looking portion by eliminating compression, which gives you up to 20% more scoops of ice cream per gallon.&quot;</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you've ever worked at an ice cream shop that uses this kind of scoop you know that the mortal sin is putting one of them through the steam cleaner.</p>
<p>Pretty sure I remember someone getting fired after ruining half our scoops in one run.</p>
<p>Years later I still have one that I bought for myself and I'm always plucking it out of the dishwasher and admonishing my roommates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water is just used as a very quick non-toxic, cheap medium to transfer the energy/heat in the room back into the scooper.  It's essentially a reset button, also used to clean off between different customers who might not enjoy mixed flavors.</p>
<p>Now, if you poured small amounts of the water into the ice cream instead, small bits of that water would freeze and worst of all you ruin the ice cream!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemistry typically concerns itself with reactions where the atoms which make molecules recombine themselves into different molecules. Thermodynamics in general doesn't need this to occur: all the different states of water, for example, involve exactly the same type of molecule but behaving differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: physical changes like melting and freezing are a huge part of doing chemistry, so while its technically not a chemical change it is still very much something chemists would study or be familiar with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a physical change versus a chemical change. A chemical change is one that is a modification to the actual chemical makeup of a substance. Think burning wood leaving behind mostly carbon ash. A physical change is going to, typically, be a change in state or something about the physical characteristics of a substance. Think freezing water, or splitting up a cup of water into two cups.</p>
<p>The line can appear a bit fuzzy sometimes. Chemical changes can cause physical changes (burning wood), but the ultimate cause was still chemical. Physical changes are sometimes described as being generally reversible but that also isn't true always.</p></div>		</li>
