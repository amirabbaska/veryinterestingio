			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't the intoxication difference between when you start and finish drinking with the same BAC be because your body is adapting to the alcohol, or because of some sort of change in your brain? Maybe it's not psychological.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. For similar reasons a steep rise in BAC following rapid drinking on an empty stomach is more associated with memory blackouts even if the slower drinking group reached higher levels.</p>
<p>I.e. reaching 0.3 in one hour impairs you more than reaching 0.4 over 6 hours.</p>
<p>Also the reason for some of the 'acute withdrawal' symptoms of hangover in non-dependent individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much in biology or the human as a whole is 100% because of x. So yes, there are probably other factors at play in addition to psychological. There probably is some sort of receptor regulation occurring, but as I said originally, alcohol is such a dirty drug that it's very difficult to know what and where everything happens. There's also the issue of metabolites, which I didn't research, but it would seem to me that some of them are certainly psychoactive, but do they reach the brain in sufficient concentration? I dunno. </p></div>		</li>
