			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh ok, that makes sense. However, we've been agrarian cultures for quite a long time now and many human cultures have lived in terribly cold parts of the world. </p>
<p>Have we simply not been alive long enough to evolve hair on our bodies in those types of situations? Or is it still just more convenient to not have it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We haven't been agrarian or living in cold places for a very long time when looked at from an evolutionary perspective. Additionally, we've also adapted to these scenarios on our own. I don't see how having long hair helps farmers at all, and for the cold, clothes do a better job anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else has said, we don't really benefit from mutations any more.  When someone with a disadvantaged mutation (downs syndrome) and someone who say has slightly better muscles and can run faster have the same chance of reproducing, evolution will no longer work.</p>
<p>Basically, because we are so advanced as a species, evolution is done unless some x-men shit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was recently listening to Joe Rogans podcast and he was talking about this.</p>
<p><em>Persistence Hunting</em> is a pretty crazy form of hunting that tribal people used(and still use) to catch animals like Antelopes for example. Antelope are very good at running very fast for short bursts, but because Antelope and other animals can't sweat, they overheat and have to take a break. But if you have a human with a spear chasing you, break time is a no no... so it just keeps running. Eventually the animal overheats and drops to the ground where it's later found(tracked) and  killed.</p>
<p>It's super crazy because these hunters will run for DAYS for a meal...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Horses sweat much more than other animals. Most mammals can sweat to some extent, but only humans and equines use it as a method of cooling off. It's not efficient at all and uses a ton of water, so most things cool off in other ways or avoid getting that hot in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC trained people can also run horses to death by exhaustion. Harder than any normal prey, and it takes extreme ultramarathon distances, but still possible and that's even despite horses as species  artificially created by us to excel at running. You wouldn't recognize a pre-domesticated horse ancestor, they were much worse at that - and I'm not speaking about thoroughbreds, just normal domestic or &quot;wild&quot; horses i.e. descendents of man-made horses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are very good hunters. There's a theory that humans are responsible for the extinction of the megafauna after the last ice age. Whenever humans expanded into a new habitat, large animals in that area died out. Save for Africa, this is quite obvious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Standing and walking on hind legs adds to that, conserving energy in terms of distance covered. Also heard claims that a degree of hairlessness might have to do with high risk high reward fitness indicators (warts, blemishes, rashes, infections, etc. Show easier).. Kinda like peacock feathers though not as dramatic. Healthy skin = good genes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Generally works well for me, too.</p>
<p>But this can also be interpreted as projecting a human preference onto a non-human specie; i.e. lot's of wild cats and dogs are healthy and their coats are 'terrible' looking.  We love looking at a glorious mane or tail.  </p>
<p>I have a cat with a flee allergy that looks like she's been receiving radiation treatments and should be on her last leg, but she consistently gets normal lab results and has a normal appetite.  Every few months, I look at her and wonder how long is she going to live, then ask my wife if we should take her to the vet's.  This has been going on for many years and several vets and she's always declared healthy, even if a bit of a grouch.</p></div>		</li>
