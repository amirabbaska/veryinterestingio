Maybe don't drink/snort the water, and use alcohol drops to dry out your ears, but don't be ruled by irrational fear.</p>
<p>I was on a swim team growing up and I get sick less than once a year on average (I got some bad ear infections when I was a kid, though). Yes, I know anecdotal evidence is BS, but until antibiotic-resistant bacteria are far more widespread, the benefits of public pools outweigh the risks, IMHO. I welcome any corrections by doctors, of course. I have zero medical training.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok chemically it is the same but percentage wise it is different.  Chlorine is a poison they literally use that stuff for chemical warfare bombs chlorine gas bombs, so the stuff we use for industrial pool is like 16% chlorine?  Don't quote me on the exact number but it's around there.  And chlorox is about 5% chlorine so when you are using it for a pool which is generally at least 15-30,000 gallons it would be way cheaper to use industrial chlorine which is about 2$ a gal at the pool supply store.  Just don't go to leslies pools they rip you off.  You would have to use about 3 times the amount of chlorox just to have the same shocking power of pool chlorine.  But you can not just throw chlorine in the pool you must have conditioner too a level of 30-50 ppm to stabilize the chlorine or else it will be gone the next day.  There is no feeling quite like throwing crates of chlorine into a pool and the next day you check the levels and they are 0 chlorine giant waste of money if there is no conditioner in the water the chlorine doesnt hold it just disintegrates away really fast.  There is a conditioner checking device and it is easy to check.  You will also need to check the ph bc chlorine has a ph of 15 or something and you want the water to be 7.4 so you use acid to bring it down.  And the alkalinity level must be 80-120 to keep the ph stabilized so it doesn't &quot;ph jump&quot; as they call it which acts like conditioner for chlorine but for ph both stabalizers.  </p></div>		</li>
