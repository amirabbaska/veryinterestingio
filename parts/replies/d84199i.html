			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's basically just low frequency light. All it will do is warm things up. In the right circumstance you might get a little zap from a sharp piece of ungrounded metal that's getting enough microwaves. On the other hand, if you do manage to circumvent the safeties and run the microwave with the door open right to your face, there are some serious potentials for injury. First, it's like having 10x 100 watt incandescant lightbulbs pointed right at your face, so you will get burns. Second, what will happen first is you will go permenantly blind as the liquid inside your eyeballs is not cooled by bloodflow and will heat up the fastest and turn white like cooked eggs. </p>
<p>Other than the heating, microwaves don't have enough photon energy to do anything special like ultraviolet and x-rays do. The wavelength of microwaves is just too big to cause cancer. It's kind of like the difference between shooting neutrons at you and shooting baseballs at you. Both will kill you if they have enough energy, but the baseballs are too big to get inside your cells and wreck your dna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves are non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation. They are on the opposite side of the light spectrum below infrared and visible light in terms of energy. Ionizing radiation starts somewhere in the middle of the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, and includes high energy x-rays and gamma rays. It is these types of radiation that cause cancer. </p>
<p>Microwave ovens cook food by causing polar molecules like water to rotate as they are pushed around by the electric field inside the microwave. The rotation causes heat which cooks the food. If your microwave is broken the absolute worst you will have is surface level burns, because microwaves don't penetrate very well. If you stuck your hand in a microwave and turned it on you would be burnt on the outside but unharmed in the middle, like a microwaved burrito. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the only part of your body that is highly susceptible to microwave radiation is the lens of your eye and other eye parts. There's no blood vessels to dissipate the heat so they can cool.</p>
<p>I built a HERF cannon at work, microwaves hurt like a bitch but unless you stuck your head in there for a couple dozen seconds you'll be fine.  </p>
<p>Microwaves work on the principle of a standing wave to amplify the energy, much like sloshing water in a bath tub.  If the shielding is broken (or you've rigged it to run with the door open) it's more like you splashing in the ocean, where the waves will not resonate and thus be less powerful.  </p>
<p>A microwave without a door is basically a wifi jammer for routers that can't run at 5GHz.</p></div>		</li>
