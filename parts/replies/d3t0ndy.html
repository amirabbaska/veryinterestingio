			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat true, but not all the way.  We consider prescribing antibiotics around 10-14 days if you are not feeling better.  This isn't because we believe you have a viral and concomitant bacterial infection; it's because most viral infections last around 2-7 days.  if it lasts longer than that you likely have a bacterial infection in which case antibiotics will actually benefit you. </p>
<p>In most cases, healthy individuals will fight off these bacterial infections even without antibiotics.</p>
<p>In children especially, antibiotics are prescribed in suspected cases of strep throat because it greatly diminishes the chances of those children developing rheumatic fever, which can have long term consequences, typically ones involving the heart, as you grow in to adulthood.  This is why most children/young adults are given a rapid strep test in the office when presenting with upper respiratory infection symptoms.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One very common case, happened to my daughter. The phrase &quot;childhood disease you get then have lifetime immunity&quot; doesn't just apply to the well-known serious diseases; there's a host of &quot;bush-league&quot; 24-hour viruses which cause short term fever and presumably body aches, run their course, usually in infants, a nd that's it.
So, Friday, the pediatrician said she'd be fine in a day, a nd she was. And of course we were back at the pediatrician's on Monday for thrush.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why isn't the immune system in constant overdrive, whether sick or not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of feeling sick isn't the infection itself, it's the response. Fever and inflammation are classic responses to infection. </p>
<p>If your immune system went overdrive all the time, you'd potentially always have a fever and never have an appetite.</p>
<p>Another issue is that the idea of allergies and hypersensitivies are your immune system working too hard, misidentifying things, running when it shouldn't be.</p>
<p>So your immune system always running overdrive would consume your resources, make you lethargic, feverish, have no appetite, experience inflammation and potentially adverse immune effects like rash or anaphylaxsis, etc.</p>
<p>Just spitballing here but the immune system is no joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system has two kinds of responses it can mount: one that happens immediately and is non-specific, and the other that takes a little time to mount but is very specific. The immediate response if left unchecked can be very destructive, both to the pathogen and to your own body tissues. The adaptive response is what leads to anti-bodies that can recognize the pathogen the next time it comes around. If/when that happens, your immune system will get rid of the infection before you notice any physical symptoms. It's not a matter of revving up the immune system all the time as much as it is a matter of training the immune system to be make efficient moving forward. This is the logic behind vaccines. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, this comment  is a gross oversimplification of a very complicated but fascinating subject. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system is basically performing constant weapons testing.  Your spleen, patches of small intestine, thymus and lymph nodes are basically weapons testing sites where white blood cells are prepared.</p>
<p>In the same way that some patches of Arizona desert are ruined from nuclear testing, your own body can't constantly pump out the full immune response without collateral.</p></div>		</li>
