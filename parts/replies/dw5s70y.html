Can't shoot for shit if your bodies having a heat stroke. Now that I'm in college, I can see about getting momentum for this for a study :) . The Navy won't do what makes sense unless it makes them look good to researchers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curved versus straight sabers was a long running debate is Europe and later the US as well.  Different pattern of swords were tried with varying degrees of curvature including straight.  The debate ended on straight sabers in the US and the UK.  Not because those were the best but because calvery sabers stopped being a thing.
At the battle of Waterloo it was noted that the French using curved sabers and slashing attacks created horrible wounds but the victim was more likely to survive the an attack from the British calvery using there straight sabers which caused fewer wounds and less nasty wounds but the stab was more likely fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My reading was that the staright sword created a smaller and cleaner entry wound, while the curved sword created a larger, messier entry but didn't go as deep.</p>
<p>So sort of aesthetic, but also how easily the wound could be bandaged up and treated. Which does factor in to which is easier to survive as well as how disfiguring it is, but either is only a concern if the attack wasn't immediately fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important consideration is that all non-metal armors, including fabrics as well as cured hides, sustain much more damage from a curved sword slash than a straight. </p>
<p>Part of that is because of the difference in weight balance, but a large part is also due to the much larger cutting surface that comes into contact as a result of the curvature of the edge itself. </p>
<p>The edge hits at a more oblique angle, reducing blunt trauma due to sin functions of force transfer, but at the same time the sharpened edge becomes a more effective cutting weapon because of this and the curvature of the blade is similar to the arc of the swing, so you end up coming in contact with a much longer segment of the sharpened blade edge vs. a swing from a straight sword. </p>
<p>Anything soft enough to be cut by a metal blade will always be less effective protection from a curved blade vs a straight sword of similar weights, weight balance, sharpness, and length.</p></div>		</li>
