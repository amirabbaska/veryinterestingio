<p>A lot of dialects carry that stigma. I talked about this in another comment, but I was pretty amazed to see the difference in how dialect is treated differently in Switzerland and Germany. In Germany, if you speak Standard German you're educated and accomplished, and if you speak dialect you're a backwoods hillbilly (exaggerated and varies by location, but that's more or less how its seen). National TV features very little spoken dialect, and if it does, it's mostly sanitized so that everyone can understand it (i.e. someone from Hamburg can still understand the Bavarian farmer).</p>
<p>In Switzerland, everyone speaks dialect. Doesn't matter if you're a farmer from the Alpine village with a population of 10 or a banker from Zurich, everyone speaks their regional dialect. Now, most Swiss dialects are mutually intelligible (except for the Valais, nobody understands them), but they're still markedly different. And on Swiss TV, everyone speaks their own variant. But the most striking thing is that regardless of education level, everyone speaks in dialect. There's no &quot;uneducated&quot; stigma associated with dialect in Switzerland, which was a stark contrast to the German attitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking about stigma, I think that some UK accents have stigma to others within the UK. (Warning: I'm getting on my <a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hobby-horse.html" target="_blank">hobby horse</a>...)</p>
<p>For example, National TV news tends to be over-represented by people who speak in RP (Received Pronunciation, a sort of standardised form of the middle class south eastern accent). RP was originally chosen by the BBC as their standard accent, as they believed it sounded sober and authoritative - and more 'educated'.</p>
<p>There's a kind of unspoken hierarchy of accents that are deemed acceptable for 'responsible' TV and radio jobs like news readers, or for national politicians. RP is the most common, followed by other accents from the home counties, and middle class Edinburgh accents are also quite common in national news, presumably for similar reasons.</p>
<p>There have been some interesting surveys ( <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/12/09/accent-map2/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/04/6" target="_blank">2</a> ) about the British public's opinions of various well-known regional accents, in general terms, and people with south eastern accents (or Yorkshire accents only more recently) are percieved as more intelligent, and people with eastern Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Republic) accents were percieved as more trustworthy. And people with Birmingham, Liverpool or Manchester accents are generally percieved badly on every measure. Interestingly, people who speak in RP are likely to be percieved as more intelligent, but less trustworthy.</p>
<p>There are more people who speak in regional accents coming through, especially on regional news, and gradually on national news. However, no dialect or slang words are used.</p>
<p>There are also more politicians being elected who have the accent of the area they represent, but it's still not unusual to see situations like my home town where a London-born, privately educated person, who speaks in RP, represents a constituency with mostly working class people, who speak in their own local accent which is very different.</p>
<p>Some people in the UK argue in favour of teaching kids to speak 'proper' English, or RP, in order to ensure that we're mutually intelligible to each other across the different regions. But I'm not sure that there <em>is</em> an issue of mutual intelligibility because a big exception seems to be comedy.</p>
<p>Lots of stand up comedians have quite strong regional accents. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD3zxeFKTTs" target="_blank">John Bishop</a> is a broad Scouser, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OISGykO6Z7U" target="_blank">Rhod Gilbert</a> has a strong south Wales accent, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evkMrvsw0rQ" target="_blank">Johnny Vegas</a> is very noticeably from Lancashire, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivv3CxnN_ec" target="_blank">Billy Connolly</a> is a strong Glaswegian, and there are lots more comedians with regional accents who've achieved the top level of success on a national level. If they were unintelligible to people outside their region, their jokes wouldn't land, and they wouldn't be popular - but that's far from the case.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that there's a hell of a lot of snobbery in the UK towards people with certain accents, and not for any rational reasons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never had the impression that the British struggle with understanding each other. Hell, I'm a dirty continental and I can understand basically all of it, the only comedian I've ever had problems understanding is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dEKQL0I4LU" target="_blank">Limmy</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, it has more to do with the fact that most Swiss dialects are mutually intelligible (along with some southern German ones) but far from all German dialects are - not surprising, since it's a vastly bigger country.</p>
<p>However, there is a slight social stigma if you can't speak standard German (never mind an accent, every speaker of German has one). Obviously there's no point in speaking standard German with somebody who speaks the same or a similar dialect but it is considered somewhat rude to talk to non-native German speakers (e.g. French-Swiss) or speakers of a different German dialect (Germans, Austrian, etc.). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Few years ago, worked with some Jamaicans who frequently spoke Patois... Knowing full well it was considered just 'broken english' I constantly asked them to slow it down to see if I could decipher any of it... NOPE...And it's basically just English words extremely abbreviated. They even tried explaining it, and teaching me. I never got it. I think its pretty impressive, they have their own spin on the english language, so different from ours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me share another story. When I was in the military I did a year with a unit that happened to have several Jamaican guys (born and raised) and one 2nd generation guy. Around the shop they would purposely talk to each other in a way to make it not obvious to others what they were saying (a little bit faster or more muffled) and although I knew what they were saying no standard English speakers did.</p>
<p>It brought home the fact in general Patois speakers are aiming to make themselves MORE understable to standard speakers. This made it more obvious how different the languages could be.</p></div>		</li>
