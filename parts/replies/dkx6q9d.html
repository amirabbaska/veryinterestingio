			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right! You can tear down the ones in your way but if you find one out of your way that you don't mind - leave it up!
That way you can control where your house spiders will decide to settle down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fantastic! Every time I walk through a single strand in my house or garage I spin around ninja style to make sure there's no spider attached to it. No more!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think that every single strand of web a spider was once there. All the places you find or don't find webs, a spider has most likely been there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I should be happy when I find a spider strand with my face because it means there won't be a spider there later. At the same time it means there is a spider nearby. </p></div>		</li>
