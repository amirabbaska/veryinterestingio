			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer, however bitter and astringent tastes are usually connected to unripe and possibly poisonous food, and not really to spoiled food (spoiled food is more sour than bitter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure thing. I need some time to find the appropriate references but, in general, the principles behind my assertions can be found in any college-level textbook of Anatomy and Physiology, or Neurophysiology. I am currently teaching these subjects with Erin Amerman's &quot;Human Anatomy and Physiology&quot;, 11th ed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance worldwide. As such, it might generate a certain dependency. Fortunately for many of us the effects of caffeine are more of an alertness thing than anything elseâ€”yet some of us will be very, very cranky without the usual dose of caffeine, especially in the morning. Caffeine withdrawal, like any other dependency-generating drug, may have physical manifestations other than mood alterations (there was a time when I would develop a mild migraine if i skipped my morning coffee). However, by the time dependency begins to be an issue the taste has been acquired and integrated into a behavioral pattern that triggers the reward pathways of the brain: their lack of stimulation upon caffeine withdrawal is what causes the withdrawal symptoms. </p></div>		</li>
