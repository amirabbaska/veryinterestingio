<p>Not much to do with 'bounciness', but do you know why objects, such as pointed rocks, seem to gain much more kinetic energy, even when just dropped, than if a flat object with the same mass hit the same surface with the same velocity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy is the same - the area over which the energy is released is not.</p>
<p>Example:  you swing a knife.</p>
<p>The knife has the same kinetic energy whether the blade, point, or flat hits, but the area over which the force is released are different. Imagine the amount of force <em>per area squared</em> required to stab/cut something with a knife. You can't put more than a certain amount of energy into the swing so you have to reduce the area over which it is released in order to overcome the object's resistance to getting stabbed good n proper.</p>
<p>When you drop two objects of the same mass they release he same amount of energy...</p>
<p>... the only difference is in the area over which the force is released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have the same kinetic energy right before hitting (KE=1/2 times mass times the velocity squared) assuming they have similar aerodynamic drag properties.</p>
<p>They will have less KE than that after rebounding.  The energy that &quot;disappears&quot; from the original pre-impact KE goes into heating of the object that is dropped, any noise made, or any denting or breaking of the object that is dropped, and any heating or denting of the surface being impacted.</p>
<p>My guess is that in the &quot;flat case&quot;, more of the energy is turned into heat (due to energy lost after the strain energy across the large surface gets turned into heat) and noise (ask yourself is the noise louder).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they genuinely hit with the same velocity, the kinetic energy is the same. Two differences already mentioned by other people are (a) aerodynamics (if they're different shapes, and start at the same height, they will lose different ammounts of energy to the air on the way down), and (b) impact area (if the impact occurs over areas of different magnitude, the smaller areas will receive proportionately more energy per unit area).</p>
<p>One thing no-one seems to have mentioned yet is that, as well as the free-falling aerodynamics, just before impact you'll have (what I <em>think</em> are termed) ground effects coming into the equation. Something wide and flat will also be attempting to compress a big cushion of air between it and the ground in a way that a more streamlined object isn't. It's compressing one as it falls in general, obviously - but the absence of the ground means that the pressure has more directions to disperse in; close to impact, it increasingly all has to go sideways, and there's clearly going to be a degree of resistance to that, up to and including the escaping air hitting the sound barrier. If you drop a big book in a flat orientation, say, there's an audible &quot;crack&quot; as the last few layers of air struggle to get out from under. That's going to transfer significant energy to the air, build up significantly more pressure in the air layer initially, and slow the object in a way that won't happen as much with something that's more streamlined.</p>
