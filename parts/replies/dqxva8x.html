			<div class="markdown"><p>If you throw in enough diamonds their carbon will be used for helium+carbon -&gt; oxygen, or even carbon+carbon -&gt; neon+helium or a few similar reactions.</p>
<p>Iron won't be used as fuel. If you make the star massive enough to end up in a supernova you do get some reactions with it, but they don't release energy, so they cannot support a stable star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course I should have known that with diamond. It is carbon. So what would happen to the iron that remains in a start that goes supernova. Would it stay iron or does the heat/pressure convert it into other elements? Is there an element that would simply 'cool' a star for lack of better word?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another aspect of your question that hasn't been explored is &quot;what happens when you throw matter in its solid state into a star?&quot;  The answer to that is that the matter will almost immediately vaporize to its gaseous state of matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rather guessed that. Just was not sure if any matter would be used as a fuel or some matter would not change form. As someone else posted, diamond is carbon, so it would be a great fuel. Iron on the other hand would mainly add to the mass and not add to the fuel. Would only make the existing fuel potentially burn hotter because of the increased pressure if I understand correct. </p></div>		</li>
