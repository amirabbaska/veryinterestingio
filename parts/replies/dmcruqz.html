			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, it's quite possible many/most people have multiple seizures in their lives. Because they can be so innocuous as smelling something like a scent that isn't there, hearing a sound that isn't there, blanking out for a few minutes, deja vu, jamais vu, and a large host of minor sensory perception changes- it's possible everyone has them to a very minor degree. People son't go to see the Dr. for scans until their quality of life is impacted.</p>
<p>We all have a threshold and lots of things can push the wave just enough over into the threshold that something minor happens. Something like a hangover can be enough. Some people may be having a full blown seizure and just walking around looking confused. Cross the threshold far enough, and that local misfire switches from local to full-brain, flooding your brain with Serotonin. This is the seizure with convulsions the OP was most likely referencing.</p>
<p>In that seizure, the flood of Serotonin is causing muscles to clench and clench and clench. The lungs can tighten and prevent breathing, which will typically lead to a bit of spitting up afterwards. Some people will urinate, but it depends on where in the brain is being impacted.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my own personal example, my brain is forgetting how to turn the convulsions off. Typically, a person having convulsions will stop in ~203 seconds. I've had 4 now that have lasted between 15-20 minutes. My wife describes them as teeth clenched, convulsions, and forcing air while turning ashen grey. </p>
<p>Final note: if you see that anyone has convulsions that last longer than 5 minutes, call 911 immediately.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can also treat them with medications called anti-epileptic drugs. There are many AED's, with different mechanisms of action and different side effects (agitation, suicidal ideations, dizziness, risk of taking when pregnant). Choosing the right AED can be tricky, because you have to know what type of seizure you're treating, and weigh the risk of side effects with the benefit of hopefully stopping the seizures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention the fact that no one knows exactly why a lot of these help with seizures - I take <a href="https://www.drugs.com/pro/keppra.html" target="_blank">Keppra</a> (&quot;The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown&quot;) and <a href="https://www.drugs.com/monograph/lamictal.html" target="_blank">Lamictal</a> (&quot;Exact mechanism of anticonvulsant action is unknown&quot;). Compounding this is the unpredictable nature of epilepsy. I was on one drug for about 5 years, it suddenly stopped working, and I bounced around a few different drugs and combinations before finding one that has worked (knock on wood). When I asked my neuro about it, he just shrugged and said that you just have to take shots in the dark and stay with whatever works for as long as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you see somebody that you suspect is actively seizing, the best thing to do is give them room, keep others back, and call 911. Do NOT try and hold them down, and do NOT stick anything in their mouth. It is a common misconception that people with seizures will swallow their tongue. This is physically impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For God's sake this. To add on, if it's safe to do so you can put something soft underneath their head, and put them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_position" target="_blank">recovery position</a> when they've finished seizing.</p></div>		</li>
