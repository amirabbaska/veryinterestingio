<p>What are the tools required to &quot;have&quot; an MLM company. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Product: plenty of stuff from china you can buy wholesale, and if your buying in bulk it is cheep and you can brand it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web site: This is a third party service, it has all the bells and whistles (it will do your comp plan calculations for you, take your orders, process you credit cards). The cost of entry is LOW and the recurring cost is based on volume (so it stays low and grows with you). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing: There are so many tools out there to get your message out, companies across the board are able to be fairly successful with little effort or investment. Again all these tools have scaling costs so the barrier to entry is LOW. </p>
</li>
<li>A 'field' The people actually selling your product. Also social media has made it super easy to reach out and find folks willing to do this, and is the genuine answer to &quot;why do I see so many&quot; because everyone is a sucker when they like a product.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in, you can start one of these up for a few million bucks (probably less) and make a go of it. The bonus is your always on top of the pile of players in your space, and the reality is the margins are so high that any sort of velocity can keep &quot;marginal&quot; operations running for years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this answer! One of the best. The technology part of this is super intersting. So many changes coming to make it easier for companies to implement this business model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for putting together a post that's not just, &quot;Because people are easily scammed.&quot;  </p>
<p>Social Media, Technology, and Manufacturing are the big reasons why MLM is taking off right now.</p>
<p>Social media I think is the biggest thing.  The generation who grew up with social media in high school and college are now just become parents, and MLMs typically target the stay-at-home / supplemental parent demographic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with what you say but I think the boundaries to entry are significantly lower, could see how a person could easily start a MLM with $5 - 20k capital depending on the product being sold... I started my business which is just a normal distribution business and no kitchy MLM theme for ~$3k ($2.2k worth of products and $800 of shipping one pallet over).  </p>
<p>I take issue with the deception associated with MLM (You need to convince everyone that they'll become rich doing it, and the truth is most of them won't) and, I think, sleep better not engaging in those kinds of business practices, but materially there's not much difference between my business and a MLM except that the people that buy my product already own pet stores and know what they're getting into, while the average person that buys into a MLM scheme tends to be far more wet behind the ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres not many that have lasted over 20 years...it seems to be lucrative to startup an mlm even if it only lasts a few years...
Point is only a small few actually have good quality  and competitively priced goods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big box retailers and local retail shops have a lot of expenses: hourly wages for the workers, property costs, air conditioning and power, etc.  </p>
<p>MLM companies have none of that.  Not only is their workforce unpaid unless they move products, many require their sales team to buy their own samples and pay for their own training.  Unlike legitimate retail companies, the more people they &quot;hire&quot;, the more direct profit they make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your right!</p>
<p>20 years ago MLM's made their sellers buy the products (they were the warehouse) and do their own taxes (they were their own accountants). </p>
<p>It would have been hard to do it any other way. You would have had a massive team of people opening envelopes, or answering calls to take orders and get them shipped out. It simply didn't make a lot of sense. </p>
<p>Tech, made it possible to run these companies without people in these roles.... Companies that never could have existed then, do today because of automation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of it is that the products are actually pretty good now in many cases and women like to be social. A big part of MLM is the social aspect of the parties.  This is different than the pushy Amway MLM idiot. My wife did Tupperware for a couple years and she was never pressured to do it and never pushed to add more &quot;layers&quot;.  She also likes to buy oils and leggings. And she likes to talk to other moms. It's not hurting anyone as long as the products are actually good and no one is being misled. </p></div>		</li>
