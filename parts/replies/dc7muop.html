Just stand up. Shake your head like a dog. Do jumping jacks. Walk around the room. Do push-ups. Just moving your blood a little will do wonders.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha this would definitely be a bad idea for anyone who is doing anything that could be potentially hazardous. Like driving a car or operating machinery. Wouldn't recommend intentionally making yourself lightheaded when tired in that case. At church yea I guess but if that's the case who cares, fall asleep. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I would think that keeping yourself awake for 30 hours is possible, but that you would be a pretty useless sack of meat while doing so and also be a huge liability to your employer while doing so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes I have, but never for work.  My point is that his wording makes it sound as though his job requires him to be awake for 30+ hours.  I do not think there is a job out there that can force you to be awake for that many hours due to work.  </p>
<p>Doctors doing their internship are made to work ungodly hours, but I just recently read in another topic here on Reddit that there is an old tradition or set of rules that still make it an accepted practice.  But even then, I do not think they are expected to function at a safe level for 30+ hours with no sleep.  It would be next to impossible.  </p>
<p>I respectfully disagree with your statement that you only function slightly worse than normal.  Perhaps you and an extreme few are capable of a regular regimen of 30+ hours workdays and only be &quot;slightly&quot; affected.  I imagine the rest of humanity would be quite affected.  </p>
<p>And even if you could, again, I do not think legally people can work those kinds of hours.  Maybe military, but thats a whole different topic.  </p>

<p>What does this mean?  Is the engineer the person driving the train?  I forget the terminology for the duties of the conductors and the engineers but it if it is the guy &quot;behind the wheel&quot; of an gigantic amount of tonnage trundling down the tracks, I don't think he is the only one in danger if he is working 30+ hour shifts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On one hand I totally agree. On the other hand, really? I think you're overestimating how long 30 hours actually is. </p>
<p>I agree that it seems criminal for a job to require somebody to stay up for 30 hours straight, but it really isn't hard. </p>
<p>In college I'd regularly pull an all nighter and then just go to sleep the next night at my regular time (for arguments sake, let's say I woke up at 8 AM on a Monday and went to bed at Midnight on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning). 30 hours would be pulling an all nighter and then going to sleep 6 hours later (this would be like waking up at 8 AM on Monday and then going to sleep at 2 PM on Tuesday).</p>
<p>And I know that my case is anecdotal, and citing that I knew several other people who did this is also anecdotal. However, a quick google search brings up several articles about the fact that college students shouldn't pull all nighters - articles that wouldn't need to be written if it didn't happen somewhat regularly (ex. <a href="https://jawbone.com/blog/university-students-sleep/" target="_blank">https://jawbone.com/blog/university-students-sleep/</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not think I am overestimating it.  Yes it can be done.  It affects some worse than others.  In my teens/20s/even 30s I could go without sleep in order to study/party/whatevs and still work 8-12 hours.  That doesn't mean it was good for me or a desirable choice.  </p>
<p>At 40 I still can do it if I have to, but damn if it isn't much much harder.</p></div>		</li>
