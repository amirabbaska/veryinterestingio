			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read an article about it, but I want to clarify, are you saying that there is different methylation and acetylation or that the actual histone configuration changes in weightlessness?</p>
<p>Because I don't for a second believe that the histone configuration changes, and there really isn't anything that dramatic about epigenetics. We could just as easily say &quot;living in the desert changes your DNA.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I don't think it re-arranged itself. The genes (three DNA bases in a row) just &quot;expressed&quot; themselves differently. I'm not 100% sure what that means or how to explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those sound pretty bad, but the effects of microgravity and radiation on the brain are what really scare me. I've read that the radiation that astronauts would receive on a Mars trip is expected to be high enough to cause serious cognitive decline. In fact, astronauts already see flashes of light that are a result of cosmic radiation hitting the eye (imagine how stressful that must feel). Microgravity is also a problem, as it changes the intracranial pressure. I think most people don't appreciate the courage it takes to be an astronaut. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it just the constant exposure of weightlessness that is the reason for these things or would swimming every day for long periods of time have a similar effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to those pesky millions of years of evolution, every one of your systems is designed with gravity in mind.</p>
<p>Bones for example are not unchanging. Your bones constantly self reinforce in response to the stress of everyday life. Even under normal gravity, someone unable to leave a wheelchair will have a lower bone density than someone who walks. Weightlessness takes this to the extreme, with no stress whatsoever. This results in bone density depletion over time in astronauts to the point of requiring ongoing rehab exercise after returning to earth. Hence the hours of exercise astronauts do daily to try and minimize bone loss. </p>
<p>Same with your muscles, your circulatory system designed to pump blood against the flow of gravity, your sense of balance from your inner ears, even your eyes; basically everything in your body is designed to accommodate gravity. Removing that constant force your body is designed around just isn't something that it copes well with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this mean if a human landed on a higher gravity planet over time his bones would thicken the to withstand the stress? Or would the high gravity cause too many issues with the circulatory system before the body could adapt. I would guess that only a small increase in gravity would allow the body to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto what others said with a bit of a tangent, the strength of your skeletal structure is in part effected by the physical stresses applied to it and the resulting defects and microfractures healing stronger. Someone heavier or involved in more impactful physical activities have stronger bones. Things like your spine and legs get most of there phsycal impacts due to gravity. They could become big potential problems both for the youth and growing up in low-G and also for long-term space travel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to clarify from this answer, because I'm not sure that this is clear: this &quot;7% difference&quot; does <em>not</em> mean that there was a change in the actual DNA of each twin. Rather, it means that there gene expression was altered. This is a fundamental and important difference; here's why. Before Darwin, the theory was that organisms evolved during their lifetime. Observations like those of these two twins seems to support this. But when the twin who was in space reproduces, he is handing down just his DNA and not his adaptions to space. He always had the ability to experience these adaptions, as likely we all do. Nothing in his DNA changed (some mutations may have accumulated while he was in space, but definitely not enough to chance 7% of his genome). I think some of the articles in more mainstream media sources make it sound like this was the case, but it wasn't.</p>
<p>If you're interested, this range of gene expressions we can show is a phenomenon known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity" target="_blank">phenotypic plasticity</a>.</p></div>		</li>
