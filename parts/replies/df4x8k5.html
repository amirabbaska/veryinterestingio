			<div class="markdown"><p>Your lungs are filled with alveoli, they are tiny sacs that fill with air allowing your blood to pick up oxygen and drop off carbon dioxide (to simplify it).  With normal shallow breathing, not all of them fully inflate, and over the course of multiple breaths, some of them will get kind of stuck in a deflated state.  The deep breath you're talking about is your body's autonomous response to fully rein flare them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a serious question please, I noticed that some years ago my lung capacity started to decrease and even while taking full breaths I could never get them as full as before, or at least it didn't feel like it, this happened with yawns too and it's been bothering me for years, I learned to live with it because it didn't seem very bad, I had forgotten what it feels to have a good deep breath, I just remember it being a pleasant feeling, I don't smoke and I have never smoked and I'm just 21, does anyone have any idea what it could be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was your age my caffeine intake was way too high (thanks to Starbucks Chai tea and too much coffee in general). This caused me to have shortness of breath, particularly noticeable when laying down. </p>
<p>See a doc for sure, but it could be something that simple (I found out it was caffeine by seeing a doc in fact!)... Take care!</p></div>		</li>
