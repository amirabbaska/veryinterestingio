			<div class="markdown"><p>There are still goons in the lower tiers, echl, ahl etc... Toledo walleye just had a brawl, including goalies against, I think, the kansas city team. The KC goon continuously cross checks the walleye player while he's on the ground. The intent is to injure. There's plenty of sports that are physical but don't resort to a full on fight like this. I understand it's part of the draw for the crowd and television. The crowd is very excited, well it makes me think, like, this was what Roman arenas were like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait...<em>agree</em> to fight? Like this is decided before the play? I figured the fights were usually not premeditated and occurred when someone got checked a little too often or some such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCMQnFDxWcM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m05s" target="_blank">Here is a video where 2 NHL players fight and one of them has a microphone on them</a>. </p>
<p>The player in teal (San Jose Sharks) is responding to the player in white (Nashville Predators) who is being a little dirty to another player in teal who is that teams primary scorer. So a fight breaks out, and you can hear the Sharks player ask if the other guy wants to continue fighting. At some point the Refs break up the fight, while saying &quot;good job&quot; to the fighting players, that is actually part of their training to tell the fighting players they did a good job, and then removing them both to the penalty box. </p>
<p>If you watch the rest of the video you will see that the two players who are in the penalty box start talking about the fight with each other, both commenting that the fight got them very tired and they have to start doing cardio so they could fight for longer, and eventually they wish each other well for the rest of the season as they both leave the penalty box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little from column A, a little from column B. Here's a great example of an agreed upon fight:
<a href="https://youtu.be/iIlLbJHKw8M" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/iIlLbJHKw8M</a>
That's at the very beginning of the game. Both teams set their lineups specifically for a fight at the drop of the puck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, this reminds me of the first hockey game I went to.  My mom didn’t want my dad to take us kids to a hockey game because of all the violence, but he talked her into it saying it’s not that bad, they don’t really fight much anymore and BAM full team brawl at first puck drop.</p></div>		</li>
