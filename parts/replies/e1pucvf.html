			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I never considered that the rides could be that smart. That makes a lot of sense. How often do the sleds get diverted? I feel like there are almost always people in that maintenance area, is it always because of weight? I also can’t think of another ride at Disney that has that maintenance bay, is Space Mountain unique in some way that requires it? Not even the Incredicoaster has that (but I guess there are two tracks so one will continue to go regardless?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space Mountain in particular has to be this way, due to the small station in relation to the number of trains on the tracks.  Only six trains fit in the station.  If all six are still in station when the seventh enters the brake zone, the ride will shut down, and all of the brakes will activate, stopping all of the active trains in their various hold zones.  This is why the 15-second dispatch time is so critical for this ride in particular.</p>
<p>Space Mountain also has the second track area in the station to allow for a car to be loaded/unloaded more slowly.  That is almost constantly in use, but I've never seen a train actually make the left turn into the maintenance area while loaded -- though it is the way to add/remove trains from the ride.</p>
<p>Space Mountain fits a <em>lot</em> more trains on the tracks at a time than your typical coaster.</p>
<p>edit: This is what happens if they have to stop the ride because they filled up the station: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MEo8XJiPhg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MEo8XJiPhg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious how you know all this? I'm always really interested in things like this. Everytime I ride a rollercoaster I always spend a lot of time wondering about all the controls that keep me from dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So both of these things have happened to me on this ride. We got diverted to the left and they have to pull up a ladder to get everyone off of the car. You then go through the server room and back into the station. </p>
<p>Another time I was on the ride when the car pulled forward to the second stop like you said, when someone decided they wanted out NOW. Even though warnings started blaring, they sent the car anyway hoping they could fix the timing. It didn’t happen. We had to be manually released which they did from the bottom down. So we got to slowly float down space mountain with the lights on. There was some fancy maneuvering that had to be done to get all the cars in the station, but We got to ride again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About your edit....I've ridden Space Mountain multiple times over the years (Disney World) and I am 100% sure we have never been in cars like this...they've all been single seat sleds, 3 to a car, 2 cars to a train....where is this one at? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know next to nothing about the engineering behind Incredicoaster, other than riding it hundreds of times, but I think you are correct as far as the two sides. I’ve also been on the coaster when one of the brake stations engaged for half a second just to slow our sled, in what I’m guessing was an effort to adjust timing. That has never happened to me on space. This could be a difference. Also, Incredicoaster only has two sleds at a time iirc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nearly every ride has a maintanence bay.  Most of them are just hidden well.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alec Watson from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0tKL1T7wFoYcxCe0xjN6Q" target="_blank">Technology Connection</a> actually explained how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz2BXUcYgKc" target="_blank">this whole system worked</a> a few months back. The video talks about all the emergency stops and how ensuring a 15 second dispatch is essential.</p>
<p>The last point you mention was particularly interesting. Then again the only Disneyland I've been to is in Hong Kong, so I'm no Disneyland expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhh, the video is cool in that he does explain some of the safety features of a roller coaster, but he lost me a bit as his information is purely from observation and somewhat incorrect. As someone who has worked for and operated both Disney attractions and a regional theme park coasters, his information implies that the use of mid course brakes to operate more than one train on the course at a time is unique at Disney is incorrect. In fact, he presented a picture of American eagle at six flags great America as an example of a roller coaster that can only operate one train on the course at a time. I used to work this attraction. In fact, the Lift hill is a block zone - so once the train ahead enters the helix approxanentaly half way through the ride you can dispatch the train in the station safely as the train leaving the station can be stopped automatically on the lift hill. Most often you will see that roller coasters at regional theme parks are dispatched only once the train on the course enters the final brake run not because of a safety limitation, but because non Disney theme parks suffer from a lack of efficiency. Disney imagineers and operations put a lot of thought into how to operate a ride efficiently that lacks in other parks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is so freaky - I've been watching him for a while and just last night I was thinking how I've never seen a reference on here.</p>
<p>For anyone reading - his stuff isn't always 100% accurate, but he's very easy watching and has some really cool subjects with more than enough information to get your teeth into. Well recommended.</p></div>		</li>
