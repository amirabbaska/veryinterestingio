<p>High pressure areas on land are caused by the sun heating it up, so it requires more volume, pressure is increased while it's expanding to more volume. So you have reversed the cause and effect in your reasoning. The high pressure is caused by the heat, not the heat caused by the high pressure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>High surface air pressure is not directly caused by heating. In fact, high pressure can often occur in very cold conditions, e.g. I remember a strong 1043 millibar surface high that occurred in the Midwest last year when the air temperature was nearly -20 deg Fahrenheit.  This is a common misconception I often heard from my own students when I was teaching undergraduate meteorology. The most obvious examples are the poles. They are the coldest areas on Earth and are virtually experiencing permanent high pressure (they are called the polar highs).</p>
<p>Instead, high air pressure and low pressure is largely governed by upper atmospheric movements and whether airflow is slowing down or speeding up, such as the airflow in the jet stream. </p>
<p>When air slows down in the jet stream, the air begins to <em>converge</em> together, much like car traffic slowing down and converging as they approach a tight curve. However, unlike cars, the air can take an alternative route -- downwards. So now all of the sudden, you have a large mass of air gradually pressing downwards toward the surface of the earth, that is the atmosphere is actually pushing down on us harder because of convergence aloft. This effect will lead to a measurable increase in the surface pressure, although often subtle, but very important as pressure changes often dictate weather at the surface. What kind of weather? Well, sinking air is not conducive to cloud formation, so often sunny skies, so perhaps this is why students often associate high pressure with warmth -- they are more likely to absorb solar radiation that day!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the airflow aloft accelerates to faster speeds, like car traffic exiting a tight curve, then the air molecules in the upper airflow begin to <em>diverge</em> away from each other i.e., begin to give each other more space. This additional space between air molecules then allows air molecules from below, such as near the surface of the earth, to rise and fill that space. So the atmosphere over some part of the surface of the Earth is now pressing less hard on the surface because the air molecules are rising away from the Earth due to upper air <em>divergence</em>. This also produces a measurable effect on the pressure -- lower pressure! What kind of weather does low pressure usually create? Well -- quite a variety. Low pressure systems in the mid-latitudes will often pull warm air to an area first (e.g., there will be a warm front), and then followed up by the introduction of cold air (a cold front will swing through and often generate rain and/or T-storms).</p>
<p>Now the factors controlling the upper air speeding up and slowing down to cause divergence and convergence are governed by the density and air temperature differences between very large air masses over the Earth, along with other factors. The system of equations to describe upper air motion is relatively large, and I invite anybody with knowledge of vector calculus and partial differential equations to open up an air dynamics textbook -- it's quite fascinating!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought something seemed funny in that.</p>
<p>The higher temperatures in mid-latitudinal areas are then typically caused at the surface when the heavy column of cold air above it doesn't allow convection and you essentially get a heat bubble in the area where we live. Is that somewhat correct?</p>
<p>This also makes sense to me for when high pressure &quot;breaks&quot; and causes all of the hot humid air to convect upwards and quickly form stratus clouds while also leading to immediately cooler surface temperatures.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, I've never formally studied meteorology, but it makes sense to me logically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sort of.</p>
<p>In high pressure systems, you often get a capping temperature inversion (where temperature will briefly rise with altitude -- normally it's the opposite) which will limit convection.</p>
<p>But the heat one notices more with warm, high pressure air is likely just a human condition. Does one really notice the air temperature when it's slightly cooler than average (in a high pressure system within a colder air mass) or do they notice more often it when it is warmer than average (in a high pressure system within a warm airmass)? They probably more likely to notice the latter, especially when the high pressure &quot;breaks&quot; and a lower pressure system moves in and introduces the temperature swings normally associated with frontal boundaries.</p>
<p>The temperature has less to due to with pressure and more with what kind of air mass one is residing in. In the centers of both cool and warm air masses sits high pressure air, irregardless of the temperature. The temperature for the week is dictated by what large air mass has moved in. You could be sitting in a warm air mass for a few days with high air pressure, then a low pressure system briefly moves in and pulls a cooler air mass into the region, and you then you have a few days of cooler weather and high air pressure. And so on and so on.</p>
<p>This is why spring and autumn are a bit funky weather wise in the U.S. Due to the location of the jet stream during these seasons, you often have a low pressure system swinging through our latitudes every few days, creating days where it can be very warm and then it suddenly shifts to be very cool. Summer and winters have less variability. Due to the location of the jet stream during these seasons, we are more often sitting in high pressure and there are fewer changes in the weather.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What he is doing is messing up basic thermodynamics, thermodynamic work, and confusing a compressible gas and an incompressible liquid.</p>
<p>With an ideal gas in a constant volume, increasing the pressure does increase the temperature.  That because you are putting work into the system.  In a static, incompressible liquid which is not in a confined volume, no work is being done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: more than one person has pointed out that water cannot boil at those pressures. It becomes a supercritical fluid which is neither a true liquid or gas state.</p>
<p>I'll leave part of my original answer below, but the closest thing to a correct answer about &quot;boiling&quot; would be at depths where pressure is roughly 200 Bar, the boiling point is 647K or 704F. This would be roughly 1/5 the depth of the Mariana Trench, and below that point you can't boil water.  </p>
<p>The bottom of the Mariana Trench is at a pressure of 1,086 Bars:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench</a></p>
<p>I searched for a state diagram of water and this is the first one I could find with the general type of data I needed:
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg</a></p>
<p><del>But at the temps shown on this diagram, vapor only occurs at pressures of around 200 bars.</del></p>
<p>~~Very roughly eyeballing the curve of the liquid/vapor line I'd say it hits 1k Bars about 300 C past the end of the graph. ~~</p>
<p><del>That's around 675 C, 948 K, or 1247 F.</del></p>
<p>The &quot;critical point&quot; on this diagram shows boiling is not possible at those pressures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Above 220 bar the water becomes a supercritical fluid, which isn't really a liquid of a gas. So water can't exactly boil under those conditions. You certainly can't just extrapolate from the shape of the graph, if you look closely the line you're extending actually stops just before the edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might be misreading the graph. 1k bars is above the triple point, you can see it on the right. You can't boil water at 1k bars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating. In the deep ocean, you can have seawater remaining liquid (due to the high pressure) at temperatures over 400°C (750°F). Below about 3000m (~9800ft) deep, water doesn't really &quot;boil&quot; anymore. The pressure is just too much, no matter how hot it gets. It becomes a supercritical fluid, which has some properties like a liquid and some properties like a gas.</p>
