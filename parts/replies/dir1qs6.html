			<div class="markdown"><p>This was suprisingly fact lite (mainly focusing on racism - thats bad) rather than a scientific perspective. You also made some crcuial mistakes.</p>
<p>Well lets get started. Firstly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In formal terms, phenotype (outward appearance) was supposed to be a good predictor of genotype (deeper biological similarities).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incredibly wrong. Genotype is what genes you have. Phenotype is how those genes are expressed and interact with your enviroment. So Sickle cell anaemia is the example I will give. The possible genotypes for sickle cell anaemia are NN (normal+normal for the gene on each chromosome), Ns (One normal and one recessive sickle cell gene) and ss (two recessive sickle cell genes). </p>
<p>The phenotypes of this are NN = Normal average human blood cells. Ns = Mostly normal average human blood cells, but with a small amount of warped sickle cells (was generally considered to be symptom free with no downside, but was in fact found to offer a slight resistance to malaria, giving rise to an evolutionary pressure selecting for sickle cell in malarial countries). ss = Full blown Sickle cell anaemia, where the blood cells are warped and function is massively impaired. </p>
<p>Perhaps a slightly better but similar example is ginger hair. Carrying a single recessive gene for ginger hair doesn't make you ginger. It does literally nothing. Genotype is a carrier of the ginger gene, but the phenotype is no expression and typical humans hair colours. </p>
<p>The distinction is more useful when multiple genes all factor into one factor. Lets take [Sherpas] (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-40006803" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-40006803</a>) as a good example; as you can read a genetic mutation gives them different haemaglobin levels for more efficient oxygen use at high altitude. Crucially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's not down to one gene, of course. We see better blood flow through the capillaries; and they appear to have a richer capillary network as well so that the oxygen can be delivered better to the tissues. But this gene would also have given them some advantage.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that the pheotype of Sherpas having much better performance in high altitude/low oxygen scenarios is a result of their genotype, but unlike the above not a single gene site. If you wanted to &quot;write down&quot; the genotype for their advantage, it would involve multiple genes in very different places, and would be very different to the above simple 2 letter system. I hope that makes the distinction fairly clear; The pheotype is easily studied and described in a sentance, the genotype is immensely complicated (and in fact unknown as of yet). </p>
<p>Now bringing race back into this. I think that you have completely misunderstood the context of a lot of what you have read. [Here is a nature article] (<a href="https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html</a>) (one of the most well respected scientific journals in the field).</p>
<p>Interesting points. Now lets get specific, you said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you arrange humans into groups based on how they are actually related, those groups won't correspond even approximately to common notions of &quot;race.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the nature article says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common approach in studying individual genetic variation is to compute the genetic similarity between all possible pairs of individuals in a sample and then to search for clusters of individuals who are most similar to one another. At least two such studies have concluded that the observed clustering patterns do not correspond well to the subjects' geographic origins or 'ethnic labels'30, 31. These studies, however, were based on only several dozen or fewer loci, and a small sample of unselected loci does not typically provide sufficient power to detect population structure when individuals are analyzed6, 32.</p>
<p>In contrast, studies based on more loci32, 33, 34 show that individuals tend to cluster according to their ancestry or geographic origin. Figure 2 shows a tree in which genetic similarity, based on 190 loci, is portrayed among individual members of most of the populations illustrated in Figure 1. The longest branches in this tree separate individuals within the same continental populations, as expected from the FST results discussed above (i.e., most variation occurs within populations). The longest internal branch separates African from non-African individuals, again in agreement with previous results at the population level. The next cluster consists entirely of Europeans, and a final cluster contains all of the East Asian subjects and one European. The robustness and validity of these findings are supported by other studies, which, despite using different loci and different population samples, obtained similar patterns34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to put it simply, the studies you seem to be referencing were bad studies. They only looked at a handful of genes and then tried to group people based only on those handful. It is like trying to group people based on eye colour or finger length alone, and they found no racial trends. When you actually look at more gene sites you do see trends based on geographical location, and here is the kicker; this is entirely what we would expect. </p>
<p>Evolution/natural selection/gene mutation are local processes. This is a fundamental property of Darwins evolution. The reason Darwin theoried Evolution was looking at different effectively isolated islands and the wildlif that grew there. If a mutation happens to a monkey on Island A and there is no way for it to reach Island B, then that mutation stays on Island A. Over time these mutations lead to the evolution process and the two evolve seperately. Because conditions on the islands are slightly different, and even just due to the random nature of mutation, two populations can evolve down very different paths. Think of the difference between an ostrich and a sparrow. </p>
<p>Humans started it africa, and then went our seperate ways. In evolutionary terms this was relatively recent, but there have most certainly been mutations and evolutions down different paths. There are distinct biological differences that although generally minor can have a profound difference on an individual scale. </p>
<p>Here is where my specialisation comes into this: I worked in pharmacy in the UK. One of the things you learn about is that certain races are recommended different drugs to others. [Here.] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075515/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075515/</a>) Heavy stuff, but the important part is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Observational studies and clinical trials have shown that commonly used antihypertensive agents exert variable BP- lowering response in ethnic populations. For example, compared to white Caucasians, the black African origin patients exhibit significantly poor BP lowering response to beta-blocker (B drug), ACE inhibitors or ARB’s (A drug), and much better response to CCB (C drug) and diuretics (D drug) when used as monotherapy [9–11]. These findings have been recognised by the BHS-NICE guidelines which recommends choice of first-line agents based on race and age of the patients.</p>
<p>These new studies have unequivocally shown that there are clinically important differences in BP-lowering response to both first- and second-line antihypertensive agents among hypertensive patients from different ethnic groups. These data illustrates the limitations in interpreting the results of data arising mainly from Caucasian populations to other ethnic groups, such as south-Asians and middle-Eastern origin patients. It also highlights urgent need of conducting clinical trials on patients from other ethnic groups. Pending these results, it is fair to suggest that current data on the use of antihypertensive agents suggest that one size do not fits all, and local (or regional) groups should modify these international guidelines for native consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a redditor. I know we all like to get up in arms about racism. The issue is how you define racism. If I have two drugs that both treat the same thing and one works well on a certain race, and the other doesn't. I have to pick the drug that gives the best outcome for the patient. I am not discriminating, and I am not judging. The choice is scientifically proven and has been in the guidelines since before I came into the field. If one drug is 50% more effective on a certain race, and another is 50% less effective, giving them a less effective drug is negligence on my part. </p>
<p>The PC ideal where race/gender/whatever doesn't exist and we are all just people is a <strong>good ideal</strong>, but there are certain biological realities that have to be taken into consideration first. </p>
<p>I honestly planned to awnser some of your more specific examples (because again you are clearly writing these things having totally misinterpretted the science), however this is already huge and I have stuff to do:/. Sorry and good day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’ve certainly quoted big chunks of scientific papers, but
I’m afraid that they don’t mean what you think they do.</p>
<p>The paper in nature explores the question “What are the
relationships between geographical location, ancestry, and genetic variation”
It broadly finds two things</p>
<p>1.      
You are more likely to be
genetically similar to people that live close to you than people that live a
long way away</p>
<p>2.      
Genetic variation is highly
‘continuous’ across human populations. That means that they found that there
are not big changes in genetics between people who live in one place, and the
people that live next to them.</p>
<p>I’m going for a visual analogy now. It’s
going to be ridiculous, but it’s late, and it’s reddit, so, you know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine a table covered with 100 bowls of
soup. Each bowl contains a different type of soup. They are all gloppy, thick
soups. I know that’s gross, but it’s important later. If you take a spoonful of
soup from any one bowl, it tastes like, for the sake of argument, cream of
tomato. It doesn’t matter whether you take a spoon from the middle of the bowl,
or from the edge of the bowl. Cream of tomato. Same with every other bowl. The
next one is minestrone all over. That is ‘<strong>non-continuous variation’</strong>.
Even if I use the same spoon all the time, and get a little of another soup
mixed in, every bowl is still going to basically taste like its own soup.</p>
<p>Now imagine the same table, but instead of 100
bowls of soup, it contains the same 100 thick, soups. Each one has been ladled
out onto the location where its bowl was in the first scenario. The soup is
thick, so they don’t totally run together, but they do blend with their
neighbors.  </p>
<p><em>Yes, I do realize that there is now a lot of
soup running off the sides of the table. That’s because it’s a crappy analogy.
Pay no attention to the dripping soup. Mind your shoes.</em></p>
<p>If I take a spoonful from different spots
on the table, it’s going to taste different. At opposite corners I can get  cream of mushroom and gazpacho. Very different
soups. But there are no borders where it changes from one soup to another. The
change is gradual across the entire table. There is a spot where I can get
cream of tomato, and nearby there is a spot where I can minestrone, but in
between there is ‘cream of toministrone’. This is ‘<strong>continuous variation’</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now your paper in Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html#f2" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html#f2" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n11s/full/ng1435.html#f2</a></a>
is demonstrating that humans are like the messy table. Some genetic variations
have local ‘hotspots’ but you can’t point to a population of any size and
say  - ‘look there – on that chunk of the
planet – that’s the only place that you find such-and-such a genetic variant’.
The idea of ‘Race’ is that there are distinct populations who are either
genetically this or genetically that. The paper in Nature says ‘geographical
location can have a (weaker or stronger) correlation with certain genes, but
the variation is generally continuous.</p>
<p>So you could pick 1000 square miles in Europe, and discover
that people there have an 80% probability of having a particular version of a
gene. We’ll call it ‘Roddenberry’. </p>
<p>Next you pick 1000 square miles in Africa. What do you know!
80% probability of carrying another version of that gene. ‘Hackman’</p>
<p>Alright! We’ve just proven race!!! Europeans are ‘Roddenberry’,
Africans are ‘Hackman’! WRONG</p>
<p>If you move your 1000 square mile area of Europe 100 miles
to the west, you get 70% Roddenberry. Your Africa sample area shifts 100 miles
East, and you have 67% Hackman. Shift your sample areas again and you find that
in some places in Europe it’s 57% Gene Roddenberry, and 43% Gene Hackman, and
There is an area of Africa where They are actually more likely to be
Roddenberry than some Europeans are!!!</p>
<p>These discrete, genetically distinct populations just don’t
exist. If you want Races, you have to make them up. Nature won’t give you any
place to draw the lines. And this is not a ‘modern, cosmopolitan miscegenation,
racial suicide ‘ thing. </p>
<p><em>“All right, Clever-Clogs, if that paper in Nature says
that Race is not a natural category, how come the word is right there in the
title?! Huh? Huh? What’s the problem – mouth full of soup?”</em></p>
<p>OK let’s get real. By which I mean imaginary. </p>
<p>That paper is talking about Race as, wait for it, a <em>social
construct</em>. Yes. It acknowledges that people identify people as belonging to
one race or another – largely (though not exclusively) based on skin tone. The
paper asks whether that way of sorting humans into groups can be useful, or
matches up with anything real.</p>
<p>It says, kind of, but its dangerous. Not dangerous because
we are all delicate snowflakes and we might trigger some dainty bleeding-heart liberal.
Dangerous because we might kill someone. With the wrong medicine.</p>
<p>And this, Mr Attack_cat, is where we come to your area of specialization.
I can see that your concern here is honest, and well founded on recommended
clinical practices, so I will try to tackle this without snark, and in good
faith.</p>
<p>The paper that you cited from Nature actually talks directly
about the phenomenon discussed in the paper you cited from the International
Journal of Preventative Medicine. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, it cautions:</p>
<p><em>“Clearly, many African-Americans would respond better to ACE
inhibitors than would many European-Americans. To conclude, on the basis of
population averages, that ACE inhibitors are ineffective in African-Americans
could deny many people a powerful and appropriate drug treatment.”</em></p>
<p>The meta-study cited (which includes the data sets cited in
your paper from IJPM) points out that although there is a very significant
difference between ‘races’ in the response to the two major classes of
blood-pressure drugs, that difference is (naturally) based on population
averages. However, a statistical analysis of the available data also shows that
<em>most African-Americans and European-Americans respond the same way</em>. That’s
right. Most blacks and whites in America respond the same way to the two drugs –
and that makes ACE inhibitors the best choice for most American Humans. The
problem is, that relatively small segment of the African-American population
that respond differently are put at considerable risk by being put on the ACE
class. The recommendations suggest treating <em>all</em> African Americans with Calcium
Channel inhibitors – even though they are not quite as good for most of those
patients – because the alternative is basically useless for some African
Americans. Why? Because Race  is a fairly
shitty predictor of an individual’s genotype.</p>
<p>So why are these doctors talking about race at all!???
Simple, because of our prevailing social constructs, in the USA they have data
about patients’ race. You can use it for your data analysis, along with their
weight, height, age, etc. You can’t put in which Pokemon GO team they affiliate
with, because that’s not on the intake data. It turns out that that information
is medically useful <em>when averaged</em> because our social construct of race
correlates to a certain extent with ancestral population location, which again,
correlates <em>to a certain extent </em> with the probability of certain genetic
variations. </p>
<p>However, it is a very inaccurate tool, because race does <strong>not</strong>
correspond to any distinct genetic group. A point made explicitly and clearly
by the paper that you cite:</p>
<p><em>“ human
populations are seldom demarcated by precise genetic boundaries. Substantial
overlap can therefore occur between populations, invalidating the concept that
populations (or races) are discrete types.”</em></p>
<p>_</p>
<p> _</p>
<p>The claim that the idea Race makes for itself is that
humanity can be divided into discrete groups 
each of which is significantly different from the others because of the
genetic characteristics of each group. That is just not true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And besides, all of this soup basically tastes the same
anyway.</p>
<p>The average genetic difference between any two human beings
is 0.1%</p>
<p>And where do you find the widest range of human genetic
variation? Sub Saharan Africa. </p>
<p>Most phenotypic variation occurs within continental
populations. The prominent exception: skin color. Why? Because it adapted
rapidly to environmental conditions, because a good skin color adaptation made
you much more likely to survive in the neighborhood your family just moved
into. Strong correlation between Geographic Population and skin color actually
happens to be the <em>exception</em> when it comes to population location and
genetic similarity. It’s an outlier in genetic distribution, but its super
obvious, and it was super useful when it came to the age of colonial
imperialism. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am slightly confused what you mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple genes produce malformed red blood cells with the sickle trait.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common form of sickle cell is a single mutation on the beta-globin gene. It was a notable example because it is a single nucleotide mutation causing a disease (albeit with two copies). It is literally used as the standard example for low level/high school genetics.</p>
<p>The geneotype is &quot;do you have that mutation? Do you have that mutation on both your chromosomes in a pair?&quot;. The phenotype is what that mutation actually does in each combination.</p>
<p>But most people taught Mendelian genetics in school etc were taught genes as dominant/recessive using letters. I just applied that to the explanation for ease of understanding.</p>
<p>Re-read my comment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The possible genotypes for sickle cell anaemia are NN (normal+normal for the gene on each chromosome), Ns (One normal and one recessive sickle cell gene) and ss (two recessive sickle cell genes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the 3 possible states a person can be in in regards to sickle cell inheritance. I didn't talk about the effects of the sickle cell gene, just if the person has it or not. That is genotype.</p>
<p>Phenotype is the effect those things have on the organism. An NN person is normal with 0 sickle cells, an ss person has full blown sickle cell anaemia with all the nasty things that can cause. </p>
<p>Genotype = What genes something has.</p>
<p>Phenotype = What those genes do.</p>
<p>I thought I made that clear, but apparently not. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to play devil's advocate: what if for each example of race-based differentials of drug reactions, there are just as many example of within-race differentials of drug reactions (say native Japanese vs American Asians responding differently to a drug even though they are the same race) ?</p>
<p>Using race as a predictor for drug treatment is certainly useful in some cases(and <em>should</em> apply in practice whenever relevant) , but if the above hypothetical is true, then it's not statistically correct to claim &quot;the current interpretation of race is real&quot; through drug reaction alone.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had this happen too when I was in school. I (being a little smartass), asked why then, if there are no racial differences, there are certain traits that are more common in certain populations (alcoholism, sickle cell anemia, etc), and why some pharmaceuticals are recommended for certain racial groups over others. After all, both of those are scientific, measurable proofs that there are quantifiable, physical differences between different racial groups, right?</p>
<p>No. I was told it was all a psychological side-effect of racism. It stressed the immune system of people back in the day and now they have permanent conditions because of it... And furthermore, white people don't have any of these measurable conditions because they have never been discriminated against. Genetics has nothing to do with it, white people are just so mean that they literally created these differences.</p>

Race is just a social construct? There are no racial traits? Doesn't seem right to me. You're saying that because we're human we don't obey the laws of nature? That isolated groups of humans that grew up under different selective conditions with a different gene pool wouldn't form their own differences?

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are genetic differences in groups of people. Nobody is denying that. The problem is, however, that the way we use race as a society does not line up with those genetic differences.</p>
<p>We randomly group a lot of different populations together based on one big visual characteristic, however many of these populations are not necessarily very similar to each other. Take Africa, for example. We say they are all black, all one race. However the genetic variation between the different populations in Africa is huge. Take [this] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953791/bin/nihms235397f3.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953791/bin/nihms235397f3.jpg</a>). The variations within non-african populations are smaller than those within African populations, and yet Africans are one race, but non-Africans are not.</p>
<p>Additionally, the way you view race is very much determined by where you are raised. I've seen Americans refer to someone as black, while someone from Europe or China would refer to that same person as while, because there are different cultural values in what makes up a race. Which, again, basically has nothing to do with the actual genetics. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No. No we (Europeans) would not call someone that Americans call black, white. Maybe mixed or mulatto, but certainly not white. I'm pretty sure that people in some African countries would call them white, but not Europeans. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course some places have more people with more of some genes etc.</p>
<p>Just as people in Northern Europe are most likely to have lactose tolerance: not because there is a North European race, but because the genes happened to have spread there.</p>
<p>There are genetic differences. Some places have more of X gene, some have more of Y. But that doesn't mean you can draw specific lines and split people into races. The genes don't follow the same borders, they overlap randomly.</p>
<p>I mean, for a start one of your examples is &quot;Chinese&quot;. This can mean two things. It could mean Chinese nationality or Chinese ethnicity. Clearly there isn't a race which happens to fit the borders of the people's republic of China. Then look at the ethnicity (Han). This is based essentially on speaking Chinese languages (Mandarin, Cantonese etc.). But these languages have historically spread due to people learning them as they were more dominant socially, not due to genetic replacement. In other words, Han is a social ethnic categorisation, not a genetic one.</p>
<p>So would you from that accept that your example of 'Chinese' is clearly not a race, just because it happens to have a higher rate of some gene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are indeed genetic differences between people, but they are not best categorized by &quot;race&quot; which rely solely on appearance. For example, a clinician might see an Asian appearing person and guess that they are lactose intolerant. However, on receipt of new information, ie they are from Tibet, you might change your guess to not lactose intolerant. You might, for some reason see their DNA sequence, and find they are more related to another population other than the Tibetan population.</p>
<p>The point is that &quot;race&quot; which is driven by appearance, is a poor approximation of which population a person hails from. Many clinical studies do use those categories because they are easier, however, which is why you may find that &quot;X race is more likely to have Y.&quot; However, if they are able to really determine each individual's genetic lineage + environmental influence (ie country born and raised in), you can find more meaningful associations.</p></div>		</li>
