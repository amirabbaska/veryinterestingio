			<div class="markdown"><p>Are anecdotes good science though? I once read an article about the benefits of whole milk, and many people responded about how fit they were and had drank whole milk. One reader's daughter had drank nothing but whole milk her entire life and had a six pack. The theme of the article was how skim milk was bad for you.</p>
<p>I responded &quot;I've drank nothing but skim milk my entire life and had a six pack. What does that prove? That neither of us are statistically relevant.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your general point is correct but the specific point in this case is not.  Why?  Because the original question was why do we need such a broad diet.  If even one person can live to 96 eating a very narrow diet then that proves that we don't <em>need</em> a broad diet.  This is similar to the talking dog, where n = 1 is enough to convince you that some dogs can talk.  Now it could be that maybe Grandpa had some weird metabolic quirk that enabled him to thrive with a narrow diet, but then even Grandma made it to 74.  The likelihood that they both had the strange metabolic quirk gets much smaller.   Now, if one wanted to prove that you only need the coffee cake, hamburger, grilled-cheese and canned vegetable diet to make it into your 90s then you would need to run an entire study hopefully prospectively double blind and controlled.  </p>
<p>The truth is I am sure that grandpa's  diet was a little more varied than described and in any case he clearly could get enough nutrients with even that narrow diet.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, anecdotes are poor science. Especially when it comes to the mental and physical conditions of other people. People lie because of ego, fear of not being normal, and many other reasons. Anecdotes are a fine starting point for a hypothesis, but just to create one, not to prove it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a kid I was starving when I visited them. There was no eating between meals. Those individually plastic-wrapped Entenmann's crumb cakes would start looking really good.</p>
<p>My grandmother knew exactly how many of them she had and kept them in an open bread box on the counter. I'd walked by and stare at them but never took one because she was mentally ill.</p>
<p>She'd put a slice of American cheese on a piece of white bread under the broiler until it bubbled up and browned. Two of those were lunch. They were actually good.</p>
<p>She sauteed broken up hamburger meat in a pan until it was nice and gray. Those meat crumbs and a can of peas was dinner.</p>
<p>I called her &quot;Grandma like in prison&quot; when I was a kid.</p>
<p>(Objectively looking at this, it's evidence of low-income eating. And they <em>were</em> low-income. But my parents had money. Wondering now about this...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty narrow! Even narrower: Humans can and do live on just meat. </p>
<p>There are groups that live only on animal food, according to the region they are in -- eg Nenet, Maasai -- and people that do it in modern cities and towns.  </p>
<p>Pretty much everyone tends towards fatty ruminant meat. </p>
<p>People are doing it for a variety of reasons -- sometimes an intolerance to plant foods due to Crohn's or IBS/IBD, sometimes to put a disease into remission (autoimmune or Lyme), sometimes because they have no tolerance for carbohydrate and even small amounts of vegetables make them gain weight/keep them from losing their excess stored fat.</p>
<p>It is an evolutionarily conserved possibility, available to anyone. </p>
<p>note: Scurvy comes from not having fresh food.  The fresh food can be meat, doesn't have to be fruit or veg. Ref: the wiki on scurvy, section Prevention and 19c. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I went through a phase where every day for like a year was a box of snackbars in the morning, gluten free mac n cheese for lunch, then steak for dinner. </p>
<p>Recently I had a kick that was 2 boxes of snack bars for breakfast / lunch followed by a meat for dinner with 2 shaker cups of ovaltine. Doctor said my blood work was great. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So far the stress and anxiety diet is working well for me. In the past month I've lost about 8kg and I haven't even been exercising. I haven't really been eating either but everything I have been eating has mostly been deep fried or mainly sugar. The downside is that while I'm now a healthy weight, I'm still fat around the waist which means my health is still at risk. I think I'm low on iron too which might be contributing to the stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember, the average vegan is probably also more concerned/into their diet than the average omnivore. That statistic is often used, but it is utter bullcrap imo. Vegans NEED to know a lot about their diet unless they wanna feel like crap all the time. Non-vegans don't have too, and therefore doesn't really think about what they eat very often. That is the difference...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main problem with veganism is people don't replace the meat and dairy they're losing. They just cut it out, and end up with an imbalanced diet when they should be adding in pulses, beans, legumes, and grains to add bulky calories, and something fatty (avocados all day every day bby).</p>
<p>Veganism doesn't take any extra planning or care to an omni diet, it's just the <em>transition</em> which requires a small change in mindset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point though is how many non vegans are unearthly and eat too few veggies or fruits? Sure, there will be vegans who don't do it healthily.  Of the vegans I've know (anecdotal), people were very aware of risk and need for additional nutrients.  Beans and legumes become staples. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment was really helpful to me, as someone who has been vegan for a few months (for ethical/environmental reasons) and noticed that I eat even more poorly than before now. I will focus on adding more beans/grains in my diet then. I love avocados but should probably cut back bc I read that they're ruining Mexico's forests (or something??).</p>
<p>Also I noticed that when I make mistakes, it's either because I was shopping in a hurry (and forgot to check that something didn't contain milk) or when I am invited at someone's house or eating out at a restaurant with other people and I don't want to make a fuss. For example at lunch today I ordered a salad which seemed vegan but they added mayonnaise to it (wasn't on the menu and they didn't ask me first), I didn't see the point in making a fuss so I just ate it but these incidents keep happening and I feel bad about them, like I can't even call myself a vegan if I'm too scared of a little social backlash to follow my principles.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It's why the Irish, before the potato famine, were actually the healthiest people in the UK. Most thought that anything that came out of the ground was dirty, so the aristocrats in Britain ate mainly meat and sweets and stuff like that, and others followed. The Irish (often very poor at this time) were left the potatos and maybe had a goat or two for milking, and were actually quite healthy for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To lose weight quickly you only need a large calorie deficit. That can happen on an all cake diet as long as you count calories and stick to it. The difficulty sometimes with calories-in-calories-out is knowing your calories out, or calories burned, and secondly the &quot;sticking to it&quot; part. It's a simple math problem but it's less simple when one of the numbers is a question mark, and when strong hormonal cravings enter the picture. There are resting metabolic rate charts that can give you an estimate but those have been shown to be inaccurate at least a good percentage of the time. So if you rely on a chart and it says your resting metabolic rate is 2000 calories (i.e. you'd burn 2000 calories sitting in a chair all day), but it's off by 500 calories for you, then you can eat a decent deficit at 1500 calories per day total and never lose weight. There are also hormonal influences like insulin to consider. If you're eating a diet high in carbs (like potatoes, oats, and milk) then your insulin levels will rise. Insulin is a storage hormone, it keeps blood sugar levels in check by wrapping up the glucose and storing it as fat. This is the idea behind a low carb diet, to minimize insulin release and therefore minimize fat storage. A diet of foods with low glycemic index (low insulin response) often works better for rapid fat loss. An extreme example of this is the ketogenic diet (see /r/keto) where people aim to eat less than, say, 20 carbs per day. Many people lose a large amount of weight very quickly on this kind of diet (again see /r/keto, a quick look of current posts shows people 100 pounds lost in 10 months, 80 lost in 8 months, 33 lost in 2 months, etc). The science of calories says it's just a math problem of adding and subtracting calories, and that works for some, but when hormones like insulin are involved it can significantly increase hunger and so people often fail counting calories just because they can't handle cravings for food. On a low carb diet where insulin response is minimal and you eat enough fat to stay feeling full, people often have a much easier time because they can go long stretches without eating and they don't have an energy crash or cravings for sugar and starch. The problem with the U.K. aristocrat diet of meat and sugary foods is the sugary foods, not the meat. While you could get the essential amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes you need from potatoes, you could also get almost all of them from a diet consisting of only grass fed beef, and maybe a leafy green veggie once in a while. A lot of the &quot;meat causes heart disease&quot; research is based on studying diets where people eat meat along with a good chunk of carbs, which cause insulin release, which causes fat storage, and it's becoming more clear that in a lot of diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease, the big factor is weight, and weight loss is the number one thing that improves symptoms. If you eat only grass fed beef and lose a ton of weight you're very unlikely to have problems with heart disease. On the old Irish diet of potatoes, oats, and milk, they were probably also doing more physical work throughout the day, and if you're sitting in an office all day you may not see similar results. Even adding exercise to an otherwise sedentary lifestyle is not equivalent to consistent, small physical work all day long. There was a study where they looked at a bus station, and the ticket takers who were walking around all day taking tickets were significantly healthier than the bus drivers who sat all day, and even adding exercise to the sitting job did not have the same effect as basic movement all day long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could simply eat fats and proteins without any carbohydrates whatsoever as well.  This would result in your body producing the glucose for you.  (You must completely cut out any and all carbohydrates, though.)  It is known as the keto diet, and a lot of people have done very well with it.  People have also anecdotally reversed their diabetes by using this diet.</p>
