			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve moved from rural Australia to the city, and I was gobsmacked to learn that barely anyone talks nicely about the unions here in the city. The anti-union sentiment is incredibly damaging in the long term, and yes, there may be a few corrupt assholes in unions, but the work they have done to push for wages, leave, and most importantly SAFETY is incredible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of our unions sort of feel like they're there for nothing too. I worked at a grocery store for a minute and had to join the union. Guess what yall, wages at grocery stores still suck. I like what unions are supposed to be, I lament the fact that there is no longer a musicians union so clubs get to force YOU to be the one who gets people out of their house, and not pay you when they inevitably don't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a young student I worked for a unionized grocery store in Canada. I think most grocery stores around here are with the same inion.</p>
<p>We had dental, raises every x hours (not much and yes, we started at minimal wage). It is also the reassurance that I could not be fired randomly just because a boss did not like my face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wages are just one thing though and a lot of what we get from unions   like safety at work and not being subject to dismissal without cause  came because of them. You don't notice these things because they are normal - they are normal because unions fought for them one concession at a time and because unions exist and there is the political will, they cant be rolled back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who was recommended to join the grocers union and being a college kid in the states, it was ridiculously funny. “So your going to take money out of my check to go to these people when I’m bagging groceries and pushing carts around for min wage? Ummm no thank you.” The butchers seemed to have a good union though. </p>
<p>I’ve done moved on from that job but realized as a college student the union didn’t have anything to offer me. I never planned for it to be a career. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see and recognise the work that unions do, but my first encounter with them left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>I had just gotten my first job at mighty KFC, and part of the orientation was signing stuff. Out of the blue my soon to be manager introduces a lady who is from a Union. Being 17 I didn’t know what they were, but she basically talked me through what they do and it all sounded Gucci.</p>
<p>A few weeks down the track I notice that my pay isn’t really as high as I expected it to be. I ask Steve (my manager) and he explains that for being part of a union (I didn’t know I was) they were taking money from my paycheck! I was losing $40 or $50 a week to a Union I didn’t know I signed up for. At the time my paycheck was like $120 lol so this affected me heaps.</p>
<p>Anyway yeah whenever I hear unions that’s what I think about. Apart from that I’ve never really heard from them, their presence isn’t that strong in my area (eastern subs Sydney)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't automatically join unions which are recommended by a corporate henchman.  They most likely are setup as a union but are actually a front with close ties to business industry groups.  It's the same as how HR is supposed to look after employees but ultimately is going to act in the company's best interests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many, many places of employment do not. I am familiar with slim to none that offer paternity leave in any form. Maternity may be more common but is often unpaid. Essentially they won’t fire you but you won’t get paid if you aren’t working.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry if it sounded like I’m trying to generalize the entire country. As you can see, location and the prestige of the employer will affect whether or not you’ll get paid leave. I was only trying to speak from my personal experience as a middle-class Iowan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in sales at a small company. I don’t have paternity leave at all. Not a big deal for me personally as I don’t plan to have kids for quite some time, but you bet your ass I won’t be sticking around once that changes. </p>
<p>There’s a number of huge red flags that are currently there. Most of it comes from our owner not knowing basic laws - like, hourly employees need to be paid per hour, not “we don’t pay overtime” </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NJ has mandated paternity leave for I believe 12 weeks, where you have to get your same position back.  The state will pay your salary for 6 of those weeks up to a certain amount. Some employers (like mine) will cover the difference for those 6 weeks, and some others will pay your salary for the 6 weeks that the state doesn't cover. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FMLA (family medical leave act) protects your job for 12 weeks (if you have been working there for 1 year).  Whether or not you get paid is up to your employer though.  You can get benefits like short term disability that will provide like \~60% of your pay (something like that) for 4 weeks with vaginal delivery or 6 weeks with C section.  It's not the best.  And I think paternity leave is state and employer dependent.  Here in Virginia, I don't think employers are required to give any time off to new fathers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t think it’s mandatorily paid by law. Bill Clinton signed a bill allowing 12 weeks of unpaid leave for mothers but it’s not law that a newly mother should be paid so it depends on how benevolent your corporate overlords are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it’s not required to be paid. FMLA just says they have to give you the time off. And it’s not limited to giving birth, can be used for caregiving to any family member.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the company. I work for Wal-Mart and they give something like 10 weeks paid maternity and 6 weeks paternity. Which honestly, I think is pretty damn good tbh. But I've also worked for companies, some of them major brands, that didn't offer paid maternity leave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... extraordinary. In Norway, you get a full year of fully paid leave, although both parents must take at least 15 weeks off each to avoid having the leave shortened - this is mainly to ensure that fathers also take time off to spend with the child and to encourage equality at home.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My employer in the UK gives 6 months full pay maternity, and this can be split with the father.  </p></div>		</li>

Most of us can't afford to miss work AND go to a doctor, so we have to work while sick. This usually gets other employees sick, and probably customers.</p></div>		</li>
