			<div class="markdown"><p>It just seems like the ticket industry is the only industry that does this.  Typically it goes wholesale -&gt; retail -&gt; consumer.  It seems odd to me that ticket re-sellers can buy tickets from the same market as a consumer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most businesses, suppliers engage in price discovery -- that is, they figure out what price the market will bear (to a greater or lesser degree) and adjust their pricing.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, so many kinds of venues/promoters just don't adjust their pricing very much between acts -- and really, really don't adjust their pricing much for location quality.  (For example, most theater venues will charge one price for all &quot;orchestra&quot; level seats -- be they row 3 dead-center or row 26 way out to the side).  This leaves a huge open market for someone to buy up all the good seats they can get, because the front few rows near the center will all sell for a multiple of face value, even at shows with only moderately high demand.</p>
<p>If venues sold each ticket for something closer to its actual market value, there wouldn't be room for mass-operating ticket brokers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ding ding ding! There is also some good will in selling cheap &quot;face value&quot; tickets because it allows you to push other merchandise from the artist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh and also Ticketing companies don't set the price and quantity etc, the venue and artists do. Neither do the companies get to choose when and what to put on sale. They also get a small percentage of the fees as income. On $100 total ticket, let's say $88 price +$12 fees, the ticketing company selling primary inventory ( like ticketmaster) only make $3 or less. They just get the blame. Most of the money from the face value and fee goes to the venue and artist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help if you think of the producer as the wholesaler and stubhub et al as the retailer, after all the venue is the one that makes the content and most individuals buy from the resellers. The difference here is then that the wholesalers readily sell to individuals if they have the product available, and the supply is strictly limited.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's nothing illegal about buying stuff in bulk. There's nothing illegal about selling stuff for any price you'd like.
Those are fundamental rights in any society that has any kind of free enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true; there are plenty of rules which specifically prohibit certain things being bought or sold in certain ways. For example, predatory pricing (selling at a loss in order to drive out competition and establish a monopoly) is illegal in plenty of places.</p></div>		</li>
