			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the context of the question (could this be a simulation), the correct answer is “None we know of,” not “No.”</p>
<p>Suppose are are living in a simulation, and the simulation is implemented with a computer that uses floating-point formats like our own computers do. In the common 64-bit binary floating-point format, the unit of least precision is 2^-52 times the value of the largest bit in a number. E.g., if an object is at a location represented by 5 units of distance, the smallest possible move the simulation could represent would be a distance of 4•2^-52 units (4 because that is the highest bit in the binary representation of 5 and 2^-52 because of the width of available bits in the format).</p>
<p>Imagine our technology progresses to the point where we can see some of these quantum effects in experiments (by which I mean numerically quantum, not quantum mechanics quantum). We might see that a distance of 5 units can be altered by amounts of 4•2^(-52), a distance of (say) 11 units can be altered by amounts of 8•2^(-52), a distance of 23 units can be altered by amounts of 16•2^(-52). The binary nature of the floating-point representation is visible in the quanta: They appear in amounts that differ in ratios of powers of two. (We do not need any knowledge of the absolute magnitude or meaning of the units of distances. We just observe that the ratios of quanta are powers of two.)</p>
<p>If the implementation used a base-10 representation of floating-point, we would observe the ratios of quanta to be powers of ten.</p>
<p>So, if we are in a simulation, it is theoretically possible that the numerical base used to compute the simulation could have effects we might observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By constants, do you mean numbers like pi, phi, etc? If so, the answer is no. The integers are the integers regardless of the base you choose to represent them. </p>
<p>Think of the integers as a concept. You have a single apple. You have two apples. You have three apples, etc. The concept of having those collection of different amounts of discrete objects is the way to think about the integers. The symbol you choose to represent different amounts of apples is irrelevant to that concept, which is why the integers are the integers regardless of the base you choose. We could create our own original numerical system where the number 3 is represented by the symbol &quot;~_~&quot; for all that matters, but it would be cumbersome and difficult to work with. The nice thing about the base number systems is that they have a nice pattern to them.</p>
<p>These types of threads pop up in /r/askscience fairly often and it all boils down to the same confusion which is that people forget that symbols like 1,2,3,4,5,etc are like a language to represent a concept, just like the word &quot;Zebra&quot; is a word we use to represent the black and white striped animal. In spanish they call that a &quot;cebra&quot;. In french they call it a &quot;zèbre&quot;. But no matter what language you use, you're describing the same animal. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet!</p>
<p>So try to think about the different numerical systems are being like completely different languages. If you think of it this way, then the following facts won't seem so mysterious:</p>
<p>1) Irrational numbers are irrational in all bases.<br />
2) Rational numbers are rational in all bases.<br />
3) Prime numbers are prime in all bases.<br />
4) The integers are the integers in all bases.  </p></div>		</li>
