<p><a href="http://jhr.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=9096" target="_blank">[When it comes to wood ants] At its extreme, a colony has survived close to 30 years on a barren islet of less than 0.2 ha, where the only permanent and relatively rich food is provided by aphids on the islet’s only pine tree</a></p>
