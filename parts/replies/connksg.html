			<div class="markdown"><p>'Teaspoon' is a measure of volume equivalent to 5 mL whereas grams measure mass.  One teaspoon is only equal to 5 grams if the density of the substance is 1 g/mL, like water.  The density of granulated sugar is ~0.85 g/mL (<a href="http://www.aqua-calc.com/page/density-table/substance/sugar-coma-and-blank-granulated" target="_blank">source</a>) so 3 teaspoons of sugar has a mass of about 12.75 g.  Assuming a small, 8 oz, (240 mL) cup of tea, that's 5.3 g/ 100 mL.  Obviously kitchen spoons are not as accurate as measuring spoons, but the coke is still about twice as sugary as the tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite misleading to change the volume of the tea to make your point. Even with the revised figures it's still 6.375 g/100mL for a 200mL cup of tea as per OP's example.</p>
<p>Even then that's not the concern here. A kitchen teaspoon can vary greatly from an actual measured teaspoon, so it's very likely that your Average Joe putting three kitchen teaspoons of sugar into their tea is in fact comparable to the amount of sugar in a can of Coca-Cola.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What?  They immediately followed that statement with the amount per 100 mL (5.3 g), which can be directly compared to your calculation (10.6 g / 100 mL). What is misleading about this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points about my manipulated volume and the differences in kitchen teaspoons. I was mostly concerned about how density wasn't considered. Crusading against 1 g = 1 mL one buried comment comment at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I always wondered that with recipes.</p>
<p>Some recipes call for 500 g of flour and others for 2 cups (or whatever).  So do I need a scale to make what Gordon Ramsay makes or is there a set conversion for ingredients?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that's quite right. A can of coke has 39 grams of sugar, and your typical household teaspoon holds 4-5 grams of sugar. Three teaspoons into coffee would be 12-15g vs 39g in a can of coke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I the only one in here who thinks that its ridiculous to put so much sugar into your tea/coffee? It hardly even tastes like tea/coffee by two servings, why would anyone put in so much sugar when your coffee/tea is so sweet after even one serving of sugar, to clarify however, I am referring to a 5mL single serve sugar packet as a serving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just makes it a different drink, imo. I'll usually drink tea unsweetened, and coffee black or with a little milk. But I still enjoy a nice sweet tea (where I work, that meant adding 5-6 cups of sugar per 4 gallons of tea. Which is crazy sweet, but damn it can hit the spot), or one of those starbucks drinks that are 90 percent sugar, syrup, and milk. </p>
<p>And if you don't like the taste of coffee/tea but want caffeine it's easy to see why you'd want to add so much sugar you can't taste the coffee :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can enjoy a sugary beverage as much as the next guy, but if <em>every day</em> you're consuming at least half of your daily recommended sugar just by having a cup of coffee in the morning you're overdoing it in my opinion. It doesn't take much to just sensitize yourself to coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not the only one, but you wouldn't believe how much sugar some people like in their tea, especially in southern US.
A local restaurant puts 3-4 often heaping cups of sugar in about 3 to 3.5 gallons of tea. That's about a tablespoon per ounce. While many like it and many ask for half unsweetened, some even ask for extra sweetener. </p>
<p>It's crazy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not the only one. Lots of people are sensitized to sugar, so they require lots of it in everything, which increases the sensitization, so they need more, and so on, until we now have 300 million people with Type-2 Diabetes. </p></div>		</li>
