<p>I've been hearing this for a while, but remained convinced that electric toothbrushes were just a gimmick (can you blame me for being skeptic? :P)</p>
<p>But after reading this thread I think there's enough reason for me to buy an electric toothbrush now. No harm in it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not necessarily true.  It all depends on technique.  I'm a dentist and I know I do a better job manually then with an electric.  Studies do show there is no benefit if technique is adequate. However, most people are lazy and won't brush correctly so an electric is Better for them.  It's also much more beneficial to older people who have lost dexterity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate the electronic toothbrush my husband bought. He doesn’t mind it, but I feel like it’s vibrating the very neurons in the deepest part of my brain and I’m going to end up with whipped, frothy white matter bubbling out of my head/ears. Even on gentle/mild mode.  </p>
<p>Is this something you’ve heard before, and would a different toothbrush maybe be better? Because I’m not going to buy an electronic toothbrush for $75 or whatever and then hate that one too.  </p></div>		</li>
