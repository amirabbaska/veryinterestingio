			<div class="markdown"><p>2 most common kinds: Hemotoxins and neurotoxins, with many, many different mechanisms of how they mess you up. Broadly speaking a hemotoxin stops blood clotting or destroys red blood cells causing you to bleed out, internal bleed or cause organ death because red blood cells are somewhat important to all your organs. Neurotoxins (again, broadly) find various ways to stop your brain from controlling the rest of your body, so it messes with your heart rhythm or breathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common are paralysis and necrosis. Paralysis makes muscles stop working, like the ones that make you breathe or your heart beat. Necrosis kills living tissues and causes them to rot.</p></div>		</li>
