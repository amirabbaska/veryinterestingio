			<p>That's what people said 40 years ago about our first wave of automation:  computers.<br><br>Turns out that the automation made possible by computers actually made our economy more productive as efficiency skyrocketed, consumption rose, and our standard of living rose with it.<br><br>Go back another couple centuries and people said the same thing about the industrial revolution.<br><br>The bottom line is:  Efficiency is good, not bad.</p>		</li>

			<p>Efficiency is good. The cost premium put on efficiency, and the sacrifice of all other ethical consideration in the interest of maximizing efficiency, is bad. Efficiency as the pillar of economics and the catalyst for the externalization of social welfare and ecological sustainability is why this thread exists. </p>		</li>

			<p>Put a price on sacrificing ethics.  In my opinion, that's the most direct way to solve the problem.</p>		</li>

			<p>At this point the worries of the economy will in reality be less significant. Such a big shock will seem very scary and will bring many end-of-timers out of the woodwork. But as humans we'll eventually understand how to live in a world where the economy is essentially automated. This could be very good or bad. That probably depends on how far we've come in decision making as a single species. </p>		</li>

			<p>automation in the workplace means that jobs for people will become increasingly rare. at that point doesn't the argument boil down to sharing the wealth? if there are very few jobs left for people to do, yet production is more plentiful and efficient than ever, how are we expected to make money? </p>		</li>

			<p>This is a crucial aspect to examine. We're essentially trying to predict how humans will behave economically in an almost economically automated world, which is very difficult to predict because there it's no precedent. How will humans value money when work and labor can no longer be used as measurements of this value? Will wealth even be competitive wealth even be desirable? Will it be replaced with a new form of competition or will humans take advantage of an opportunity that permits a possible form of social utopia?</p>		</li>

			<p>The fact that we still have fanatical jihadist muslims that are willing to destroy the western world in the name of an imaginary &quot;allah&quot; doesn't put a lot of faith as to how far we've come as a species.</p>		</li>

			<p>The fact that we still have radical fundamentalist Christians who thump the good book, abhor homosexuality, deny climate change and evolution and otherwise ignore obvious scientific truths, and these people are IN CHARGE OF THE MOST POWERFUL STATE ON THE PLANET is a bigger testament to our progress, or lack thereof. Extremist Muslims are neither a symptom or a cause of the problem. Just a minor annoyance. Like when it's really cold outside and you have to take your hand out of your pocket to turn a doorknob but you have no manual dexterity. The tendency of Americans to look past America instinctively when looking at a problem is staggering </p>		</li>

			<p>We are not running on fumes, we need to spread the wealth around better. What is happening is that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting shafted.<br><br>The internet revolution hasn't been creating jobs like the manufacturing revolution(except for a couple of start ups) did but instead it is making lives better without much expense. Instead of working in manufacturing more people are working in the service industry.</p>		</li>
