			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite to that extent, but same idea here. I pay for all my transactions with credit card if possible. I usually don't carry a balance, I just like the rewards. Also fraud prevention, purchase protection or whatever else you get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>bingo!  they only win if you forget or dont have the cash. well as long as your card didnt have an annual fee.  my job at first had me charge my hotels, 75 nights a year, they would reimburse, but that first year i made BANK on that 2%.  now they just give me a pre-loaded debit, sucks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These rewards are very much them sharing our own transaction fees back with us.  So they charge the merchant 3%, and give use 1-2%.  skimming 1% of the retail sales in the process.  </p>
<p>if we all stopped using CC's we could lower retail prices by 3%, but that will never happen now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are making the false assumption that handling cash has zero cost or risk. </p>
<p>Electronic payments, when used to the issuers requirements, have very little risk of loss and go straight from their account to your own. </p>
<p>Cash on the other hand, you have to pay someone to count it on acceptance, pay someone to count it at the end of a shift, pay another person to count it to verify the total is correct, pay someone to create a deposit slip and either drive it to the bank, or give it to an armored car service. </p>
<p>So very many people make the assumption that cash has zero handling costs because it does not show up as a line item on the P&amp;L statements. You see the costs of accepting electronic money, you don't see the costs associated with accepting cash, but they both exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different kinds of businesses will favor cash vs card and vice versa. Your average grocery store would be pissed if the card machines were broken for a week and people could only use cash and check. I see a lot of places using those iPad PoS devices, cash is seen as an annoyance there. But a local small mechanic shop might favor cash. I've been to those places where the mechanic will gladly give a large cash discount (25% or more) since he knows he can just pocket the cash, nevermind the swipe fees. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not quite that much, because card users spend more than cash users, and handling cash costs businesses money too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I specifically change credit cards for the best cash back rewards. Sadly, I just got a card with a high annual fee for a 2% reward. Only to just find a new one offering 2.5% with no annual fee. All they ask is that you put 1k a month into their accounts. When you pay your cc off every month, it's a huge incentive to use your credit card. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No need to pay a fee for a 2% card. Citi DoubleCash is 2% (well, 1% at time of transaction and 1% when you pay it off, but as long as you pay monthly it's basically 2% within a month). No fee. Capital One Venture is 2% with the first year annual fee waived (and they often will waive the fee the next year if you call and ask, or you can cancel the card or downgrade to something else).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you know if it hurts your credit score to cancel a new card and apply for a better one?</p></div>		</li>
