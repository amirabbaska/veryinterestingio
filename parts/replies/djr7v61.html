<p>When you refer to a foetus passing waste it's really not waste in the way people think.</p>
<p>Meconium should by and large remain in the baby until after birth (and even then isn't really 'poo')</p>
<p>as for 'peeing' it's really just cycling amniotic fluid in and out so the organs can practice at what their supposed to after birth.</p>
<p>It's not 'urine' in the same way we produce urine...after all the foetus isn't technically eating or drinking, just passing nutrients back and forth across the placenta...</p></div>		</li>
