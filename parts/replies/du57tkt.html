			<div class="markdown"><p>Some severe narcolepsy patients have a chance of slipping into a coma, rather than just falling asleep while awake. My father for example, has to take Vyvanse daily to avoid this even though he suffered a massive heart attack a few years ago. The reward outweighs the risk in his instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you already try armodafinil? It has helped me a ton with my hypersomnia (similar to narcolepsy if you haven't heard of it). Ritalin or Adderall was going to be my next stop if this didn't work. It's not perfect and I sleep a lot on weekends (because I give my body a medicine break), but it's changed my life. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember when I used to take legal methapheta-I mean adderall I used to get really tired after I stopped taking it or when it would wear of, Id have to keep taking it just to feel baseline and normal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>have there ever been any experiments done using blackout curtains and artificial sunlight to create a longer “day”? i’m interested if the circadian rhythm is inherently 24 hours biologically or if it could adapt to, let’s say a 36 hour day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None that I'm aware of specifically using blackout curtains and artificial sunlight, but you might find <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefania_Follini" target="_blank">this article</a> about a woman who went into an isolated underground chamber for four months interesting, particularly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inside her twenty by twelve foot acrylic glass room, away from all cues to the normal 24-hour daily cycle, her biological clock drifted away from its regular rhythm to following first a 28-hour day, and later on a 48-hour one. She started staying awake for up to more than twenty hours and sleeping up to ten hours at a time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I freelance from home and basically go to bed whenever I feel like and get up whenever I feel like. I'm constantly drifting to a longer day, currently going to sleep at 6-7 am and waking up at 4 pm or later. Once in a while I need to reset, maybe when I need to go shopping at a reasonable hour (which makes me fall asleep earlier), but a few days later I'm heading to bed at sunrise again. Funnily enough, I don't even have curtains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens in someone who has a backwards circadian rhythm?</p>
<p>By which I mean when someone's natural cycle is to go to sleep in the morning and wake up late afternoon and when they try to change this to a more socially acceptable sleep cycle they feel permanently tired no matter how much sleep they get and are constantly fighting there body's natural urge to slip back into a nocturnal sleep cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doctor, but this might just be a matter of time to adapt to a &quot;proper schedule.  Or it could be other underlying problems like sleep apnea or other variables like light and noise when there should be darkness and less noise, etc. When in doubt see a sleep doctor and explain the situation.  You would most likely be observed and given test results.  </p></div>		</li>
