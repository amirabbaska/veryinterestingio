			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more like a self-updating system. Imagine a computer program that realizes when it makes a mistake and then changes elements of its code avoid making that mistake and thereby optimize its performance in the future. That's analogous to what the brain may be doing during sleep.</p>
<p>A couple specific examples which I think are mentioned in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11052946" target="_blank">When learning songs, songbirds &quot;rehearse&quot; the songs during sleep</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17173043" target="_blank">When rats navigate mazes, they &quot;replay&quot; the steps they took while asleep</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As an aside, these examples and others also demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, sleep is actually quite an active process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can relate. Solved a puzzle piece in Banjo Kazooie while asleep. Woke up the next Saturday morning and solved it instantly. Involved not stepping on cracks in the haunted house level by becoming a pumpkin and travelling down the chimney.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often find if I've been trying to figure something out, I can usually solve a problem straight after waking. I thought it was just like subconscious processing whilst asleep. So kinda like what you said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To indicate there isn't a conflict of interests. Since I'm recommending a book that aims to develop a theory of sleep represented by the views of the author (despite being substantiated by a good deal of evidence), people might assume I have an agenda to promote the book in order to popularize the argument and increase book sales that I might profit from (e.g. if I was the author/publisher/etc). If I were referencing a journal article I wouldn't have included such a disclaimer since conflicts of interest are generally disclosed in such articles and verified during the review process.</p>
<p>I suppose it may not be necessary to include that sort of disclaimer in this context, but it's standard practice in the science world and so I figured I'd do it here just in case. I'm just glad to have contributed meaningfully to the discussion :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The difficult thing is dissecting which processes sleep originally evolved to perform, and which processes took advantage of the sleep state to occur. An explanation for sleep must apply universally to all organisms that sleep, regardless of the quality and quantity of sleep they have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm just a layman, but this argument seems shaky because it excludes the possibility that sleep first evolved to serve a need that has since ceased to exist for higher organisms, but the need for sleep was retained because it had begun to serve any number of other needs depending on how the organisms evolved. </p>
<p>Or in other words: there might no longer be a universal advantage that sleep provides for every species. </p>
<p>The argument also implies that sleep only evolved once and not multiple times in different organisms, but I think a serious book on the topic would back that claim up.</p></div>		</li>
