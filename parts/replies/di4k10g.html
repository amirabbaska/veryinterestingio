			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple and Samsung are both switching a lot of stuff to USB C and plan to continue further. Google has been pushing type C for like three years already. I can't imagine it won't be the standard for almost all medium and high end electronics within the next decade. I'm pretty happy about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The new MBPr <em>only</em> has USB C though, and I'm not if the new iPhone follows suit.</p>
<p>But you're right they'll probably introduce another proprietary cable just cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The EU regulation behind the sudden agreement doesn't actually specify a particular plug and such, it just has language saying (on the top of my head) &quot;industry standard&quot;.</p>
<p>To be technically compliant manufacturers might need to include B to C cables in the beginning, but, well, meh. That is, C on one side, something you can plug into an existing USB charger on the other side. Passive adapters are perfectly fine, it's about the power electronics part as that's the recycling nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No idea what each one belongs to but I'll be damned if they're being thrown out.</p>
<p>Could be useful. One day. Maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example of that is Ryobi's universal jig-saw blades. They developed a type of blade that would fit into (and most importantly stay in) jigs designed for all 3 major designs of blades. So they mass produced it and when it came time to release a new jigsaw, they made it only accept their blades. Except, those blades didn't sell well and the product was killed off. Now it's very difficult to find blades for those Ryobi jigsaws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best example imo are garden hose fittings (GHT). </p>
<p>There's NPT,JIC, etc, but garden hose fittings have to be their own special standard. </p></div>		</li>
