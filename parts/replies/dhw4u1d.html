			<div class="markdown"><p>so you worked for a vendor who bought data from the Facebooks of the world and then did the associating of campaigns with the segments?  Or did your company buy the data from somebody who got their data from the facebooks?</p>
<p>How granular was the data you looked at?  You said male twenties, white but facebook has names right?  Do those get sold?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't buy data from facebook and co.</p>
<p>You use their ad-network to create ads targeted to their existing audience. The more accurate and detailed this data is, the better you can target your ads to the audience.</p>
<p>Facebook and co. make money from providing advertisers an efficient way to show the right ad to the right person at the right time.</p>
<p>Advertisers make money, if they invest X money into advertising on that ad-network and hopefully do good enough targeting to the relevant audience, so that a fraction of this audience will find the ad useful, click on it and finally buy the product/service etc. If the revenue generated from the invested money X is bigger than X itself, they make profit. (ROAS / ROI)</p>
<p>Digital advertising is not about getting Personal Identifiable Information like names, addresses, emails except for email marketing. The big share of advertising in the online world is about having a mass of people (audience), the right fraction of that mass (target), the right ad, and the right time. If this is all right, the ad is useful to anyone in that chain. That's all based on cookies and userIDs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, it's all stored in databases.  it's like a huge excel spreadsheet.  You get a row and all the data that is being tracked in this manner is attached.  Reputable companies don't sell the identifiable parts of that data, but they may sell the ability to advertise based off it.</p>
<p>Google for example allows you to target adds based off those columns, but generally sells very little of the data. (they make money off keeping that data as secret as possible.)  Many other companies simply sell that excel spreadsheet like data file, as they don't need to safely store and figure out how to monetize that data themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what I want to know is what columns are for sale?  Which columns is Facebook selling for instance?  What columns can I go in and buy?</p>
<p>And then Google, who doesn't sell much information so we can only speculate, but maybe there are some indicators of just granular their profiles of each of us are?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Facebook, Google AdWords, DoubleClick, LinkedIn, Instagram and other advertising companie's business model isn't based on selling personal identifiable data. It's used internally to optimize their targeting.</p></div>		</li>
