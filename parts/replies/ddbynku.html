			<div class="markdown"><p>I am specifically interested with your last example (the red light stuff).</p>
<p>How can the fish evolve in such way? I mean, how do they learn that red color can help them to conceal? Furthermore, for the predator, how do they recognize this and how are they able to develop body part which emits red light? </p>
<p>Evolution is always an intriguing topic to me. I am always wondering if animals such as those in deep sea are able to sort of 'think' the ways to modify their bodies in order to adapt to the environment, they should have had better intelligence, and not just spending their whole life hunting their preys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither fish has to know anything. Think of it like this: there's a population of rabbits in every color ranging from black to pure white and everything in between.</p>
<p>When the rabbits mate they pass on their genes. When two white rabbits mate it produces white rabbits. When two black rabbits mate it produces black rabbits. When two differently colored rabbits mate it produces offspring with a mix of colors.</p>
<p>Then an ice age starts and the world is permanently blanketed in snow. For all the predators, every color of rabbit stands out against the white snow for easy pickings. Except for the white rabbits who are nearly invisible. Far more white than colored rabbits will survive to reproduce and most new rabbits will be white because it's the only variation that survives to reproduce.</p>
<p>Evolution isn't a process where species pursue the best solution. Evolution is a process of elimination. Mutation creates many, many tiny variations in living things. Most are useless and harmless and nothing happens. Some are detrimental and negatively impact an animal's ability to reproduce (like being a brown rabbit in the snow). If the odds of reproducing go down, the odds of passing down that gene go down and that mutation quickly disappears from the gene pool.</p>
<p>But sometimes a mutation is an advantage and it actually increases an individual's chance of passing on that gene to the next generation. Individual mutations are usually small differences but incremental change over millions of years as directed by natural selection (ie. the fittest individuals survive to reproduce) can create massive change.</p>
<p>The human eye is a great example of how incremental change can create something incredibly complex. In simplified steps the human eye came into existence like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some very simple species evolved light sensitive cells that can tell the difference between light and dark. Useful for figuring out night from day, cover from being out in the open. Earthworms still have these cells.</li>
<li>Some species started growing those cells at the bottom of a little bowl-shaped depression. Now the direction of the light can be detected as light only hits one side of the bowl. Useful for detecting when a predator suddenly looms overhead, blocking the light from one direction.</li>
<li>In some species that little bowl started to turn into an enclosed space with a tiny opening, effectively turning it into a biological pinhole camera that can form an image. A very primitive eye!</li>
<li>Some species that tiny opening becomes controllable in diameter, it's now a simple aperture allowing the proto-eye to control how much light falls into and focus it on the plane of light sensitive cells.</li>
<li>At from that point on different types of light sensitive cells develop that are sensitive to different types of electromagnetic radiation (colors of light), different types of tissues for conducting the light evolve and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>So even something as complex as an eyeball can evolve from very simple beginnings given enough time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't think. It just throws shit at the wall and sees what sticks. It just so happened that a few predators had both red lights and eyes that could see red, and since that worked better than the alternatives, they kept reproducing and there started being more red lights with red-seeing eyes.</p></div>		</li>
