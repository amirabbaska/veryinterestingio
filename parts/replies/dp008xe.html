			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but u/half3clipse 's analogy is really useful. If light can't even escape, and you cant move any faster than that, then of course you'd never escape either. I don't know much SR or GR but I thought imposing that speed limit and defining the photon sphere as a mathematical surface is sufficient.</p></div>		</li>
