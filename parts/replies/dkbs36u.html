<p>Ozone only 'lives' for about an hour,</p>

<p>How does model this fit with the depletion of the ozone layer?</p>
<p>I mean, if the ozone only lives for an hour, why would cloroflorocarbon-based propellants in aerosol cans make a difference to the health of the ozone layer? And wouldn't the &quot;hole&quot; in the ozone be self-repaired in &lt;60 minutes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on /u/Cintramontane's reply, it helps if you understand how equilibrium processes work in chemistry and what it is that the CFCs are doing to the ozone layer.</p>
<p>This is the ozone-oxygen cycle: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone%E2%80%93oxygen_cycle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone%E2%80%93oxygen_cycle</a></p>
<p>Ultraviolet light splits an oxygen molecule into oxygen radicals.</p>
<p>O2 + ℎν → 2 O•</p>
<p>The radicals join with diatomic oxygen to create ozone.</p>
<p>O• + O2 → O3</p>
<p>Ozone interacts with a different wavelength of light, and splits to create more radicals.</p>
<p>O3 + ℎν(240–310 nm) → O2 + O</p>
<p>These radicals recombine quickly, but in doing so they gain the kinetic energy form the ejected particle and heat up.</p>
<p>O + O2 → O3 + EK</p>
<p>The process keeps going because, once the free radical oxygen is created in the initiation step, it keep participating in the reaction with diatomic oxygen to form ozone and back, and thus absorbing potentially harmful energy from the sun and turning it into heat, until it runs into a molecule of ozone or another radical and reforms diatomic oxygen. </p>
<p>O3 + O· → 2 O2</p>
<p>2 O· → O2</p>
<p>These reactions are much rarer because the radicals themselves and the ozone molecules are rare compared to the diatomic oxygen. In other words, once the radical is created, it pretty much stays there absorbing energy forever.</p>
<p>This is an equilibrium process because the amount of ozone in the stratosphere, and thus the amount of energy from the sun the ozone layer absorbs, depends on the rates of the above reactions, and the rates change with the amount of the reactants.  The rate of the initiation reaction remains relatively constant because of the abundance of O2 and the constant energy input from the sun.  As the amount of O3 increases, the removal reaction where the radicals recombine becomes more common and the rate of removal speeds up, until a balance is reached and the ozone is being created as quickly as it is being destroyed, and you get a nice comfortable amount of O3 acting as a blanket.</p>
<p>CFCs were useful to humans because they are very stable, inert, and unreactive, and so when we released them into the atmosphere we expected them to remain that way.  However, they are destroyed by ultraviolet light when they reach the stratosphere, which releases a halide free radical (Cl· for example).</p>
<p>When one of these radicals meets an ozone molecule, it steals the radical and leaves behind diatomic oxygen, becoming ClO.</p>
<p>Cl· + O3 → ClO + O2</p>
<p>ClO can then do the same thing with another ozone molecule, leaving behind two diatomic oxygens and the Cl radical again.</p>
<p>ClO + O3 → Cl· + 2 O2</p>
<p>This is a catalytic reaction, and it neither depends on energy from the sun nor destroys the Cl radical, and so the radical is free to stick around and destroy ozone molecules forever, until it runs into something else and turns into an inert molecule like HCl.  This takes a long time to happen, so the radical stays up there a long time, and it upsets the equilibrium by destroying O3 faster than it can be created, thus depleting the reservoir.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for taking the time to explain this. </p>
<p>Does the F from the CFCs also become a free radical/ catalyst? It's my (limited) understanding that once F grabs ahold of something, it won't dissociate without a pretty big jolt of energy. But then again, F0, F02, or FOOF all seem like they would to react with literally anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if we had some magical hypothetical way (an H-bomb) to drastically reduce the CFC radicals in the ozone layer? Are there data models for what could happen if we were to try to fix the issue ourselves?</p>
<p>Also, does the heat production due to the recombination of O and O2 into O3 mean that if we didn't have Oxygen (or CO2, which I assume can undergo similar reactions) in the atmosphere our planet would not be warm? Or maybe just that we wouldn't have any heat at all unless under the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original explanation sounds like the existence of ozone isn't important, instead the process of creating ozone is what absorbs the UV rays.</p>
<p>Assuming that's true, it sounds like CFCs must block or slow the creation of ozone, rather than destroy it... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another very important part is that a single CFC molecule doesn't just react with one or a few O3 molecules, it serves as a catalyst for the reaction that depletes the ozone layer and does so tens of thousands of times.  It's because it's so long lived in the atmosphere that it's able to have such and impact.</p></div>		</li>
