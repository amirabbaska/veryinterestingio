			<div class="markdown"><p>Skype has been updated long ago to use modern compression codecs like VP8 and H.264, the latter being the same one as FaceTime, so the &quot;age&quot; is pretty much invalidated.</p>
<p>FaceTime, however, has the advantage of the platforms it runs on. macOS and iOS both offer hardware encoding/decoding APIs that FaceTime uses to compress video faster and with better quality than Skype can achieve only with software (as the Skype client is for multiple platforms, and therefore can't integrate very much with other technologies to aid with compatibility).</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons why Apple isn't keen on providing FaceTime clients for other systems, they wouldn't have the hardware integration to provide video at the quality they need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the implication that Skype uses less bandwidth? I am constantly overrunning my monthly data allowance, but if FaceTime is more of a glutton I'll stay away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not ELI5: the implication is that using the same bitrate, FaceTime is more efficient at transferring details. They could transfer the same quality, and FaceTime would use less bandwidth. This isn't accounting for variable bitrate. I was explaining to a five year old. If you want performance metrics, run some tests or search online.</p></div>		</li>
