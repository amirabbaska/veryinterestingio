			<div class="markdown"><p>Swelling helps initially. Our vessels become more permeable to allow clotting factors and white cells into the tissue to stop hemorrhage and fight off infection. The next step in the healing process is proliferation where our body will remove dead tissue and bacteria from the site. If we reduce swelling at this point, it will speed up the proliferation process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is haphazard. It uses what works, not what works best. Creatures that mutated in a way that swelled the injured area survived longer because the influx of white blood cells reduced the risk of infection. A swollen limb or digit also is less likely to be used, so that too would reduce exposure of the wound to possible infection by proxy. This mutation would keep said creatures alive long enough to breed more often than those who did not develop this mutation. </p>
<p>We swell because that was the mutation we were handed down by our progenitors. We reduce the swelling because our brains have evolved beyond that mutation to know that it is uncomfortable, and we have gained knowledge about how to treat wounds properly that is far more beneficial to us than letting a wound swell. Also, certain cases of swelling can be detrimental to your health, such as in the brain, and put pressure on other nerves or organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is focusing on the 'bad' cases of swelling or the extreme cases of inflammation/swelling. Most of the time it is mild, appropriate and serves its functions. And what nobody is mentioning is also the cases where inflammation and swelling is insufficient to prevent systemic infections or other bad outcomes, because we don't see that. So yes our immune systems are somewhat haphazard and there is a balancing act also between under-responding and over-responding. But it is not like we have just inherited a whole host of immune responses that are useless to us.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the best answer, but I'd like to add that it does use what works best, but what works best may not come up, or if it does, it may not make a significant impact on survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is swelling you’re not able to use a certain muscle or joint to it’s fullest potential which is certain instances will cause you to be off of it for a while. If you don’t strengthen the muscle you won’t be able to recover as quickly from a few injuries. It’s best to ice in situations that you want to recover quickly from ( example: non so serious injury during a football game so you’re able to go back in)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From first hand experience, it can also cause joints/muscles to no longer function if that swelling effects nerves. </p>
<p>I had my entire thigh stop working after a meniscus repair surgery... I just wish they would've told me that is normal after that surgery before hand. A repair meaning I had my meniscus sewn back together with 6 stitches instead of just trimmed and smoothed out. Took 8 weeks of recovery before they had me start PT, then 3 months to get strong enough to get off crutches. Had to use electro-stim to get the muscles to start firing again. It sucked, but in the end was worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there also a 'splint' affect to it? So a sprain that's swollen has reduced range, which keeps you from making it worse. I'm asking, since I remember that coming up in my EMT class...but again, it's an EMT class. They teach 'what' not 'why', so I can't really speak authoritatively.</p></div>		</li>
