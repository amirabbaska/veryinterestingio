Could it be that an internal molecule carries enough speed to escape the liquid? I imagine it's more difficult to because of the greater intermolecular attractions within. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fluids (liquids and gases) there is the concept of the &quot;mean free path&quot;, which is the average distance a molecule (or atom, for the noble gases) can travel before it collides with another one. In water, this mean free path is ~0.25 nm, and since any molecule more than a few mean free paths from the surface will likely collide with another one before reaching the surface, the vast majority of evaporation for water will happen in a layer withn about one or two nanometres of the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been some simulations of how evaporation from an air/water interface occurs on the molecular level. The water molecules forming the liquid are held together through hydrogen bonds. For a molecule to escape, these bonds have to be broken. From the simulations described in the link below, &quot;the evaporation process can be viewed as a Newton’s cradle, where momentum is transferred to the surface from below, in a well-timed manner, to kick off one water molecule.&quot;</p>
<p>Based on these studies, evaporation is really occurring at the very outmost layer of water molecules (i.e., less than a nanometer), though the energy required to kick that molecule into the gas phase comes from slightly deeper in the liquid.</p>

<p>It applies to all of them, but if they're not at the surface then they'll quickly get &quot;reassimilated&quot; into the liquid around them. Below the boiling point, anyway. Above the boiling point, it'll happen often enough that bubbles start to form, which then float up to the surface on account of their relatively low density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of molecules with enough energy to escape is probably about the same throughout the liquid, including the surface, but if it's in the middle, chances are it'll get slowed down before it gets to the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why you can lose body heat by sweating, or why you feel cold when you step out of the shower / bath.</p>
<p>The droplets of water have on <em>average</em> the same temperature of your skin, but as /u/erdaron said each molecule is of a different temperature. The hotter ones, having more energy, are the most likely &quot;escape&quot; in the air thereby evaporating - with them gone, the average temperature of the droplet lowers.</p>
<p>Due to the first law of thermodynamics (or some other number, I can't remember) since now the water is cooler than your skin, your skin cools and the water heats up.</p>
<p>The process repeats until all the water is gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an individual molecule, yes. But you have roughly the same amount of water in your body, and so a similar number of molecules will be going the other way: there's no overall effect. It's only on the surface of the droplet, where <em>far more molecules are leaving than are entering</em>, where you get a net loss of water and heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Educated guess: once the molecule has left the droplet, it's mean free path (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4bx3kq/if_water_has_a_boiling_point_of_100_degrees_c_why/d1db14d" target="_blank">zekromNLR's post</a> ) should greatly increase since it is in a far less dense medium (air). That is, when the particle breaks out, it can coast a good distance. Bulk movement of the air can then take over in carrying it away. Probably why air movement helps evaporation?</p></div>		</li>
