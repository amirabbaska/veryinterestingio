			<div class="markdown"><p>The advantage of sexual dimorphism is the same advantage brought forth through any specialization within species. </p>
<p>Males save a great deal of energy by not having to produce eggs and nurture them to self-sufficiency. They can then use this energy for other things, like showing their sexual prowess (and thus their fitness to mate) and protecting their mates. Just look at humans for instance. A tribe of pregnant females is unlikely to survive on its own. </p>
<p>Another factor is the selfish gene theory. Simply put, it doesn't have to benefit everyone for the existence of males, it just has to benefit males. Not expending your energy/time to produce your own offspring is a direct benefit and so evolutionarily it makes sense for males to come about as opposed to hemaphrodites. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's an interesting point, and I suppose it also explains why not three or more sexes. A third sex would have no advantage over males.</p></div>		</li>
