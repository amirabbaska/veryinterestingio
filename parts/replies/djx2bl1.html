			<div class="markdown"><p>And of course, just because your bank allows you to use a 4-digit PIN doesn't mean you should.</p>
<p>Brute forcing isn't the only issue.  Peeking over-the-shoulder (often with a skimmer and a hidden camera) is a real threat.  With a 4-digit PIN, if the camera picks up 1 or 2 digits, brute-forcing your PIN is still very, very easy.  With a 7-digit PIN, there is a much greater chance that the skimmer will miss enough digits of your PIN to make brute-forcing impractical, as long as you always make a reasonable attempt to obscure your PIN entry.</p>
<p>It's less of a problem with chip-and-PIN since they can't just skim the card as easily, but there are so many swipe-only situations remaining in the USA that they could capture your PIN while you're using the chip and later correlate it with a captured swipe.  If you're paranoid.  Especially if you're being targeted specifically for identity theft, for some reason. So always try and obscure your PIN entry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with a known ciphertext hash you still would generally have 2^128 bits and generally a collision at 2^64 bits of &quot;entropy&quot;. If you can check 10^9/s, that's roughly 2^30, you'd still need 2^34 (8 billion seconds) to find a matching hash. That's incredibly long. Your password then needs at least as much &quot;entropy&quot; encoded in it as the hash, which for alphanumeric passwords of length n it's 36^n. which is roughly 2^5n. Meaning, roughly, if a computer can guess a 6-character password in a second, it will take half a minute for a 7 character alphanumeric password, 15 minutes for an 8 character, 7 and a half hours for a 9 character, which shoots up to years very quickly. Known ciphertext is not as fast as you think, and that doesn't include the extended symbols or capital letters on a keyboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Length is incredibly important to password strength. But most people use ~9-10 character passwords, which don't take <em>too</em> long to crack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why my passwords are all max length + max character sets allowed by the particular site, created using a password manager. Can't see a way to get more entropy than that... And the master password is a 30+ character sentence (not from any book, random like &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My password is always minimum 16, max 30. I use a base &quot;word-salad acronym&quot;, and then add symbols and  numbers that are dependent on running a simple algorithm against the site name. This results in long passwords, unique to every site, and yet incredibly easy for me to remember. Even if I return to a site I haven't visited in years, I can just stick the site name into my algorithm and get the password in seconds.</p>
<p>Even if a site was hacked, the hacker would only get the password to <em>that</em> site. You'd have to be targeting me in particular, and collect many examples of my passwords, in order to reverse engineer my algorithm - but if that's happening, I've got bigger problems.</p>
<p>The only problem are shit sites that don't allow 16, or special, characters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does including non-ASCII characters add to the entropy of a password of the same length? I never understood why Crypto people always advise against using brain wallets with phrases you make on your own. I understand that it is easy to check phrases and poems but how easy is it for a guessing program to guess &quot;חַיִים  生活 өмір حياة&quot; - which is the same word repeated in 4 languages?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you do it.  <code>$3cr3t p@@5w0rd</code> is only marginally more secure than <code>secret password</code> because modern cracking tools are clever enough to know common leet-speak substitutions like that.  Equally, putting an exclamation point at the end is worthless for the same reason.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a <em>truly random</em> special character (and by &quot;truly random&quot; I mean you rolled dice or something) will be more effective, at a cost of being harder to remember.  Overall, however, extra length has a bigger effect than extra character classes.</p>
<p>For the password you suggested, there are a few things to note.  For one, it's unicode, which has very inconsistent support in passwords.  This is double-edged because on one hand you'll have a hard time using it anywhere, but on the other hand most hackers won't bother trying unicode until more people start using it in passwords.  Two, it's made up of 4 dictionary words - more specifically the same dictionary word 4 times, just in different languages.  That adds a lot of length for a naive password cracker, but one smart enough to do multi-language dictionary attacks will probably find it after only a few billion iterations (which sounds like a lot but in reality can be done in minutes if the password hash is not a good one [and yes, real-life websites often don't have good ones]).</p>
<p>It's a significantly better password than most people have (if only because most people have passwords like &quot;hunter2&quot;), which may be enough to protect you.  Of course, it should go without saying that I mean the general category of passwords that look like that one -- since you posted &quot;חַיִים 生活 өмір حياة&quot; on the open internet, that specific password is now unsafe since a hacker could stuff it into their dictionary.  Personally, I'd suggest just using a password manager instead because they can make and use passwords far more complex than you could possibly remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it does, because a truly or CS random password would have a^n entropy, where a is the number of possible representations of an individual piece. Another way of thinking of it, is your password is a string represented in hexadecimal, the amount of unpredictability is considered the entropy. I'm not sure how most websites would handle non-ascii unicode. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easier than you might think, though it would be an outside guess that would require an idea that you're doing it.</p>
<p>Non-ASCII characters usually require more than one keypress per character. You have a 13-character (I think) password there, but if it takes three keypresses to make each one, you're better off making a 39-character password. This has the advantage of making most password crackers not work due to a technical limitation that caps max password length at 28 characters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this assumes people aren't using passwords like &quot;hunter2&quot;.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't hash it on your computer, the server hashes it on their end. If you hash it on your end, then that's the same as just having a plaintext password, albeit a weird looking one, in that a hacker who gets the database could use your hash to login.</p>
<p>If the server hashes it on their end, then even if the hacker knows your hash they'd still have to guess the password.</p>
<p>What you want is an encrypted connection so that someone doing a man-in-the-middle attack wouldn't be able to tell what you're sending to the server.</p></div>		</li>
