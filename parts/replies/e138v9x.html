			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. As someone who was a fan of the team (Hockey) before I started working the camera, I still get into the game, but the job comes first. If I'm on game camera, I do get to see the majority of the gameplay, but if, say I'm dedicated to the goalies, or doing a tight follow on the puck, you do miss stuff. </p>
<p>And it's not the same watching it through a monitor that's smaller than an iPad. It can be hard on the eyes to try following a tiny black puck on white ice for a whole game. </p></div>		</li>
