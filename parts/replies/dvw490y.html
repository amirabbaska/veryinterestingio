<p>Is that the case for stealth designs, too? Is noise simply not an issue at all at the ranges/speeds involved in typical stealth fighter operations?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, that is also the case with stealth fighters. Typically they're high enough that you wouldn't hear them anyway, but the stealth aspect only refers to them being designed in such a way that they reflect minimal RADAR radio waves making them appear much smaller on a scope (i.e flock of birds as opposed to an air craft), become harder to detect on RADAR, or simply don't show up on the scope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true.  The undergrad AIAA engine design competition a few years back was for an engine for a fighter/ trainer platform.  The winning design heavily stressed noise reduction features including mixing, chevron usage, and an acoustic liner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there are two factors at play:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can't fly (practically) faster than a jet engine's exhaust velocity. So in a fighter you want an engine that is capable of high exhaust velocity.</p>
</li>
<li>The closer the exhaust velocity is to the aircraft airspeed, the higher the propulsive efficiency. Meaning that if you have a low bypass turbofan flinging exhaust out at 1,000 MPH while you're flying at 500 MPH you're wasting a lot of fuel. A high bypass engine reduces the exhaust velocity because of the air being moved by the fan stage leading to exhaust velocities better suited to high-subsonic airliners.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the exhaust is coming out at 1,000 MPH, what would hold the aircraft to 500 MPH?</p>
<p>Or more generally: I would expect airspeed to be equal to exhaust speed - some coefficient of drag and momentum, which should reduce to a constant over time.</p>
<p>How far off am I?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, but you need to take the mass flow of the air into account.
Think of it like this: you can get the same reaction force by pushing a small object really fast (like firing a bullet) or a large object pretty slow (throwing a rock).</p>
<p>Commercial airplanes try to throw a LOT of air out the exhaust, but not too fast. This optimises for fuel economy.
Jet fighters need a higher top speed, so they are designed to throw less air VERY fast out of the exhaust.</p>
<p>The difference between the two is the bypass ratio - the ratio of air being pushed by a fan in the engine vs the air going through the combustion chamber. The larger this ratio, the more mass you're throwing (bigger rock), but the slower the mass is going. Higher bypass rario = better fuel efficiency, but lower top speed.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drag. You end up with a force coming out of engine that pushes the entire aircraft through the air. That force is more or less constant and will eventually reach equilibrium with drag and give you an airspeed. This airspeed is less than the exhaust gas velocity (or your engine is causing more drag than thrust- [for negligible pressure ratios])</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition: the lower-bypass engines work better at higher speeds, and sacrifice lower speed performance to get it. At low speeds, the lower-bypass engine doesn't really have enough air to work with, so it ends up with a higher than optimal exhaust speed, which uses more energy (fuel) to get the same thrust. But in return, it can keep producing useful thrust at higher speeds than a high-bypass engine can.</p>
<p>Commercial jets are carefully optimized for a very specific flight regime.</p></div>		</li>
