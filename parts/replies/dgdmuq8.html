			<div class="markdown"><p>Also of note, epsom salts, as you mentioned, are magnesium sulfate. This is used in medicine (in citrate form) as a laxative due to its osmotic action. It increases gastric motility and tonicity and therefore has an osmotic effect which pulls water into the colon and into the stool. </p>
<p>Moreover, magnesium has demonstrated a variety of other benefits such as improving and maintaining nervous and cardiac function, reducing blood pressure, regulating calcium in the blood and therefore bone density, along with a variety of other things. It can be given as mag sulfate via IV or IM or orally as mag oxide. </p>
<p>Magnesium is usually easily filtered out by a health kidney (be careful if you have kidney disease tho!) and has few side effects. It also is used to prevent seizure in pregnant women who have preeclampsia. </p>
<p>However, even tho lots of health blogs love to talk about how great it is, there is little scientific evidence for its use in a bath and topically. Small studies exist, but the results are not always consistent and as stated most of these studies are small which makes the results suspect as to generalizability. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fantastic! I wonder if if is through its effects on the nervous or the vascular tissue. I find migraine treatment to be very interesting as there is SUCH a variety in therapies. What form of magnesium supplements do you take? Have you ever gone for IV transfusion therapy? Many patients I've worked with go in for transfusions to treat their migraines. Do you have a neurologist who recommended it to you? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just meant routes for mag citrate, then mag citrate is generally only effective orally from what I understand. I wouldn't recommend IV, IM, or rectal at home, and I don't believe it is effective transdermally. It may have some benefits topically for things like cellulitis, but I doubt it. </p>
<p>If you were asking about different forms of magnesium, it depends on why you want to take it, and what you're comparing it to. There are actually many different forms of magnesium available, and each one has its own marketing to wade through. Mag citrate is best as a laxative in my experience. It has other uses, but due to its low absorption rate it's not great for supplementation. Same with magnesium oxide, which is also the active ingredient in milk of magnesia, which is another laxative. Why do you want to use magnesium? Talk to your doctor before you supplement long term with anything. While having normal blood values is important, long term inclusion of supplements in your diet could create problems like bowel stones, kidney stones, nervous problems, and other issues. If your blood values for magnesium are normal, you probably don't need more. Besides, obtaining it from eating foods like brown rice and calciferous vegetables is better for you and more affordable. Instead of investing in vitamins and supplements, take that money and invest in healthy and well-sourced fruits and vegetables. </p>
<p>Here's a good article to read about different types of magnesium. Not that I'm endorsing any one over the other. And always be CAREFUL of anything that's supposed to &quot;quickly absorb&quot; or has &quot;high concentrations&quot; because both of those things can lead to stronger and more severe side effects. Thanks for the question! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be risky for the skin to allow free passage of ions, I mean that really runs counter to the skin's physiological function if you think about it. But an epsom salt soak is hypertonic, which may cause local deformation of the membranes, and obviously there'd be a huge concentration gradient favoring MgÂ²+ entry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - but obviously there are sensory nerve endings there, v small ones. In this study, magnesium inhibited norepinehprine release in rats, by blocking calcium channels, authors think </p>

<p>i guess it was delivered to the rats orally or by injection, but the calcium blocking happened in a petri dish</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Magnesium salts are well-known to relax muscles and cause vasodilation independent of nitric oxide. It is also a laxative. Two tablespoons of epsom salts was used by old biologists as a nuclear option in wiping the intestines of microbes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, homeopathic medicine uses the same style of advertising that older cures do. While we both agree that magnesium salts are capable of being useful it is still right for someone to want to know why they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be quite honest, it's the purported mechanism which would supposedly get magnesium <em>across the skin</em> into the bloodstream in therapeutically significant amounts which has me skeptical. And within about 10 minutes, no less...</p>

<p>&quot;This Epsom salt sure helps my sore muscles, I'll just use a LOT of it on my calf muscle infarction.&quot; Extreme and stupid example? Sure. But people do extreme and stupid stuff with homeopathy and other &quot;cures&quot; that solely utilize placebo to bolster their efficacy. </p></div>		</li>
