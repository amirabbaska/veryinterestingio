			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group" target="_blank">special unitary group</a>. Essentially it's a generalization of the group of rotation operations, which is the special orthogonal group (i.e. all matrices *in O(n)* with determinant +1). The field would be Lie algebra, which is the study of symmetries </p>
<p>Edit: clarify that SO is a subset of O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the mathematics concept that maps to how particles behave.<br />
It's not that SU(3) was created for physics so-much-as mathematicians have explored every nook and cranny they can and out of the vastness of what is known today SU(3) happens to fit well.  </p>
<p>Loosely speaking, a group is a set of things (often numbers, in this case particles) that can be reached using some set of operations. An easy example is something like the set of integers modulus 5. That forms a group of {0,1,2,3,4,5}. If you had a 6 it would become 0 so &gt;6 is not part of the set.  Then let's say the only operation you could do on it is +1. No +2, no -1 allowed. You can start from any number in the group and get to any other number in the group with +1.  (5+1 % 5 = 0). That starts to define the minimum of what you (might) need to define a group. When they developed Group Theory they figured out all of the necessary and sufficient requirements. Group theory lays out what you automatically know about a set if you can prove it's a group. There are many variations with ever increasing requirements and if you can meet those requirements then you know more about the set. One example is associative; 2+1=1+2. It's intuitive for integers but matrices, for example, are not associative which is probably why so many people are saying Linear Algebra is where they were exposed to it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group" target="_blank">The SU groups have a bunch of extra requirements.</a></p>
<p>I presume when physicist started doing collider experiments they started figuring out what transitions can happen and which transitions cannot happen. The picture was incomplete but it started to settle in on the form of SU3 which names a generation of the SU groups.  </p>
<p>SU(1) ~= {1}<br />
SU(2) ~= quaternions (&quot;3D imaginary numbers&quot; sometimes used to represent rotations in 3D graphics)<br />
SU(3) ~= particle physics up to chromodynamics (which means electromagnetism, weak, and strong forces modeled)<br />
Theories out there use higher-order SU to try to pull in gravity.  </p>
<p>An actual physicist will have to correct me but I presume that because particle states are quantum they are mapped onto either a unit-circle/unit-sphere/unit-hypersphere at equal spacings (like slicing a pie into equal pieces or placing candles along the edge evenly spread out) and those are the members of their SU3 set and the operations on that set are the sub-atomic transmutative transitions (e.g. Feynman diagrams).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, that is helpful, indeed. However, I don't get the crucial part of KDN's answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solving the eigenvalue problem for the spin operator S gives eigenvalues of Sz=±ℏ,0, where the normalized eigenvectors, given in cartesian notation, correspond to eigenvectors (1,+/-i,0)/sqrt(2) for ±ℏ and (0,0,1) (for 0).
The first two eigenvectors represent propagating right- and left-circularly polarized photons. The third eigenvector represents a non-propagating field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I understand the eigenvalue problem and how to solve it, but it's unclear to me why the (0,0,1) represents a non-propagating field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An eigenvector of a matrix is a vector which, when multiplied by the matrix, results in a constant multiple of that vector. The constant is the eigenvalue.</p>
<p>In more conceptual terms, the &quot;direction&quot; of the vector is preserved under the transformation represented by the matrix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a transformation, an eigenvector is a vector whose direction(*) is not changed by the transformation. An eigenvalue is how much the eigenvector's magnitude is changed by the transformation.</p>
<p>Example - in 3-D space, a rotation has eigenvectors that lie in the axis of rotation, and the corresponding eigenvalues are all 1  (rotation does not magnify or shrink).</p>
<p>Sometimes when a math course introduces these topics they do it in the context of a matrix, this is because a matrix can represent a linear transformation.</p>
<p>(*) I'm counting a reversal of direction as being &quot;same direction with negative magnitude&quot; here.</p></div>		</li>
