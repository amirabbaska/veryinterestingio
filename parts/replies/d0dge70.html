			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could have been in the room when whoever designed the experiment presented the idea to his/her committee chair or boss. </p>
<p>&quot;So I'm going to set out to test out possible locomotion mechanics of dinosaurs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how are you proposing to do this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to pluck the ass of a chicken and stick a plunger to it.&quot;</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, this is an interesting study. Got any more info or links on it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is the article linked in the video's description.</p>
<p>To get more similar info, look up &quot;biological locomotion dinosaur&quot; into various databases and it should give you a running start. Hit up the references within studies to expand out from there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the tail would give them a completely different center of balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The position of the tail would shift the center of mass a bit. I understand that is a subjective statement, but from the standpoint of somebody who studies animal locomotion for a living I would say that the differences in movement that a shift of the center of mass of that magnitude are nuanced, but not radical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm looking at the video that was linked and it seems that the steps are the same length (press 2 and 7 during video to switch back and forth). The leg is closer to straight instead of more movement from the knee. But it looks like the shaved more of the down from the leg so its harder to see the thigh in the regular chicken.</p>
<p>This (non-scientific) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/mar/20/did-losing-their-tails-make-birds-cock-o-the-walk" target="_blank">article</a> is about the research being done in the video. What's your take on it, as a locomotion person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vivian Allen is legit--she knows more about bird/dino locomotion so I would trust her take on the study (and she liked it). I really appreciate how she doesn't sensationalize it (T REX WALKED LIKE THIS CHICKEN WITH A PLUNGER ON ITS BUTT), while firmly underscoring its importance. 10/10 would recommend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the results from that paper wind up being that in the experimental group the thigh is held more vertical, but the shank is held more horizontal, and the ankle flexes more, possibly to maintain a similar contact angle for the metatarsus with the ground. </p>
<p>/u/providang is right that the research is interesting, and it's worth noting that it's even more interesting in the context of this earlier paper: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Search&amp;doptcmdl=Citation&amp;defaultField=Title%20Word&amp;term=Carrano[author]%20AND%20Experimental%20alteration%20of%20limb%20posture%20in%20the%20chicken%20%28Gallus%20gallus%29%20and%20its%20bearing%20on%20the%20use%20of%20birds%20as%20analogs%20for%20dinosaur%20locomotion" target="_blank">Carrano and Biewener  1999</a> which attempted a similar experiment, adding weight to the tail of birds with the expectation that they might walk more like theropods. Bizarrely, the birds did the opposite of what was expected, and walked with femora held more horizontal. This was pretty weird, so it's great that other researchers repeated the experiment. It was published in PLOS One so it's open access to anybody who wants to read it:<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088458#pone.0088458-Carrano1" target="_blank">Grossi et al. 2014</a></p>
<p>P.S. Vivian is male. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much of the defining movement of a chicken, is about stabilizing it's eyes.  Since the eyes cannot move very much, the head is kept stationary relative to the ground or whatever it is tracking, while the body moves forward.  Then the head jerks forward to catch up in a rapid movement, giving the chicken long periods of stable vision while moving.</p>
<p>Since dinosaurs probably had much better eye movement capabilities, they probably wouldn't head bob as much or at all.</p></div>		</li>
