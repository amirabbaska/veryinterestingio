			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you can say that it's a hormone because it's transported in the bloodstream and binds to intracellular receptors. But on the other hands, it's not a hormone because it's not secreted by endocrine glands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hormones can be made by endocrine cells in organs. For example, atrial natriuretic peptide is made in the heart (it's a diuretic hormone that will lower blood volume/pressure). For the case of vitamin D, the skin turns a precursor molecule into vitamin D3, which is then modified by the liver and kidney to make calcitriol, which is a hormone helps with calcium absorption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, d1 is ergocalciferol, plant based, and d2 is cholecalciferol, which is animal based.  Once they are in the body, they go through a major change in order to be used properly.  The first step is they get changed into d3.  Sorry but we did not go into detail with these steps in my nutrition courses so I don't remember the names of each step.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it turns out that most Americans are deficient in vitamin D. The benefits of reasonable (not excessive) sun exposure generating vitamin D far outweigh the risks of skin cancer. Sun block for a long time only blocked UVB wavelengths (the good kind that helps with VitD and triggers release of melanin to protect cells) and let UVA through (the kind that gives the bad kind of skin cancer). To this day there’s no standard for UVA blocking in sunscreen so you can’t easily compare quality of broad spectrum sunscreen :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Live Florida and golf 2-3 times per week. Usually forego sunscreen on my legs (not upper body) and therefore have a wicked golf tan (telltale white feet aka Florida feet) so I know I get plenty of sun. Way more than most people. </p>
<p>Still deficient. I have to supplement to get my level up. I test it 2x year. </p></div>		</li>
