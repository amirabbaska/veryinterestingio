			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. I used to be able to do that when I was young. Jump in the pool.. Clear vision. Didn't know what the big deal was when everyone else was using goggles. Can't do it any more though. Stupid growing up :-(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, same here. I had goggles, but it was always more fun to just go without them. Until you try to close your eyes after a few hours of being in the pool....Good lord, the burning...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water you were in was all P, no h. </p>
<p>South Park jokes aside, the stronger you can smell chlorine, the more the agents are having to work. This is why public pools smell so heavily is from the amount of, erm, contaminates, are in the water. </p></div>		</li>

<p>TIL apparently me being able to see underwater without issue is not common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm practically blind without my glasses, so I actually only wore goggles for the chlorine.</p>
<p>Chlorine is relatively bad for your eyes whether you can see or not so goggles are still very useful, especially in public pools that deal with young swimmers all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. My vision has always been as clear as the water. Some water burns more than other, so I figured others' eyes were more sensitive to the chemicals and burned more.</p>
<p>Thanks for being &quot;that person&quot; with me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL only a small number of children possess the ability to see clearly underwater.</p>
<p>I've worn glasses since I was 11 and had severely near sighted vision for far longer. Since I was around 6. The world's always been blurry, and I just stupidly assumed people with 20/20 can see fine underwater. -.-</p></div>		</li>
