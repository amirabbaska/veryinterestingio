			<div class="markdown"><p>To be completely pedantic, a circle always is perfect. A rendering of a circle can be represented as an infinitely sided polygon, but a geometric circle is the set of points a given distance from a central point. You can represent it by connecting those points in an arrangement, but that is not a circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more precise, a set of all points that are a given distance away from the central one. If we omit the all, then i can take three points and have a triangle. </p>
<p>Also, no need to connect them, since they are infinitely close to eachother</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Sorry to break your bubble, but an atom does not physically exist as a circle. An atom is mostly empty air with electrons rotating really fast around a cluster of neutrons and protons which are jammed together tightly. The electrons, neutrons and protons can further be broken down. Us humans like to represent these things as circles because they're easier to imagine.</del></p>
<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure I'm can't read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to really trip you out.. at subatomic scale, (i.e. photons) things begin to behave like particles and waves simultaneously. I would consider this to be the breakdown of geometry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Understood, but what about the (not-sub)atomic scale?  Is a real-world example of a circle truly possible?</p></div>		</li>
