			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that not everyone gets to go to university. You have to prepare and take rather hefty exams to get in so it's not like it's an open door for anyone. I also know that they limit majors based on job availability - so for example a friend of mine wanted to study set design and it was really competitive because the school she wanted to get into only accepted about 5 kids per year. They didn't want to graduate 30 people if 25 of them wouldn't be able to fine work afterwards.</p>
<p>In America you are given endless possibilities to those who can pay. In Europe they offer some possibilities to those who test well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very important to note. I spent a year as an exchange student in Wisconsin and this was one of the most common misconseoptions people seemed to have reagarding the funding of schooling. A huge argument often was that &quot;then slackers can just ride the same schools as the hustlers and reach the same paygrade in the end&quot; which I believe very much isn't true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. They're notorious in Asian countries, where kids spend a whole childhood getting ready for the exam as it determines whether or not they even go to college</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same goes in Brazil. They have a whole system of tutoring/prep schools that hopeful students pay a lot of money to prep for an exam that will determine which school they will get into. The students have to go to each university and take an entrance exam. My friend drove to 7 different cities to take exams. He passed in two. He cried when he found out he passed; because, his father and mother spent all their meager savings to help him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this is true for a lot of countries in Europe, but my country doesn't have entrance exams and doesn't take high school grades into account. Of course, only the people who are smart and willing to work will complete a university degree, but anyone can try as long as they graduated high school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like college is actually difficult in your country. In the US, for certain majors, as long as you aren't a total idiot you'll pass your bullshit classes and graduate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crazy part is.
You won't find many Americans that say education is bad or useless. Most would say it is very good if American education wasnt the following (</p>
<p>Bad at generating jobs</p>
<p>Misleading in major studies that lead to jobs</p>
<p>Very very radical in some states in the information that is learned in public school especially elementary and junior highschool</p>
<p>Wasteful because we blow so much money on pointlessly dangerous extracurricular activities (looking at you football, basketbal, and any other sportball per name. </p>
<p>If the money we spent on football went to education salaries instead of new stadiums every 8 years. (Usually millions of dollars)</p>
<p>If our teachers were inspired by money other than just a hero complex</p>
<p>If we had better assimilation programs.</p>
<p>If we focused on learning material instead of methods of passing standardized tests.</p>
<p>If school funding was given by post highschool student achievement ratios versus how they did on a test designed by and for the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>If no child Left behind didn't handicap teachers by stripping the power of local administrators (I hear this alot. But nobody has explained it to me)</p>
<p>If colleges didn't sell themselves as a product but rather established themselves as a knowledgeable institution that contributes to society.</p>
<p>If professors could make better money from publications by having the hosted on the public web vs behind dumbass paywalls. (Contraversial topic I don't know about also)</p>
<p>The list goes on and on. </p>
<p>From my personal perspective. Every citizen feels like education should be our focus but we don't have enough passion and or people in our government to get the job done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A small detail in difference in financing education and what's being done with money between the US/Europe is that the US universities are simply extremely rich. They got billions some cases tens of billions a year to spend opposed to my own for example a T100 still but only a budget of half a billion a year.</p>
<p>The consequence of this is that we can't build these fancy facilities. Or it becomes more complicated. Again my own university attracted a top neuro surgeon and it cost them roughly 50 million in getting the right equipment (some super high end scanners + the building itself). The professor same story is capped they earn maximum 165.000 euro/year (some flexibility is in there though) but professors in the US can earn far more.</p>
<p>These differences in funding have big effect on university rankings though as they partially take in account how much is being spend on professors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American Universities aren't &quot;simply rich&quot;, they got rich by charging high tuitions costs. If European universities charged more they could get rich too, and build the fanciest facilities and pay higher salaries for professors, but they have chosen not to go that route. </p></div>		</li>
