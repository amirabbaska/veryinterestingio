			<div class="markdown"><p>man the dreams are freaky stuff aint they?</p>
<p>I stopped at new year so still well into the throws of them, never had actual trouble sleeping, have a natural talent for nesting if I am honest lol but the dreams are just insane, not scary or nightmarish in the whole, but so so vivid.</p>
<p>I think its maybe because when you are on it you don't remember many dreams and when you stop its like a rebounce and you aint used to is.</p>
<p>does it fade? or will it go on for a while, I was on it for like 16 years so its all new to me</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've read somewhere that there is a part of normal sleep that is overstepped when you smoke regularly (was it REM? not sure)  - and when you quit your brain catches up and it manifests itself as very real dreams. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good job man ! I am a weekend smoker, recently started smoking daily, and i just don't like it that much, gets boring and all relaxation effects (even for good indicas) is not that good. I ended up frustrated and having done nothing for myself. </p>
<p>So now i am cutting back, it's not that easy though, as the thought is always there. I noticed that if i plan things to do and stick with them -  i don't have the call for a smoke. I try to do my job better, things around the house that needed fixing for months etc. </p></div>		</li>
