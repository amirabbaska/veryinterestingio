			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking the top comment, microwaves actually create <em>less</em> harmful chemicals than most other cooking methods.  Any cooking method that creates char or browning (grilling, frying, searing, and even baking) creates carcinogens.  Microwaving has a hard time creating char because it primarily boils the water in the food and boiling water tends to top out at a relatively cool 212F.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never tried cooking bacon in the microwave? The fat gets hot enough for maillard. </p>
<p>Anyway, why would microwaving be less tasty than boiling in water? Boiling isn't hot enough for maillard (unless you use a pressure cooker), and you'll wash away flavor in the water as well. That makes boiling less tasty than microwaving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear the term &quot;maillard&quot; often in regards to brewing as it is what takes place in the malting process of barley. Does this mean that the dark malted grains (roasted barley, chocolate malt, etc.) have higher levels of carcinogens than lightly malted grains?</p>
<p>So are stouts and porters giving me cancer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True to an extent, but more accurate to say microwaves agitate the molecules of any liquid, not just water. So if it gets fats to melt, even a bit, it'll heat those up to well over the boiling point of water (melting the rest of the fat in a chain reaction of heating).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However microwaves can be bad if you are microwaving something in a plastic container, as it can break the bonds in the plastic and release it in your food. This is also why pasta sauce will stain plastic bowls because the pores open up in the plastic, trapping some sauce in the plastic when it cools back down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, putting the same plastic on a grill or fying pan will also cause melting, and should be avoided. Just don't heat up plastic unless you know it's absolutely safe, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a myth that there's any special correspondence between microwave radiation and water molecules.  Water molecules are 0.3nm across, and microwave ovens use wavelengths of ~10cm.  If you put something like a bowl of oil in there with no water whatsoever, it will still heat up just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water isnt unique but hydroxyl groups have a large, strong absorption band in the microwave regime which makes water heat faster in a microwave than many other substances. Consequently fats and oils also heat rather well. However you can choose substances that will be &quot;microwave safe&quot; and not have strong absorptive features in the microwave and won't get hot nearly as quickly as your food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwave send out electromagnetic waves yes, but they cause the water molecules to &quot;rotate&quot;, witch actually creates the energy.
If you put a large dry plate in the microwave with only a small portion of food in the middle, the plate won't heat up, only the food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a correspondence, but the peak isn't at 2.45 GHz. For 100 C water, the peak absorption is around 9 GHz (and over 100 GHz for 0 C). There's an explanation <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/microwave_water.html#loss" target="_blank">here</a>. Basically, a less ideal frequency is used so that it penetrates the water, and doesn't just boil off the outermost layer of water.</p>
<p>In any case, it doesn't have to be exactly right, which is why it does fine heating oil too.</p></div>		</li>
