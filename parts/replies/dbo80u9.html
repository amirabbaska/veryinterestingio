			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think a lack of abortion was causing maternal mortality. In every case delivering by c-section is safer, faster and gives the child a chance. In order to preform a later term abortion the patient needs 3 days prep time to dilate, there is NEVER a case where you have this amount of time of emergency interventions to pregnancy. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an anti-abortion website and full of misinformation, hyperbole, and straight up lies (sad that the website is called abortions facts when it's filled with anything but). Also it's really unclear what you mean by &quot;delivering by c-section is safer and faster.&quot; Are you just talking third-trimester abortions? Because abortion is must safer than carrying and delivering a baby, but that's also in part due to the fact that 91% of abortions occur in the first 13 weeks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planned parenthood is and was performing a lot of womens' health medical stuff, stuff like pap smears and prenatal care and contraception until a woman is ready to have a child (and not get STIs) and so on.  This stuff results in happy, healthy moms and babies - by targeting clinics politicians have caused entirely predictable maternal deaths.</p>
<p>Deaths you expect when you withhold medical care, and deaths you don't normally see in developed countries. The steps we can take to prevent these deaths are political.</p></div>		</li>
