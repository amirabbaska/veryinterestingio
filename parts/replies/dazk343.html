			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you may be confusing a shark's sense of smell with its sense of electroreception. As a form of information, smell spreads as quickly as its molecules move through water. Electricity spreads instantaneously no matter the distance between transmitter and receiver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same way as anything dilutes in another substance. Put a droplet of ink or squash into a beaker of water and watch how it moves around. It's not instant. The moment blood enters the water it still has to travel to the sharks nose. But particles are very very small and there's a lot of them even in a small drop, eventually with the tides and currents a small amount of these particles will have spread far enough for the shark to be able to smell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only answer from a fisherman's perspective, but I think a lot of the &quot;how fast&quot; factor is just your perception.  The blood can only disperse as fast as the water it is in.  The speed is more about realizing that sharks are probably not as far away as you thought they were to begin with.  If I can get a chum line going and have multiple sharks on hooks in 5 minutes(easier than you might think.. in many places that people swim), that's because they were nearby.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>sharks have a very sensitive olfactory system that can detect these stray blood particles in extremely dilute circumstances</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this is the part he's asking about, how the sharks' sensing system is so good</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in that case I can only tell you what I know about dogs noses and hope it extends to sharks also.</p>
<p>Our olfactory system is essentially a large particle detector, and a particle detector works best when It has a large surface area, a dogs nose on the inside looks more like a labyrinth of tubes that air passes through, with many time more surface area than ours has thus is able to detect more with it.</p>
<p>There's also their having a wet nose, this stimulates the air entering their nose and makes it easier to smell.</p></div>		</li>
