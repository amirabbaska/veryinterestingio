			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess they don't need very much oxygen while in that state! It's actually a problem here in New Mexico because some threatened species like to dig so far into the ground that they get trapped underneath concrete foundations that are being laid in their habitats. I don't think it's well understood how they can sense rain, and how they &quot;know&quot; a good rain...they don't always come up.</p></div>		</li>
