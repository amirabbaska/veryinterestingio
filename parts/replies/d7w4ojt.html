<p>Very true, and thanks for making that clearer.  No matter what you do, it all ends up as heat.  The battery and generator are just a way to take a small portion of it, and delay it until later.</p>

<p>Yeesh... I can't even imagine.  Three competitive cyclists would be dumping something like five kilowatts as heat.  Roughly 17,000 BTU if you want to put it in the terms of the heating industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the room overheat, or would they overheat due to exertion in a closed space? For instance, if there was another person in the room just sitting still, would they perceive the room to be overheated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both.  Yes, a bystander would perceive it to be hot.  Not as hot as those working out, who would want the room cooler than someone sitting on the couch would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a really good question. Obviously the human body can produce a varying amount of heat, so that's not a help.</p>
<p>But as for the makers of the heaters targeting a specific wattage to the human body? Probably unlikely. It probably was based off of heating a genericly sized room to an arbitrary temperature given a certain amount of heat leaving the room. </p>
<p>Best guess: coincidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it's much more practical than that.  A standard household circuit can supply about 1200W before the breaker trips, so unless nothing else is on the circuit a heater bigger than 500W is going to have you going to the breaker box all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, of you want to have the energy released in a very specific spot, or at a certain time (or both, for example in a heating blanket while you're sleeping) charging a battery while heating your room may still be an option you want to consider.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a gaming computer, you could use that instead of a space heater. Things like folding@home are very good at making your computer use as much power as possible, and still produce useful results, something a space heater just can't do. Also, literally anything is a more efficient space heater than a space heater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very true.  If you want to double up, you can play <a href="http://zwift.com/" target="_blank">zwift</a> in front of your gaming PC, so you can bike while you bike and heat while you heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an inverter is inefficient, it's because some of the energy gets converted to heat instead of AC, so it wouldn't matter very much.</p></div>		</li>
