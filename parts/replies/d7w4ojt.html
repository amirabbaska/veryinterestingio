			<p>That's an interesting concept. If you're eating healthy then that 500 watts of heat is likely more expensive than if you got it off the grid. A fully charged car battery contains as much energy as a sandwich. You could likely fill a battery for a couple of cents. Sandwiches are slightly more expensive. Of course you don't get healthy exercise heating your room with a space heater, so there's that. <br><br>Edit: a gallon of gas contains 31,000 calories. A gallon of milk contains 1600.

			<p>Its amazing how our bodies can run on so many different things, as long as it is digestable, has nutrients, and isnt poisonous. Whereas machines have to have one specific power source like gasoline, diesel, coal, or electricity etc. It reminds me of Doc Brown shoving garbage into the Mr. Fusion to power the Delorean.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's an interesting idea, though. We don't actually have to be able to digest something as long as we can house bacteria which can break it down into digestible products. There's a lot of research being done on fecal cultures now, maybe at some point in the future someone will figure out how to introduce bacteria that can help us digest crazy things. Then we can all live on a risk-free diet of Haribo sugar-free gummy bears.</p>		</li>

			<p>They should probably just not grow humans as a power source-- we're pretty inefficient, and we need some really specific food items.

			<p>That's actually a really good question. Obviously the human body can produce a varying amount of heat, so that's not a help.<br><br>But as for the makers of the heaters targeting a specific wattage to the human body? Probably unlikely. It probably was based off of heating a genericly sized room to an arbitrary temperature given a certain amount of heat leaving the room. <br><br>Best guess: coincidence.</p>		</li>

			<p>I suspect it's much more practical than that.  A standard household circuit can supply about 1200W before the breaker trips, so unless nothing else is on the circuit a heater bigger than 500W is going to have you going to the breaker box all the time.</p>		</li>

			<p>What woosy circuits you have in the US. In the UK a plug circuit will take 7200 watts before the breaker trips, and individual plugs are fused at 3100watts. Very common to have 3kw plug in heaters.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup. this. Its basically how much power a set of heating elements pulls at 120V. You cant really get higher than that without pulling more amps than most consumer grade home circuts can handle</p>		</li>

			<p>Standard outlets are rated for 15 amps, and usually have a matching breaker. So as long as there wasn't an initial surge you could run an 1800 watt heater if it was the only thing on the circuit. Standard heater runs at 1500 watts.<br><br>edit: added link to random 1500w heaters. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/c/kp/1500w-heaters" target="_blank">https://www.walmart.com/c/kp/1500w-heaters</a></p>		</li>

			<p>That being said, of you want to have the energy released in a very specific spot, or at a certain time (or both, for example in a heating blanket while you're sleeping) charging a battery while heating your room may still be an option you want to consider.<br><br>Also, if you have a gaming computer, you could use that instead of a space heater. Things like folding@home are very good at making your computer use as much power as possible, and still produce useful results, something a space heater just can't do.
