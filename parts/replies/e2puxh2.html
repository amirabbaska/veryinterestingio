			<div class="markdown"><p>I said the next lecture was on Gate Control! But since you asked....   </p>
<p>Strokes are semi-diagnosed by a layperson using the FAST acronym. Anyone interested can and should learn this.    </p>
<p>F: Face. Ask them to smile. One side of the face is poorly controlled, the other relatively normal.  </p>
<p>A: Arms. Ask them to lift both arms in front of them, and test their strength. One arm is extremely weak, the other normal or near normal  </p>
<p>S. Speech. Ask them to speak. It will be slurred.  </p>
<p>T. Time. Note the time you did the assessment and call 911 and/or go to the nearest Emergency Services.  Be sure to record the time to tell emergency services!</p>
<p>There is NOTHING you can do for stroke. Stroke tends to be assymmetric. They can be ischemic or hemorrhagic. For a hemorrhagic, only the neuro-intensive care unit can help. But for ischemic strokes, there are time sensitive things you can do so it is essential to get to emergency services and a local stroke care unit as rapidly as possible.   </p>
<p>Temporary pins and needles sensations can occur with transient ischemia, but is not restricted to the zone of one nerve or nerve root. They tend to be more &quot;one side of the body&quot;, and they are a stroke warning sign that should be checked out. A real stroke, however, doesn't come and go, it comes and stays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the information. It is good for everyone to be able to be aware of FAST. </p>
<p>What I was wondering though was about persistent tingling that happens after a stroke has occurred in the past. (In the case I was thinking of, the stroke happened four years ago, and the tingling pain is on the left side of the body, as the stroke was located in the right side of the brain.) Since the tingling doesn't happen from nerve compression in the area where it is felt, I was curious as to how that works. </p>
<p>I apologise for my lack of clarity. I'm largely uneducated and I only started college last year at the age of 52. After the stroke I find it difficult to express myself properly on occasion. Thanks again for your kind and thoughtful response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweet, an answer that actually gets into mechanisms!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, when there is pressure on a nerve, you lose light touch and proprioception, and you retain crude touch, thermal sensation, and pain. <strong>This results in</strong> the paresthesias feeling people report as numbness and tingling, or pins and needles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there more to say about this part? I'd be interested (in anything that I could actually follow), but I'm guessing the devil is in the interactions (and maybe cerebral processing?), and that it might be similar to the thermal grill illusion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_grill_illusion" target="_blank">TGI</a>), aka why hot/warm water can feel like scalding hot water to cold hands/feet/anything: what we do know is complicated, and it's still incomplete.</p>
<hr />
<p>At least that was the case last time I looked into TGI. Just searched and turned up a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24635-1" target="_blank">2018 paper</a> that &quot;investigated whether the TGI percept originates spinally or centrally.&quot; Which suggests that there is, in fact, still no comprehensive consensus answer. And the dominant explanation given by that paper gives a sense of the complexity of these things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TGI has been traditionally explained by the unmasking of the activity of polymodal nociceptive lamina I spinothalamic neurons (Heat – Pinch – Cold, HPC, nociceptors) due to a reduction of the inhibition supplied by thermoceptive neurons that normally code for cold temperature (Fig. 1). The reduced activity in the cold pathway is caused, in turn, by spatial summation of neurons coding warmth, which inhibit neurons coding cold. The consequent enhancement of afferent signaling by HPC neurons would produce the burning pain sensation. The sensation of burning pain that characterizes the TGI can be quantified as a subjective overestimation of the temperature of the cold stimuli within the grill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also their conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>our results provide further evidence against a spinal mechanism generating the afferent input producing the TGI, and indicate that the burning sensation of the TGI is consequent to supraspinal interactions between thermoceptive and nociceptive systems</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, here is where we get into the Gate Control theory. In the spinal cord, large diameter fiber input masks small diameter fibers. So, when you compress a nerve, you unmask the small diameter activity, and you can perceive them. Certainly this mechanism is at least part of the pins and needles sensation. Google &quot;Gate Control theory&quot;. </p>
<p>A comparable interaction for thermal sensations probably also exists and leads to the thermal grill illusion, but, as you note, the circuits are not worked out as well.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I feel like this is the crucial/tricky bit when getting into phenomenology: these systems are extremely complex, and it's very difficult to offer up the <em>sufficient</em> conditions (which is, I think, what people really want to know).</p>
<hr />
<p>That Ferrè et al. paper I linked might be more than analogously relevant here: They frame their experiment in terms of Gate Control Theory (mentioning that its &quot;implementation remains controversial&quot;), in the end characterizing their evidence as being <em>against</em> TGI being a spinal mechanism and favoring TGI being a supraspinal mechanism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the question whether the cold-nociceptive interaction occurs spinally or supraspinally, or both, remains unresolved. <strong>Here we address this question using the physiological concept of tactile-nociceptive gate control</strong>4. Gate control postulates a basic, powerful mechanism through which pain is generated and controlled. While <strong>the detailed implementation remains controversial</strong>4, <strong>the core finding, namely that touch can powerfully inhibit nociception at spinal levels, is widely accepted</strong>5,6, and recent animal studies have identified the specific cellular mechanisms that open and close the “gate”7. On the basis of this postulate we explored whether the nociceptive signaling in TGI arises at spinal or cortical levels by contrasting the intensity of the TGI percept when concurrent non-nociceptive somatosensory stimulation either is or is not present. <strong>If TGI originates at spinal levels, for example by activation of lamina I HPC nociceptive neurons8, then it seems likely that, like other nociceptive signals in the spinal cord, it should be reduced by concurrent non-nociceptive input. Conversely, finding no effect of tactile input on TGI would cast doubt on the involvement of spinal nociceptive signaling in TGI, and point instead to supraspinal interactions between thermoceptive and nociceptive systems.</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The relative importance of spinal and supraspinal mechanisms remains controversial, but recent studies of radiant heat pain perception in humans confirm that <strong>an important spinal component exists</strong>5,6. However, <strong>our finding of no tactile effect suggests that the signals underlying the TGI are largely spared from the effects of tactile interactions at all levels.</strong></p>
