			<div class="markdown"><p>To remain perpendicular to the earth's surface, the top of the building would have to be moving faster than the base of the building (and you with it). You would maintain the increased horizontal velocity as you fell, meaning you'd be traveling eastward progressively faster than the building at your current altitude. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the same token, when you jump you have a horizontal velocity to match the size and speed of the earth's rotation, while briefly ascending to a higher altitude. At that higher altitude, your (conserved) linear velocity corresponds to a slower angular velocity, meaning that the earth briefly has a higher angular velocity than you do, and that therefore you will drift ever-so-slightly west.</p>
<p>This becomes actually-significant when you get to the point where you're Blue Origin launching rockets 100 km &quot;straight up&quot;. They end up having their landing pad off to the west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the top you are moving to the East faster than the ground.  When you fall you keep moving at the same speed but the shaft around you is slower.  So you move East relative to the ground.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't a getting closer to the centre cause a small diameter to travel ratio relative to the speed, making it the same? </p>
<p>Sorry I dont physics so that may not make any actual sense..... closer to centre =smaller diameter=same relative speed and distance covered </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Objects traveling in a circle accelerate towards the center of that circle. A point on earth is traveling around a circle parallel to the equator, and the center of that circle is a point on the axis of rotation, so it accelerates toward the axis.</p></div>		</li>
