			<div class="markdown"><p>My first day at my former job I fell down the stairs, hit my shin on a step and ended up with a bump the size of an ostrich egg for weeks. Then on day the lump was gone and my ankle turned blue. The bruise travelled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, shin injuries are generally bad pain-wise because there's not much fatty tissue to absorb the impact, or something along those lines. For instance:</p>
<p>I slipped while on a boat and got my shin stuck between some stuff while the rest of my body was unsupported (that section of my leg was holding my entire body weight during and after the fall, so that's a lot of force on such a small area). </p>
<p>I thought I was fine for about 30 seconds and then almost the entirety of my shin started bruising and the part where my shin was stuck (the leverage point) swelled up bigger than a golf ball. And the pain... I've been in a couple car accidents, had some bad injuries, have back pain/sciatica (with shooting pains in my groin area). None of that compared to the level of pain I experienced then when I fucked up my leg. It felt like my whole lower leg was being ripped apart. </p>
<p>This was 4ish years ago and I still have a dent on that part of my shin and a scar that starts a few inches below my knew and goes almost all the way down to my ankle.  Doctor told me it was some sort of (hairline?) fracture plus a nice bone contusion (or whatever happens when you &quot;bruise&quot; the bone marrow), loaded me up with pain meds because I still had work to do and told me to rest it as much as possible and give it heat/cold treatment often.</p>
<p>Lessons learned: don't trust your coworkers to do their jobs correctly or stow gear correctly, don't be careless on boats (or anything with heavy machinery, equipment, slick surfaces), and don't work to the detriment of your health. Especially the last one. Work paid for my medical expenses but I worked myself too hard after the injury and now have to deal with leg pain for the foreseeable future (on top of other unrelated problems) and be constantly vigilant with regards to putting too much weight on my leg or it getting smacked by anything. Apologies for personal story time, didn't mean to write this wall-o-text. </p></div>		</li>
