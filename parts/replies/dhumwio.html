			<div class="markdown"><p>This article was not well written. The reason why the reactor exploded had to do with several phenomena specific to nuclear power. </p>
<p>Electrical engineers would run these tests at night when the power requirement from the locals was lowest. Nuclear engineers instructed the testers to not allow the power production to fall below 200 mega watts. It was dropped to 30 MW. This caused what's known as reactor poisoning and is why Navy reactors have a powerful neutron source in them. During fission, some elements are created that act as neutron sinks. Too much of these will shut a reactor down. They're short-lived; 11.5 hours later, 1/2 of the poison is gone.  </p>
<p>This caused the reactor to explode.</p>
<p>To start a reactor, you pull the control rods out. The analogy would be if we accelerated a car just by taking our foot of the brakes. Rods are made of some stable elements that also act as neutron sinks, like boron. </p>
<p>But the ends of the rods are made from other stuff that act like reflectors. So the reactor was taken down past safe levels, and then they tried to bring it back online by pulling the rods out. The production of neutrons was not sufficient to counteract the poison, so the were pulled further out. This continued until the poison's half-life was reached, causing the reactor to over heat very quickly. </p>
<p>The test they were running was to see low coolant flow properties. </p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Immediately, the control rods were reinserted, broke about half way in, the reactor poison was gone and the rods were reflecting neutrons back into the vessel. Coolant pipes without enough water were cracked and the entire thing exploded.</p>
<p>Note: Any number of safety systems would've shut the reactor down, including low coolant, low power, etc. These were all bypassed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction...the reactor itself didn't explode. What happened is that the extreme heat generated by the reactor runaway criticality event separated water into hydrogen and oxygen, then ignited that gaseous mixture. It was a chemical explosion that blew the reactor vessel cover off and the graphite moderator blocks up and out of the building. It also luckily ruptured the floor which in turn allowed the boron sand liner to flow in and mix with the corium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the foot started out at 2600°C, cooled to about 2255°C and stayed over 1600°C for at least four days, not very pleasant to be around.</p>
<p>Today it's cooled off, if you're impervious to radiation you can sleep on it; any non-metahumans would be well advised to stay away from it as far as possible though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where you get your immunity. If you are somehow reflecting external, high-energy emissions then you may notice the highest-energy reflections due to Newton's Third Law, like someone shooting BBs at your skin.</p>
<p>If you are somehow magically protected, then there is no reason for you to notice it, but then arguably you might be unable to interact with the world in general, just wafting through material reality with your body made of dark-matter. (you, wimp, you)</p></div>		</li>
