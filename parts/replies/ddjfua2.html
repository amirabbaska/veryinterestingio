			<div class="markdown"><p>Always nice to see an actual neuroscientist/person who knows what they're talking about dispelling the popular myths and misinformation we've collectively accumulated as a society.</p>
<p>I also believed the dopamine=pleasure claim once because my only source for this kind of information was the popular, laymans magazines/articles like Psychology Today, Popular Science etc and back then I didnt question what I read and just accepted it, afterall they cited some difficult to read journal/science paper in their articles so it totally must be legit right.</p>
<p>Now after reading a bunch of articles that dispelled that myth I know better now I hope. I realize that its never so simple and straightforward as the pop-psychology sites claim, and the more outrageous and or simple their claim the less likely it is to be true (dopamine = pleasure release, oxycotin = love chemical) etc, because all they do is just make clickbait out of the science and take something complicated and distill it down to the perfect clickbait headline to be shared wildly across the internet. </p>
<p>And because the vast majority of people will only be exposed to these studies and this field through pop-psychology sites/magazines which are often then repeated in major news media we end up with a depressing amount of misinformation and misleading claims circulating around that everyone believes in and they enter the popular culture and become further ingrained and then it becomes that much harder to collectively unlearn the misinformation that everyone goes around believing is correct.</p>
<p>What a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooof...  That's a pretty complicated question.  It's certainly possible to identify what types of stimuli tend to be aesthetically pleasurable.  And I'm sure there have been at least some studies that have investigated which brain areas are most active when someone finds something (e.g. music) aesthetically pleasurable.  But as for the actual mechanism that causes the feeling of enjoyment?  I don't know if that's even answerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  That's what I thought.  A lot of people think certain things define what sounds good in music, and it just doesn't sit right with me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does addiction factor into this? I had always heard that drug and sex addiction had a lot to do with dopamine, seratonin, and oxytocin. Namely that subjecting yourself to immense amounts of these hormones can be addicting when your body become used to them... With the result of becoming less sensitive to these hormones and of course withdrawl-like symptoms when they are lessened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine and serotonin are emphatically not hormones. They're neurotransmitters, which are by definition very different. A hormone is like a broadcast signal. It's usually meant to spread out and reach the whole body, even if not all of the body responds. A neurotransmitter, in contrast, is by definition released in much more tiny amounts and on a cell-by-cell basis, and is also usually mostly broken down or sucked back up within a few milliseconds or less. So neurotransmitter release is not a broadcast signal. It's more like a message from one neuron to one or more other neurons.</p>
<p>As for your original question:</p>
<p>Addiction is not that simple. The brain is not just a stew of chemicals with fluctuating levels, and emotions / feelings / states of mind are not produced by chemicals. Emotions, thoughts, and actions are complex phenomena, produced by complex patterns of activity in neuronal circuits. Exactly which neurotransmitters those circuits use to function is not really that important. It's about as important as &quot;what kind of wires are used to connect two components&quot; in a computer. So saying that someone has an addiction (including a behavioral addiction) because of dopamine levels is like saying that you're seeing pop-up ads on your computer screen because you have too much / too little monitor cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what of people who have depression due to &quot;dopamine deficiency&quot;? That is oversimplification as well then, according to your analogy.      </p>
<p>So, if I follow:<br />
To say that someone has a behavioral or mental disorder due to an imbalance of certain <strong>neurotransmitters</strong> is theoretical, subjective and unverifiable. However, to say that someone has a behavioral or mental disorder due to an imbalance of certain <strong>hormones</strong> is much more realistic and/or verifiable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Budding neuroscientist here! I might be able to point you in the right direction. Addiction has been found to be related to a circuit involving the nucleas accumbens, orbitofrontal cortext, and ventral tegmental area which has a lot of dopamine activity with inputs from the substantia nigra (which produces dopamine). These areas/circuits are active during enjoyable and addicting events (gambling, drugs, sex, etc.) The more they act, the better they get at their job (known as plasticity).</p>
<p>If your brain experiences a lot of activity in a certain area, it will start to change. With certain drugs (as an easy example), like cocaine (which blocks the re-uptake of dopamine), more dopamine is around to activate the neurons. Eventually the brain responds to this by doing things such as down-regulating the receptors for dopamine. So now that amount of dopamine cannot result in the same level of activity (or pleasure/&quot;high&quot;/whatever). So you need more and more. Which as you can imagine can produce quite a problem!</p>
<p>This is all super general, and if there's real neuroscientist out there reading this, please correct me (would love to keep learning!)</p></div>		</li>
