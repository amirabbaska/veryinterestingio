			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an air vent or fan blowing directly on her where she sleeps?  That used to happen to me as a kid when I would sleep on the floor near the air vent (because kids are weird).  I would sometimes wake up and my lashes were stuck together and glued shut with this stuff.</p>
