			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I thought it did, whoops! Maybe this will help. Pretty much what is happening is that your brain knows what's happening as the contractions happen and interprets it as the &quot;point of no return&quot;. Technically, the &quot;point of no return&quot; IS part of the orgasm phase, just the part that involves all the ejaculate being prepared inside of you. The actual ejaculation actually happens a few seconds after.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why does it sometimes take a light breeze, and sometimes takes half an hour and now I have a friction burn.  Why wet dreams?  Why constant raging erections when I'm struggling to stay awake?</p>
<p>I feel like this is more what OP is asking, when they are asking about the mental side of it all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source on this? My personal experience varies.</p>
<p>I've found if I contract my kegel muscle quite hard as soon as I feel myself reaching the point of no return I can orgasm without releasing any semen whatsoever.</p>
<p>This allows me to continue intercourse with no refractory period. During sex with my girl I generally have 2-3 orgasms where I hold in the sperm using the kegel muscle before finally releasing everything. </p>
<p>I've noticed 2-3 is the maximum amount of times I can hold it in while still having a good release when I do allow the sperm to come out. If I orgasm too many times it just kind of dribbles out (I'm guessing because the muscles involved in orgasming are exhausted).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From your experience, here is what I think is happening. (According to Sexuality Now 5th Edition by Janell Carroll and my human sexuality class, that's the sources on the comment I made origionally to OPs post too)</p>
<p>When you kegel past the point of no return, you DO actually have semen all made and ready to go, it's just kept inside of you. When the actual sperm get out of your testicles, they have to meet up with the fluids that come out of the prostate and the seminal vesticle to create the semen. So, when you orgasm when holding back the actual &quot;expulsion&quot; phase, you still get an orgasm! I think what's happening is that you are &quot;tricking&quot; your brain and body into thinking you are orgasming, but you stop it before it actually leaves your body. But like the top comment said, nobody REALLY knows what's going on up in the brain.</p>
<p>So, you experience the orgasm when your body and brain are &quot;ready to go&quot;, so to speak, but since you can stop it you are left with semen that is just hangin' out, all ready to go for another round.</p>
<p>In short, you are manually stopping the &quot;explusion&quot; phase with the kegeling while getting the orgasm, and since you have semen all ready to go in there you can go again for another round.</p></div>		</li>
