			<div class="markdown"><p>So I am Caucasian and have curly hair. I also have dry skin, and dry hair (typical for curly hair). When a shampoo doesn't lather I feel like my hair isn't getting clean. But it's (typically) better for curly hair to be washed with a low lather shampoo?</p>
<p>Also, I've never had my hair washed at a salon that didn't have high lather. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did previously, but the majority of posts were directed at ethnically curly hair which is a whole other ball game from Caucasian curly hair. </p>
<p>It makes sense, I'm a minority hair-wise, but it leaves me with few resources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its hard for me to say much without seeing and feeling your hair, or knowing what kind of water and products you use on it, but I'd try a good clarifying shampoo once in a while with a nice moisturizing conditioner, and avoid products for damaged hair. A clarifying shampoo can often help by removing residue and build up that other shampoos can't, which can make your hair feel weird or icky.</p></div>		</li>
