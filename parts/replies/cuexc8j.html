			<p>No.<br><br>The top post is completely wrong and bullshit.<br><br>The main reason they can do it is because via pasteurization they are basically making &quot;fake gross-tasting juice&quot; and adding a lot of water to it with &quot;real orange flavoring and smell&quot; when reconstructing it. The gross still-juice-but-not-orangey is shipped across the country and rebuilt this way after being storable for easily a year+<br><br><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5825909/orange-juice-is-artificially-flavored-to-taste-like-oranges" target="_blank">http://gizmodo.com/5825909/orange-juice-is-artificially-flavored-to-taste-like-oranges</a><br><br>Look up pasteurization and then see if you will ever bother drinking non-fresh squeezed orange juice again. It is NOT REAL FOOD. There is a reason that fresh-squeezed juice has such a short shelf-life, and this crap does not.<br><br>You're delusional if you think that there's &quot;price effectivity&quot; for orange juice that doesn't include this process. It is not possible. </p>		</li>

			<p>That's interesting. I'd never heard of the processes described in the article before, but it doesn't really surprise me.<br><br>Pasteurization is just heating by the way, so all the other nonsense they do (like storing without oxygen and adding things) should be described as something else, maybe just storage + processing. <br><br>None of this really changes what I said above. My example is intentionally simplistic (this is ELI5 after all). The processing would be another cost to factor into the making of OJ, but the flavor profile and/or health benefits don't really factor into the short-term economic variables. It prevents spoilage, which could be another explanation for why OJ can seemingly sell at a lower price than plain oranges.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think there's a lot more to it than what you put here, like the types of oranges used for juice, where those oranges come from (Brazil vs. the US), the quality of those oranges vs. the quality of those sold in supermarkets, the cost of buying in bulk vs. buying in retail, etc.  Also you seem to be confusing orange growers with juice companies and supermarkets.  Orange growers don't make juice, they just grow and sell oranges, juice companies buy the oranges from them and make juice.  Supermarkets buy oranges and mark them up for resale.  Whoever grew the orange has nothing to do with the final price your supermarket sets, and is probably only paid a fraction of that for his product.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks. There are about a million more complications I thought of adding in there, but it all just gets really convoluted at that point.</p>		</li>
