<p>The reason people post clickbaity articles like this is so more people will click it, and they make more money. You're giving them exactly what they want.</p>
<p>If it comes back up, share a screenshot of it on imgur or a wayback machine archive of it instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the thing i fucking hate about articles written by people with a soccer mom understanding of science, they always end up being DRAMATICALLY overblown bullshit that detracts from the actual severity of the issue because people KNOW it's bullshit and ignore the whole thing so the actual base issue gets forgotten.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't understand why they do this.  It's what deniers cling to as proof that global warming isn't real. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the wrong mentality to have ^</p>
<p>&quot;Deniers&quot; arent the problem, the problem is the apathy of the other 99.99% of people whose brains just shut off when they read obviously bullshit claims. </p>
<p>Anyone who actually lives here is instantly going to stop listening and thing &quot;get fucked, it's not dead, this entire article is invalid&quot; and not absorb anything.</p>
<p>You want to fight global warming effectively? It needs to be done with the truth, not clickbait headlines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;This shit is going to die in a generation&quot; has NEVER gotten action. You need to declare it dead, and, even then, you've still got people on the internet saying &quot;No, it's totally not dead. Why are we even worrying about it?!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>A quarter of the reef is now dead.</p>
<p>And the bleaching is far wider ranging than the dead coral - and bleached coral generally leads to dead coral.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/the-great-barrier-reef-a-catastrophe-laid-bare</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Surveys have revealed that 93% of the almost 3,000 individual reefs have been touched by bleaching, and almost a quarter – 22% – of coral over the entire Great Barrier Reef has been killed by this bleaching event. On many reefs around Lizard Island and further north, there is utter devastation.</p>
<p>Further south, the bleaching is less severe. Since tourists usually go diving and snorkelling in the middle and southern sections, there are plenty of spectacular corals for them to see there. But they shouldn’t be fooled by that – the reef is in the midst of a major environmental catastrophe.</p>
<p>Many scientists are now saying it is almost too late to save it. Strong and immediate action is required to alleviate water pollution and stop the underlying cause: climate change.</p>
