Correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every random number generator IN YOUR COMPUTER is a pseudorandom number generator. There are RNG's that run off things like geiger counters and radioactive isotopes, or cosmic rays hitting a detector. Atomic decay is, as far as I know, entirely unpredictable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like rolling dice to get the same results is exponentially more complicated than flipping a coin with the same results, and not just because of the number of outcomes.</p>
<p>Dice are lighter (slightly more affected by tiny changes in air friction and also bounces) and have grooves and corners and don't behave as easily in the air as a coin does, especially if it's just an end over end coin flip vs a die being thrown any way (or specifically leading with a corner first). </p>
<p>Of course, I'm talking about getting a robot to roll a die in the same fashion consecutively even just twice in a row (not the thought experiment of actually being able to toss it perfectly symmetrically twice). </p></div>		</li>
