			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like more often than not, this is certainly the case, but what about when you see pictures of gazelles at a watering hole  near lions, or that gif of the bald eagle on a house deck with the fox walking up the steps (which is actually what inspired this question)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Animals, through experience, learn what other animals are capable of, especially as prey of  predators. Since water sources are rare (I'll use the lion as an example) prey and predator alike are focused to a small area.</p>
<p>But these water holes become more scarce as things get hot, and when things get hot, it's hard to chase your food down without over heating. So predators are more opportunistic in their hunts, preying on the old or weak since most of a lions prey, in their prime, can do a decent job of avoiding direct attacks on them. </p>
<p>These predators rely on getting closer to their prey before springing on them, and even then, only succeed maybe 10% of the time. This obviously varies by predator.</p>
<p>Theres a series on Netflix called &quot;The Hunt&quot; that is superb. It documents several predators around the world and talks about the difficulty they each have in finding food. </p>
<p>But back to the lion, trying to attack in full view of everyone will most likely yield in failure, with tons of burned energy, and over heating, which requires a long time to recover from.</p>
<p>There are many other factors, but basically, it's smarter for the lion to wait for a better time than when literally all the prey is on edge and super tense and highly aware of every predator and it's distance. Like all predators, they need to get within a certain distance in order to kill. As long as the prey maintains that distance, they know, through experience, that they are relatively safe.  Or as safe as they can be. As always, it's still a risk. Die of thirst, or risk that drink.</p>
<p>All predators face different challenges, but hopefully that gives you a better idea.</p>
<p>Also, check out The Hunt on Netflix. It's good stuff!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While what you say is interesting and makes sense i feel like you’re contradicting yourself. You say animals learn who a predator is and what they’re capable of is by experience. How often do humans chase down and murder Squirrels, Rabbits, etc and they all run </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, there's  movie which used(? Maybe still is) available on Netflix called The Hunt starring Mads Mikkelsen which is not about animals but humans and pedophilia and stuff. Cool movie but not what jphillips is on about; in case you are curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point and I'll definitely give it a watch! I would also agree that learning though example and experience reinforces an animal's sense of danger or what danger actually is to them.</p>
<p>I also replied to another user and posed the question of whether example and experience might or might not matter with the following example that might have some relevance to what you said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presuppose though, that there is a full-grown deer that has never crossed paths with.....let's say a beaver. Then one day the deer encounters one at the river. I feel like the deer would probably not be alarmed (although i could be wrong), but let's say the deer encounters a human walking through the woods for the very first time. I feel like in that case, the deer would run away. What I feel is puzzling, is, aside from our comparative size, why would deer be more afraid of the human than the beaver</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Context for the bald eagle and fox gif in Alaska: they are baited with food. When wild animals are provided a source of food, they lose inhibitions and regularly come back expecting food. As you might imagine, this can be pretty unhealthy for the animals and is really unethical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously though, bullshit answer. But I also feel like the question is bullshit as well. It's simply not true that most animals immediately flee at the sight of a human and that they're not unaffected by other animals. Yeah a pigeon will fly away if it seems like you're going towards it, but it will also fly away if a dog does the same thing. Or a fucking squirrel. A deer might or might not get spooked by a human, depending on the circumstances. And it also might or might not be spooked by a wolf. Or a boar.  </p>
<p>Such a weird question. </p></div>		</li>
