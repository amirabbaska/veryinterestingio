			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read a detailed report but I think discussions centered on the tolerance of expansion surrounding the battery cell. The lithium ion cells expand a little during normal usage, and as they age they expand a bit more. So, it seems that the engineers did not design the space appropriately and it caused excessive stress on the battery, which eventually caused it to fail.</p>
<p>If you consider the amount of devices with these batteries (hundreds of millions) you'd see that incidents are few. Still, high profile problems like this one may damage the reputation of the company, so safety should be thoroughly considered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. I am often amazed at just how much powerful tech (batteries included!) we carry around with us and yet there are hardly ever any serious hardware issues. Pretty incredible and a testament to the skill put into the engineering. </p></div>		</li>
