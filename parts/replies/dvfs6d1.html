			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my mother worked at a grocery store and once a month or so they’d clear out the book racks and return the book covers. The coverless books got thrown in a box for employees to take. She’d being home piles to go through and if not for that I probably wouldn’t have found some of my favorite authors, at least not as early. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The retailer has a contractual agreement with the publisher that if they get refunded for the book by sending the cover back, they will have the books destroyed.  So depending on how you get the book, the retailer is in breach of their contractual requirements and may have committed theft, or a recycling company employee hasn't done their job/has stolen from the recycling company.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked for Waldenbooks back in the day, we just sent back the covers and trashed the books. It horrified me that they didn’t have us recycle the books, we were supposed to put them in a trash dumpster. Needless to say, I stole many a book from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine this notice is there for the same reasoning behind people being worried that someone is going into a voting booth with a fake ID.<br />
ie: they are being stolen, just not that way, and this wouldn't help even if they were.</p></div>		</li>
