			<p>So? This is <em>intrinsic</em> to capitalism. This is not an accident. If you want to see the true face of capitalism, go to the Former Soviet Union. Capitalism is an economic form that benefits the elites excellently. It is at its deepest core authoritarian and undemocratic by removing the basis of wealth, i.e. the primary and secondary sector (ressources and production) from any social control and putting them into the hands of people who may make authoritarian decisions over them.<br><br>Once the basis of the economy are in private hands, there is no turning back. From there on the market mechanics take over and they naturally conflate power into the hands of less and less people. That these people will also take over power over the state as an institution is just natural, but that is not where their power originates from. It comes from the mechanics of private capital ownership itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not nearly as bad as feudalism, it just is only a much too small step forwards. The dependencies that capitalism builds aren't that different from feudalism after all.</p>		</li>

			<p>Of course they didn't figure it would come like this, and yet it is intrinsic to the logic of capitalism.<br><br>Do you know why the classical political economy was abandoned? It was because of Karl Marx. Marx worked on the assumption that the classical political economists were serious people writing serious things, and that they can't be all wrong. So he took their writings in detail, deconstructed them, and put them together again in a configuration that he considered more realistic. And with this he proved that on the assumptions that his predecessors made, i.e. what a free market is and how value is produced and so on, the free market would <em>not</em> lead to a utopia but to a pretty bad oligopolic situation. Afterwards classicism was dead. If you still agreed with their core principles, you found yourself being a Marxist now. This is what he did in Capital Volume 1, about the production process in capitalism.<br><br>It was not until Volume 2 (The Process of Circulation of Capital) that he started with the figure of the money lender. And he made some very spot-on predictions there: That the financial economy would become more and more important, overtake the real economy in volume and power, and that equally capital exports would become more important than commodity exports. He predicted the situation the United States would find themselves in since about 40 years.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; The labour shortage turned into a labour surplus.<br><br>Had there been a labor surplus, there would have been a corresponding decline in productivity.  We've experienced the longest and largest increase in productivity in human history since 1973.  <br><br>Capitalism was successful before WWII.   America succeeded after the war because the people in charge of the nation's industries had integrity.  <br></p>		</li>
