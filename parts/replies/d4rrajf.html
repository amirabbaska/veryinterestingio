			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish more mods did this. I can't stand when someone posts a good and serious question ,only to see the top comment is a joke/sarcasm which leads to a thread of bad puns/jokes/sarcasm.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I know what sub I'm in. I'm glad it's not like /r/worldnews . I clik to see some news and have to scroll half the page of derailments,puns, and tasteless jokes before there is a real discussion on the topic.<br />
Mods like you keep reddit great.</p></div>		</li>
