<p>Well, you could say that chemistry <strong>is</strong> physics. The goal of physics is to understand the natural world. Nature doesn't care how humans decide to divide up the sciences.</p>

<p>This is more a historical question than anything. And one that I don't know the answer to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankyou! I was hoping there was a scientific distinction why we made the distinction between the two. You have been very helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Everything is connected and subjected to the same laws of nature. Doesn't matter which words we attach.. words don't have meaning in themselves</p></div>		</li>

<p>Physics is applied mathematics</p>
<p>Chemistry is applied Physics</p>
<p>Biology is applied Chemistry</p>
<p>Its broad, but it makes a good generalized conceptual statement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are trying to find the underlying form of the entire universe, the only way to know that you have found it is to test that your model accounts for everything. The laws of physics have to explain pretty much everything in the known universe if they are truly 'laws.' This is why physics has to be so broad.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, trying to explain organic chemistry in terms of elementary physics will give you a brain aneurysm. It would bee like trying to program an application in binary by just typing in the ones and zeros. Its too complicated to solve problems with many interactions, so you take an alternative approach. Instead, figure out how chemistry works separately, and then try to merge the two afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a whole branch of chemistry called &quot;nuclear chemistry&quot;, and what they do is essentially identical to what nuclear physicists do.</p>

<p>This really isn't true. Nuclear chemistry investigates things like the chemical effects of radiation absorption and the chemical properties of radionuclides.</p></div>		</li>
