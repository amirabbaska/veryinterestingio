			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Ivanovich_Ivanov" target="_blank">Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov</a> did experiments. We can't really say it was unsuccessful since his work didn't last for a long time. And for obvious reasons, I don't think scientists followed up his work.</p>
<p>edit: For those interested, there is a nice <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848608000174" target="_blank">summary of his research</a>. It's behind paywall, but I guess these two Time articles might be free to read. Also, if you can find someone to send you the original article, you can find more books and articles on this type of research and its impact.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern humans &quot;should not&quot; be able to reproduce with chimpanzees, or, at least, their offspring should be mostly sterile, as humans have 46 chromosomes and chimpanzees have 48. Their offspring would have 47 and thus be sterile, if existing at all.</p>
<p>We know all great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans) have 48 chromosomes. The chromosome 2 of modern humans is the result of the fusion of 2 great ape chromosomes, conveniently called 2A and 2B.</p>
<p>The Homo and Pan (chimp+bonobo) branches split around 6 million years ago, so we can infer that the human chr2 fusion event happened, at most, in that point. We also know that we/our ancestors were able to interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans, that split from the human branch 400-800kya, so the theoretical answer to OP's question should lie between 400 to 6,000 kya.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main point here is not the &quot;number&quot; of chromosomes, but having a pair of each chromosome. Cell replication machinery has to be able to replicate each chromosome and correctly split them into the two daughter cells, so each of them is viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be more of a problem for the hybrid being fertile as chromosome segregation wouldn't work well. That's the issue with mules. They exist but are sterile largely because horses have 32 chromosomes and donkeys only 31.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we not spoof a chromosome - specifically in the case of horses/donkeys, take another chromosome from another horse and insert it into the mule's set.   (it takes 32 from horse and 31 from donkey - I believe)</p>
<p>As I understand it, the 'blue-prints' are spread across all the chromosomes.    </p>
<p>So, the eye color for example, would look at ALL the chromosomes, because chromosomes are not ordered.  They are sets of data following a sequence to grow which routes through each as demanded. </p>
<p>To make it oh so much less complex - let's use the example 'eye color'.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chromosome 1 - Start define eye color - next info found in chromosome 10
Chromosome 10 - if eye color use [information] then go to chromosome 3
Chromosome 3 -  if eye color use [ information] then end eye color - start hair color.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the example 'hair color'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chromosome 3 - Start define hair color - next info found in chromosome 1
Chromosome 1 - if hair color use [information] then go to chromosome 2
Chromosome 2 -  if hair color use [ information] then end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following each 'process' until it ends - and other processes being started based off another ending (order of development)</p>
<p>Back to the question, can we just splice a portion of a male horse and insert it into the mules Chromosomes?
(The missing chromosome that matches the female horses chromosome that is inside the mule)</p></div>		</li>
