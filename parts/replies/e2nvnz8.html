			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question! Most stimulants are based on release or reuptake inhibition of dopamine, which is a stimulatory neuromodulator. The increased amounts of dopamine modulate various different other neurotransmitter systems, such as noradrenaline, serotonin, corticosteroids and glutamate. With them, also come the secondary effects, such as increased blood flow and heart rate, as they stimulate the. All of the aforementioned neurotransmitters contribute to the feeling of temporarily being alert and energized. As it affects glutamatergic system, I reckon it would also be enhancing the build up of process S, but unfortunately I have not seen any studies done with it. At least the users of these stimulants can feel very tired after the effects of the drug are gone. However, in the subsequent sleep period following the stimulant use, are similar neuroplastic changes happening as with high physiologic stimulation? What I remember from reading large studies on the use of amphetamine or methylphenidate as cognitive enhancers, I don't remember it leading to any increased learning. Thus, I can assume that the amphetamine use does not lead to any differing amounts of synaptic reorganization during the subsequent night.</p>
<p>Different anesthetics also differ from these two processes. Anesthesia caused by CNS depressant does unfortunately not bring natural sleep, and thus, probably does not clear the accumulated molecular correlates of sleep loss in a similar way. The differences of sleep pharmacologically induced sleep can be seen for example on biochemical level, where some neuroplasticity-related signaling cascades are regulated in reverse from natural sleep, and electrophysiological level through differences in EEG. </p>
<p>In a short answer, I would say these stimulants affect the brain by &quot;fooling&quot; the natural process S. They contribute to the normal build up and clearance of molecular correlates of sleep need, but they do not mimic the natural processes completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of it might, yes! But to keep things simple, I unfortunately left out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orexin" target="_blank">orexin system</a>. They act as a &quot;flip flop&quot; switch regulating wake and sleep. In many cases of narcolepsy, the orexinergic cells are damaged from one reason or another, causing the person to fall asleep and wake up randomly. The orexin system would not be directly categorized in either process S or C, instead being one of the systems which receive the input from both of the processes and when certain parameters are filled, switching from wake to sleep or vice versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't adenosine get changed into amp, adp and than ATP rather fast?  It is how our energy storage and muscles work as much as I remember. Triphosphate gets reduced to diphosphate to monophosphate giving off energy on the process and then it gets oxidated back. Some steps were faster some slower. Can't quite remember which were which though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, adenosine is from the ATP and the brain is constantly trying to rebuild the ATP storage. However, during wake there's a huge demand of energy which ATP transfers. So the ATP is constantly broken to ADP and to AMP and then to adenosine faster than the body can build new ATP, wich the body then senses as a representation for feeling tired. When the energy demand is lowered, the brain can recycle adenosine back to ATP. In muscles, it might be a whole different issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah good point. Forgot we are in the brain right now and not general body physics.</p>
<p>Though it does show me, that I need to reread some books. :/</p></div>		</li>
