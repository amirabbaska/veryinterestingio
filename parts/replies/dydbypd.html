It was first aired on Arte which is a cultural Tv network on the 1st of April, but many people thought it was a real documentary because it was on Arte.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for one point in the video 'how came the retro reflectors to the moon' you don't need a human person to leave them there. the Russians, for example, had already landed a remote control vehicle on the moon (how cool is that?) during the time the Apollo Americans (allegedly) went there in person.  </p>
<p>The reflectors left by the Russians are used by the NASA and other research agencys today, because they are doing their reflector job much better than the reflector object (allegedly) put there by the Americans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>APOLLO is now using Lunokhod 1's reflector for experiments, as they discovered, to their surprise, that it was returning much more light than other reflectors on the Moon. According to a NASA press release, APOLLO researcher Tom Murphy said, &quot;We got about 2,000 photons from Lunokhod 1 on our first try. After almost 40 years of silence, this rover still has a lot to say.&quot;[7]

<p>That's Earth in the background - it doesn't look right because we wouldn't get to see ourselves from space properly for the first time until (as others below have rightly corrected me) <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/apollo_8.html" target="_blank">Apollo 8's Earthrise photo</a> <em>eight months after the film was released.</em> </p>
<hr />
<p>Two years before the film, Lunar Orbiter 1 took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_View_of_Earth_from_Moon.jpg" target="_blank">a blurry black and white shot</a> - which looks closer to the appearance in 2001. (These were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Orbiter_Image_Recovery_Project" target="_blank">reconstructed in higher resolution</a> in the last decade.)</p>
<p>The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble" target="_blank">Blue Marble</a> photo was from Apollo 17 - <strong>four years later</strong>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is addressed more in the book. The Dinosaur DNA they have are just fragments and they have to fill the gaps. They used whatever DNA was the best match, and did use bird DNA and other types. Only the species that got the frog DNA ended up reproducing. The lead scientist didn’t believe there was any real difference between the different species DNA they were using. When Grant (in the book) asks about whether they used frog or amphibian DNA, the scientist doesn’t understand why it even matters.</p></div>		</li>
