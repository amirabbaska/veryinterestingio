			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another important aspect to consider in regards to MHC is the way in which T-cells mature through the MHC binding. T-cells go through a positive selection process where T-cells that stay bound to the MHC are able to survive. Additionally, a negative selection process occurs in which T-cells that bind too easily to self-antigens (to allow for self tolerance). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, a &quot;good&quot; immune system will have a population of T-cells with high antigen diversity (by presumably a larger number of T-cells that pass the positive selection) as well as a strong self tolerance (by passing the negative selection).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, pretty much everybody is heterozygous for almost all of the MHC alleles; it's one of the most diverse genes we have. This is probably true for some other immune genes, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Although some MHC alleles are more frequent in certain regions.  What comes to mind are the malaria-resistant HLA alleles that are more frequent in regions of higher malaria burden.  These alleles could be passed on to children in regions without malaria and confer unique HLA diversity compared to the rest of the region. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to your comment, it is often cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages and dendritic cells (often called APC's or &quot;Antigen Presenting Cells&quot;) that are characteristically known to express large amounts of MHC molecules.  One of Macrophages' main roles is to phagocytose (engulf/internalize) antigens that they encounter, so it makes perfect sense for them to also be the ones using MHC molecules so heavily - they're the first responders to pathogens, so they also need to be able to communicate/present/display what they have found to the other immune cells.</p>
<p>MHC molecules are kind of the linkage point between the innate and adaptive immune system</p></div>		</li>
