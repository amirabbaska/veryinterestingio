<p>EDIT: TIL that's actually called a 'cul-de-sac;' the island in the middle is optional; and a &quot;court&quot; is just one of many possible names for such a cul-de-sac.  Other possible names include Bay, Circle, Close, Cove, Grove, Loop, Mews, Pass, Path, Place, Plaza, Point, Row, Run, Square, Terrace, Trace, Trail, Turn, Walk, and Way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who lives on an &quot;avenue street circle.&quot;  It's seriously unbelievable.  There is honestly no explanation whatsoever.  He lives off of a major avenue (in a city where avenues run north-south and streets run east-west) on a dead end road with a roundabout at the end instead of an abrupt stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that a Road is typically meant to efficiently move traffic and a street is meant to accommodate people. That's one of the reasons why people are more likely to say &quot;play in the streets&quot;, &quot;dance in the streets&quot;, &quot;grow up in the streets&quot;, or play &quot;street hockey&quot; as opposed to &quot;Road&quot;.</p>
<p>When you inappropriately merge those two purposes, you wind up with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6jFnOnjzrk" target="_blank">Stroad</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems to be a term that the makers of that video just made up, but that's fair enough, because the presentation is quite good and they've got a point. And by calling this type of street a stroad, they cleverly avoid references to and comparisons between European and American-style city streets, and make the suggestion to basically become more European seem fresh, original and American-made, which should improve its chances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This accurately describes NY state route 5 from downtown Schenectady (where it is known as State St) to downtown Albany (where it is known as Central Ave).  They built it around a route that used to be a light rail line connecting the two cities, but the tore that out in an equal fit of shortsightedness near the middle of the 20th century.  Amusingly, they have since put in a bus line that emulates the light rail.</p>
<p>But I digress.  I have driven, bused, walked and biked along this stretch of stroad, and it is exactly the thing that the video is describing.</p></div>		</li>
