			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the analogy, it made sense to me.</p>
<p>How come we know that &quot;light is always moving at the speed of light&quot;? I mean, in your description it didn't, and that is explained by changing the speed of time (instead of the speed light).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been countless experiments done to test the speed of light in all kinds of situations. Our physical theories are based on the idea of reference frames where translating between different frames keeps only one speed the same while all others change, but the experiments are ultimately why we need theories like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation always occurs, and follows a pretty simple equation as long as acceleration is not involved; at which point the physics gets quite a bit more complicated (though time dilation still behaves predictably in every situation involving acceleration).</p>
<p>Space &quot;dilation&quot; (length contraction) also occurs in a way. The actual distance between you and a moving object doesn't change, but anything moving appears to be shorter the faster it moves. This shortening of an object only happens in the direction of motion. Whether or not objects truly get shorter as they move faster is a matter for debate; the center of that debate being that proper length (the length of something with no velocity relative to you) doesn't change.</p></div>		</li>
