			<div class="markdown"><p>This! France had a king, a mad decapitator, a republic, an emperor, another king, the emperor again, yet another king, yet another republic, another emperor, and then another republic... All only one hundred years following the signing of the American Constitution. </p>
<p>Then there were the Nazis and the Vichy, too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, there were TWO kings between the two empires. Why?  Because there was a minor-ish revolution in July of 1830 that replaced the Regular Vanilla Plain Jane Bourbons with the Orleans Bourbons as a kind of stop-gap instead of a second republican.  France has a hell of a history. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious about Spain for the same period and it's similar. Spain, by my count, hit 8-9 in the same time. I tried to be conservative in my count, but there were several places where the argument can be made they changed again. It seems like the Spanish thing to do is to scrap the current constituition and just rewrite it from scratch to include what you want, use an old constituition, or just stop everything and fight over the role of the Catholic Church for a couple of years.</p>
<p>I made my cuts from:</p>
<ul>
<li>pre-1789 - 1808: Bourbon rule ending under Ferdinand VII.</li>
<li>1808 - 1812: Civil War and Rule Under Napolean.</li>
<li>1812 - 1814: Cadiz Constituition under Ferdinand VII.</li>
<li>1814 - 1837: Spanish Republic/Bourbon Rule interrupted twice by using the Cadiz Constitution from 1812.</li>
<li>1837 - 1873: New/Revised Progressive Constituitions featureing Separations of Powers</li>
<li>1873 - 1931: First Spanish Republic and return to Bourbon rule.</li>
<li>1931 - 1936: Second Spanish Republic</li>
<li>1936 - 1978: Francoism and a Transition to Democracy.</li>
<li>1978 - Present: The Kingdom of Spain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder if this government changing thing is a European thing? My world history classes never really focused on those aspects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>your world history class should have done a better job covering the 1800s and the Industrial revolution. it was a progressing world, and if you were falling behind, it was common tactic to chop off the head and start anew/revised. not only was it a time for economic and technolgical advances, but also a massive increase of population, the industrialization of cities, and the progression (or regression) of the worker/person's rights. this also played a major factor in the ever changing governments. weak and detached monarchies would be replaced, strong and militaristic came in, replaced by the next republic or what ever would come from the chaos of these times.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Combine a strong diplomacy system with a more in depth and evolving societal culture and you've got a game that has a lot more depth.</p></div>		</li>

I'm sitting here with a nice Iroquois republic after kicking Spain out and stealing their colonies, and then suddenly BOOM France owns Florida and Canada and they really want New England so if you could just give up and die that would be great thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That game gave* me a whole new appreciation for history, the nations of old, and how wild all of that must really have been.</p>
<p>The relation balancing, how wars and battles really are fought, how land is gained/lost, the understanding that &quot;Civ&quot; style play is so watered down and diluted compared to how you actually have to manage things that it really is fascinating how it all melds together in eu4.</p>
<hr />
<p>edit: I'll add, I've learned more about the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns from this game than anything I ever learned in school. It caused me to <em>want</em> to read pages and pages of wikipedia at night to understand <em>how</em> each of these little HRE nations even came to be, why the alliances/rivalries are the way they are, and how the hell the world actually got to that state. And that shit is absolutely fascinating when you read about it. </p>
<p>Did anyone else know that the Hohenzollern dynasty came about ~1000AD, formed Brandenburg -&gt; Prussia -&gt; Germany, <em>and the only reason they were replaced was because they finally lost a big war in WWI</em>. Like that shit is wild; some dynasty literally took a tiny castle in 1000AD and turned the lands into <em>fucking Germany</em> by the 1800s. A single dynasty. The <em>fuck?!?!?!</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this to also talk about economic dependency a little more. </p>
<p>The first heavily manufactured goods were textiles and the British were the ones who got there first. It went so far that the designs for water powered  looms were considered state secrets and not allowed to leave Great Britain (yeah we smuggled them out, copyright law's a bitch). So for years GB had a huge demand for cotton and we were growing a lot of it, I mean this was economic hegemony for GB, just to compare it's like the manufacturing power of the US after WWII, you're the only game in town and you know it, but even better back then was that GB literally had zero competition for decades and made a killing. This is why GB was such a hugemonic power for such a long time, they evolved from spice/raw material trade into manufactured goods and kept their navy in tip top shape. </p>
<p>So here you are, the US has just fought a war for independence but is an entirely agricultural economy, and GB which is almost exponentially expanding manufacturing and living on an island, we needed each other, plain and simple. </p>
<p>Another huge part is that Rule of Law was instituted quickly and effectively during/after the revolutionary war. Political opponents weren't being killed, if I remember correctly the split was about 1/3 for the revolution 1/3 against and 1/3 not really sure what was best, and everyone knew that and it wasn't seen as revenge could happen after the war and still maintain a country, there was definitely some hostility, but overall, for a revolution, people were very civil afterwards when it came to forgiving people on the other side (though a lot of Tories did move back to GB). But you had stability, which really allowed for normalized relationships with the rest of the world and for more pragmatic deals like trade negotiations with the country you just fought a war with.</p>
<p>Edited were to weren't being killed.</p></div>		</li>
