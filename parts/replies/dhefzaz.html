			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote that there is no solution in Newtonian gravity for a mass distribution that is homogeneous throughout all of space. The relevant equation for the Newtonian potential is Poisson's equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Δφ = -4πGϱ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with some appropriate boundary condition at infinity (called free-space boundary conditions). If ϱ is not compactly supported, then it's unclear what the boundary condition should even be on physical grounds. Now if ϱ is a uniform constant throughout all of space, then a reasonable condition on the solution is that the associated gravitational field, i.e., <strong>u</strong> = grad(φ), should be a homogeneous vector field. It follows that <strong>u</strong> must be a uniform constant vector field, and so -4πGϱ = div(<strong>u</strong>) = 0. In other words, the only uniform mass distribution that makes sense is just ϱ = 0 (no mass at all).</p>
<p>(The best you can really do is find solutions that are isotropic about a single point. The unique such solution is φ(<strong>r</strong>) = -2πGϱr^(2)/3, up to an additive constant.)</p>
<hr />
<p>However, if ϱ is compactly supported and sufficiently smooth (the smoothness required is very weak), then Poisson's equation has a <em>unique</em> solution under the simple boundary condition that φ --&gt; 0 at infinity. (This boundary condition is sufficient only in 3 or more spatial dimensions. In 2 dimensions, we need to specify that |grad(φ)| --&gt; 0 at infinity.) Clearly, this boundary condition cannot be imposed on a mass distribution that is not compactly supported.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm guessing that in 2d, φ must diverge (logarithmically) at infinity? Or are there other options? (EDIT: Besides the trivial ϱ = 0, φ = constant).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't things cease to be causally linked, at some distance?  OP seems to be asking whether it's possible for no attractive force to exist because of gravity and it seems like the concept of any force exerted on you by anything with a world-line that doesn't intersect your future is pretty meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about assuming periodic boundary conditions, as is usually done in N-body simulations? While the overall offset of φ is undetermined here, that offset has no physical meaning in Newtonian gravity so any value we choose will result in the same behavior. With this boundary conditions one doesn't need to assume compact support.</p>
<p>Structure formation in a Newtonian universe with periodic boundary conditions eventually leads to the collapse of all structures into a single halo, the size of which is determined by the size of the period (though for arbitrarily large periods this can take arbitrarily long). This is different from a lambda-CDM universe, where the structure formation eventually freezes on large scale.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how different the case of periodic boundary conditions vs. non-periodic with compact support are in the limit where the size of the period/compact area goes to infinity but we stay focused on a patch of constant size. However, a qualitative difference between these two cases is that only deviations from mean density gravitate under periodic boundary conditions, while for the compact scenario the mean inside the compact area contributes to that area's collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but your answer was a bit over my head.  I'm looking for a more ELI15 answer here.  The two questions are related because I'm asking if our perception of gravity involves a quantum mechanical explanation and you touched only on relativity.  Obviously the two are linked in some way.</p></div>		</li>
