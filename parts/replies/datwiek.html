			<div class="markdown"><p>But is there a limit within the realm of physics though? For instance, mammals AFAIK are compromised of bones, certain organs, hair, etc. Bones can't support an infinite amount of weight. Provided the environmental factors are met, what limits does physics put on size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Volume increases faster than surface area, so it becomes more and more difficult to support all of that mass. Blue whales for example die pretty fast outside of water because their skeletons can't support their weight. </p>
<p>There's also practical reasons. Taller people (like way tall people with hormone problems) usually die quicker, and have a lot of heart and joint problems due to their size. As you get bigger you have more cells and it's very difficult to get oxygen to every cell, so the heart has to work a lot harder,and gives out quicker. Getting enough food and oxygen to support such a large body is basically a waste of energy, since you aren't really gaining much from the increased size. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are right, there is a physics element to the limit a mammal can grow. It is called the square-cube law. Bones have a hard outside with the soft marrow on the inside so most of the support a bone gives it supported by the hard outer layer.
Now if we think about a 1x1x1 cube, it has a surface area of 6, and an area of 1. A good ratio if the surface area (outer layer of bone) is supporting the cube's weight. Now let's look at a 9x9x9 cube. It has a surface area of 486, and an area of 729. As you can see, the area has outgrown the surface area so the surface area so our bone would have a hard time supporting the weight of the animal.
Another problem is the heart, and giraffes are a perfect example of this. As limbs get further from the heart, especially upwards, the heart has to work harder to push the blood. This would be a problem with giraffes with there long necks, but the evolved a mechanism that acts like a doctor's squeeze sleeve. However any larger, and the animal wouldn't be able to eat enough food to support a heart that is big enough to pump blood to the whole body.
Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>
