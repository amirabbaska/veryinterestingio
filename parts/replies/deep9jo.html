			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many people that don't understand that 100 is always the average for an IQ test because the 100 score is set at the average.  I've heard quite a few rants from fairly smart people lamenting how the average IQ is only 100.  lol.  I think there's a Patton Oswalt bit about it.  If an alien intelligence showed up and made everyone on earth five times smarter, the average iq would still be 100 once the tests were adjusted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't entirely work.  Because then everyone's score would change slightly <em>after</em> they take the test as new people take it.</p>
<p>What happens is a test is developed, they randomly select lots of people to take it,  take the scoring based on <em>that</em> distribution,  and then keep that scoring method for a long time. </p>
<p>Thus,  in a given year, or a given group, average results can differ from 100, as the group differs in quality from the original group that at the standard. </p>
<p>If you keep the same standard for, say, a decade,  then you can plot the IQ mean and distribution changing over time,  sometimes increasing, and sometimes decreasing.  </p>
<p>Yes it's arbitrary and normalized,  but it isn't <em>continuously</em> normalized.  So non-100 averages are quite valid and quite expected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't mean it's literally changing every time you take it, only that it's variable.  Like I said, it would go back to 100 once the test is adjusted.  It also adjusts to various age brackets as well so someone with a high IQ as a kid might have a lower IQ as an adult.  My point is that by design 100 is the average and what that 100 represents changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what the criticism means. It's not &quot;lol 100 is such a low number&quot;. It's &quot;think of the sort of intelligence that currently qualifies as a 100 IQ. People with what is currently considered a 100 IQ are thought of as being not very smart. And half the population is less intelligent than that.&quot;</p>
<p>It works because the average intelligence is currently unimpressive, not because they assign an expected intelligence to that raw number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in the patton oswalt bit I mentioned he's specifically talking about the number of people below the 100 mark, not that the set 100 mark is unimpressive.  In fact I'm not sure I've heard a single person complain about that specifically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Proper tests generally have a test taker that will make sure you do everything correctly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you please expand on this. What exactly does it mean to do everything correctly? </p>
<p>My understanding of IQ tests is that they are not really an objective way of measuring IQ's are they require some general background knowledge, I have done a few, so first hand experience. What I mean is if, for example, we discovered a tribe that has never had outside contact, they would all score poorly on an IQ test, not because they are not intelligent, but because a level of general knowledge is required for these tests which they are not exposed to. So, how do organizations like Mensa or International High IQ Society determine who becomes a member and who doesn't? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The test supervisor I had basically just checked so that I didn't cheat, checked all the answers, and timed everything since the time to answer each question is of relevance.</p>
<p>And basically they've made charts to compare IQ scores between the tests, probably by having people do both. So, while you might get 150 IQ score on one, you might have 130 IQ on the other.</p>
<p>And to test other populations they likely remove parts, translate them, or do a seperate scaling for the region.</p>
<p>Personally, I did the WAIS-IV test and found its scoring to be more of how good a citizen you are, rather than just raw intelligence, though each section is scored individually, so you don't need to include the sections that hurt your ego.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only subtest you could be referring to as a citizen test is Comprehension. This a known weakness, and so that subtest is relegated to supplemental status. The core subtests have greater criterion validity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your tribe example: they would likely do as well as the average westerner on the non-verbal spatial reasoning tests. Depends on the tribe; I read about some tribe who didn't have a quantitative understanding of of time and then would likely perform poorly on timed tests, for example. </p>
<p>Personally, I'm more curious about how they actually DESIGN the nonverbal tests. Like how did they figure out how to systematically make the Raven matrices progressively more difficult for the average person? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was tested as a kid, like 12-13 to get into my school's humanities program (which had an IQ requirement, I think a relic of the cold war). Anyway the test was basically translate the code quickly given this cipher, continue this pattern as much as you can in a minute, reproduce this picture by assembling blocks with patterns on them, etc. The test supervisor explained each task, timed, and assessed how far I was going. They could probably all do it on a computer now.</p></div>		</li>
