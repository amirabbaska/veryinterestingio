			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here. Although this is a pretty good explanation of the term &quot;cave&quot;,  I will add that other carbonate rocks can form caves by dissolution, such as marble, which is metamorphosed limestone. These voids in the ground can be as small as a vertical shaft in the ground with little horizontal passage, or miles long like Mammoth Cave with hundreds of miles of mapped passage. Anecdotally, caves are generally a void in the ground large enough that some portion of it will not receive sunlight, whereas a cavern is capable of having speleothems (formations) such as stalactites and stalagmites composed of dissolved minerals (usually calcite, but also gypsum). </p>
<p>I don't believe there are fast growing caves, such as OP described. However, there are a subset of cavers called &quot;cave diggers&quot;, which are out to find new caves. They often look for sinkholes in karst areas that take on water and will dig out these areas in search of new caves. Sometimes, large cave systems can be discovered that are quite lengthy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm a tour guide in Hocking Hills. Ash cave and Old man's cave, they're technically recess caverns. I've been told that to be considered a cave, there has to be a point at which there's no ambient light. Hense why caves are typically thought of as deeper than the caverns in hocking. We always say they just call them caves for marketing, because they didn't want to sell T shirts that said &quot;I explored the Old Man's Crevice&quot; or &quot;I saw the Ash Hole!&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not, but I took a quick look at some info for the state park. Overhangs like that can form recess caves where less resistant rock was eroded faster than the more resistant rock above, leaving behind a recess that tapers downward creating an overhang. These are different from solutional caves, where the rock was actually dissolved by weakly acidic glacial meltwater and/or groundwater. The bedrock at Hocking Hills is sandstone, which doesn't really lend itself to dissolution in the way that limestone does because of the composition of the rock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There absolutely are fast forming caves. Read about the gypsum karst of West Texas. And karst formations can be found in some quartzites as well as more conventional formations like limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. There are some very interesting formations in northern south America. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did some caving in central New Mexico where the entrance had a lava &quot;ceiling.&quot; The entrance was a tunnel in the gypsum underneath, barely large enough for a human. The ceiling retained the texture of the ground over which the lava flowed.</p>
<p>While the flows vary in age, they are Holocene (circa 5,000 years old) and some of them have impressions of corn-on-the-cob in them, presumably left by Native Americans, perhaps as some sort of ritual.</p>
<p>Anyway- net upshot is that passageways able to be traversed by a man, in gypsum, in ~5,000 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caver here. 99% are found either by word-of-mouth (ranchers who have a cave on their property, for example), or by &quot;ridgewalking&quot; (boots-on-the-ground searching in terrain such as limestone found at the surface). Sometimes sinkholes open up on their own, or get dug open. Some, like Carlsbad, were &quot;found&quot; (by Europeans, anyway) because of the nightly bat flight.</p>
<p>Technology (ground penetrating radar, thermal imaging, etc.) is used occasionally, but it's not like people are finding cave entrances with technology. There are some caves where you can be standing within a meter and not even know the entrance is there; how those would be detected using technology is beyond me.</p>
<p>I do know of one cave that was discovered because it &quot;whistles&quot; from the airflow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand upon what's written below, sink holes are observed to see if they will drain water quickly with no apparent outlet. That could be a sign that there is passageway below the surface. Geophysical surveys are used to some extent, especially if the cavers are friends with a grad student or professor with access to geophysical equipment. A &quot;ping&quot; is sent into the ground and the data that comes back can be interpreted to look for voids below the surface. </p></div>		</li>
