			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow just reading up on it now. Insane. A whole years worth of water fell in 24 hours. Apparently the dams weren't really built for flood protection--just for irrigation. All I can think is, they weren't designed with the kind of safeguards dams are designed for today. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Taking the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/La_diga_del_Vajont_vista_da_Longarone_18-8-2005.jpg" target="_blank">second image</a> and its caption from the article:</p>

<p>The Vajont Dam as seen from the village of Longarone in 2005, showing approximately the top 60â€“70 metres of concrete. The wall of water that overtopped the dam by 250 metres (820 ft)[1] and destroyed this village and all nearby villages on 9 October 1963 would have obscured virtually all of the blue sky in this photo.[2]</p>

<p>The dam managed to mostly survive that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That dam's height was enlarged 3 meters after completion, it showed cracks after completion and was built 64 years ago by what I assume were inexperienced people.</p>
<p>Your question implies that all damn collapse quickly if water spills over.  If that were to happen, if the spillway were blocked or a valve defect, then most dams around the world would have so much extra capacity to with hold the extra water. What could happen then is erosion but that should not be an immediate issue by a concrete dam. Lets say there is a clay dam built along a river that floods, and then floods over the dam. That would cause erosion and could ever widen a hole in the dam so it breaks at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is such a surge that it reaches the top of the dam the water probably also contains a lot of debris like trees, I think those might cause an issue, especially since they can get caught then collect other debris and then suddenly surge as one big chunk of material.</p>
<p>The same way normal floods are exacerbated when cars and such start to float and knock into things causing damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, assuming a dam is meant to last at least a century, being able to withstand a 1000 year flood is still a 10% failure rate. Not impressive...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also recall reading in ENR or Popular mechanic that water spilling directly over a dam can quickly erode the earth under the dam itself. This apparently structuraly compromises it pretty quickly. Most dams have Giant Ramped drains like <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/f-china-hydro-a-20150608.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> that shoot the water far away from the foot of the damn to avoid erosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe OP means to ask...  Is there any math or extra force involved once the structure is practically being engulfed?  Maybe its built to withstand more side pressure and anything from above is detrimental?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, anything weighing in above wouldn't affect the integrity of the dam unless it was made of dirt. The problem comes from the water flowing over so rapidly that it erodes the earth at the base of the dam on the dry side. This happens quickly and causes the dam to fail.</p>
