<p>it's slightly different in Canada due to our healthcare system. Our resident salary is government funded and so the government determines how many residency spots they are willing to fund each year. This is in turn determined by things like patient loads and safety, job prospects (eg. neurosurgery jobs are tough to come by so there are fewer residents each year). So it's not as simple as just opening up more spots, because ultimately the money has to come from somewhere AND this person needs a job at the end of all of this 13 years of post secondary education.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, residency spots in America are funded by the government, too. Specifically by Medicare. Politicians are loathe to spend more money on Medicare. Residency positions don't keep up. Presto. Projected physician shortage of 90,000 by 2020. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhh very interesting. Did not know that. Are the physician shortages in primary care? In Canada they are funding a lot more family medicine spots and cutting other specialties. Also we don't necessarily have a physician shortage here, it's more of a disparity in terms of family medicine vs. specialties and also geographically more concentrated in urban areas vs. rural. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly the shortages is split evenly between primary care and specialty services, though the shortage of primary care is a large problem which has been getting more attention over the years. There are efforts to increase the attraction of primary care including increased compensation, benefits to medical education debt and some schools and some residency programs are emphasizing primary care as a career focus. Unfortunately, there is a large stigma against primary care in the US, though I don't imagine it's different than in other countries. Prestige is low and compensation is relatively poor than that of more attractive specialties. </p>
<p>We also have the urban-rural disparity, but this is in addition to the overall physician shortage. I do imagine it more heavily impacts rural areas.</p>
<p>To address the physician shortage, medical schools are increasing their class sizes and new medical schools are opening up. This will currently do nothing as the bottleneck is in residency (other than leaving increasing numbers of American grads with wasted education and the taxpayers with the medical school debt they will not pay off). Between MD grads, DO grads and FMGs, there are already far more applicants to residency than there are spots. </p></div>		</li>
