			<div class="markdown"><p>Three of my uncles were freemasons and they all have passed away two of which held high ranks, one of them was at one time the national treasurer. I'm interested in getting involved, when I spoke with the last surviving uncle he wanted to set me up with masons in Atlanta. I had just moved there and this scared me as I wanted to set up with a one of the places that I lived in because i was onlyt to live in atlanta for 8 months. He said I needed to be in that city and told me to let him know when I was ready. he fell ill a month before I moved and died in the hospital before setting me up with his friends. How can I get in line with the masons if I dont have my surviving relatives. His sons both became masons but they both &quot;shirked their duties&quot; as he said so I didn't want to go through them. My aunt was an eastern star but we aren't close and my other cousin who i am close to just graduated college and joined the military and she has so much going on in her life that I don't want to bother her.
At this point I'm not sure, I don't know much but I am interested. When speaking with my uncle and he asked me a few prerequisite questions like do i believe in a higher power, asked what my personal desire is in helping the world so when telling him about how I wanted to fight slavery (sexual, child, etc.) he said that would be something to bring up. I know of petitions but I don't know exactly what they are. Am I'm currently in the bay area but I have no kids. I don't know how long I will live here but how will moving effect me being a mason? Thanks for any and all help.</p></div>		</li>

Apparently the FM in my hometown was established by some Scottish dude so they go by diffferent rules than other places. I don't live in my hometown anymore but it was suggested to me to start in my hometown and &quot;transfer&quot; to FM near me. That way I'd stay on the scottish rules. </p>
<p>Maybe your uncle meant you to do something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will always take someone who is enthusiastic and wants to better himself. Just Google &quot;Grand Lodge of <your state>&quot;. The GL is the states governing body. It will have a list of all the local Lodges in the state. There are often several Lodges in bigger cities. Each Lodge meets at least once a month (the dates and times will be on the site) and often times has a social hour before or after said meetings. That is a good time to get to meet several people.</p>
<p>Its easier than you think to get started. Just contact the Secretary of the Lodge (again from the site) and setup a time to meet. If you are in a city with multiple Lodges I HIGHLY suggest going to all of them for a meet up. Each Lodge has a different culture, so you might find one more fitting to your personality than another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>32nd Degree Freemason here... The answers I'm seeing across these threads are pretty high level and don't really answer why people like it or why we have such a large membership.</p>
<p>I'm starting to wonder if there is a &quot;keep Redditors out of Masonry&quot; conspiracy by saying it's just charity, approving bills, etc... Of course the charity is very important, but there are many ways to be charitable without being a Mason</p>
<p>On top of what I have seen in these answers, there is the mystery, the sense of connecting to something ancient, unique views on history, politics, and spirituality.</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;behind closed doors&quot; work is about moving people up through the degrees. This is the very unique part of Masonry...where all of the symbols, wording, and non-public things happen. It's what bonds us together.</p>
<p>Personally, I have never been to a day of church in my life. What I saw from any church function I was exposed to (funerals, weddings, etc...) was a real turn-off to me. Masonry has helped fill what I think is a basic human need to explore spiritual concepts with a like-minded community. I didn't even realize I had this gap in my life, but once I joined, it's been very impactful and has helped me feel more complete.</p>
<p>Also, it should be noted that the experience can vary heavily lodge-to-lodge. My closest lodge is made up primarily of retirees. A nearby lodge has membership including the mayor, a couple of judges, attorneys, many police, and a couple of FBI. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>79Banana.. I'm a 32nd degree as well... but lets not confuse people.  Anyone that joins the Scottish Rite is a 32nd degree mason.  It is no higher than anyone else.  Not every mason has to join the Scottish Rite.  Every member is Master Mason and that's where everyone is level and the same.  No one is above anyone else.  If someone decides not to join the scottish rite they are still master masons just like the 32nd degree scottsh rite member. I just want to point that out as many see that and associate it with this &quot;high rank mason&quot; BS.  But regardless, everything else you said is spot on and really hits it on the head.  But also, I don't think we should compare a church to the lodge because it is not the same thing. Masonry is not an alternative to the church.  One can still participate in both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, good point on &quot;high ranking&quot; BS. Makes sense. </p>
<p>In regard to comparison to church...yes, they are independent, unrelated, and can coincide. My point is that I personally receive some benefits from Masonry that others may receive from a church (such as community and spiritual exploration). Since I'm not a churchgoer myself, this was an excellent personal discovery....it seemed to fill a void I didn't realize was there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES! This is the sort of discussion we should have on Reddit.</p>
<p>I too am a &quot;progressive&quot; thinker. When I decided I wanted to be a Mason, I spent a lot of time researching what was really required of me.</p>
<p>To be sure, no one will ask you if you believe in a bearded man in the clouds.</p>
<p>Rather, you will be asked if you believe in a supreme being. Simple yes or no, nothing more.</p>
<p>Still, I wasn't sure if I could answer that question ethically. Until I came across books written by Dr Robert Lomas, who holds a PhD in Physics and is a professor in England.</p>
<p>In his book Turning the Hiram Key, he discusses his research into how he could reconcile himself with the question.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are a scientist who is attracted by the fellowship and tolerant spirituality of the Craft, but are worried that you will be rejected because you are not a church-goer or a member of any particularly religious fath, let me offer you a choice of definitions of 'supreme being' from two high priests of cosmological science. I find both of them deeply moving and inspiring, and fully identify with them; either will allow you to answer honestly the question which guards the entrance to Freemasonry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then provides quotes from Einstein and Newton. There is an additional 4 pages on the subject, including a great quote from Stephen Hawking as well.</p>
<p>Basically, I marvel at the order we find across the universe. I can meditate on a visual of this. I can ask why the Universe even goes on about existing. I can engage in all practices of Freemasonry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The major difference is, while other organizations such as the Rotary, Kiwanis, KoC, etc are charitable organizations, we are but we also have the obligation of making our members better men. That's done through a inexhaustible amount of symbolic and allegorical teachings, which pull from a lot of mysterious symbolism (ancient builders, mathematics, etc).</p>
<p>It's worth noting that these Masonic symbolisms are kept secret not because they're nefarious, but so that it raises the importance of their lessons to the Mason. In other words, if someone tells you a fact, you might remember it, but if someone tells you a fact and tells you to keep it a secret, it becomes ingrained. It's also a way to bind the community together. We all share something - our secrets. Sure you can go to a library or online and start reading, but it has no context, no foundation.</p>
<p>As Masons we also share something unique - men who are seeking something more in life to the point where they'll literally go into something blindfolded to find it. What we're seeking doesn't matter - it's the journey not the destination. </p>
<p>I also suspect some of the mysterious weird symbolism is also to generate interest in people who are attracted to unusual subjects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Symbols were used to express ideas that were too complicated to put into words. Ideas transfer easier through symbols than words because words can be distorted through time. Symbols have layered meanings, require people to meditate on the meanings and can be displayed publicly so only those in the know understand true meaning while everyone else remains ignorant. Those who seek understanding of the symbols are potential initiates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The United Grand Lodge of England was founded in 1717. This was the first Grand Lodge. The records of individual Lodges go back into the 17th century. Sketchy allusions to symbolic or &quot;speculative&quot; lodges of stoneworkers go back as far as the mid 16th century.</p>
<p>None of that is the &quot;middle ages&quot; which has a fuzzy end-point, but most would agree ends in the 15th century at the dawn of the European Enlightenment. That Freemasonry is clearly a product of the Enlightenment is really not a point of debate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>secrecy was a big thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course it was. Some countries were so afraid of Enlightenment ideas that they literally killed or imprisoned Freemasons by the thousands (e.g. Spain).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'mystical' imagery from ancient egypt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that there's a lot of Egyptian imagery in Freemasonry is really not true. The Shrine certainly has a lot of Egyptian imagery, but the Shrine is also the least &quot;mystical&quot; of all of the branches of Freemasonry, so it's a bad example to start. Mostly, it's a philanthropic and social organization.</p>
<p>Mostly, Freemasonry focuses on allegory surrounding the construction of King Solomon's Temple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rotarians planned 911' theory probably won't fly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor will the idea that a decentralized organization focused on becoming a better and more compassionate member of society could either. But that doesn't stop conspiracy theorists from trying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very wrong.  There are two things that are not discussed in Lodge: politics and religion.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is where the secrecy comes from.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The secrecy surrounds the rituals and the means to be able identify another Freemason.  This comes from the times when operative Masons would travel from city to city for work. It would be trivial to say &quot;I'm a Mason&quot; but not know anything about actual Masonry.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also why many of the founding fathers happen to be masons.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a handful of the Founding Fathers were Freemasons, granted there were some important ones like Washington and Franklin, but Jefferson and Hamilton were not.  The ideology of equality and fraternity was definitely influential, but it was most definitely not some secret political organization as many would like to portray the Fraternity.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm going to have to ask you to cite some sources, there...</p>
<p>It was certainly true that Freemasonry was about Enlightenment philosophy and that also gave rise to a number of political philosophies, but that makes Freemasonry correlated with and not causal for those political views. I know of no record anywhere that even suggests that political ideologies were discussed in Lodge.</p>
<p>What Freemasonry did do was to lead by example. It is and as long as we have records, always has been a true representative democracy, electing leadership in each Lodge and in each jurisdiction every year (or multiple years for a jurisdiction such as the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts which elects its leadership every three years).</p>
<p>The success of that model definitely paved the way, intellectually, for men to view democracy as a valid form of governance! But we're not the Illuminati who, in the late 18th century, were definitely focused on political and social change... a sort of forced second Enlightenment that they thought they could bring about by removing monarchies. The Illuminati folded under the weight of their own politics and external rejection of their methods and lasted only for about 20 years.</p>
<p>This is one of the secrets to the success of Freemasonry: we keep religion and politics outside of the Lodge. Inside, we're all Brothers, but outside we might be political or even military adversaries. If you ever want some really wild stories about the extent of Masonic brotherly love, check out the history of Freemasonry in the US Civil War. Brother fought and killed Brother, it's true, but they also sat in Lodge together when possible and tended to innocent civilians as best they could.</p>
<p>Freemasonry endures not because it lurks in the background trying to control politics, but precisely because it's removed from that process. This is why Revolutionary War era Masons in the US had to very carefully segregate their attempt to throw off the yoke of British rule (which they did in conjunction with many non-Masons) and their role in the Fraternity where many of their Brothers did not agree with their goals or methods.</p></div>		</li>
