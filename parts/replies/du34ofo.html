			<div class="markdown"><p>Space has on the order of 1 atom per cubic centimetre. A 1 cubic kilometre bucket would therefore contain on the order of 10^15 atoms, which is much, much tinier than the human eye can see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we assume that all of those atoms are hydrogen atoms then 10^15 atoms would weigh about 16.7 nanograms. </p>
<p>16.7 nanograms corresponds to something on the order of a single spec of dust. So in theory if it caught the light just right in a perfect environment, you might see it. </p></div>		</li>
