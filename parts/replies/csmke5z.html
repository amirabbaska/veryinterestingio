			<p>This seems more like the correct answer than all the others.<br><br>&quot;He was in one episode of Arrested Development&quot; &quot;she was in season 3&quot; </p>		</li>

			<p>There are tons of rules like this for prepositions in English, but none that are not subject to multiple exceptions.  <br><br>The takeaway, I think, is that prepositions are wildly idiomatic.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wow. When I think about it, it's really messy. I'd say &quot;in House of Cards&quot;, &quot;in Game of Thrones&quot;, but &quot;on Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;on QI&quot;. Maybe in those cases I think of participants being &quot;on&quot; a stage vs &quot;in&quot; a movie set.</p>		</li>

			<p>in this case I think the usage is subtly different. I am not an english grammar expert so I won't try to name the difference, but you are talking about a featured guest as opposed to an actor, so different rules apply.<br><br>In the original it was more like &quot;John Hamm had the lead role on Mad Men&quot;, which sounds fine, but of course &quot;in&quot; would work there as well... I don't think either is 'correct', I think it is just a style thing.</p>		</li>
