			<div class="markdown"><p>Great ELI5 version, wish I could give more upvotes.</p>
<p>I've written AI systems for about a dozen different games now. And over the years I've helped on forums and places as young developers cut their teeth on writing game AI.</p>
<p>The key thing is that the player wants to have FUN.  The game developers could create a perfect AI that always takes the most optimal steps, but that is not fun for the player.  </p>
<p>To focus on fun, the AI for enemies, opponents, and NPCs are given combinations of rules that provide a fun experience and proper learning curve for the player.  It depends on the game, but typically in the earliest rounds the AI opponents will simply stand there as targets, sometimes having a minimal response when interacted with, but basically standing around as cannon fodder.  Designers build the game so that as the player gains skill, the game-controlled enemies become increasingly difficult.  Never so difficult that they cannot be defeated because that would not be fun, but difficult enough that the player gets satisfaction for overcoming the challenge. At the end of the game the AI can have full knowledge of the entire map and all kinds of additional information never shown to the player, but it is still fine-tuned to be a fun, difficult, and rewarding challenge.  You finish the game and shout &quot;That was AWESOME!&quot;</p>
<p>That balance is one of many difficult parts of a game designer's job. Most games go through hundreds of hours or even thousands of hours of fine-tune balancing to ensure the game is fun. Sometimes in a patch the company will modify the balance; players complain about &quot;such-and-such has been nerfed!&quot; but usually the game is more fun because of it.  The AI for enemies, opponents, and NPCs is all about fun, not about if the computer 'cheats' or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When CoD Ghosts first came out, the AI in the coop mode was insanely good. Really, really challenging, and I wasn't bad. One thing I noticed was some of the bots appeared to be YouTuber names. Like, the bots had YouTuber icons and flags and so on.
Did the developers add paths and algorithms from high-end players?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! This explanation illustrates the point that the video game's algorithm is to entertain the player, just like the aim of the algorithm here is to entertain the little sister. </p></div>		</li>
