			<div class="markdown"><p>So when the CDC are talking about UV they mean UVC whereas SODIS uses UVA and B. UVC causes DNA damage, but it can't pass through the oocyst of Giardia very well. UVA in SODIS reacts with the water and creates reactive oxygen species, they damage the exterior of the oocyst, UVB can do oxidative damage and DNA damage (it's the one that causes sunburn and skin cancer). With SODIS and Giardia you're looking at two days SODIS as opposed to the usual 6 hours. </p>
<p>This should show a link to what the oocysts look like after SODIS treatment. All dented. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Castro-Hermida/publication/6904888/figure/fig2/AS:268287355387915@1440976098604/Figure-6-Scanning-electron-micrograph-of-oocysts-of-Cryptosporidium-parvum-a.png" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Castro-Hermida/publication/6904888/figure/fig2/AS:268287355387915@1440976098604/Figure-6-Scanning-electron-micrograph-of-oocysts-of-Cryptosporidium-parvum-a.png</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. If you read the SODIS site it says 6 hours for Giardia: <a href="http://www.sodis.ch/methode/index_EN" target="_blank">http://www.sodis.ch/methode/index_EN</a>.  So are they being misleading?</p>
<p>Also, CamelBak is marketing their UVC filter as killing Giardia in 60 seconds, which also seems misleading. Is this complete BS?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When sunlight is used to disinfect water, is it the heating from the light that kills the bacteria or the UV radiation or something else? I'm confused, because according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, it is the rather short wavelength UVC radiation that kills germs, but it is absorbed by the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading when the method first came out that part of why it works is the increase in temperature. So for example, you can boil something for 5 minutes, or you can let it sit at 120 degrees for 20 hours.</p>
<p>Though I know for a fact that SODIS will work in low air temperature so that must only be for certain bacteria and definitely isn't the main source of the action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea it's mostly the UV. The experiments I performed used a heat sink to negate the temperature increase. Still worked really well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heating helps, it can get to over 60 degrees Celsius. But it's mostly the UVA reacting with the water and organics creating oxygenated radicals and UVB also does this but also causes DNA damage. Sunlight is mostly UVA with a bit of B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great comment, however there is an inaccuracy: a strain of Escherichia coli known as Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. Traveler's diarrhea will be non-bloody with a large volume.</p>
<p>Campylobacter is mostly found in poultry and is the reason to make sure the locals thoroughly cook chicken prior to eating it! This may cause bloody diarrhea.</p>
