			<div class="markdown"><p>To touch on the philosophical part about our attraction to flowers, plants want to attract pollinators to their flowers, so they had to evolve ways to draw the attention of potential pollinators to them. This is in effect a form a cross species communication. The plants need to signal other species that they are offering some type of reward in exchange for a visit. In order to attract a vast array of species to act as potential pollinators they had to develop some sort of communication mechanism that was broad enough to signal many species. The shared mechanisms that all animal species have to interact with their environment are light and smell, and possibly some sort of attraction to symmetry and certain color combinations. The flowers have exploited this in animals. This could be some sort of shared sense of &quot;beauty&quot; between different species based off of common ancestry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There we go. You and the parent lay it all out and close the loop here. They are exploiting our adaptation to fruit bearing plants. Or maybe not ours but because we evolved to see certain traits similarly to other pollinators it works on us too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly not only pollination. Red apples carry seeds. Mammals carry food or food waste and it ends up spreading. Isn't this why fruits are sweet and contain the seeds in the edible portion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>females like them because only healthy males can afford to spend energy on decorative appendages. being highly visable can also display health because only strong healthy animals can avoid predators while being bright colored.  weak genes can survive on camaflage alone. that isnt circular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think about science not being able to truly/fully tell us why we find something beautiful though? I subscribe to the idea that science can tell us about matter in motion through space and time but not fully about the realm of thoughts, feelings, emotions and spiritual experiences. </p>
<p>Edit: cool guys thanks for the thoughtful discourse and downvotes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you that there is a bigger question about why we humans care about beauty.  Yes attractiveness between humans is clearly linked with procreation and survival of the species.  But what about that creative impulse we have when we see something beautiful?  Why do we want to paint it, to photograph it, to write poems about it? </p>
<p>This theory about color is very interesting, but how does it explain my good friend who suffers from color-blindness, and who is an avid gardener?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thoughts, feelings, emotions, and spiritual experiences are composed of matter and energy.  Science studies those things.</p>
<p>We have not yet figured out the full nature of beauty.  But to say that we <em>cannot</em> seems about as wise as attributing lightning to Zeus.</p></div>		</li>
