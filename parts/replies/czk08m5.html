			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you - I will check out that link. Yeah, I guess I know about good bacteria etc. especially with all the recent talk about gut flora and the potential links to obesity and diabetes. What about on a larger scale? The Zika virus is dramatically shrinking the brain - so I guess I was talking about more physically noticeable or major.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where is the evidence that the Zika Virus is shrinking the brain? Honestly asking. Everything I have read shows that Brazilian officials &quot;linked&quot; the virus to Microcephally and that the only scientific evidence is that the link has not held up. I would like further reading on this, please.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right, and I was making an assumption that has not been clearly determined yet, based on the current facts.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study that showed no link between Zika and the cases of microcephaly? Could you link to it please, I haven't seen / heard anything from that angle yet. </p>
<p>It's fascinating, because if Zika isn't causing that epidemic of babies with microcephaly in Brazil....what is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, noticeable like - a mosquito can transmit these traits to others. And like a person can be normal, and then gets bitten by something, or contracts something, and then suddenly develops new abilities or physical differences. I guess, larger scale things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now, I aint no learned man... But I reckon because we's talking about mitochondra being part of our cells and all, he don't mean no prokaryoties. Les'sen you saying you's a single celled organismm. Now, animals I recall are having, whatcha call it? eukaryoties cells or sumthin, and they possibly early on in envelopution taking on bacteria or what not that turned into misosoupchondra. Now, they says this cuz mitochondra got that there, their own unique DNA inside 'em thats circular like, like that wacky bactoria, which is a prokaroyotie like ya talking about. and they're approximately the same in size too, that is mitochondria in eukaryoties, and bacteria bout the same size.</p></div>		</li>
