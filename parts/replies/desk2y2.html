			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking to recommend this podcast on <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/91500-emergence/" target="_blank">Emergence by Radiolab</a></p>
<p>It talks quite a bit about ants as well as other things and is incredible. Just for the uninitiated &quot;emergence&quot; is the phenomena of small, simple organisms forming and acting as a whole.</p>
<p>/u/qwertynous mentioned a different <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/226523-ants/" target="_blank">Radiolab podcast specifically about ants.</a></p>
<p>Even though I haven't heard the second (yet), I can still recommend it. Radiolab is just that good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may sound completely insane, which it is (especially if you have children): ants don't like cayenne pepper. Literally put a ring around your place. Don't throw it around, make a liquid with water as a base and put in a squirt bottle. Lay a thin line around your baseboards as close as you can get. Peppermint oil (NOT the sugar based type) also helps. Crazy, but it really helps. AND you get spicy baseboards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to note:</p>
<p>This only really applies to Claustral/Semi Claustral species. A parasitic species on the other hand will pick up on the types of markers of a species they aim to hijack and follow the trail.</p>
<p>Because parasitic species invade other colonies and steal their young or just take it over, they will indeed go 'looking for trouble' constantly!</p>
<p>So it could be that the species OP is dealing with all the time are roaming bands from a parasitic species invading a dead colony's territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true! Though aren't slave makers and other parasitic ants highly seasonal? I must admit, I don't have much knowledge of duolosis and other parasitic processes.</p></div>		</li>
