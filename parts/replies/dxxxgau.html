			<div class="markdown"><p>A super charger will improve economy as much as a turbo.  As long as you drove it economically.  The biggest upside to a supercharger is that because it’s directly related to engine rpm you get low end boost much quicker than a turbo.  However the supercharger will hit a limit and at high rpm does not deliver as much power as a turbo.  Also the parasitic drag on the engine is greater than a turbo (there is still some drag for a turbo). A top fuel dragster supercharger takes about 800 horsepower just to turn if I remember correctly.  There are other small differences, superchargers go right on top of the intake so on carbureted applications it’s compressing the fuel with the air, a turbo only compresses air.  Also turbos are typically intercooled.  Meaning there’s an air-air heat exchanger between the turbo and throttle body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aren't super chargers less efficient than turbos? Since they're being directly driven from the engine, there's no way to bypass it, whereas with a turbo, if you drive efficiently and keep revs under a certain range, it'll never trigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is correct. at higher RPMs there is a bigger parasitic loss of power with a supercharger and there’s a certain point where the parasitic loss from the supercharger would be greater than the power gained. </p>
<p>that’s why any high boost/high power applications use turbos instead </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The efficiency doesn’t come from keeping it from running. Since then the best economy oils be to leave it off the car. The engine is an air pump and the more efficiently you can fill the cylinders the more efficient the burn will be and the more power.  More power means better fuel economy to a point. Once you start going crazy and running high boost and rich mixture (to protect the engine) then your power goes to shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's absolutely possible to shut down the supercharger, VW/Audi (and probably others as well) use an electromagnetic clutch to disconnect the roots-blowers in some of their TSI engines at higher revs (turbos take over from there on). </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is such thing as a centrifugal supercharger which has a compressor very similar to a turbo's cool side, which DOES NOT sit on top of the engine.</p>
</li>
<li>Both superchargers AND turbos can go both ways when it comes to where the fuel is mixed. With fuel injection, fuel is almost always added post compression, but with carburetors you have two options; blow-through, and pull-through. Blow-through requires stronger seals and solid floats in the carb, whereas pull-through allows use of a standard carb but requires a compressor that can handle the corrosive properties of the fuel. AFAIK blow-throughs are the more common configuration.</li>

<li>I didn't touch on prochargers cause I'm not a fan and kinda see them as being worst of both worlds</li>
<li>I haven't seen a blow-through supercharger with a carb, or a pull through turbo, but I'm also not really experienced with anything carbureted because most everything I've touched has been injected.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re mostly right, superchargers create drag to produce boost, turbochargers use otherwise wasted energy. That SOTP feeling that comes from a proper supercharged car is special though. </p></div>		</li>
