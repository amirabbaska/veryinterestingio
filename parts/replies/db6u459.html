			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. They only received 1.4 billion and they paid back 1.1 billion of it by 1971. Meanwhile they were also paying 2.4 billion per year in war reparations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno. I haven't spent 30 minutes researching Japan's economic recovery.</p>
<p>Edit: This one only took 18 minutes of research.<br />
Japan's period of economic recovery was also called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_economic_miracle" target="_blank">economic miracle</a>. Like Germany, Japan also got USA money post WWII. During the Cold War, the USA was concerned with the growth of the economy of Japan because there was a risk after World War II that an unhappy and poor Japanese population would turn to communism and by doing so ensure that the Soviet Union would control the Pacific. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Trade_and_Industry" target="_blank">Ministry of International Trade and Industry</a> (MITI) was instrumental in Japan's post-war economic recovery. According to some scholars, no other governmental regulation or organization had more economic impact than MITI. MITI was created with the split of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in May 1949 and given the mission for coordinating international trade policy with other groups, such as the Bank of Japan, the Economic planning Agency, and the various commerce-related cabinet ministries. At the time it was created, Japan was still recovering from the economic disaster of World War II. With inflation rising and productivity failing to keep up, the government sought a better mechanism for reviving the Japanese economy. The close relationship between MITI and Japanese industry has led to foreign trade policy that often complements the ministry's efforts to strengthen domestic manufacturing interests. MITI facilitated the early development of nearly all major industries by providing protection from import competition, technological intelligence, help in licensing foreign technology, access to foreign exchange, and assistance in mergers.</p>
<p>Manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks teamed up in closely knit groups called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu" target="_blank">keiretsu</a>. The member companies own small portions of the shares in each other's companies, centered on a core bank; this system helps insulate each company from stock market fluctuations and takeover attempts, thus enabling long-term planning in innovative projects. It is a key element of the automotive industry in Japan.</p>
<p>So in Japan, they had US cash, a government ministry specifically designed to promote industrial and economic growth in Japan (MITI), and companies teamed up in groups called keiretsu to help each other out. This lead to Japan rapidly becoming the world's second largest economy (after the United States) by the 1960s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Culture matters and is important.  Wealth doesn't spring as much from natural resources, as the human capital which develops resources.  Imagine for a moment, if you have a devastated country, but an intelligent, hard-working, law-abiding and well-educated workforce.  Compare that with a country with say lots of oil, but a population with the antithesis of the human elements.  It is an interesting, age-old question which Adam Smith attempted to answer in his book, &quot;The Wealth of Nations.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
