			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a geography professor who was working on a degree in broadcast meteorology. He made this statement about the desert latitudes and pointed out that it hilds true in the US as well - at least in the southwest (Death Valley). The only reason it is not true in the Southeast is the Gulf of Mexico and the prevailing weather patterns that bring moisture north out of the Gulf.</p>
<p>Edit: Ok, enough with the Dead Valley comments, as I said below, it is a bad example, but it was what I came up with off the top of my head in that region of the country. What I've said still holds true for the SW US and the effect of the Gulf on the SE US.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so why is it not the same case with Arabian sea and Arabian peninsula? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's because the Indian Ocean is cooler than the atlantic, creating less rain. And because of various other pressure reasons.</p>
<p>Edit: Indian Ocean is warmer, but pressure differences keep air and rain from moving into the continent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ocean Temperatures. The Gulf is warm. Very warm in a fact, over 90F in late summer, allowing Hurricanes and tropical storms to thrive. In the winter it provides moisture to revive cold fronts after they get over the Rockies.</p>
<p>The reason SoCal and Chile are so dry is because the Pacific is very cold off the coasts there. The Indian Ocean is also cold.</p>
<p>East China, Korea, South China, Japan, etc are heavily forested for the same reason that the American Southeast is, which is that the western Pacific contains <em>the</em> warmest waters on Earth.</p>
<p>Australia’s West Coast is very dry due to it’s cold water currents. The East Coast is wet and experiences hurricanes occasionally, all because the currents are warm. </p>
<p>If prevailing winds and ocean temperatures are right, areas at 30 degrees can experience vastly different environments. Georgia (US), where I live has a nearly subtropical climate. It was October 5th and the high was in the 90’s with high humidity yesterday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk for sure but the two areas are vastly different. For one thing it's all about ocean current and wind patterns. The gulf of Mexico is also much wider than the Arabian peninsula which could allow for more evaporation in north America. The amount of land those clouds travel over is much more concentrated than the Arabian peninsula. Which is massive compared to the east u.s.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read (A Little History of The Untied States) that the weather in North America is so diverse because of the Appalachian and Sierra mountain ranges. That makes the continent sort of like a funnel that drives warm air up to the north in the summer and pushes cold/arctic air down south in the winter. This would surely keep it from becoming a desert. </p></div>		</li>
