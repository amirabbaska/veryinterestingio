			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, I once had a dry cleaner short me a pair of pants that wasn't on the ticket for some reason. The owner pulled up his crystal clear surveillance footage showing me drop off the pants a week earlier. Within minutes he was able to find the pants and return them to me. Surveillance magic!</p></div>		</li>
