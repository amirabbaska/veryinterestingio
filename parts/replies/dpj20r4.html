			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a lot of back pressure to force the blood up through your veins like in your arterial system, so your body relies on one way valves, and the action of your muscles contracting to force the blood towards your heart like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube.</p>
<p>So if you fidget by repeatedly flexing your calf muscles to bounce your knee up and down, yes you're probably helping circulate blood out of your legs.</p>
<p>Fun fact: as a physiotherapist, I often prescribe &quot;ankle pump&quot; exercises to people on bed rest or post surgery for this exact reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually yes. </p>
<p>The main mechanism the body uses to bring blood from the lower leg is the calf muscle. The squeezing of this literally pushes the blood upward a little at a time. With the help of valves to prevent back flow, the calf-muscle pump is the main way blood in circulated back to the heart from the legs.</p>
<p>Every time you're in a long plane ride or car ride people will suggest to stand up and stretch or walk around. Essentially the reason for this is to flex the calf properly as to avoid clotting.</p>
<p>So it does help, but to be fair -as a leg bouncer myself- the extent at which legs bounce is over kill. A couple good flexes takes care of the clotting factor. BUT moving your legs does reduce anxiety and increase focus according to studies I've read that I'm too lazy to site right now!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re standing perfectly straight without moving your legs for hours at a time, absolutely. But the body is amazing, as you continue to stand but not use your calves to squeeze blood back up the brain becomes aware that there is decreased return and you passout. It’s the brains way of making you lay flat to allow blood to move freely. </p>
<p>It’s why you see new soldiers, band members, and people at weddings passing out.</p></div>		</li>

I'd hate to think that once I stood up and started moving around again, I was going to force my heart to somehow process a strawberry jelly-like substance.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you are standing still the Blood in the veins in your feet Will reach max pressure in 30 secs. Walking and using legs muscles (muscle pump) helps blood in its way to the heart. Which is why you Can get uncomfortable if you stand still for a long period but feel nothing if you spend the same amount of time walking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ask anyone who has had to stand in formation (military, marching band): it is possible to pass out just from standing if you allow your knees to lock. The extra pressure at the knees prevents normal circulation. To counter this, keep your knees just slightly bent, and at regular intervals get as much motion without drawing attention to yourself (e.g. tense your leg muscles).</p></div>		</li>
