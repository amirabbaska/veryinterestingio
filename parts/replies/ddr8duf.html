			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, a little confused. Don't all I need to do to convert a gas to a liquid is to compress it?</p>
<p>Edit: why does compressing a gas increase the temperature? Wouldn't that limit the movement of the molecules?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the substance's phase diagram iirc, and so it would depend where you start and finish on the diagram.</p>
<p>However, if you use Gibbs equation (combo of first and second laws of thermo): dh = Tds + dp/rho, where h = enthalpy, T = temp, s = entropy, p = pressure, and rho = density (all stagnation quantities for simplicity, plus assuming a perfect gas), then you can integrate it out to find that pressurizing a gas increases its temperature.</p>
<p>Now, in reality, gases are not perfect, but the specific heat ratio that you would find in the isentropic relations does not usually have a broad range (most are between 1.2-1.4 for most engineering purposes, unless you have weird gases that aren't monatomic or diatomic). If you compress a gas, you will increase its total/stagnation temperature. At that point, stagnate the gas to increase its static temperature and cool it from there.</p>
<p>Edit: I should also say that no practical compression process is isentropic. All that means though is you will have to put more work into the fluid to pressurize it to your desired pressure. That results in the total temperature increasing more than the ideal amount. Same can be said of an expansion process (free expansion results in a total pressure loss, so your total temp won't drop as quickly either).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out the equation: PV = nRT, for the sake of your question, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. If you compress a gas, the molecules bump into each other more frequently and thus raise the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but this equation is only applicable on low pressure bases. But you are using it on a domain (gaz cooling) that is not intended to be used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a tennis ball being thrown at a wall.  </p>
<p>When the ball hits the wall it will have a certain speed. </p>
<p>If the wall were to move away from the the ball, the speed of the ball would be lower as the ball loses kinetic energy from traveling a farther distance.  </p>
<p>Same can be said of a gas molecule colliding with the surface of a container, if the container expands isobarically then the gas would lose kinetic energy, lowering the temperature according to the kinetic theory of gasses. </p>
<p>Since we tend to think of processes as being microscopically reversible then when the volume of a container decreases the temperature of the gas inside increases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to envision this process is to consider your air conditioner in your home (if you have one that is). The big bulky thing outside is a coil of tubing connected to a compressor which does the compressing of the refrigerant. That liquid, now at high pressure and relative temperature get's pumped into your home where that other big thing (the evaporator/air handler) lives in your attic, basement, or perhaps in a hall closet. It has a small restriction just as the hot liquid enters another coil of tubing. When this liquid passes into the relatively large volume of the coil at a lower pressure it expands and cools dramatically (because the refrigerant  has a very low boiling point). The air in your home is blown across the coil and you have glorious cooling. The refrigerant now gets pumped back into the condensor ourtside where the process starts over.</p>
<p>In the case of helium, the process is repeated without really adding the heat of the &quot;home&quot; in the example above and just get's colder and colder.</p></div>		</li>
