			<div class="markdown"><p>sleep scientist here.</p>
<p>It depends on the animals. Cats, rats, mice, dogs all have full WAKE, NREM sleep and REM sleep.</p>
<p>When it comes to rodents (i can speak to this best as I study it) we do not break the NREM sleep phases into 4 stages like in humans. We just call it NREM </p>
<p>What is different is the TIME they are in these states and the speed at which they move through them.</p>
<p>I study REM sleep in mice, so let me give an example. It is surprising that a mouse on average has about 80-90s of REM sleep  vs a human which has 90minutes. This is interesting because the question that one may ask is what does the animal accomplish in 90s of rem sleep that a human cannot.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is the transitions are MUCH faster. Animals move from wakefulness to NREM to REM sleep way faster than the amount of time we spend in each state before we transition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we are not really exactly sure but there are some theories.</p>
<p>Some people think it prune away the pointless information of the day and strengthens connections for particular memories and motor tasks.
Others believe the twitches that occur during total muscle paralysis of rem sleep allow for a mechanism by which the brain can test brain body connection and help properly identify the pathways by which each muscle is connected.</p>
<p>Sorry for the quick and short response, I am on my mobile at the doc office.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Periods of REM sleep punctuate the full sleep cycle in humans and make the sleeper easier to arouse than in other sleep states. It has been supposed that REM sleep has evolved in humans as a mechanism for protection against predators during the night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious about sleep apnea which I recently found out I have. If I'm waking up so many times an hour but don't remember it, is that dangerous just because of the fact that it's hard on your body (because you &quot;forget to breathe&quot;? Or is it dangerous because of the impact on your sleep cycles? Or both?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not that I am aware of. Brain size should not really matter, when we break down the brain into the circuits (what i study) that form behavior (in my case, my focus is sleep) it is cells. We are looking at the interaction between many cells from one region to another. Similar circuits may still exist regardless of brain size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been part of research that has identified a potential link there. In general, the rate of sleep/wake cycling does seem to correlate with animal size, and this may indeed be related to rates of metabolism, since sleep homeostasis is in part energy dependent. Metabolism is of course known to scale with animal size via an approximate power law relationship.</p></div>		</li>
