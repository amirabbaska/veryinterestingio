			<div class="markdown"><p>But shouldnt cable companies use the money they collect from internet subscribtions on maintanance on this infrastructure? Also, The idea of spending equal or more money on something like cable tv when you can have netflix, hbo etc. Who doesnt have fixed program scheduals or commercials seems insane and very archaic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>....they do? In mass when all the poles went down, comcast had people out there the next day to fix their lines and poles, the techs get paid from comcast who gets their money from the ISP monthly rate. And if you dont like that then youre shooting the wrong person, cable tv merely pays for the rights to access the channel and bring it to you, viacom/disney and content producers actually decide on scheduling and ads. Also, most channels now offer free on demand if you recieve their channel too </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but networks are paying for content, too, and cable companies are paying those networks... so an additional level of revenue split. Netflix pays to produce House of Cards. Comcast pays AMC for access to AMC's programming, and AMC pays to produce Mad Men.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and what I'm saying is that the people that want to send you the service also have to pay. The cable companies charge twice. It's not free to send video to you.</p></div>		</li>
