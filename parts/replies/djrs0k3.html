			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, for petty criminals, if they're caught with a handgun on their person at any time, then it's a minimum 5 years in prison. So <em>why</em> take the risk by having one?</p>
<p>If the police arrest you on suspicion of something, you can try to wriggle your way out of it as part of your legal defence. Deny it, use an alibi, fight it in court. But if you're caught carrying a handgun...well, you've kind of screwed yourself. You've just handed them clear evidence of guilt. You've basically handed the police a &quot;jail me for 5 years&quot; card. </p>
<p>I've once heard it described as, <em>imagine a handgun as a brick of cocaine</em>. There's no legal reason for you to be having that. And if any member of the public glimpses it, they're going to immediately call the police. </p>
<p>Nobodies going to <em>not</em> call the police. </p>
<p>So you'd be an idiot to carry it around.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> - Think of that scene from The Departed. Where Jack Nicolson's character is making a deal with some chinese gangsters. <a href="https://youtu.be/jtYDGff2tjg?t=66" target="_blank">And he mocks them for being stupid enough to bring automatic weapons.</a> ). &quot;It don't add inches to your dick, and you get a life sentence for it&quot;. Similar to handguns in the UK. It's a stupid risk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll note that this also doesn't exist for the most part in America. Everyone pleas out or they take a high risk of spending their lives in prison. For most people there's no <em>option</em> to defend themselves in court - defense lawyers are typically paid a pittance to show up and talk to the defendant for 5 minuets before court and advise them to plea out. You will not get a good free public defender in most of America unless you can talk him into doing charity work.</p>
<p>Sure, you'll spend a few more months in jail for having a gun on you when you commit a crime (without using it), but you'll spend a few more <em>decades</em> if you try to fight the charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do obviously have plea bargaining in the UK.</p>
<p>But mugging someone is likely to only get you a suspended sentence or a few weeks in jail with a bit of probation. Especially if it's your first offence (or first offence of that kind).</p>
<p>Add a knife? You'll probably get a few weeks behind bars, maybe a couple of months.</p>
<p>Add a gun? 5 year sentence, of which you'll probably spend at least 2 years behind bars.</p>
<p>The payoff just isn't worth it at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer but doesn't quite tell the who story just in terms of the &quot;cultural&quot; angle.</p>
<p>There is no mass gun culture to speak of in the UK, shooting sports are niche. As original commenter says, handguns are outright illegal and all other firearms heavily restricted. Firearms offences carry <em>very</em> heavy sentences.</p>
<p>In the UK, civilians simply don't see firearms as part of every day life, we mostly associate them with the military. This is the case in other countries, too, even ones where gun ownership is less restricted. The restrictions themselves don't fully explain the lack of ownership. The 'appetite' to own a gun in the UK is tiny, even if it was easier.</p>
<p>For these reasons, and the reasons original commenter lists, the police are vanishingly unlikely to face guns in most scenarios.</p>
<p>Police in sensitive areas may be routinely armed (e.g. palace of Westminster. The recent knife attacker was shot by a routinely armed officer, not an armed response officer, I believe.)</p>
<p>Police officers on foot do not routinely carry firearms but there are constantly armed and available officers in patrol cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, in Northern Ireland the police do routinely carry firearms. When I grew up there I don't think I ever saw a police officer not carrying a firearm.</p>
<p>Mind you, we did have the Troubles for a long time, plus a few centuries of violence against each other. Bit different than the rest of the UK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question. How well trained are the police in Great Britain in terms of firearm training?</p>
<p>I only ask because in America, they carry their sidearm with them constantly, but they are very poorly trained for the most part. If you could see what it takes to qualify, it is truly abysmal. </p>
<p>Being a regular at the range, when you see the officers practicing the day before they qualify, it's really embarrassing (although I am sure there are a few who practice on their own paying out of pocket to become proficient or just because it's fun)</p>
<p>In my mind I expect the British police to be better prepared with their firearms than US police, despite not carrying regularly, but I would be interested to hear from someone who might know better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what? </p>
<p>I do have knowledge of the US police qualifying requirements. I even said I am at the range next to them while they practice. And I speak to them while they are there. My range is literally attached to the police station.</p>
<p>I also expressed my preconceived notions, but also expressed my uncertainty and asked for someone with more knowledge to provide me with more information about the British police training and qualifications so I could better understand the differences between the two. </p>
<p>I have no idea how you came to that conclusion.</p></div>		</li>
