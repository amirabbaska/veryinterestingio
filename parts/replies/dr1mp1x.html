<p>This is why if you run into a mountain lion while hiking you never run, because you will stimulate its innate response and it will chase on instinct. Instead you make yourself as large as possible, make noise and otherwise communicate you are not a deer or coyote for snacking on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aren't they stealthy predators, though? Meaning if they wanted to attack you they would jump on you without you seeing them first? And that if you want to avoid trouble you should just make a bit of a ruckus so they know you're coming and get out of the way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>large cats are known for stalking prey for a long time until they can go in for a sneak attack but they aren't always flawless machines and can get spotted.</p>
<p>many such predators will usually give up on the prey once said prey is aware of them and looks threatening enough because it doesn't matter if they get the kill in the end if they get a nasty wound for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that making lots of noise (bells, stomping, clapping, talking, singing) is generally good practice if you're hiking in an area with lots of bears -- same reason: let them know you're there, you're pretty big, and you're not going to sneak up on them/startle them. Not sure if the same applies to mountain lions, but wouldn't be surprised if it did. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just because that can happen doesn't mean that's always the only way you'd ever come across one.  it's entirely possible to stumble upon one in the woods randomly.  they're rare enough that neither scenario will really happen to you though.  but if you did just happen to come face to face with one on a trail, don't run away like a prey animal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To help combat this type of boredom, the Louisville Zoo (and others) rotate their animals between enclosures in a way that stimulates the animals.  In addition to having random rotation schedules, sometimes they'll put a predator animal in an enclosure that had a prey animal in it the previous day, and vice versa.  An example of this is the sumatran tiger and the asian tapir.  The tapir scent marks over where the Tiger has been, and the Tiger spends the day trying to hunt the source of that tapir smell.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe as the scent fades over time the enclosure rotation happens again and to the predator it seems like they've caught the scent again in a new environment and they're perpetually close on its trail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My cats are still trying to catch that red dot.  They think it lives under the refrigerator, because that’s where it appears from and goes to hide.</p>
<p>It’s a lot more about stimulation and exercise.  They love stampeding through the house and I usually bring the red dot out at night before bedtime.  The cats sleep longer if they’re burned out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually seems like a great compromise between providing the animals with the stimulation they need and not having to give them live prey, which probably wouldn't go over well in North America.</p></div>		</li>
