			<p>Yep, frozen water stays around freezing temperature, but the air gets waaay colder than that. Add to that its insulating effects by trapping heat that the wind would otherwise carry away... theres a reason the Inuit build homes out of snow. </p>		</li>

			<p>Har. <br><br>You're not wrong, but they could also have built homes out of hides, like teepees and yurts and such. </p>		</li>

			<p>Which they also did.  It depends more on the resources available.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep. In the summer. :) they packed them away in the winter because snow worked better. </p>		</li>

			<p>Really? I'd think igloos/snow homes would be so much more useful in summer.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is not true, snow will eventually reach ambient temperature, it's not like it generate thermal energy and keeps itself at 0 degrees.<br><br>However, snow is a much better insulator than air.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's also the reason I build my kids an igloo which also doubles as an outdoor chill hut. It's pretty easy, just take a roughly cubic storage bin, pack it with snow, and you have a brick. Assemble bricks into igloo, easy as can be!</p>		</li>

			<p>I've seen Roosevelt elk with snow on their backs in the winter. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is also why voles create tunnels under the snow during the winter.  The temp close to the ground under the snow is much warmer.</p>		</li>
