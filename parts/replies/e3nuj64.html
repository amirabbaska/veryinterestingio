			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Starvation mode is definitely a myth. Even in the oft-cited study &quot;proving&quot; the existence of starvation mode, the participants were <em>still</em> losing weight under severe restriction (albeit at a reduced rate). When their calories went back up, so did their metabolisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like a propane stove. If you all of a sudden realize that your tank is almost empty, you can turn the flame down to make it last longer and use less fuel...but you are still using fuel. Your body is burning calories no matter what. Even if you could somehow tell your body to turn the heat down so to speak in order to conserve calories, you <em>are still burning some</em>. You have to in order to live. As long as the amount you're burning, whatever amount that is, is higher than what you're taking in, you will lose weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your metabolism will fight this though, and any minor excess in calories is stored as fat.</p>
<p>I agree you can still lose weight being hungry all the time like this, but it's hard to build muscle and be functional when your body has 'turned down the heat'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There’s a reason why it’s called starving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one with even a gram of brain matter has said that you don't lose weight in &quot;starvation mode&quot;.  </p>
<p>The problem with it is that you also lose muscle mass and it can have an impact on your well being while you are in it ( in terms of mood and energy )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started counting calories recently. Holy shit, I always knew milkshakes were bad, but didn't know just HOW bad. Dude, you could eat an entire other cheeseburger for the same calories, sometimes two! At that point, one gives you so much more food than the other. Maybe this is the secret to dieting? Next I'll realize that you can eat 200 carrots for the same calories </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This so much. Half of cleaning up your diet is learning which foods fill you up &amp; which don’t, then reducing what you don’t need. Essentially, how to feel full with fewer calories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No joke. I lost 57lbs over the past 16 months just counting calories with an app and tracking what I eat. No additional exercise or even really changing <em>what</em> I was eating, just the amount. I still get pizza and Chipotle here and there. I just keep a handle on how much. 57lbs lost just from that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are losing muscle but you will not lose all of it. I'm at work right now so I can't get into it all but you may be interested in looking up Cut and Bulk cycles. </p>
<p>Basically when lifting ( or whatever working hard on your fitness goals entail) you'll need to eat at a surplus to increase muscle mass. The downside is you will also gain some fat. When you think you're too fat you can start the cut and go back to a calorie deficite- you will lose fat but also some muscle. Rinse and repeat until you're at your desired goals, be it muscle mass, body fat percent, whatever, then just eat at your TDEE </p>
<p>Note that these are months-year long cycles and are not once every other week</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you fast there is some initial lean mass loss before the body snaps into ooh, fasting!  Then it scrounges proteins from autophagy and becomes much more efficient at recycling proteins and you excrete less.  Then you mostly burn fat with a little protein.</p>
<p>Short term or intermittent fasting is better, IMO, because you then do eat and the body doesn't rely as much on lean mass.  Mostly that's to make glucose.  Taking it easy on fast days and exercising on feeding days seems to work well for people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found IF is much easier than constant restrictions on my eating. I've been doing a 4:3 eat:fast cycle each week and doing cardio on the eating days. I've lost 15 pounds overall but definitely gained some muscle mass as well.</p></div>		</li>
