			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed won’t affect the pitch of the sound directly. The only effect speed has when moving through a magnetic field is determining the strength of the induced electric current. A random mess of signals from induced current won’t sound like anything but noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't magnetic sensors. They are RFID sensors. Same concept as an access control card you would use to enter a secure building. The tags in books are the cards and the gates you walk through are the readers. The gates send out an electro magnetic signal that is picked up by the antenna in the book tags which then charges up a capacitor in the tag. The tag then has enough power to transmit a signal back to the gates that identifies it as being ok to pass or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Librarian here...Many libraries with big budgets have RFID, but most of us that do not, do in fact use old fashion electromagnetic sensors.  RFID wont cause noise in your headphones, but the older style EM gates will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The older gates are just RF. RFID has unique identifiers for each tag. RF just sends a signal that something is present for all tags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am aware that they are RFID sensors, but RFIDS are essentially electromagnetic field generators which detect when specific antennae move through them. Which is what I described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah i guess that would increase the magnetic flux, and dexreases the time. so that would create a bigger force thus higher sound right?
(sorry if it's not totally correct, magnetism at school is a while back)</p></div>		</li>
