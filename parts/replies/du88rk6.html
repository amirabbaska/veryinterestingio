I keep hearing how it’s good to have your kids play in dirt to help develop their immune systems. Wouldn’t a bottle of your own bacteria be a handleable challenge for your body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria in your mouth are under control. Your mouth is a sufficiently hostile environment that they can’t grow enough to become dangerous. What we’re talking about is moving them to a more favourable environment, letting them breed, then consuming a large amount of them all in one go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could imagine if you leave the water in the bottle for too long it could eventually get to a point where your immune system couldn’t handle it (especially weaker immune systems). </p>
<p>If I’m putting in the effort to carry around water though, I’m consuming it that day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most if not all city tap water systems use Bleach, or Chlorine.
The is injected into the water right before it is pumped out to the populace.</p>
<p>Bleach and or Chlorine is used to control the growth of microbiological things. The closer you are to your water treatment plant, the more chlorine will be in your water, compared to someone towards the end of the line.</p>
<p>Most water treatment plants, over chlorinate the water (still not enough to even hurt you) to make sure there is no biological growth in the line, or in your house water line while it sits to be used.</p>
<p>Now when you fill a water bottle with this tap water, can close the lid, that chlorine is trapped. It slowly off gases and leaves the bottle each time you open it, meaning less chlorine to stave off microbiological growth.</p>
<p>Next time, fill a water bottle half full of water, let it sit for half a day, then open the top and smell it. Generally it will smell like a pool, that means your water has enough chlorine to control growth.</p>
<p>Long story short, If you fill up your water bottle, and drink it, you will be fine. Don't leave them empty with a little water left in them for too long, or you can get algae or mold growth. But you are safe to re-use them constantly.</p>
<p>But if you need to refill the bottle that much, invest in a real stainless steel water bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add that if you live in an area that uses bleach, as is becoming more common in the US, that the chlorine smell only shows up when the free chlorine has been consumed.</p></div>		</li>
