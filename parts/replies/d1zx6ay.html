			<div class="markdown"><p>Really this is just saying that for your typical yellow G-type main sequence star in the main galactic disc, you'd expect a certain amount of metals (i.e. elements other than hydrogen and helium).</p>
<p>There will be some natural variation among those stars depending on the exact formation history. Some of them will have a bit more metallicity, some will have a bit less. Our Sun happens to be on the &quot;bit more&quot; side, possibly due to to being a later generation star formed out of the material of multiple supernova explosions.</p>
<p>The fact that we observe our Sun as metal-rich is actually not too surprising when you think about it. There's a strong correlation between the metallicity of a star and the chance of it having planets. The fact that we are here at all to even observe anything depends on us having a planet, and the probability that any planets formed around the Sun is increased by the Sun being metal-rich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The planet occurence-metallicity correlation only appears to apply to giant planets. Smaller planets are observed to form around stars with a wide range of metallicities. So perhaps the Sun being metal-rich is not surprising in the context of the existence Jupiter (and perhaps Saturn), but we expect Earth-size planets to form even around low metallicity stars.</p>
<p>This is likely telling us about the formation process -- e.g., the need to build up a large core before runaway gas accretion can occur (and the fact that there is a finite amount of time to do this before the gas disk dissipates). At least for the gas giants from which this planet occurrence-metallicity correlation is derived (e.g., roughly Jupiter analogs and shorter periods), the dominant mode of formation is thus unlikely to be gravitational instability, which doesn't require a core to form. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not strictly true. While the metallicity correlation with giant planets is very strong, there's still a significant metallicity correlation with terrestrial planets. </p>
<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7830" target="_blank">Wang &amp; Fischer, 2014</a> showed that while the planetary occurrence rate around metal-rich stars is a whopping 9.3 times higher for giant planets, it's also 1.7 times higher for terrestrial planets.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought the big majority of stars had planets? Doesn't higher metallicity just mean more, and rocky, planets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun <em>is</em> unusually metal-rich for its age, type, and location in the galaxy.  This is not in contradiction with the disk mostly consisting of Population I stars, since those stars have a range of metallicities.  The boundary between Population I and II is not a sharp dividing line, and is typically set more by kinematics (how the star is moving relative to other stars/the Galactic disk) and metallicity together than raw metallicity, but a good rule of thumb is that if a star has [Fe/H]* &gt; -1 or so, it's probably a Population I star.  Notice that that means that a Population I, &quot;metal-rich&quot; star might have only ~10% of the Sun's metal content!</p>
<p>Still, that leaves the question of how can we say the Sun is unusually metal-rich.  Well, when we look at stars in the Solar neighborhood, particularly young open clusters, we find that many/most of them are about Solar metallicity.  This is surprising, since you would naively expect the open clusters to have much higher metallicities than the Sun, as they are much younger.  But they don't; the Pleiades (~120 million years old) is sitting at [Fe/H] = +0.042 <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0511" target="_blank">(Soderblom et al. 2009)</a>, M37 (~550 million years) is at +0.045 <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3063" target="_blank">(Hartman et al. 2008)</a>, and the Orion Nebula Cluster (just ~1 million years old!) is at -0.01 <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1840" target="_blank">(D'Orazi et al. 2009)</a>!  The Sun would seem to be a bit unusual having as high a metal content as it does, being 4.5 billion years old.</p>
<p>Note on the [Fe/H]* scale for those unfamiliar:  this is the ratio of iron to hydrogen in a star relative to the Sun, placed on a logarithmic scale (base-10).  So the Sun has [Fe/H] = 0, since log(1) = 0.  [Fe/H] = -1 means 10% of the Sun's iron, 1 means 10 times as much iron, -2 is 1% of the Sun's iron, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it will solve the problem cited in the article, but the metallicity of the Sun has been shown to be lower than previously though (by Asplund and collaborators, but I don't remember the exact year now, the guy publishes a lot).</p>
<p>Also, it has been proposed that the unusual composition of the Sun is due to planet formation: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...508L..17R" target="_blank">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...508L..17R</a></p></div>		</li>
