			<div class="markdown"><p>I just cannot relate to your taste. I saw the hobbit movies in 48 as well and I wound up walking out of the movie I hated it so much. It completely breaks all the fantasy of watching a movie, If I wanted to see a live play I'd go to a theater, not a cinema. It destroys any semblance of immersion whatsoever, and completely ruins the experience for me. It also didn't help that the movies were shit lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting, I actually read a lot about similar opinions to yours online at the time, but for me it just breaks the immersion when the mountain in the background while panning or anything in fast scenes just stutters across the scene..</p>
<p>But I am also used to 120 Hz gaming and I notice very fast when my driver decided to switch the monitor back to 60 Hz and it just feels off.</p>
<p>I know I am way more sensitive towards this issue, as my gf never understands what I'm complaining about in the cinema :D</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't get this. I have never noticed this to such a degree as you are describing in other 24fps films. Especially because modern film making uses super fast cuts in order to simulate fast action scenes without actually having to film them happening. Look at how many cuts happen in fight scenes in movies today, versus how many cuts happen in fight scenes in movies 30 years ago. Your eyes can actually follow the punches in older movies, whereas your brain has no fucking idea whats going on in modern ones. This is intentional because its a cost saving measure and still drives the point home that something exciting is happening without having to actually act it out. The movie Taken is a prime example of this, I think it has the world record for most cuts in an action scene lol where it takes over 6 cuts to show him jumping over a fence.</p>
<p>I also play high end PC games, and I agree that the highest FPS is ideal in that scenario, but that is a wholly different experience than a film. I truly believe that 24fps is integral to film immersion. So much so that when I play older movies on my 4k TV, I turn off ALL HD effects, all smoothing effects, and all up scaling effects so that I can actually lose myself in the film. </p>
<p>Go watch a movie like scarface or conan the barbarian with your 4k options turned up, and then watch it with them all removed. It's a COMPLETELY different experience.</p></div>		</li>
