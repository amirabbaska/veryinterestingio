<p>Also: their commentary is scripted/directed. The whole point is to generate lots of drama.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's done via casting and editing and probably partially as a tiebreaker in 'who goes home', not via scripting or directing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I directed some reality tv style ads a while back and one trick to get them to talk in the present tense about something that happened hours or days ago  (harder than it sounds) is to prompt them: “you’re right back in it. Tell me what you’re thinking.”  And keep prompting them with summaries they’ll repeat and expand on. Them “it’s really hard. I didn’t know what to do”. Me “you’re scared!” Them: “I’m scared! I keep dropping the ball” Or... me:”you need to beat her or...” them: “I need to beat her or I’m screwed!” And then you give excited praise when they give you good stuff, fan the flames, etc. </p></div>		</li>
