			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer I've come to accept after looking into goes something like this: <strong>yes</strong> language definitely affects how we think, but it does not constrain how we think. Language is like a box and most of what we think about is inside that box, but language doesn't stop us from thinking outside the box once we know the box is there. Sometimes we have to invent new words, and sometimes we just have to see things in a different way and language can adapt</p></div>		</li>
