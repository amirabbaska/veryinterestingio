			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all correct, but I will point out that for the most part, they aren't even shooting the lasers at the DT pellet in the NIF anymore; they found that uniform compression was basically impossible with the UV light of the lasers given its coupling with the ablator.</p>
<p>They've now moved to what's called indirect drive, which shoots a gold hohlraum around the capsule, which is reemited as X-rays, which then compress the capsule.</p>
<p>They're also going to try some direct drive experiments again on the NIF (shooting only at the poles of the capsule), but the takeaway from NIF is.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They need a laser 10x as energetic as what they have </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They need it to shoot X-ray instead of UV.</p>
</li>
<li>They couldn't figure 1) or 2) out until they built the original laser in the first place. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you're sorta wrong on NIF, the way the lasers were designed it was always for indirect drive. They actually can't really study direct drive on the NIF because of this, the lasers are asymmetric in order to shoot the interior of the hohlraum, this was a big complaint. NIF was a big investment to be restricted to indirect or polar drive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were plans at some point for direct drive targets at NIF. I don't know when in the planning phase they were scrapped in favor of a indirect/PDD only approach, but they did exist at one point. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the biggest complications of that is that it slows down everything. There is always something your previsions and calculations didn't account for, which has to be learned trough experimentation: when you have to build a car engine, this is pretty fast, but when you need to build these enormous and advanced facilities, it can take several years and if there was just a tiny something you couldn't predict, you possibly have to wait other 10  years to include that.</p></div>		</li>
