			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be true for farmed salmon that use artificial coloring. Wild salmon is almost red and stays very pink after being cooked. Farmed salmon is a more orange and cooks to a more neutral color. I bet it's the food dyes that are breaking down in farmed salmon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wild salmon staying red (meat) largely depends on diet.  The reason farmed salmon might have more or less red in the meat is they are not naturally hunting for prey, they are fed a very similar thing to power bait, which is just like play dough.  They dye it sometimes to get more of an orange flesh color.</p>
<p>Pacifica and Atlantic salmon vary as well.  </p></div>		</li>
