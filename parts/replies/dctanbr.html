			<div class="markdown"><p>Peach often has real peach bits. Black Cherry used to be a very common flavor, but has fallen sort of out of style, it had lots of fruit bits.
I would guess raspberry and blackberry are out because you get pips that are hard, but that's just a guess. In order to remove the seeds you'd end up with a mush that would just blend smooth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want bits of raspberries and blackberries you get seeds.  Nothing worse than a nice ice cream full of goddamn blackberry seeds.  I know, I've eaten it and hated every bite.  Still ate it because it was tasty but damn those seeds.  Never again though</p></div>		</li>
