			<div class="markdown"><p>And from a chemistry perspective, &quot;octane&quot; isn't even actual <em>oct</em>ane. Real octane is a parent chain of 8 carbon atoms; what's commonly called &quot;octane&quot; in fuel is really 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, with a parent chain of only 5 carbons. The reason why it's called &quot;octane&quot; is because the trimethylpentane molecule has 8 carbon atoms in it, but they're not in a chain</p></div>		</li>
