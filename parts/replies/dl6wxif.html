			<div class="markdown"><p>I flew into LGA during heavy fog a few years ago and as a passenger with a window seat I couldn't see the runway until we hit it - hard.  I assume that was an instrument only approach and that the software is trying to get that bird on the ground - and not with the normal grace of  pilot flying by hand. </p></div>		</li>
