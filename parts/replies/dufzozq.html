			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m interested in knowing why there seems to be a stigma associated with wearing masks specifically in America. Typically only immunosupressed people wear masks. There’s a fairly serious flu outbreak this season. Are masks really very effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, masks are associated with preventing yourself from getting sick (hospital workers wear them). In Asia, the masks are a form of politeness intended to prevent from spreading your sickness to another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wearing a mask makes one look less attractive. In America other people assume you are doing so to protect yourself and must have something really bad which leads to people reacting negatively and keeping their distance and other social slights. </p>
<p>In Asia it is seen as being more concerned about others and therefore is respected as a form of self sacrifice for the good of the group/community. </p>
<p>Now precisely why these different views exist is a tangled web of culture and historic experiences that I'm not able to sort out. The population density and smaller distances of personal space in Asia undoubtedly contribute as well.</p>
<p>I do wish we would have a public education campaign to encourage mask wearing. And more legally mandated sick days for employees would be an even bigger improvement in public health imo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it. </p>
<p>I have recently decided to get into selling masks.</p>
<p>I now know my marketing campaign thanks to you.</p>
<p>Commercial of sick people in America to Asian countries.</p>
<p>Commercials of mask wearers in Asia to Americans.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You ask an interesting question, because viruses are very small and easily pass through standard surgical masks. However, some studies have shown that masks can help limit viral spread, despite their limitations.</p>
<p>Any type of barrier probably provides protection. In addition, wearing a surgical mask is a constant reminder not to touch one's face.</p>
<p>America has a very strange approach to communicative diseases. We don't like the idea that others may blame us for their illness and a mask can seem like a social reproach. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's probably the reduced flow of air and liquid particles carrying viral pathogens that are helping there.  Even if the virus can pass through the mask, it's no longer being carried in vaporized mucus and driven by a 100mph sneeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's the idea that the person wearing the mask must have some terrible contagious disease, and that they need to wear the mask to prevent them <em>spreading</em> their disease. </p>
<p>When you go to a medical clinic in the US and think you have the flu, they make you wear a mask. </p></div>		</li>
