			<div class="markdown"><p>While the accident contributed to Concorde's downfall, the real reason was they were losing money and only keeping the plane as a &quot;national pride&quot;. </p>
<p>The Air France flight that crashed had run over a burst tire of a DC10 that ruptured the fuel talk, so there was no real malfunction of the Concorde. </p>
<p>Edit: it ran over a metal strip which burst its own tire that ruptured the fuel tank. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I'm going to add that the plane, despite all of its beauty and elegance, was an absolute monster to use. The start up procedure alone is ridiculous, it's ancient technology, and would need a full refit to ever have been used commercially. </p></div>		</li>

BA didn't want to keep supporting them but they didn't want anyone else to have them either and refused to sell them to him, selfish wankers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Concorde crash and the subsequent discovery of McDonell-Douglas' use of Black Market parts for DC10's, thanks to the discovery of the metal piece on the runway, also led to the DC10 being pulled out of the passenger airliner market.</p>
<p>For short, Don't use unapproved parts on your aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It hit metal debris on the runway during takeoff.  It wasn't like there was some glaring defect in the design of the aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The metal debris was from the plane that took off before. The wheel went over it and flicked it up into the fuel tank, which caused an explosion despite not actually piercing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The metal debris caused a tire to explode, and flying rubber debris created a shockwave in the tank, causing a rupture in one of the weak spots of the tank. The leaking fuel caught fire, but no explosion. Due to fire they had to shut down one engine which lead to loss of thrust causing the crash. A whole series of unfortunate events...</p></div>		</li>

<p>The flight was successful, the landing event for the press went exactly to plan, and everything seemed poised for success. And then, just thirty minutes later, the first plane hit the World Trade Centre. <em>Concord's return was overshadowed by about the single worst thing that could possibly overshadow it.</em></p>

<p>holy shit. I didn't even know about the concord flight!</p></div>		</li>
