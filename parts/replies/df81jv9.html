			<div class="markdown"><p>Why hold off?  He can just say &quot;It gets darker as you get older, just like getting taller and growing facial hair&quot; and leave it at that.  Talking about hormones and puberty is a bit outside the the typical knowledge that has been taught to 5 year olds so far as I am aware, but I think they can understand the idea of getting taller and growing more hair with age.</p></div>		</li>
