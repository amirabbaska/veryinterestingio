			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't answer definitively, but my best guess would be that the nerves would alter themselves back to the way they were before the initial weight gain, i.e. nothing significant would be different. The body is good at growing/losing weight and adapting to different circumstances to maintain homeostatic (including nervous) equilibrium. </p>
<p>Just a guess though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, youâ€™re absolutely right. If an individual were to lose weight and thus require less sensory feedback, then the nerves would become desensitized, thus responding to and sending fewer sensory stimuli back to the CNS </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything you say, but I'm thinking that if you have more inputs coming in than your brain would have to dedicate more brain matter to processing that so i'd disagree that it's only restricted to the PNS. Not sure though so hopefully someone smarter can say what they think.</p></div>		</li>
