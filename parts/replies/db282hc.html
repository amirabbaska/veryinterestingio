			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics tells us that if the conversion is allowed, it will happen with some probability.  Relativity says these conversions can happen, subject to restrictions (conservation of quantities like momentum and electric charge).  Sometimes these conversions are very likely, and sometimes they are very rare.  The collider brings the objects to collide together at high speeds, and one sees what comes out.  Part of the purpose of the LHC and its associated experiments is to determine the rates at which different objects are produced; this tells us about the fundamental forces of nature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on the idea of 'allowed' conversions; our best model, the Standard Model, includes - in a sense - a list of interactions. These allowed interactions are all the possible ones that conserve a few different kinds of charges. So, for example, interactions have to conserve the electric charge of the constituent particles. So all interactions that conserve the electric charge (and some other charges) are 'allowed'.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are a set of conditions that have to be satisfied for a conversion, or interaction, to be allowed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they're continuous in the sense of being a loop. but it's pulsed and unlike a railgun, which accelerates by using magnetic forces and running a high current through the projectile, the lhc works more like a coil gun: pulling and pushing a particle without touching it but using electrical gradients instead of magnets for pushing and pulling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beams in accelerators where there's RF involved are generally not continuous. Although there are machines like CEBAF which provide continuous beams. The beams as the LHC are &quot;bunched&quot;, meaning they come in discrete pulses of many particles at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forces due to magnetic fields do no work on charged particles; you need electric fields to actually increase the kinetic energy of the particle.</p>
<p>To bend and focus, you can use either electric or magnetic fields. But magnets are more convenient in practice.</p></div>		</li>
