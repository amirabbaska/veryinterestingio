			<div class="markdown"><p>The kernel is the central controller of the operating system. Now we are entering the software side of how a CPU works. </p>
<p>When you have just a raw CPU, one of the first things you need to program is an assembler, which allows you to write programs in assembly, a basic programming language that has English keywords and is decipherable to a human. The assembler converts assembly into machine code, which is the 1's and 0's for the processor to use. Programs are run from a processesor's memory. </p>
<p>The next thing you write is a compiler, which takes higher level coding languages you've probably heard of like C++ and Java and converts those programs into assembly, which is converted into machine code by the assembler. </p>
<p>My knowledge of operating systems isn't incredibly detailed so someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe most of the OS(and it's kernel) are written in higher level languages, and it's purpose is to allow the computer to be used much more easily, by providing stuff like a visual and an audio interface, and take in input from the keyboard/mouse              </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're substantially correct, yea. </p>
<p>There are basically two &quot;parts&quot; to an operating system: The kernel and &quot;userland&quot; (or &quot;userspace&quot;). </p>
<p>The kernel is the only strictly required (though, without userland applications like a console, windowing system, file navigator, etc..., it's going to be difficult to use the computer).</p>
<p>The kernel is the lowest-level software interface to the physical hardware of the CPUs, memory, networking, storage, input/output devices, etc. The kernel also present a software interface (aka an API) to the userland applications, so that they may consume computing resources.</p>
<p>In metaphor: Imagine a railway network. You have the rails, the switching tracks, the signals, etc..., all the stuff you'd need to operate multiple trains safely. This is the kernel. The trains themselves are the userland applications. The network is completely functional without the trains, it just wouldn't be very useful.</p>
<p>For Windows, Linux, and Mac, the kernels are all written in C and some assembly. Windows uses C++ for its userland, Mac uses Objective-C, and Linux is a great mix of C, C++, and Python.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite right. I've done some machine language coding (did tb303 emulator with programmable step sequencer for c64 for ex) and the amount of simple routines you need to write is very laborious and handling complex stuff get REALLY complex, very fast.. Whereas with higher level languages we don't need to think about them in that detail when you think in individual instructions, we don't need to write tons of different variations from the same code that accepts just a bit different input or modifies the function based on other conditions. Abstracting the hardware layer allows us to move into much, much higher level. And all that is done because we can't speak machine... Trying to keep every instruction in your own human memory is almost impossible in 64kb, let alone 64mb. And if you have 64mb that is a SMALL program these days... The complexity is on another planet these days and there is absolutely no way we can do that without moving to languages that are more... complex in their grammar and construct. I can read and understand small snippets in machine code and yet i can do massively complex stuff with higher level languages. Not because i'm good but because people much, much clever than us have invented these high level languages and thousand of brilliant coders have written lots and lots of modules and extensive documentation how to use them. Using those is really not that hard, at least when you compare to the hardware level.. But the potential goes thru the roof, the possibilities open up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't far off...</p>
<p>ELI5: Imagine two people, named Software and Hardware separated by a vast distance, (from a bit's perspective, the distances are VAST) and the only way to communicate between the two, they need to make use of this other guy named Kernel to get messages between each other. Kernel works for this other dude named Operating System which manages which messages have priority.</p>
<p>When we talk about a kernel, we are referring to a part of the operating system (windows, mac os, linux, ios, andorid, etc), and in particular that part of the operating system that bridges the software layer with the hardware layer (which was described very well by /u/jamesd5th.) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I choosed not to get into too much detail for simplicity's sake. If we're talking about the actual working of the CPU then yes, the registers play a role in keeping the current state of the program (instruction pointer and flags) and hold the data during the fetch stage. I also could have mentioned the ALU in the execution stage, but kept to the most basic example for the sake of eli5. Those details were also covered by other answers I've seen at the time of writing.</p></div>		</li>
