			<div class="markdown"><p>An ex of mine watched Titanic what felt like a hundred times... so basically the value of that movie was greater than a a game I put 40 hours in. In a time of netflix, amazon prime I hardly see a reason to buy movies anymore. Since I can not just sink a few 100 hours in a game anymore I consider buying the newest games or just wait 6 month...</p></div>		</li>
