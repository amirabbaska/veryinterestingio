			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never had a fitting for my contacts. When ever I have went to get new contacts they always check the stock of available prescriptions.
Now my eyes are pretty bad -8.5 so there is usually only a single box and rest get ordered and shipped to my house.  Hell I remember requesting the blue visibility tint because it was harder then hell to find a clear lens in solution with my bad eyes. </p>
<p>I just find it hard to believe that they somehow magically only have a single box of my correct strength and that they were specially fitted to my eye. </p>
<p>Looking at the box of my contacts I see nothing about the size, or curvature. I only see the strength, and expiration date. </p></div>		</li>
