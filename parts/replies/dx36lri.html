Additionally, increasing both sodium and potassium the correct amounts to keep membrane potential the same will <em>still</em> cause a buildup of chloride.</p></div>		</li>

Anything higher needs a script, but sodium chloride doesn't??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this was in response to a specific public-health issue. Potassium causes the body to retain less water (contrary to how sodium can cause water bloat), which is why it's popular with bodybuilders preparing for competitions (where dehydration contributes to the &quot;shredded&quot; look). People have died from ODing on potassium in preparation for competitions or simply to looks svelte, hence the ridiculous restriction on K supplements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A high concentration of ions in solution is called hypertonic. There is some rationale for what the OP is saying and high potassium diets have been tried to counteract hypertension / high sodium problems. The results have been mixed as I recall. Cells in our body concentrate (take up) potassium (K) and excrete sodium (Na). High sodium diet causes hypertonicity and high blood pressure but it also makes it harder for the Na/K ATPase pump that people are taking about to concentrate K and excrete Na because you have to work against the extra high Na gradient. K is an ancient, critical ion, the major intracellular ion of our bodies. Some people might be helped by increasing their dietary K. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Understanding this requires quite some basic knowledge in biochemistry / cell physiology, but I'll try to break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All cells in the body are electrically charged: In total, you have more positively charged particles outside of the cell than inside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In nerve cells (neurons) signals are transmitted as electric impulses called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" target="_blank"><em>action potentials</em> (APs)</a>: For a very short time (milliseconds), and on a very small portion of the neuron's surface, positively charged sodium ions can flow from the outside to the inside, thus creating a &quot;spike&quot; in the cells's electrical potential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This flow of  sodium ions is facilitated by so-called <em>voltage-gated sodium channels</em>. These proteins form channels from the outside of the cell to the inside and only allow sodium ions to pass. They are activated by a voltage spike caused by neighbouring channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For neurons to work properly, the rate at which these APs are generated is very, very important. When they fire too fast or too slow (depending on the type of neuron), seizures can happen</p>
</li>
<li>Mutations in sodium channels can alter their properties, resulting in a changed firing rate. This is how mutations in sodium channels cause epilepsies</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in your case, I'm not totally sure it's actually sodium channels that cause it. I've admittedly only scanned the wiki page for JME, but there it doesn't mention sodium channels at all, rather calcium channels, chloride channels, and GABA receptors, which all have different roles than sodium channels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here. From a little research it looks like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy can be caused by a mutation in the SCN1A gene that encodes a subunit of an important sodium channel. It looks like different mutations of it can cause different childhood epilepsies. </p>
<p>These sodium channels are absolutely key though. In a normal neuron, when it sends an electric signal, it does it by opening sodium channels and letting sodium rush into the cell, and that makes the charge inside the cell become more positive, thus “exciting” the cell. The problem when the sodium channels are mutated is that they might let too much sodium in or open when they’re not supposed to (lots of different mutations though so I’m not sure which one causes SJME). Either way, that makes the neurons hyper-excitable which leads to them exciting too much and at inappropriate times. A seizure is then basically a group of neurons that are way too electrically excited, leading to too much electrical activity in areas of the brain and what you would see as the symptoms of a seizure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for SCN1A being implied in JME? Because I can't find anything in the literature.</p>
<p>Also, SCN1A is expressed in interneurons. Consequently, most epilepsy-related mutations are actually loss of function, causin reduced firing, and thereby reduced inhibiotion of postsynaptic excitatory neurons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just comment from the medical end and I'll try to make it palatable because it gets a bit cluttered. First off, JME is an idiopathic disease with its etiology (source/origin) that is not entirely certain thus far from our studies. In terms of what is abnormal, neurons are partially dystrophic, meaning partially disturbed developmentally. On top of this, there are variants which have different abnormal ion channels or receptors depending on the type/mutation.</p>
<p>Now, with abnormal channels/receptors, they have disrupted function. Their normal functions, to put it a bit simplistically, include activation or inhibition (halting/diminishment) of certain pathways. For JME, it is overall Central Nervous System overexcitability. Thus with the pathways I mentioned, the activating ones are either too active or the inhibitory ones are too diminished (so they can't block activity), depending on the mutation type.</p></div>		</li>

Too much sodium say through consuming too much salt upsets the balance of the pump. Equally, too little potassium. The answer is to eat the right amount of both minerals but not too much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. PPIs block a transporter which exchanges potassium outside the acid-producing stomach cells with a hydrogen ion (i.e. proton) from inside the cell - this is the “proton pump”, which is the final step in gastric acid production. The drug targets this to stop the acid production. Sadly if you want to avoid lifelong drug therapy, dietary intake of electrolytes does not affect stomach acid production. But it’s much better than having oesophageal cancer!</p></div>		</li>
