			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the point. It's not about making an enjoyable experience for you. It's about tricking you into scrolling further and further so you see more ads.</p>
<p>Remember, the only reason any of these sites exist is to show you ads. Period. Get uBlock Origin, get /r/pihole, get Blockada. Your attention is the most valuable commodity on earth. <em>Stop</em> wasting your time and attention looking at fucking ads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Get uBlock Origin</p>

<p>There is something <em>a lot better</em> that you can do than simple ad-blocking.</p>
<p>Install &quot;Ad-Nauseum&quot;</p>
<p>It is an ad blocker so effective, that Google literally hardcoded Chrome to prevent you from using it.</p>
<p>The way it works is that, rather than blocking all ads (and therefore creating a you-sized hole in their algorithm's feedback), it instead clicks <em>all</em> ads. This ends up providing two major benefits:</p>
<p>1) It screws up the profile of &quot;you&quot; that the ad companies have. You overwhelm them with noise. If a lot of people do this, it really fucks with their demographic statistics.</p>
<p>2) It ends up costing the ad companies a lot more money, since these aren't &quot;legitimate&quot; clicks, and do nothing for the people buying the ads. So, the people buying the ads end up wanting refunds, costing the ad companies time to process to refunds, and making their customers less likely to return.</p>
<p>I should probably re-iterate this here: it is so effective that Google, the top dog when it comes to constructing customer profiles and selling them, panicked so hard that they literally prevented their browser from utilizing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;If you don't pay for something, you're not the customer; you're the <em>product.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>^(edit: It's an expression, folks. It's pithy for the sake of being memorable, and for the sake making a point that is accurate, <em>generally speaking</em>. Everything in life is always far, far more nuanced than can adequately conveyed in a single sentence. Including this one. And most people understand this -- at some level, at least. Calm your tits.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are we talking about reddit specifically here? Because it seems like in the last few weeks my front page has stopped updating. I get one list of threads at the start of the day and that's it, that list stays almost exactly the same until the next morning. </p>
<p>My proof of this is that for the first time in 3 years I've started browsing All and Popular. Up until this month I could browse a few pages, take a break, and when I got back on their would be at least some new content. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually made me want to scroll <em>less.</em> When it was chronological, I scrolled until I knew I had seen everything (which took longer than I’d care to say). Now that it’s all jumbled up, I stop after 10, maybe 15 minutes, because why bother to keep scrolling when it‘s pointless to try to see everything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just quit Facebook in part because of this. My friends had started telling me about their posts <em>in person</em> because I never saw them on my feed. So all I was using it for was Messenger, and that's functionally no different than just texting someone.</p></div>		</li>
