			<div class="markdown"><p>Thick vs. thin is all a function of the number of strata.  Thin has 4, thick has 5.  Each stratum can be many layers of cells thick.  Calluses increase the thickness of the stratum corneum (of memory serves).  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The genes for skin color operate on at least 3 loci.  The effect send to be additive.  The more genes you inherit for color, the darker you are.  You can inherit 0-6 individual genes for color.  If  two parents are each medium skin toned, with 1 color gene at each locus, they could combine to produce any possible color combination in their children, with the 3 copy combination being most likely, but 0 and 6 copy combination being possible as well.  That why you occasionally get things like twins, where one is apparently black, and one is apparently white.  For example: <a href="https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/images/photos/people/graphics/twins2.jpg" target="_blank">https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/images/photos/people/graphics/twins2.jpg</a></p>
<p>The gene for for palm color seems to operate within the domain of overall pigmentation for that individual.  It controls what fraction of potential skin color is expressed on the palms.  You can have up to as much pigment in the palms as the rest of the body, but not more.  Patches of increased volar pigmentation are often a sign of melanoma.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why are thick skin present only in palms and sole ? Friction can't be a factor here as others commented bc the armpits and pubic region face a lot more friction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not due to friction.  It's a specific adaptation for the skin we use for grasping and traction.  It's also the only totally hairless region, and the only places with finger prints.  It's the party of your skin you interface with the world with.  </p>
<p>The terms thick and thin refer specifically to the number of layers present in that type of skin.  This skin has 4 strata, basale, granulosum, spinosum, and corneum.  Thick skin has basale, <em>lucidum</em>, granulosum, spinosum, and corneum.  The thick skin does callus a lot more than the thin skin though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider evolutionary pressure. Friction between your arm skin and torso skin is pretty tame compared to walking on and handling stone, wood, tree bark, sand, etc all day. You can see first hand (heh) the protective response of palms and feet if you observe people who do manual labor, lift weights, or walk barefoot regularly.</p>
<p>I don't know the science behind all this skin talk, but I a sure that &quot;friction&quot; refers to significantly more stimulus than armpits experience. </p></div>		</li>
