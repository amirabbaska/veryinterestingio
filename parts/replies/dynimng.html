			<div class="markdown"><p>To make the differences clearer, though, a human can eat too much and will suffer ill effects as a direct consequence of excess blood glucose and the proliferation of storage structures, whereas &quot;overfeeding&quot; a plant isn't really possible since their uptake is passive. In a pathogen-free environment, a plant that has abundant nutrients available would simply keep growing (unlike humans, that have a less flexible growth pattern).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where does overwatering come into play with this? Once I overwatered an aloe plant and it got very swollen. When I touched it the skin broke and the aloe it contained went everywhere.</p>
<p>Edit: I want to thank everyone for their replies and for helping me gain a better perspective of the science behind overwatering plants!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overwatering causes oxygen loss in the soil as the plant and bacteria consume it with no way for gases to penetrate the water logged soil.</p>
<p>Lack of oxygen causes bad bacteria to start forming that will often eat plant roots and/or emit toxins that kill the plant roots so they can eat the decaying organic matter. </p>
<p>This is why chronically over watered plants 'wilt', they lack enough living roots to absorb enough water. By this stage the plant will often die even with corrective treatment. </p>
<p>By converse, hydroponics, the art of growing plants in water, can grow plants submerged in water because the water is constantly oxygenated. In flood setups the medium is chosen so that water drains away and is replaced with fresh oxygenated water often (a few times a day generally) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at a plant nursery. Overwatering causes root rot which kills the plants from the root. Don’t know exactly what root rot is from a scientific prospective but I believe it’s a fungus that grows and feeds on the roots</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you overwater a plant, water typically tries to force its way into the cell, which can make the plant cell swell up and become soft. This can make the cells more fragile, and more likely to break if you touched it. (A good comparison is squishing a balloon that's super-full of air, if you squeeze it too much, it pops.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, excessive nutrients do cause problems, as they will cause problems trying to absorb other nutrients from the soil.</p>
<p>In extreme conditions, excessive nutrients (salts typically) will even prevent the plant from being able to absorb enough moisture. </p>
<p>Excessive nutrients can also cause stunted growth, especially in young plants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often see warnings that flower species adapted to poor soil will need staking in rich soil - am I correct in assuming this is because the excessive nutrients lead to the stems being floppy instead of rigid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photorespiration would be more analogous to malnutrition, imo.</p>
<p>In short, photorespiration occurs when high concentrations of oxygen are present and the result is that the plant loses CO2 with no gain of energy. So, if oxygen is present, the plant loses some weight in the form of CO2 (but in total, it can still 'put on' weight).</p>
<p>You could call it 'overfeeding of O2', but since O2 isn't really what the plant 'eats', similar to how we don't eat O2, I think it's the wrong metaphor.</p>
<p>Certainly, in terms of 'being fat', photorespiration isn't the process we're looking for.</p></div>		</li>
