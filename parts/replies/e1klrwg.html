			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. As an additional point, you are converting from digital to analog signal. Digital signal is made up of samples and bits. The louder the signal, the more bits you utilize, the better your signal sounds. So not only are you reducing preamp noise, you are actually increasing the fidelity of the signal.</p>
<p>A simple way to think about it is to start at the source. You want maximum gain at the first part of the chain (as long as you aren't clipping). Just like when you're recording an instrument, or voice, you want that signal to be as hot as possible before you have to add gain with the preamp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as you're using a DAC that supports a bit depth of 24 or higher—and most decent sound cards do nowadays—the extra fidelity provided by a louder signal is unnecessary. Especially due to auditory masking, the extra dynamic range provided by a signal with more depth than 16 bits, which already has a -96 dB noise floor, is completely pointless unless you are listening to music at volumes loud enough to damage your hearing quickly.</p>
<p>And with many DACs on the market, you absolutely will have clipping at 100% volume due to the nature of digital-to-analog conversion. Each value in a digital stream represents the amplitude of a smooth analog curve at a discrete point in time, and the amplitude of the signal can overshoot the maximum/minimum value that the DAC can output by up to 2-3 dB during the periods in between, with the resultant chopped-off waveform peaks potentially making loud, busy parts of a song sound harsher.</p>
<p>As for how much the increase in noise floor and distortion from greater hardware amplification matters in reality, that is a function of the impedance and sensitivity of your headphones as well as how gracefully your amplification stage reacts to being driven harder. With most headphones, it doesn't really matter unless you're cranking up the hardware volume near 100%.</p>
<p>e: As for whether changing volume at the individual program level matters, it may or may not, depending on the program. With anything competently designed, it shouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if I’m streaming audio and the remote server increases the volume, that will consume more bandwidth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to the other answer...</p>
<p>If compression is used (which it will be), yes.</p>
<p>Deliberately-over-simplistic-and-not-how-mp3-actually-works example: if you have a 16-bit super-low-volume stream sampling between 0b0000000000000000 and 0b0000000011111111, the most significant (first 8) bits will always be 0 and so will compress really well. If you are running at a higher, we'll-normalised level and you range up to 0b1111111111111111, the entropy (variety of numbers) is going to be much higher and it won't compress so we'll and the higher-volume bandwidth will be marginally higher. </p>
<p>Now, there are all kinds of other factors (mu-law, wavelet-based-compression, variable-rate encoding etc.) that make this answer subject to variables in the encoding, but the result of such a debate would generally be &quot;OK, so it does make a <em>small</em> difference.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Think of it more like low volume is wasting bits: if each sample is represented by 8 bits, a loud sample would be 11111111 and a quiet sample would be 00000001, so the same number of bits are sent either way. The difference is that a quieter signal uses fewer of the bits that are sent, since they're effectively locked to zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm using a direct from pc to headphone connection would it increase the quality of the signal if I were to get a cheap amp? I always assumed a cheap amp would degrade the signal more than it would boost it since I don't listen to particularly loud music to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean a different DAC (like an external USB-connected headphone amp)? Yeah, that would likely yield a higher-quality output.</p>
<p>But if you’re using cheap headphones anyway, you’re not likely going to notice a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily true. I tested a well reviewed USB DAC, the Dragonfly, and could not tell any difference testing between it and the built in headphone port on my MacBook with a number of high end headphones. Turns out Apple puts a decent DAC into their laptops. If you aren't having line noise issues or volime issues you're unlikely to see a benefit. Also it's important to note how much misinformation and pseudoscience there is in the audiophile community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you aren't having noise issues or problems with volume it's unlikely. Some headphones require a more powerful input, and need an amp to produce a quality sound, but the 518s do not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, this is true. In practice, I am not sure it matters. Most headphones are connected to a DAC. Both software controls only affect the power produced by the DAC, so they are largely equivalent unless you are doing some kind of mixing of different audio channels. The inline volume control on most headphones sends a signal to the software to change the volume on the DAC. Very few analog headphones have an actual rheostat built-in. So, I don't think it matters in most cases.</p>
<p>For bluetooth headphones, it is much the same thing. The DAC is in the headphone itself, and very often the master volume on the device is synced with the master volume on the headphones. Even when it is not, it is still altering the signal while it is digital, so it shouldn't affect quality unless there are multiple channels.</p>
<p>For USB headphones, the DAC is on the headphones themselves, so any volume control is likely falling into the same situation as the previous examples.</p>
<p>TLDR: it will only matter if there is an actual rheostat somewhere, which is rare on modern portable technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call it very rare that rheostats are used. For earbuds or headphones made for use with phones, yes, these have TRRS connectors a up/down button to signal volume changes. If it's a wheel then it is a rheostat.  A lot of headphones like say, a good quality set from Sennheiser or Audio-Technica, have a rheostat and TRS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true in practice as well, because software volume reduction reduces the bit-depth of the signal, which results in reduced dynamic range. You're essentially reducing the amount of information used to describe the sound.</p>
<p>All software volume controls should be maxed out whenever possible for the highest quality sound. That isn't always an option, and the casual observer may not notice, but it remains the truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Volume has no effect on bit depth. Bit depth is  a function of how the sound was encoded, not the volume. </p>
<p>PCM waves work by taking a sample of a sound a certain number of times per second and encoding the data using a certain number of bits per sample. All the bit depth does is: &quot;limits the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the reconstructed signal to a maximum level determined by quantization error.[1]&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, higher bit depth means that there is less rounding errors when encoding and decoding an analog signal, so you get a more precise signal. It has nothing to do with power or amplitude of a digital signal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have spotify/itunes, my pc/mac volume, and external speakers.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd ideally want both Spotify/iTunes and your PC volume at max. Lowering either of them will provide less signal to the hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what kind of speakers you are using. If you are using purely analog, amplified speakers with rheostat, then you should turn up the volume on the computer as high as it will go without the sound quality suffering (overwhelming the preamp with too much power can cause crackling and popping).</p>
<p>If it is a USB speaker with a digital control, it doesn't matter. </p></div>		</li>
