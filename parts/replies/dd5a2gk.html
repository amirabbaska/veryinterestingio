			<div class="markdown"><p>not exactly. evolution favors what works, not what's optimal. there may be a better position for the balance organs, but ears came first and worked well enough</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer sounds backwards to me.</p>
<p>The problem with thinking that the vestibular system evolved in the ears because that's where the body experiences the smallest aceeleration is that there is no reason to propose that the head experiences smaller acceleration... unless the vestibular system is located in the head. Even then, I'd argue that the chest experiences less acceleration than the head.</p>
<p>One piece of evidence for that is that the vestibular system is located in the inner ears for most mammals. Think not only humans, but also monkeys, chimps, rats, and sloths. These animals have largely different body structures and their heads can't all experience the same types of acceleration, even with respect to the rest of their bodies. If you assume that sloths spend most of their time hanging on trees, then their heads experience <em>more</em> acceleration than their bodies.</p>
<p>I don't know of any study for how the sense of equilibrium came to be, but if I had to hypothesize, based on ToE, I'd say it's probably located where the body is able to retrieve the most important pieces of information from: it tells you where your head is going and the orientation of what you are seeing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First and foremost the reason why all sensory systems are in your head is they develop close to your brain because that where the processing happens that makes those systems evolutionarily useful in the first place so they may be further improved. </p>
<p>Of course, you could then ask why don't those organs develop further to be elsewhere. But those systems would only move if there was some pressure for them to move or if it was more useful for it to be elsewhere. Staying close to the brain has a lot more advantages than moving further away as it means shorter nerves, therefore less lag when transmitting information which allows faster processing and more interaction with other systems (as it is the case with the eyes/vision). Also, since the brain is much more susceptible to trauma compared to the rest of the body it is more useful to know the motion of the part containing it over any other part. The position in the ear and having two opposite points of measurement are just such reasons why that system would move elsewhere but at this time no reason comes to mind why it would be useful to move any further.</p>
<p>As for the acceleration thing, maybe the chest does experience less, it would be inefficient to accelerate that large mass too much when moving but most animals tend to stabilize/level their head with their neck (the sloth moves so slowly any acceleration maybe somewhat irrelevant). Then again the vestibular system is very useful for that task, maybe its development helped animals not only balancing further allowing faster more agile movement but also stabilize their head so it helps with the visual input. But that is just somewhat educated guesswork.</p></div>		</li>
