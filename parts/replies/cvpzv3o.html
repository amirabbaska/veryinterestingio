			<p>Or set an alarm on your phone.  It IS important to take your pill within the hour of your scheduled time.  This keeps your levels at an adequate level for reasons u/ArmyTiger said.  But taking it at the same time is a good plan.  Better to be safe than pregnant.</p>		</li>

			<p>Right and wrong. If you're taking progesterone-only pills, they need to be taken with 30-60 minutes of 24 hours apart, otherwise the effectiveness is almost 0. For estrogen/progesterone combination pills, you just need to take it within about 24 hours of when you were supposed to. Lots of physiologic reasons for that, but the ELI5 answer is that the combo pill has two drugs and the progesterone pill only has one, and two is better than one.</p>		</li>

			<p>30 minutes to an hour!?!?! I was always told &quot;as close as possible&quot; &quot;ideally within 3 hours&quot; and I'm sure it said in the leaflet &quot;if you miss the time and take it within 12 hours that day, you're covered&quot;. I think maybe thats the newer wave of progesterone-only pills though?<br><br>I often took mine a couple of hours late, once 11 hours, and never got pregnant. Got a Mirena eventually. I'm now ironically worrying that I'm infertile or something. </p>		</li>

			<p>If you miss progestin by 3 hours late, you're supposed to use backup contraception for a week.</p>		</li>

			<p>I just looked it up - it seems like some progesterone only pills are 'low dose' and some are 'intermediate dose'. With the low dose only ones it affects the build up of cervical mucus and prevents ovulation about half the time. The medium dose ones prevent ovulation over 97% of the time and have the same effect on the mucus. I was on Cerazette, and while information I found on it isn't that clear, I remember being told that it had a 'much longer window than traditional prog only pills'. So I'm guessing that was one of the intermediate ones - and maybe the timeframe isn't quite as important if its almost certain you won't ovulate? Obviously more important than the combi pills, but still. I found a leaflet from when I took it and it says &quot;If you are <em>more than 12 hours late</em> use contraception for a week, so I suppose it must be different?<br><br><br>I was talking with a friend recently about all of this. We were saying how we've used contraception and never been pregnant. But then we know so many people who used contraception and became pregnant anyway, you start to think &quot;Maybe its just me? Maybe I can't have kids and I don't know yet because I've never tried? Maybe thats why I've been 'lucky'?&quot;. You're torn between being thankful you've never had a kid in a position where you weren't ready to look after them and paranoid that means you can never have one. Being a woman is fun...</p>		</li>

			<p>THIS! If you are prone to migraines with neurological symptoms, you cannot have added estrogen in your system. My doctor told me if I couldn't remember to take my progesterone pill within the hour (half an hour on each side) of when I was supposed to take it, I might as well not bother taking it at all. I'm hopefully getting a Mirena soon.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; neurological symptoms<br><br>Can you elaborate what constitutes neurological symptoms of a migraine. I know some people get light spotting which I have never had.<br>edit: All symptoms of a migraine are neurological? </p>		</li>

			<p>My sister has really awful migraines that give her tunnel vision, light headedness, and the inability to speak. It's the scariest thing ever because she literally cannot say ANYTHING but um and make hand gestures. It's like she has had a stroke. (Yes she has been to a doctor and this is normal)</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not really an authority on this sort of thing, but I know symptoms can be (rarely) other than visual, although it could be hard to link them directly to migraines. If you get symptoms before you get a migraine, it's called an aura. I get partial loss of vision in my right eye (the side I get my migraines on), which looks like a blurry spot the same colour/texture as the surrounding visible area, as if my brain had a blind spot there and was filling it in very poorly. Sometimes I feel really high, as if I had done a bunch of acid and it hit me all of a sudden. Sometimes it's barely noticeable. Other people get fragmentation (parts of the scene you're viewing appear where they don't belong, as if you had cut and paste small fragments).<br><br>I think any unexplained disruption of your senses followed shortly (within an hour) by a migraine could possibly be explained as a neurological symptom of it.</p>		</li>

			<p>My dad gets migraines much like another poster described being like a stroke and having vision problems. I've never had light spots, maybe I get slight vision problems but it's hard to say since I try to keep my eyes closed I also get incredibly nauseous but after throwing up I usually become so exhausted and drained I fall asleep immeadately and wake up feeling better.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd consider anything an aura if the symptoms are persistent and consistent enough that you can tell you're about to get a migraine when you experience them, and then you do. I don't think I'd be able to fall asleep while having a migraine, so I don't know if that's what you're experiencing. You usually experience the aura before a migraine starts, not after. Not everybody who has migraines experiences an aura. I would talk to a doctor. </p>		</li>

			<p>Looks like it's a combined OCP so it has both Estrogen and Progesterone.<br><br>Edit: And I don't even think you can get estrogen only pills, it's either progesterone only (the time sensitive ones) or combined tablets. The implantable ones (Mirena / Implanon) release progesterone only, I believe.</p>		</li>
