			<div class="markdown"><p>Right and wrong. If you're taking progesterone-only pills, they need to be taken with 30-60 minutes of 24 hours apart, otherwise the effectiveness is almost 0. For estrogen/progesterone combination pills, you just need to take it within about 24 hours of when you were supposed to. Lots of physiologic reasons for that, but the ELI5 answer is that the combo pill has two drugs and the progesterone pill only has one, and two is better than one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>30 minutes to an hour!?!?! I was always told &quot;as close as possible&quot; &quot;ideally within 3 hours&quot; and I'm sure it said in the leaflet &quot;if you miss the time and take it within 12 hours that day, you're covered&quot;. I think maybe thats the newer wave of progesterone-only pills though?</p>
<p>I often took mine a couple of hours late, once 11 hours, and never got pregnant. Got a Mirena eventually. I'm now ironically worrying that I'm infertile or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS! If you are prone to migraines with neurological symptoms, you cannot have added estrogen in your system. My doctor told me if I couldn't remember to take my progesterone pill within the hour (half an hour on each side) of when I was supposed to take it, I might as well not bother taking it at all. I'm hopefully getting a Mirena soon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate what constitutes neurological symptoms of a migraine. I know some people get light spotting which I have never had.
edit: All symptoms of a migraine are neurological? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like it's a combined OCP so it has both Estrogen and Progesterone.</p>
<p>Edit: And I don't even think you can get estrogen only pills, it's either progesterone only (the time sensitive ones) or combined tablets. The implantable ones (Mirena / Implanon) release progesterone only, I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much the case, but it's important not to take one at 11:59PM and the next at 12:00AM. </p>
<p>As close to 24 hours apart as possible is the best way to ensure the regular presence of the active ingredient that does the work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually true of most drugs. When I was on naproxen I looked up the half life and figured out that you only reach maximum levels after 36 hours (3 doses), then you get the best result from keeping that level constant. </p></div>		</li>
