			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re in it deep rn but we still haven’t invaded a country offhand based on made up intelligence. Bush will always be one of the worst presidents ever, even if our current administration manages to match or surpass him. And if trump manages not to go and invade Iran or North Korea he might have enough policies reversed after he leaves that he’ll have little long term impact (I doubt this but it’s possible). In contrast, Bush’s aggressive invasions are still with us and causing further conflict in the region, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got nothing against W when he's not in power.  I didn't hate him as a person, I hated what he was doing to America.  It's not amnesia, it's just recognizing that he's out, and there's nothing to be gained from opposing him anymore.  We have a different villain in the White House now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point, there’s lots of hip hop protest music. I’d add Reagan - Killer Mike </p>
<p>Speaking of him, there’s definitely a few run the jewels songs that I’d reckon count. Same with the last Tribe album. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather watch the Nixon shit </p>
<p>Than politicians politic</p>
<p>CNN and all this shit</p>
<p>Gwaan yo, move with the fuckery</p>
<p>Trump and SNL hilarity</p>
<p>Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy</p>
<p>Bloodclot, you doing</p>
<p>Bullshit you spewing</p>
<p>As if this country ain’t already ruined</p>
