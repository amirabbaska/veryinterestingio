			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding, I'm sorry no link, but that when you get hungry, your body recognizes that it is nearing the end of the calories in your digestive system. It is encouraging you to eat, as your blood sugar goes down. This also causes your body to tap into your fat reserves. Once your reserves are fully tapped, and you are striving off the fat, your hunger wains.</p>
<p>It will come and go after this, but that initial &quot;I'm starving&quot; goes away so it seems like you are not hungry anymore, or at least not nearly as hungry.</p></div>		</li>
