			<div class="markdown"><p>You're 100% correct, but I wanted to add one additional reason why 70% is a more effective disinfectant than 100%- the evaporation rate. 100% IPA (or EtOH) will evaporate too quickly, not allowing for a sufficient contact time with the bacterial membranes, especially on a heavily soiled or scratched surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like a bit shy of 100% correct to me, given the ommission of H2O2 having no <em>medical</em> use.  Since we're talking about antiseptics it should be important to mention this if bringing up the product.  After all, gamma rays are also a very effective disinfectant, but we didn't mention them because their harmfulness clearly makes them irrelevant to the question.</p>
<p>Hydrogen Peroxide is not recommended by any serious medical specialist for any kind of human use.  Low dilution H2O2 is in the category of &quot;fairly harmless so whatever&quot;, but that's hardly good reason to stock it for home use.</p>
<p>It may frequently be used for sterilizing instruments and rooms because it doesn't leave behind harmful byproducts when cleaning is complete.  So you may find it in a hospital, but not on a cotton swab!</p>
<p>The widespread medical use of H2O2 comes from hydrogen peroxide therapy/oxygen therapy, which was a once hugely-popular pseudoscience/alternative medicine.  It was so widespread at its peak that you can still find the stuff in typical store-bought first aid kits next to the actually-effective alcohol swabs!  Even though real medicine says the stuff is at best worse than IPA for disinfecting and can actually do more damage to human cells than the bacteria would have.  It generally promotes scarring and can slow wound healing in high concentrations or with repeated use at low concentration. </p>
<p>Basically: please do not use H2O2 for first aid!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the hospital (some time ago) with a burst appendix and the medical corpsman poured H2O2 into my open wound daily for some time, as it healed. Yes, there's a major scar there, but the output of the burst appendix was certainly a problem to leave inside of me, untreated.</p>
<p>I always wondered why they couldn't just tip me over and pour it out, but I'm sure that's just too simplistic. (sigh)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason that H2O2 doesn't work as an antiseptic is because our own cells have catalase and other enzymes in them that are able to get rid of the toxic oxygens.  This basically stops the function of hydrogen peroxide as an antiseptic.  It does work well as a disinfectant or sanitizer, and probably would work to kill bacteria on skin since keratinocytes are dead and can't produce catalase.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's say I didn't have any isopropyl alcohol, would something like 80-proof vodka be a good enough sterilizer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So tell me this, how many chemicals do I need to clean my kitchen and bathroom extremely well, and in what order can I use them without making toxic gases or other hazards?</p>
<p>Sounds like the H202 first, to get the ones with the protein rich shell and then some 70% IPA to finish them off. Anything else to the mix? What about fire?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really don't need to wipe your kitchen and bathroom down with H2O2 and 70% EtOHâ€”you're just wasting your time and money. Those disinfectants are better suited for other applications.</p>
<p>Like what the other guy said, bleach is already very good at disinfecting your bathroom surfaces.. but I don't see why you'd even need that to clean grease off your kitchen counter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As other said, bleach is always the best for disinfecting surfaces such as floors, counter tops, and bathroom stuff. Just don't use it on plastics(not all plastics), and keep it from contacting things with dyes of-course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wait I think the guy below you is wrong, because the person who answered actually said water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The water helps the IPA denature these proteins. Some bacterium, called spore formers will form a very protein rich shell which even 70% IPA can't denature so H2O2 is a great alternative (6% hydrogen peroxide)</p>

<p>Actually I dont know who is right or wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The alcohol is diluted with water.  Mixtures, or solutions can have different &quot;behaviors&quot; than the pure solutions.</p>
<p>Edit:  anything under roughly70% can't dissolve the lipid membrane.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  is not as effective at dissolving the membrane.</p></div>		</li>
