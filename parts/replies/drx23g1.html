			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Everyone else is missing the point. The battery reaction slows and he voltage drops. In response to the voltage drop, the processor runs at a slower speed that requires less power to conserve energy, which makes the phone laggy. </p>
<p>This is actually pretty topical considering everything that is going on with Apple. The same concept applied to slowing phones when the battery is dying and slowing them when the battery is cold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If apple was actually slowing phones because of battery issues, they would have made them run full speed while plugged in. It's just an excuse because planned obsolescence is a huge lawsuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but let us make a distinction between the car battery, which is a lead-acid battery, and the phone battery, which is a lithium-ion battery. Both are batteries but work fundamentally in different ways. At least for this, they are both affected by the cold weather, slowing down the electrochemical reaction rates.</p></div>		</li>
