<p>(and sorry for the essay)</p>

<p>I come here for the essays!  Nothing more frustrating than an answer that has a couple of sentences for an answer and barely hints at the reasons behind it.  This was very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I came and joined Reddit for the essays. To read them and to write them.  After the wintry wastelands of other social media that shall remain nameless, it was refreshing to come and find some place that was truly interactive. </p>
<p>Sorry for the less essay-ful reply.  :D  but I can appreciate the effort required for the essays. And being on the Desktop. Oh phone how I hate you, parasite and necessary evil that you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all - in fact, I would have said the closer to the opposite. The Irish Elk are generally included with other megafauna such as woolly mammoths as a group of species which went extinct following the last ice age. Again there is ongoing debate about the cause of this extinction - the changing climate following the ice age has been suggested as a cause, but humans also spread as the climate changed which makes it hard to disentangle the effect of climate from the effect of human hunting (my best guess is that climate change probably made the species more vulnerable, but they only went extinct because of human hunting). So I see Irish Elk as more belonging to tundra-like habitats, which would have been present in Britain immediately following the retreat of the ice caps, but not a habitat that would have persisted in Britain anyway as the climate warmed. It might have persisted elsewhere in Eurasia such as Siberia - and there is a Russian scientist called Sergey Zimov who hopes to create a <a href="http://www.pleistocenepark.ru/en/background/" target="_blank">'pleistocene park'</a> by restoring some of this megafauna.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've always been confused about this.  Presumably the megafauna had survived millions of years prior to that, throughout multiple glaciation cycles.  What was special about this glacial advance/retreat that wiped nearly all of them out nearly simultaneously?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuval Noah Harari in his book <em>Sapiens</em> posits both environmental changes and human intrusion as the cause for similar megafauna extinction events, like what occurred after the arrival of humans in Australia: humans introduced fire to Australia and posed a threat to, say, the giant sloths living there which hadn't yet learned to avoid the fierce, hairless apes; in addition, a changing climate meant a change in diet that affected the megafauna population poorly until it could adapt, which would happen too late. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With their massive racks (haha, boobs), is it reasonable they would be able to get the nutrients required if it were a forested space as opposed to a tundra like environment as it is with plane bison?</p></div>		</li>
