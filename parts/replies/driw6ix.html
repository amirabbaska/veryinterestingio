			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! But I'm still a little confused: are these extra dimensions actually &quot;real&quot;, or are they just a kind of hidden explanatory scaffolding that helps us make predictions about what we'll observe when we look at teeny-tiny things? That is, they don't actually map out how the world is, but they're a useful way to describe the effects that we see around us? What would be the difference between the one interpretation and the other, given that we can't percieve these dimensions either way?</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense. It kind of did in my head. I was reminded of the complex mathematical models that existed to explain (and predict) the movement of the stars before we realised that the eath went round the sun - there were lots of elaborate calculations that described the apparent retrograde movement of stars at some times of year (they appear to loop back on themselves because we're moving in relation to them). These mathematical descriptions <em>worked</em>, in the sense that they allowed us to make predictions about where certain stars would be at certain times, but they didn't actually describe reality despite being internally consistent models of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could actually ask this same question about standard particles like electrons. The truth is <em>everything</em> we (think we) know about things on a submicroscopic scale is just &quot;explanatory scaffolding&quot;, but that's about as close to &quot;real&quot; as it gets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>orangegluon's answer says these are theories that posit the existence of extra dimensions.  These are hypothetical and haven't been tested/disproven.  Electrons are totally different and our model of them makes testable predictions that have been carried out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the case for all of physics.
The scientific process can converge on the truth, but it can't confirm it absolutely.
Perhaps the very idea of spatial dimensions will be looked back on as a primitive understanding of the universe, one that explained many observations, but was ultimately shown to not align with reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna quibble here, though it's not central to your argument: if we can't ever confirm the truth, then even talking about truth as if it were a thing we were &quot;converging on&quot; can be seen as misleading or at least unnecessary. There are a number of scientists and philosophers of science who don't even deal with the possibility of positivistic or objective truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a scifi author that had a sect of science minded monks that said it best: <strong>Be less wrong</strong>. </p>
<p>Newton was a genius and was less wrong than those that came before him. But he didn't get it all exactly right. For his time, it was revolutionary. But very wrong in a lot of cases. And that's the best we can hope for. We'll never dig down so far into science that we understand everything. There is no metaphorical bedrock. But we can learn more, refine our understanding, and be less wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are asking is a very important epistemological question. Karl Popper has my favorite perspective about it (google Popper epistemology and you'll find all about it), but it has been a subject of study for a long time. He states that science can't prove the truth of any statement, it can only prove the falsehood of (some of) them. Like, you can't really say that &quot;all dogs have hair&quot; is true, because there might be one that doesn't (xoloescuincle, for example), but you can certainly say that &quot;all dogs are brown&quot; is false. By refining this approach you delimitate the posibility space a lot, thus leaving you with likely true statements that can't be ever proved completely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes no sense to me. If &quot;all dogs are brown&quot; is false, the surely it's negation (&quot;not all dogs are brown&quot;) is true. Similarly, if we cannot use a negative predicate, the statement &quot;some dogs are brown&quot; is clearly true too.</p>
<p>Moreover, some statements are necessarily true because they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>tautological - &quot;All dogs are dogs&quot;</li>
<li>based on the definitions - &quot;Zero is not positive&quot;</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense in the context of the modern scientific method and how we evaluate scientific hypotheses. We don't set out to prove our hypothesis; instead we decide if our experimental data allow us to reject the null hypothesis (which supposes that our hypothesized effect is <em>not</em> occurring) to within a certain statistical degree of certainty. So is Popper the reason that we do it this way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing, although meant only for the scientific method, is closely related to a mathematical concept known as &quot;(godelles?) Incompleteness theorem.&quot; The idea behind this is that not every true logical statement (aka &quot;mathematical&quot;, as any logical statement can be converted into an equation) can be proven. Numbers are solid, and many things in math are absolutely true, and we can prove them, but some things by nature cannot be proven using conventional methods despite them being true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been trying to wrap my head around these concepts for twenty+ years, thank you for finally being the guy to explain it to me in a way that makes sense.  This is a quality comment, if I hadn't broke the Christmas shopping budget I'd guild you a second time.  (Perhaps a redditor with better money management skills can do it on my behalf?)</p>
<p>Happy Winter's Solstice and whatever other non-scientific holidays you may be celebrating soon :P  Thanks for adding quality to my life.</p></div>		</li>
