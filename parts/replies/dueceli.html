			<div class="markdown"><p>In my (very limited knowledge) it’s the same reaction they have as when they feel like they’re falling, they spread all their limbs and then curl them together in an attempt to grab onto anything to protect themselves. It’s called the Moro reflex! Someone please correct me if I’m wrong or elaborate on this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely correct. It is a reflex to promote survival and they lose it round their first anniversary.</p>
<p>Edit: Moro is the one who found this </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies actually have a bunch of different reflexes. We use them to check at birth that they are normal neurologically. Over time they fade as we learn and they become suppressed or redundant. It's a normal test for a doctor to provoke the falling reflex, as mentioned. Another is the suckle reflex which we also test.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another confounding factor could be that houses near to noisy things such as main roads or airports are cheaper, people who are buying cheaper housing could be more stressed due to many other reasons such as financial hardship, career stress etc. </p></div>		</li>
