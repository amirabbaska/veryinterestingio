			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be anecdotal, but I grew up in Oregon and the speaking thing seems to be the opposite. When I've visited friends on the east coast, my friends' parents have commented that I talk 'faster but lazier', as in I'm getting the words out faster, but pronouncing them sloppier.</p>
<p>That said, they're the ones saying y'all and djeetyet</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sounds like you visited the South, not the Northeast. It's silly the way the OP talks about the &quot;East&quot;. Northeast and Southeast are world's apart. NY and California are much closer. As for the &quot;West Coast&quot; that everybody is talking about here, they mean California. Portland and Seattle definitely don't have idyllic weather.</p>
<p>P.S. As a damnyankee I feel funny defending anything about the South, but &quot;y'all&quot; is a perfectly proper word. Seriously, look it up.</p></div>		</li>
