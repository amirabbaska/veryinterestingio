			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, if you have 2 perfectly reflective surfaces (for a particular wavelength of light) then you can bounce that light back and forth between them forever. The term often used for such a device is a &quot;light clock&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, I'd like to add that you can't observe the light in this theoretical setup, as observing it would absorb (some of) the light, making it fade out in no-time.</p>
<p>The only way to validate the working of the light lock would be by breaking it.</p></div>		</li>
