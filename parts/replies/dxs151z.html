			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly are you talking about? As a locksmith I find this confusing and misleading at best.
Where are these 8 pin locks coming from?
I can assure you that no one uses this 'type of system' professionaly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he's saying to imagine a series of locks that can have 8 pins each, but only 5/8 are used per lock. Each lock would have the unused spaces in different spots, for example key 1 is 12467 and key 2 could be 12478. The master would lift all 8 pins into the correct height. I can't really see the utility of this type of system over any normal master key system with multiple shear lines unless each pin is a fixed height to reduce the amount of shear points when raking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might only be used in some parts of the world. But what he's saying is not that there are eight pins - but there are blank spots in the lock. So for example one pin, one spot without pin, three pins, another space, and the last pin. This allows for a master key without making it too easy to figure out the master key. Really fascinating design</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a very insecure system, you'd only need two keys to get the master key. There's a 5/28 chance of any pair being sufficient. </p></div>		</li>
