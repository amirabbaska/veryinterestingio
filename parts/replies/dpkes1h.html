			<div class="markdown"><p>They spelled it &quot;Koagulation&quot; because it was first written about in a German Journal.</p>
<p>Back in the day Germany used to dominate Chemistry and many discoveries were written about in German, which is why a lot of names and terms dating back to the 19th and early 20th century have German names and abbreviations that are based on German spelling of words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fall from grace happened before the whole genocide thing, Germany started losing its prominence in that area about the time of WWI not WWII.  Imperial Germany was one of the few powers involved in that war, which had not been guilty of some recent genocide in some colonial possession other (unless you count the Herero and Nama), but few cared about that sort of thing back in those days.</p>
<p>It was losing the war, not any ethical or moral falling that started the destruction of Germany and the crimes against humanity committed later only helped finish the job.</p></div>		</li>
