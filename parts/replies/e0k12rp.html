<p>For one thing, Hollywood is an American industry that likes to make movies about American characters. Since American troops only arrived in the final year of the war, there isn't much time for a story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one of the biggest factors. America's entry was late, and although it enabled the Entente to ultimately defeat the Central Powers, it was the last chapter in the war. Not great movie material for a Hollywood that doesn't dig foreign stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, WWI didn't have a Hollywood &quot;win&quot;. Audiences want a happy ending, and &quot;we decided to stop fighting, and Germany conceded some territory&quot; isn't very satisfying. The complicated politics that led up to the war also makes it more difficult to paint the Germans as villains. With WWII it's much simpler: &quot;Nazis = evil&quot; is the easiest villain story there is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Germany signed the armistice without Entente powers even on their territory. Shoot, they knocked the Russians out of the war. They had to stop fighting for a couple reasons, many of them internal, but they didn't surrender like we saw in WWII.</p>
<p>Also right that it's difficult to truly find a &quot;villain&quot; in WWI. It's not clean. Not at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The podcast Hardcore History has like a 7 or 8 episode stretch on WWI. I’m only maybe halfway through it, but it’s fascinating. Check out the “Blueprint to Armageddon” episodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer! To add to the last part, due to the sheer scale of the holocaust the Nazis are basically the epitome of evil. Few wars can be looked back at in such a black and white way. Especially not any war that America has fought since, so it's kind of the last pure heroic war, from a Hollywood producer point of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder how much had to do with the fact that the movie industry was more prevalent around WW2. </p>
<p>Plus it’s a more recent event that tends to hold peoples interest. </p></div>		</li>
