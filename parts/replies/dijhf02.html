			<div class="markdown"><p>This was exactly it for me.  I had food poisoning or some 24 hour thing but was puking like a champ all night. I was laying in bed, tossing and turning. Everything hurt. I felt the need to puke again and after a pretty solid session I just laid down on the floor in the fetal position with a bath towel. It felt amazing to finally lay down comfortably. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it was left over pizza that had a lot of sausage and artichokes on it. I heated it up in the oven really good though. Or it could've been the tsaziki dip but that was pretty fresh. I'm afraid to try either now which is a shame because theres a lot tsaziki dip and it's really tasty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, and heat rises so the air at floor level will be cooleet. Anecdotal, but when I get queasy, breathing cold air really settles my stomach. Like just sticking my head in thr freezer and taking a couple deeo breaths. So maybe the cooler air near the floor also settles your stomach a little?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh maybe. I also get sweaty and super uncomfortable when I'm sick so coolness helps that as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat rises, but thats not why. Its because tiles and hardwood tend to transfer heat faster than fabric, so the tiles suck the heat out of your skin faster.</p>
<p>The same as a waterbed if you've ever slept on one. They're basically a big water balloon - water inside a vinyl condom. The water sucks the heat out of your body, as opposed to a normal spring matress which doesn't have the thermal capacity or thermal transfer properties.</p>
<p>Go spray water on your face - it absorbs heat, then evaporates which is why it cools you down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No joke. I got slammed with the flu and since I still have things to do around the house at times, I'd get hot with that super weak spell and just lay down on the floor.</p>
<p>It was eye openingâ€‹ how much better I feel after a nice solid 15 minutes laying there. Body feels better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked for specific tiles in our bathroom because they resembled the tiles from my childhood home. </p>
<p>Nostalgia? No. </p>
<p>It's because they felt so danged good on my cheek when I'd lay there in between barfing fits. </p>
<p>I'm such a romantic.</p></div>		</li>
