			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm obviously taking huge liberty with interpretation of definitions here, which I understand you decided to avoid, but I'd still like to nominate turtles and tortoises.
Regular endoskeleton in limbs and endoskeleton (almost) gone exo around the main body. Most of them have a layer of horn on the outside of the carapace though, but in the case of leatherbacks (Dermochelyidae) and soft shell turtles (Trionychidae), they only have a layer of skin on top. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was quite confused on that myself. On the one hand, the shell technically satisfies (at least my understanding of) the definition of an exoskeleton. However i think i would disqualify it based on the fact that a turtle's shell is attached to its endoskeleton (their spine is infused into the shell). </p>
<p>I mean logically, you wouldn't consider a deer to have an exoskeleton (its antlers are bone connected to its endoskeleton as well), therefore turtles kind of don't fit the bill.
But yeah, its probably the closest we'll get to a creature with both an endo and exoskeleton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shell isn't so much attached to the endoskeleton as it is a part of it; fused bones with a cover of skin or horn. But I still wouldn't compare it to antlers or other protruding spike thingies though, because in contrast to those, the carapace actually envelopes the majority of a turtle/tortoise body. And, much like an actual exoskeleton, it does serve as both protection from mechanical damage and structural support for the soft tissues and inner organs.
Unlike an arthropod exoskeleton though, the carapace grows as the animal grows and is never shed. Also, most importantly, it isn't the outermost layer of any species I know of.
Convergent evolution is fascinating!</p></div>		</li>

Does the shell also connect to a bony endo-skeleton? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After a bit more research on the topic i've come to the conclusion that it basically isn't possible to have both an endo and exoskeleton, mainly because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The scientific definitions of endo and exoskeletons basically mean that if any of the exoskeleton is connected to the endoskeleton, it can no longer be classified an exoskeleton</p>
</li>
<li>Its simply not viable to have both. You only need one to fulfil the structural role and having both does not offer any worthwhile evolutionary advantages. The extra weight just isn't worth it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this (kinda) helps answer the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like how some of the dinosaurs are described, with bony armored plates. But the &quot;armor&quot; would have to serve a supportive function to qualify, maybe? So maybe not. </p></div>		</li>
