			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, US bwrs are water cooled and moderated, which means that when water boils off and steam bubbles form power goes DOWN. </p>
<p>At Chernobyl (RBMK design) the core is graphite moderated, so when water boils to steam, power goes UP. It makes the Chernobyl core more likely to have instabilities and places different operating restrictions on the core. Losing forced cooling flow in an RBMK can cause power to rapidly rise and if control systems don't respond you can have core heat damage. Compare this to a US style BWR where we intentionally cut off forced cooling water flow to the core during certain events to reduce power and protect the core (for example, loss of a feedwater pump and run back, turbine/generator trip without bypass, scram failure without steam relief). </p></div>		</li>
