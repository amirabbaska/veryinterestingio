			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 4 main tissues of the tooth. Enamel, dentin, cementum, and the  pulp. Enamel is a deposit of minerals left behind by living tissue that dies as part of the tooth formation process. The other tissues vary in their level of mineralization but they are alive and will heal themselves. Pulp delivers blood and nutrients that are required by the Dentin and cementum. </p>

<p>Why does this tissue die? So is it like it 'births' the enamel but then it has to make room for the next layer? Why doesn't the next layer create enamel as well?</p>
