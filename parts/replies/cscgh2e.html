<p>Getting shot at with a bullet proof vest on will still leave one hell of a bruise, even though you don't get shot the round imparts a significant amount of force onto the vest and into your body.</p>
<p>Also medieval armour wasn't that heavy, something like 35 pounds IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improved_Outer_Tactical_Vest" target="_blank">Modern armor is just as heavy</a>.  Modern fighting loads are probably heavier overall:  an M4 weighs more than the average longsword and I'm unsure what the weight comparison between a shield and ammunition is but it's about a pound per magazine.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've always wondered why that is. It seems like getting shot while wearing a bullet proof vest deals much more damage than, say, being punched really hard in the chest, but since the recoil momentum of the gun is equal to the momentum of the bullet, and we control that recoil momentum pretty easily with our arms, it seems to me that we should be able to create a similar (if not greater) impact with a punch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the other responses, also keep in mind that modern &quot;lightweight&quot; armor generally aims to defend against bullets, for obvious reasons. The mechanism for protecting against a gunshot, though, is very different from protecting against a sword strike. The former is essentially many layers of cloth (Kevlar) absorbing blunt force concentrated on a small area afaik, whereas the latter needs to stop a cutting strike.</p>
<p>For instance, a knife can cut through a bulletproof vest pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't answering the question. Nobody mentioned kevlar. A titanium or aluminium armor would undoubtedly be like a superweapon because of how fast and how much more protection you would have compared to the weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did. They typically used daggers design for thrusting so they could penetrate armor better or slip between plate joints. Grappling and knife fighting were both vital combat skills. Daggars used were like the rondel. </p>
