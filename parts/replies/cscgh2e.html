<p>Getting shot at with a bullet proof vest on will still leave one hell of a bruise, even though you don't get shot the round imparts a significant amount of force onto the vest and into your body.</p>
<p>Also medieval armour wasn't that heavy, something like 35 pounds IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improved_Outer_Tactical_Vest" target="_blank">Modern armor is just as heavy</a>.  Modern fighting loads are probably heavier overall:  an M4 weighs more than the average longsword and I'm unsure what the weight comparison between a shield and ammunition is but it's about a pound per magazine.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I've always wondered why that is. It seems like getting shot while wearing a bullet proof vest deals much more damage than, say, being punched really hard in the chest, but since the recoil momentum of the gun is equal to the momentum of the bullet, and we control that recoil momentum pretty easily with our arms, it seems to me that we should be able to create a similar (if not greater) impact with a punch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the other responses, also keep in mind that modern &quot;lightweight&quot; armor generally aims to defend against bullets, for obvious reasons. The mechanism for protecting against a gunshot, though, is very different from protecting against a sword strike. The former is essentially many layers of cloth (Kevlar) absorbing blunt force concentrated on a small area afaik, whereas the latter needs to stop a cutting strike.</p>
<p>For instance, a knife can cut through a bulletproof vest pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't answering the question. Nobody mentioned kevlar. A titanium or aluminium armor would undoubtedly be like a superweapon because of how fast and how much more protection you would have compared to the weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I'm assuming some stuff for my question:  </p>
<ol>
<li>We are fighting a medieval knight using medieval weapons. The only difference between our possible weapon set and the knight's is our access to modern metallurgy and tool making.  </li>
<li>Both physically and in skill level, we are approximately equal to our foe. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now, this being said, how much could we gain from, for example, a longsword of equal length but less weight compared to our opponent? How about the decreased armor weight and improved integrity (I imagine our ability to bind the armor together has also improved)? Would it become considerably easier to carry a secondary weapon (a short mace, for example)?</p>
<p>Also, since we're at it, are there any benefits of modern metalworking that could apply to historical archers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent points, and I am trying to find authentic-ish groups myself. I believe swords were more-or-less optimized for their purpose, so any improvements from more modern metals would be minor, as they will almost always unbalance the optimization.</p>
<p>However, if you consider an exotic material like carbon fiber, (and the variations of it that include metal weaves) there are more options because it has great strength but so little weight. A carbon fiber shaft would be great for spears. Or, if someone went completely crazy, it could be possible (after countless attempts and lots of wasted money) to build a core of a sword out of carbon fiber and attach a metal layer around it that can be sharpened. That could make a much lighter sword where the weight is reduced evenly across its length, so it doesn't throw off the balance too much. But that may not even be possible, no matter how much money is thrown at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In any case, swinging that sword wouldn't utilize momentum as much. As an extreme: Imagine a paper sword with the stability etc. of the finest steel. Doesn't sound advantageous to me at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The response about balance to the tip is more important. I was imagining a bastard sword with the same weight as a shortsword. Hitting power of a shortsword but better reach. I neglected the balance of the weapon in thinking about this.</p></div>		</li>
