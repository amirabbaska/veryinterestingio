			<div class="markdown"><p>why doesnt Steam not mind about you buying steam keys away from Steam? Steam doesn get the sale (money/revenue) but they have to rovide a service for gamers/purchasers to download the games from.</p>
<p>Why? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the monopoly Steam has, imagine if in addition to taking a cut off every game sold on Steam, if they took a cut from every other site's sales of games. There would be a riot. It is a good thing Steam provides free keys otherwise the competition landscape would be much worse.</p>
<p>From Steam's perspective, those games are still being locked into the Steam DRM. The user is still using their client, will be directed to DLC and other games in their store. Probably offsets any bandwidth costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valve gets new users who try Steam for the first time, and some of those new users will go on to spend tens or hundreds (or thousands) of dollars on games in the future. For Valve, generating those keys and hosting the game files is just the cost of acquisition, and it's probably extremely cheap compared to the average lifetime value of a Steam customer.</p>
<p>Even if only one in every hundred keys that Steam generates goes to a person who doesn't already have a Steam account, that's still thousands and thousands of new users joining the platform every month, each of whom will eventually spend money on Steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My belief is that ultimately, if you sell a steam key, that has the chance of bringing user who has already made a purchase onto their platform.  Since they know that they've made a purchase before, those users have a much higher chance to buy additional products on the steam store.  It ends up being a net positive for Steam.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I suspect trumpsc is one of these. There's no way he'd actually want to promote them today, but cant get rid of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, it's not.  Key revocation on Steam is manual, you have to upload a list of keys.  I do a bunch every week when we get cc fraud reports from our approved key resellers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's through regular key revocation, IE if Humble or GMG gives you a list of chargeback keys, you have to revoke them that way.  If someone purchases say, a gift copy on steam and that gets charged back, then the developer has no interaction there.  It just revokes the key.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, you would think with the technology today, something like this could be automated. I guess the up side is that it gives jobs to people but really, I am shocked that this isn't automated.</p></div>		</li>
