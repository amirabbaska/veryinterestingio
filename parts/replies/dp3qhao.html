			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably just the tabs you bought, I've never had melatonin that wasn't supposed to be swallowed. Even if it says to chew it swallowing will just take a little longer to kick in </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are sublingual lozenges for Melatonin. It absorbs through your oral mucosa. It definitely takes effect MUCH faster that way, than the traditional swallowing-version Melatonin tabs.</p>
<p>Source: Have had bad sleep problems and have used both extensively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Just because it dissolves does NOT mean it's sublingual. Dissolving tabs are great for quick onset (because they readily go into solution -- surprise, solid tabs aren't absorbed by the stomach) and don't require water to get down (great for nauseated patients). For example, Zofran ODT (orally disintegrating tab) is not a sublingual tab. I have to correct nurses (and pharmacists) all the time on this. &quot;Absorption: Oral: 100%; nonlinear absorption occurs with increasing oral doses; Zofran ODT tablets are bioequivalent to Zofran tablets; absorption does not occur via oral mucosa.&quot; Source: UpToDate + am pharmacist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do end up swallowing some.</p>
<p>The sublingual lozenges (dissolve in your mouth) end up absorbing a large amount of the melatonin via your oral mucosa (gums/cheeks/tongue/roof/floor). This allows it to enter your bloodstream faster, which makes it take effect much faster. The longer you hold it in your mouth, the more will be absorbed. </p>
<p>The stuff you end up swallowing does also get absorbed eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTC acetaminophen/paracetamol is coated with a substance designed to resist dissolving in your mouth. It may be possible to take it sublingually if it were reformulized for it, but IIRC it actually <em>has</em> to go through your liver to be effective.</p>
<p>Also it tastes insanely bad and doesn't absorb through the tissue under your tongue as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah just to reiterate this point; sublingual medication is usually faster acting as it bypasses what is known as &quot;first pass metabolism&quot; - Blood supply serving the digestive system goes through the hepatic portal system first before systemic circulation. A lot of toxins / molecules aren't metabolised in one go - they require several passes through the liver. </p></div>		</li>
