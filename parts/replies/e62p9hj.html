			<div class="markdown"><p>The advantage to putting it in North Africa and middle East is both that there's plenty of sunlight from being on the equator but also it's unsuitable for farming in large parts of desert and Rocky terrain. It would also boost the local economies and insulate the countries from Total reliance in the oil market whole still maintaining a energy provider role</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc 90 minutes of sunlight hitting Earth is enough to power the world for a year. Of course, you can't just grab all of that energy. </p>
<p>As solar becomes more efficient, we'll see some fantastic gains and cheaper energy. Even the best, most expensive panels are somewhere around ~30% efficient.</p></div>		</li>
