<p>The fights are not &quot;planned&quot; in a wrestling sense, nor are they just for show</p>

<p>This is correct, however, there have been times (much fewer recently with the demise of the &quot;enforcer&quot; role) when the puck drops and both teams just pull gloves and go at it. Usually this happens when there has been bad blood between the teams for a game or two prior </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my introduction to hockey was in the 80s watching the Ice play the Fort Wayne Comets. Being 11 years old watching them halt the game because fights have broken out in the stands will make you a fan of the sport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say this.   </p>
<p>I've seen everyone on the team get into a fight, which prompted the goalies to meet at the center of the ice and cordially agree to throw a few punches.  Everyone cheered, then they went back to their nets.  </p>
<p>So while some of it is not staged, sometimes it's just something they do for the heck of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I came here interested in.  It seems like every player knows what to do as soon as the puck drops.  How is this coordinated?  Best example I can find: <a href="https://youtu.be/6MFRpipkQu8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/6MFRpipkQu8</a></p></div>		</li>
