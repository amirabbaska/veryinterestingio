			<div class="markdown"><p>Because purple is red + blue (e.g. missing yellow, green...). What happens at mid-day is the blue is bouncing off air molecules and that's why you see it. At sunset the air is bouncing all the blue out of the spectrum before it gets to your eye, so the light looks red.</p>
<p>To get purple, the air would need to filter out the middle of the spectrum (yellows and greens) and that doesn't happen.</p></div>		</li>
