			<p>Most pathogenic bacteria in humans are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesophile" target="_blank">mesophiles</a>. Meaning they're stable in relatively mid-range temperatures (20-45ºC), with enzyme function optimal at around 37ºC. Temperatures that are either below or above the optimal temperature usually cause a decrease in enzyme function and cell growth decreases. Temperatures too far above the threshold causes the enzyme to denature and stop working completely. <br><br>Example chart, notice where E.coli is located on the temperature spectrum:<br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QPTkaDK.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/QPTkaDK.png</a></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Body temperature, especially fever, limits or prevents the<br>growth of many microbes, especially viruses. In addition,<br>the immune response is more efficient at elevated<br>temperatures.<br><br>and<br><br>&gt;Body temperature and fever can limit replication or destabilize<br>some viruses. Many viruses are less stable (e.g., herpes<br>simplex virus) or cannot replicate (rhinoviruses) at 37° C or<br>higher. The live influenza vaccine is attenuated because it<br>cannot replicate above 25° C.<br><br>Medical Microbiology (Murray, Rosenthal, Pfaller), 8E</p>		</li>
