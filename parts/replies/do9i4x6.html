			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I really wanted to thank you for the thorough response to the quiestion. The other day I was having a conversation with a friend and he kinda convinced me that reddit is just another social media like facebook but with categories; I couldn't put in words at the time what reddit is and why I use it instead of the others. </p>
<p>This is it! Yes, there are memes, different communities for all kind of tastes; but the knowledge and information (and often misinformation) from these seemingly simple question is one of the best qualities of this site. So thank you! and all the others that answered this, sometimes right, sometimes wrong, but in the best way they can! You keep the escence of this site alive!!</p></div>		</li>

If you scaled a gorilla up to the size of a building it would collapse under its own weight because its volume would scale &quot;faster&quot; than its area/size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same principles should apply with hail (as long as it's normal sized hail), but it definitely does more damage.  I'm not sure how much of that damage is done due to the rigidity of the ice though.  Water is pretty forgiving at those slow(ish) falling speeds and splashes nicely (it sure as hell can sting on a motorcycle though).  Hail just impacts without any splashing and that may have an additional effect.</p>
<p>I know I've found large insects like dragonflies dead after hail storms, but I've never found dead frogs or mice or anything like that after one.</p>
<p>The caveat here is that we are talking about normal sized hail in the pea or smaller size range and not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XeTqp_HRIs" target="_blank">the bigger hail like this</a> that can cause serious damage to cars and houses, to say nothing of humans and other animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crazy video.</p>
<p>I just realised, there may be habitable worlds out there that are <em>almost</em> right, but that feature hail storms for 12 hours a day. They'd need mild climate control/terraforming. Better than sulphuric acid rainclouds, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer yes. Most small animals hide during hail. There probably are some losses but hail is pretty localised.</p></div>		</li>
