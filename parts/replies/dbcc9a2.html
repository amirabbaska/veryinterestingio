			<div class="markdown"><p>So, sound plays a part in your brain's arousal pathways. The sound will activate the reticular activating system (RAS) which &quot;turns on&quot; the brain. The RAS is in different states of suppression during the sleep cycle, so the level and type of sound needed to wake someone changes dramatically based on the stage of sleep that they are in. People are also more sensitive to their name and other things that are emotionally relevant so if you want to wake someone, saying their name helps. That's also why a text notification on your phone might wake you but loud thunder may not.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your daily schedule, diet, and mood can affect this but one of the biggest factors is how active the brain is when trying to sleep. If she is thinking about a lot or her mind is wandering and thinking of several things, her brain isn't able to &quot;turn off&quot; and go to sleep as easily. This isn't easily controlled but focusing on a background sound like white noise or something may help.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not dumb at all! It probably does help because it becomes somewhat meditative and you are focusing on one thing which makes it easier for your mind to &quot;shut down&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
