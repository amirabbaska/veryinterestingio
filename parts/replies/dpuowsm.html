<p>the conditions needed for a wormhole to be created are hugely difficult to create - it needs things like 'exotic matter', matter with negative mass or pressure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, since there is no evidence for negative mass-energy in the universe, any theoretical construct that requires it -- including both wormholes and Alcubierre warp drives -- goes beyond &quot;difficult to create&quot; to &quot;probably impossible but you never know.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with you completely, whenever anyone says &quot;never&quot; I am always reminded of  Auguste Comte who argued that we would &quot;We can never learn their internal constitution&quot;, talking about stars. Then less than 50 years later spectography was invented, and we figured out exactly what the stars were made of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well first, they did say &quot;probably&quot; impossible.</p>
<p>Second, those are two different kinds of &quot;never&quot;. &quot;We can never learn about the inside of starts because I just don't imagine how we could&quot; is different from &quot;If relativity/our understanding of physics is essentially correct, then some things are definitely impossible (e.g. getting information out of a <em>black hole</em>, instead of a star) or probably impossible (Alcubierre drives, if negative mass-energy turns out not to exist).&quot;</p>
<p>The former is just a shrugged shoulder and lack of imagination (not that Comte wasn't brilliant, but pobody's nerfect), whereas the latter is actually predicted by the math (which math might be wrong, but which might also be right).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm, negative mass-energy is a thing. Is it not? Unless you're referring to something with negative mass, and something with negative energy. Then you'd be correct. I never realized how confusingly similar those two ideas are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If there is a black hole between us and a star but the star had a direct line of sight to us could a black hole bend the light so we'd see the star twice but in different locations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational lensing creates multiple images in most cases - as an example, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross#/media/File:Einstein_cross.jpg" target="_blank">Einstein's Cross</a>, where four images of the same quasar can be seen thanks to an intervening gravitational lens. It's actually possible to use this as a test of the expansion of the universe. If you look at a distant, lensed, supernova, you'll see multiple images of it at different times and different positions, as the lensed light will travel different (longer or shorter) paths. These can be predicted, but if the expansion of the universe as not as we expect, then we'd see them at different times or places to what we predict. This has been done once, with a supernova known as SN Refsdal, after the astronomer who proposed the test.</p></div>		</li>
