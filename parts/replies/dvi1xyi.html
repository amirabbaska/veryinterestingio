			<div class="markdown"><p>I drink about ten cups a day and have been doing so since about the age of 12. Were big tea drinkers in Ireland. I like to squeeze my teabag . Recently though due to not having a spoon on the building site indeciddd I would hover the tea bag overnthe cup to allow the dark tea to drop and cascade marbling tannins on the surface , ensuring a strong cup. Best results use a painty screwdriver to hover your teabag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Switch to loose leaf. A full teaspoon of tea in your steeping device of choice (disposable bag, metal tea ball, straight in the cup, or even using a french press, it doesn't matter!) will give you 2-3 re-steeps after your first cup.</p>
<p>I ain't never going back to pre-bagged tea again. Plus, I get to support a local business instead of some bullshit who's probably affiliated with Nestle anyway. Win-win.</p>
<p>Nothing quite like putting two spoons of honeybush and a spoon of gunpowder into a teapot steeper and dropping that bitch into the bottom of a stainless steel mug every morning at work, then using that same load to make another two 30-oz mugs throughout the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought people were against it because the squeezing could lead to the tea getting all in your drink and stuff, specifically if the bag decides to break.</p>
<p>I've never not done it, cause that's wasting my tea that's trapped in the bag</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude I actually had a question about that and did some research.  I don't have the link offhand to the study I found but after 4 to 6 minutes (may not be 100% accurate) the amount of caffeine actually decreases if you leave the tea bag in as it binds with other chemicals in the tea!!</p>
<p>Of course that's assuming stronger = higher caffeine content</p></div>		</li>
