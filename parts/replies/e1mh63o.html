<p>So, in order to meet the CDR, you really have to freeze the technology a year or two before that date, so that you can actually do the design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see this often in fighter jets - which also take years to design - initially roll out with less recent software/avionics than the planes they're replacing.</p>
<p>Because while older aircraft will have concurrent upgrades happening even as they are being replaced/removed, the newer aircraft still haven't gone through their own upgrades yet.</p>
<p>This is part of why the F-35 has been such a complex project with numerous delays and issues - the plane has to replace a ton of aircraft and be able to carry virtually every type of weapon/equipment in the arsenal. It's why its IOC saw it capable of carrying fewer types of weapons than the planes its replacing - but in a few years, it will have had enough upgrades/updates to carry all of them and more as older aircraft get sundowned and development/upgrades end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the term we use in the industry for this is P3I, which stands for Pre-planned Product Improvment. It's when you release a product with limited capability (usually because of a tech freeze), while having the plan to upgrade it to newer tech down the road.</p>
<p>If you continually update the tech while you're doing the design, you'll never finish and never release anything, so this at least gives you a chance to put <em>something</em> out and update it later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's like the hardware equivalent to the Agile software development model. You put something together to meet the initial customer requirements and additional features and updates in later sprints.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what I was trying to discribe in my first response. If companies supplied products, like cell phones, that were capable of what they're truly able to do. They'd make high end desktops of today look like a horse and buggy. But then they'd have nothing significant in terms of technology to apply to any future models and would quickly run out of money. </p></div>		</li>
