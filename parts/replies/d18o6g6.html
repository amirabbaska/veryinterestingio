			<p>If a person is frozen solid then that person is dead. You need to rephrase it to &quot;we need to figure out how to revive frozen people&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually no, if you freeze a human quickly enough to not cause massive widespread cell wall rupture it still kills them. Also you can't freeze people that quickly anyway, fixing the cell damage would be part of whatever future technology is capable of reviving people. </p>		</li>

			<p>When you think of it though, might as well freeze yourself. To you it'd just be like closing your eyes then opening them if it works. If not, you die like everyone else before you.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah but how much do you trust them? Havent some frozen 'people' been 'lost' thanks to power outage? </p>		</li>

			<p>Possibly. I trust them, by the time I croak it will probably be 2100. and then even if they don't find a way to unfreeze people, it's just like i died anyways. </p>		</li>

			<p>So you're saying we don't really need to improve our methods of freezing people? A person could be frozen today with current technology, and assuming some future generation does eventually master cryogenics, then that body won't be at any &quot;disadvantage&quot; and will be &quot;compatible&quot; with future thawing technology? I didn't know how far along we were in cryogenics, and this is interesting to me.</p>		</li>

			<p>From what I understand, that is pretty much the case. I could, of course, be wrong.<br><br>We can freeze you instantly. That's not really so much the problem. The real problem would be returning you back from that. Ultimately, the problem with freezing is potentially creating ice crystals. They essentially act like needles while your cells are bubbles, and if they touch your cells, they pop, just like bubbles would. If you do not freeze quickly enough, you get pointy ice crystals that can pop your cells. However, you can also get the same problem thawing, as if you do not thaw out quickly enough, as you melt you can create pointy ice crystals that will pop your cells.<br><br>We can generally do the first one pretty well, but we don't really have the capacity to do the second one - at least not without using so much heat that you would instantly incinerate the person inside anyways.</p>		</li>

			<p>There is no cryonics organization that &quot;flash freezes&quot;, as this would cause massive fracturing and destroy neural connections (the &quot;connectome&quot;). Instead, patients are usually vitrified and cooled slowly, which minimizes fracturing while preventing ice crystal formation.</p>		</li>

			<p>We are already freezing people with terminal illnesses. But yeah, we have no idea how to safely unfreeze them yet.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's a theory (forgot the name) that says that once unfreezing is figured out, the people frozen more sooner will have a greater chance of getting unthawed succesfully than those forzen sooner. The later back someone was forzen, the smaller chance they'll make it out on the other end. Not necessarily because of the time they spent frozen, but because freezing technology will become even better in the future.</p>		</li>

			<p>I feel like I need another ELI5 for this.<br><br>What's the difference between flash-freezing a person and hypothermia? You reach that same freezing temperature in both scenarios, so why is one relatively safe and the other one deadly?</p>		</li>

			<p>hypothermia is just being cold, flash-freezing refers to cooling their temperature down so fast that ice crystal formation is kept low. And flash-freezing is done to people who are already dead lol</p>		</li>
