			<div class="markdown"><p>So you act like a woman. I'm in the mental health business and I think there are so many of us in that field--at most agencies it's predominantly women therapists--because the body language and voice you describe are less threatening, more nurturing. Also as a horse trainer, I think most animals appreciate the behaviors that you describe, too. Most horses love a high soft voice and add baby-talk words to it and they're in heaven. Your customers probably wouldn't respond well to the baby talk, though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retail manager here. My lord the hands can change the tone of a conversation so easily. We wear vest and I use to have this habit of just passively putting my hands in my pockets and it'd really put a lot of people off. Now If I'm just standing there talking to someone I put them in my vest pockets and it's a world of difference. Even more so when asking someone to leave the store. If you put your hands in your pocket it's almost like you're threatening them, put your hands in your vest and you just look passive. Like you're not gonna be grabbing for them or pulling out some type of weapon. Sounds stupid but I swear on anything it makes a difference. </p></div>		</li>
