			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the earth's orbit isn't perfectly circular.</p>
<p>When the earth is at a longer distance from the sun, the tangential velocity is slower than the other planet's, so they wouldn't stay always at exactly opposed places. These small differences in position would mean small differences in gravitational attraction, which would add up in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were just the earth, the sun, and the hidden earth and there weren't orbital perturbations, then you could construct an orbit whereby the earth has the exact same tangential velocity as the hidden planet at every point in time, and regardless of the eccentricity of the orbit, you could draw a straight line from the earth through the sun to the hidden planet at every point in time through the orbit. </p>
<p>EDIT: Here, I wrote a gravity sim a while back and just inputted what I was attempting to explain. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/a9xNC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/a9xNC</a> </p>
<p>You can see that some time later, the straight line is maintained regardless of eccentricity, and the one planet would never be able to see the other planet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when we talk about Lagrangian points, it's in a very limited context.</p>
<p>To start off, if you have one object.... everything is very, very boring. Now we put a second smaller object in orbit around it. We can just treat this as on a circular orbit, and the earth's pretty close to a circular orbit. So we now have gravity coming from the sun, and gravity coming from the earth. Any point in space is going to experience a combination of those two gravitational tugs. For most of space, if we put a third object (smaller than the first two) somewhere, gravity of the sun and earth will start moving it somehow. However, there's 5 points, what we call the Lagrange points, where the gravity from the sun plus the gravity from the earth cancel out and an object would seem like it would just stay in that one spot from the earth's perspective.<br />
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Lagrange_points2.svg/800px-Lagrange_points2.svg.png" target="_blank">Here's a map of them</a></p>
<p>Now, these spots are pretty useful, and so we do have telescopes at L1 and L2 because it keeps them in a spot near the earth. The next thing, though, is what happens if you move a little bit away from that spot where the gravity balanced out to zero. Think of it like putting a ball down on a bumpy surface. If you put it on a sloped area, it's going to start moving immediately. But if you put it at either the top of a hill, or the bottom of a valley, the ball will stay put. At L1, L2, and L3, it's like the top of a hill. If it gets nudged a little bit, it'll end up just rolling right down the hill. These points aren't stable. At L4 and L5, it's like the bottom of a valley, and if it gets nudged away, it'll just move back to the position again. These are stable, and for several of the planets we find that asteroids have ended up here, the most significant being the Trojan asteroids that are at Jupiter's L4 and L5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be careful with your statements about L4 and L5. Those points are only stable if the secondary object is much less massive than the primary (smaller than 4% of its mass). So it works for the Sun and the Earth, and even for the Sun and Jupiter, but it wouldn't work for a binary star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, the Earth is not in a stable orbit (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_of_the_Solar_System" target="_blank">source</a>) -- in general, once you have more than a two-body system, the system becomes unstable, although in our Solar System's case we're talking about instability over periods of billions of years.  That doesn't really matter much to what you're really asking (because when we talk about instability at L3 we are talking much shorter time-frames), but thought it was worth the mention.</p>
<p>Now, we're talking about the L3 Lagrange point for the Earth.  L3 is an unstable Lagrange point -- basically, think of it like a ball at the top of a very steep hill.  If the ball is placed perfectly on the top of the hill, it won't move.  However, if you get the placement even the slightest bit off, or some external force (the wind in our example, another planet or an asteroid, etc. in the solar system) moves it ever so slightly, it's going to accelerate away from the top of the hill and go somewhere else.  If it were a stable Lagrange point like L4 or L5 (the points 60 degrees ahead of and behind the Earth's orbit), then it would be more like the bottom of the hill -- if you move the ball slightly away from the very bottom, it would just settle back into the bottom.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a good graphic of the stability of the various Lagrange points:

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put this in the context of L3 a bit more, if the L3 planet were to be a bit slow in its orbit, Earth would catch up, and being behind it, slow it down even more. If it were a bit too fast, Earth would be in front, and drag it forwards, speeding it up. That's not stable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>L3[edit]
L3 is the Sunâ€“Earth Lagrangian point located on the side of the Sun opposite Earth, slightly outside the Earth's orbit.</p>
<p>There are no known objects in this orbital location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haahaa.  I just noticed that you called it &quot;Planet IX&quot;.  Is that because you are referring to it as the ninth planet and not as a variable?  If it is called &quot;Planet X&quot;, which it is, then that would make Pluto Planet 9 again wouldn't it?</p></div>		</li>
