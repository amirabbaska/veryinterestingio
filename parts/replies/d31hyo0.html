			<div class="markdown"><p>They are very accurate, just as you would take photos of a Lake while sitting on a Boat inside the same Lake. Space agencies also use space based satellites and space telescopes such as Hubble, Herschel/ESA, Japanese ASTRO-F and NASA/Spitzer, also looking in other spectra wavelengths such as near-Infrared and Xray, along with ground based radio telescopes, some of which give the ability to cut through the dust and gas which sometimes obscures our views of the Milky Way giving us an even more clear 'picture' so to speak. The space based observatories Gaia and the upcoming JWST should provide great information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, plenty of errors. Beyond the very nearby areas (maybe 5% of the disk), it becomes quite difficult to make out what is going on, precisely. Some things, like the radial velocity of the gas, we can do very accurately, but distance is very, very hard.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like taking a photo of a landscape, using trigonometry to work out how far away the trees are, then drawing a map to show where the trees are relative to each other. You never need to go and touch the trees; it's all just angles and distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except those trees haven't been in those positions for years. And the ones way in the back might not even exist anymore. Our map of our galaxy is only accurate to our current perception of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like taking a picture of the city from the suburbs; even though we're in the same city, we have a vantage point to see the skyscrapers downtown and much of the surrounding area to either side and towards us, but not much on the other side of downtown. We're on the outskirts of our galaxy, so we can point a camera towards the galactic center and photograph much of the galaxy from an edge-on view.</p>
<p>However, just like you can't take a top-down satellite-style photo of your city from a vantage point anywhere on the ground, we can't take a plan-view photo of our galaxy (e.g. showing the spiral arms) from anywhere within it, even way out near the edge where we are. Any photos like that you've seen are of other galaxies similar to ours, or an artist's illustration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most pictures of the Milky Way, the information involved is more &quot;we live in a galaxy that looks basically like this&quot; than anything more specific. You're not using it for stellar navigation or anything, it's just to aid your imagination.</p>
<p>So it's more like looking up &quot;human skull&quot; on wikipedia and using that as an illustration of <em>your</em> skull. Sure, that's actually someone else's skull, but unless you're doing brain surgery, it gives you all the information you want: your skull looks basically like this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I respectfully disagree. We can measure the positions of the stars that are closest to us quite accurately. Unfortunately we can't look very deeply into our own Milky Way due to all the dust that's in it, absorbing light. But radio signals go through it very well. Hydrogen turns out to emit at 21cm, and by pointing a radio telescope along the galactic plane, and measuring the strength of this signal at various frequencies (therefore doppler speeds relative to us) you can build a very good picture of where e.g. the spiral arms are. Specifically, the top down view of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#/media/File:Artist%27s_impression_of_the_Milky_Way_%28updated_-_annotated%29.jpg" target="_blank">our Milky Way</a> that's shown on Wikipedia is based on radio and optical observations to make it as accurate as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh so we can see a part of the milky way, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>it always confused me when I see a post on /r/space titled &quot;took a picture of the milky way today&quot;</p></div>		</li>
