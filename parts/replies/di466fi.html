			<div class="markdown"><p>I found your answer very interesting.</p>
<p>What would we define as the immediate region of any body?</p>
<p>Would the size of the local area around any atom be exactly one light unit(?) away?.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So &quot;the immediate area&quot; is in fact the exact point at which the particle lies.  So say our particle is at a point <em>x</em>.  The force of gravity he feels will be related to the spacetime curvature at that point.</p>
<p>Now, as the other commenter said, CHANGES to curvature propagate at light speed.  For example, the gravitational waves detected a few years back propagated at the speed of light.  This is because they constitute a transfer of <em>information</em>, which must occur at or below the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. Does that mean that a star greater than the speed of light in diameter takes more time to calculate its effect on the curvature of space time then if it turns into a neutron star?</p>
<p>Meaning the same mass took more or less time to calculate the same result based on the distance apart because once it became as small as a neutron star it has fit within the local group.</p>
<p>What im pointing out is that it seems very strange that the universe becomes &quot;more accurate&quot; at calculating the curvature of space time, so long as its all within the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I feel I should expand a little on my original response.</p>
<p>This &quot;non-locality&quot; is not just a problem when we talk about gravity.  It is also something which we encounter in quantum mechanics.  For example, you might at first glance think that entanglement breaks the &quot;nothing faster than light&quot; rule.  However, this is saved by the fact that entanglement does not actually transmit any information.  We also try to formulate our quantum interactions (e.g. particle decays) in terms of <em>local</em> &quot;operators&quot;, that is the local value of some quantity (essentially) as opposed to some universal quantity.</p>
<p>This kind of thing is generally covered by &quot;field theories&quot;, in which we describe (for example) electromagnetism by using a &quot;field&quot; which takes a value at every point in spacetime.  Particles which interact via EM then essentially get affected by the value of the field at the point they are at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is all this scalable at the extremes of mass, e.g., is a black hole as &quot;non-local&quot; in its influence as a lighter mass?  A black hole horizon?  </p>
<p>Are there degrees of &quot;non-locality&quot; or are some forces or gravitational interactions more local than others (or less &quot;non-local&quot;)?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think maybe what's missing here - if the earth disappears, the effects of gravity dissapearing <em>is not</em> instant - the effect travels at the sped of light. </p>
<p>In your question, gravity is always acting on the ball - you happen to stop opposing it instantly, hence an instant reaction </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doggone it, you lost me.  The initial part of your answer seemed to agree with OP that gravity transmits its effects (information) instantaneously, then your edit says that it's not the case, which is exactly what I would have expected.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're saying, and I'm beginning to suspect that your entire post before the edit just simply said &quot;No, OP.  Gravity's effects don't move instantaneously&quot;, which was his/her actual question.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what I'm saying is that the <em>classical</em> (i.e. Newtonian) formulation of gravity (the whole GMm/r^2 thing) requires that all bodies know the locations of all other bodies instantaneously (this isn't the only issue with classical gravity, but is one of the main ones).  This is what OP is essentially asserting.</p>
<p>In our modern, more sophisticated formulation (general relativity), this instantaneous knowledge is <strong>unecessary</strong>, and in fact information about the presence of other bodies travels at the speed of light.</p>
<p>My response aimed to highlight <em>why</em> instantaneous transmission would be an issue, how general relativity fixes it, and how information is really transmitted.</p>
<p>Apologies if I was unclear in any of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it.  Thanks.  To tell you the truth, I thought that it was kind of an obvious question that OP had originally posed, but your top comment appeared to agree with him that it was instantaneous transmission, so I got quite interested.  It was a bit of a letdown when you edited it to make it clear that the universe actually worked exactly the way I expected it to.  I was hoping there was more to your original comments that I just wasn't grasping.  Unfortunately not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not any more, no.</p>
<p>In the distant past, prior to the inflationary period, (assuming gravity worked the same way back then and wasn't merged into the other forces somehow) the entire Universe was causally connected and so evrything gravitated everything else.  After inflation, objects outside the observable portion of the Universe will no longer affect us.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I know this might be obvious but do you mean this is because of the universes expansion rate?</p>
<p>Things outside the observable universe cant have their gravitational waves reach us specifically because we are gaining as much distance as the wave might be travelling.</p></div>		</li>
