			<div class="markdown"><p>We think we probably have, but not definitively. If we have, it's been done in the Large Hadron Collider, and possibly in smaller synchotrons as well. A characteristic of Hawking radiation is that all particles in the Standard Model are emitted in equal numbers, which means that this is possibly the process by which the massive particles which have been observed (the Higgs particle, for example) were generated. This also means that if this is the mechanism of their generation, every particle in the Standard Model is now being produced at the LHC, and was being produced even before the major power upgrade it received in 2013-2015. As more data is collected, we can expect to see these micro-black holes occuring more frequently. Of course, since we haven't verified these micro - black holes, it's entirely possible that some other process is at work, and we are just wrong.</p></div>		</li>
