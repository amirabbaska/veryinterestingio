			<div class="markdown"><p>No, eustress and destress and just positive and negative stress, respectively. Examples: Distress is you were demoted or fired. Eustress is your getting married or buying a house. It doesn't matter if it's physically or mentally happening. They both create the same physical sensations. Which is kind of a blessing and a curse to know. Another point: When you are having an event your excited about coming up, it's easy to go back and forth between anxious and excitement because it's your mental state that determines the feeling... The physical sensation is the same. </p></div>		</li>
