			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. I think I can recall the King of Babylon being called the Morning Star once. So this explanation also makes sense.</p>
<p>Are there any other verses that people &quot;incorrectly&quot; associate as a reference to Satan?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on your definition of 'incorrectly', a lot of them. First of, many of the verses in the old testament prophets which concern foreign kings could easily be read as concerning Satan if read out of their textual context, and/or without knowledge of the historical context of the text. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the apocalypses in the Bible (primarily Daniel and The book of revelation) use coded language to speak of the political powers in the world as manifestations of Satan and his power. For instance, as you might have heard, the famous number of the beast (666) is very likely a reference to Nero. So while the author of revelation definitely would say that he was writing about Satan, he was not primarily/only making prophecy about the future, but also describing what he saw as manifestations of Satan in the world he lived in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite the same but I've heard people use &quot;Beelzebub&quot; as a synonym for Satan.</p>
<p>His name comes from the Philisitine god Baal Zebul who is derived from the Canaanite god Ba'al. The strategy of the early Judaism was to declare the other gods to demons or idols in order to maintain the narrative of monotheism.</p>
<p>In the middle ages the term &quot;Mammon&quot; was personified as a demon, although in the text it was probably meant to be just money or materialism. Generally people in the middle ages just wanted to make up demons, and used small hints in the text as reference (or just made stuff up). The Zeitgeist in the middle ages was just &quot;everything sucks&quot;, life sucks, humans sucks and the life after death is even worse.</p>
<p>Then as Christianity progressed the many demons just got rolled into one big bad - a monotheistic god works best with one antagonist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Satan as the main Adversary/Old Dragon was always there. Elaborate demonologies went out of fashion at  the Reformation. But it's still present in Milton</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, the idea of Satan being a fallen angel origonates (I think? At least was popularized) with Milton's <em>Paradise Lost,</em> where the angel Lucifer, god's Left Hand Man (blah blah lefties are evil), decides to stage a communist uprising with like a third of the angels, and god bitch-slaps him so hard that he plummets from heaven, through the earth, and into Hell, where he basically says &quot;fine, I'll make my own afterlife, with hookers and blackjack!&quot;
Between that and Dante's <em>Inferno</em>, a lot of actual scripture and pop culture (meant to carefuly insult the rich asshats that ran Europe at the time), got confused together into the general public's mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a bastardisation of the events of the book of Enoch (non-canon in most sects, but referenced in the bible AS IF the canon authors believed it).</p>
<p>Ironically the blackjack and hookers fits, but happened before God punished them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first section of the book depicts the interaction of the fallen angels with mankind; Sêmîazâz compels the other 199 fallen angels to take human wives to &quot;beget us children&quot;. This results in the creation of the Nephilim (Genesis) or Anakim/Anak (Giants) as they are described in the book</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically angels lusting over human women. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they became pregnant, and they bare great giants, whose height was three hundred ells:[69] Who consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kids have superpowers and turn evil. Meanwhile the angels teach humans things they were not meant to know (Azazel science-y stuff and Semjâzâ magic-y stuff). </p>
<p>God then warns Noah of the flood, which will cleanse the world of the angels, their children and those that have been corrupted (a much more reasonable explanation than the bibles &quot;Too many sinners so lets KILL EVERYONE&quot;).  Then God says &quot;Screw Azazel in particular&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Lord said to Raphael: &quot;Bind Azâzêl hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dûdâêl (God's Kettle/Crucible/Cauldron), and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not see light. And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the Watchers have disclosed and have taught their sons. And the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azâzêl: to him ascribe all sin.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that became interchanged with Lucifer/satan etc. Still interesting to see God hated science specifically long before modern science was a thing (written 300BC), but was reasonable enough to put the sin of it onto Azazel rather than blaming us poor humans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is clear from Job that Satan is a spiritual being.  And we see him again tempting Christ in the Wilderness in Matthew 4:1-11.  Luke also talks about him being cast out of heaven as a lightning bolt from the sky.  Additionally Revelations 12 goes into great detail about how Satan and a third of the angels that fought to overtake heaven were cast to the earth.  This is straight from the bible, not some other book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know of any subreddits that focus on the historical/cultural origins of the bible? I find the book itself interesting, but not so much interperating it, especially with how muddled its become over millennia. I feel like if I understood its origins and the origins of its versions better, I might find greater interest in actually reading it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a book called &quot;Don't know much about the Bible&quot; that I thought was an interesting perspective. </p>
<p>The author looks at some historical context, discusses differences between versions, and talks about how certain translation choices or accidents came to shape various aspects of the beliefs in modern forms of Christianity. </p>
<p>Not exactly a subreddit, but still an interesting way to examine the Bible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Old Testament was written in Ancient Hebrew. The New Testament was written mostly written in Aramaic and Greek. The first five books of the NT (the Gospels) are 5 disciples accounts of their time with Jesus. The predominant language in Judea and Samaria at the time was Aramaic, and so that's what they wrote them in. A lot of the NT thereafter was letters written by the apostle Paul to various churches in the Mediterranean and Adriatic regions (Think Greece and Anatolia). As the language in those regions was either Greek (predominant) or Latin, that is the language Paul used to communicate with the peoples there. </p>
<p>Eventually, Rome went from its polytheistic ways to becoming fully Christianized. This is where a lot of the scripts that were not in Latin were translated into Latin. (This continued through the Holy Roman Empire). However, the formal Bible as we know it today was not actually assembled for a while after the events described in it occur. Before a group of Christian scholars sat down and decided what should be the 'codex of Christianity' if you will, what was taught was the Jewish Tannach (Torah and the rest of the Old Testament), and several books written while Jesus was alive and shortly thereafter. Once these scholars finished compiling what books should be included, that task of making sure everything was translated properly into Latin began, culminating in the original Catholic bible.</p></div>		</li>
