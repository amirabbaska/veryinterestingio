<p>All the above is true but there is also the issue of translating some of these ideas to production.  A lot of ideas that came my way could never be produced efficiently (if at all) on the available equipment.</p>
<p>Several great ideas that I could coat well could not be made into modules.  One was very efficient but swelled when under charge.  Another had unpredictable reliability.</p>
<p>As you said, batteries are much more than just chemicals on a bench.  They have to work outside the lab and the world outside the lab has a LOT more variables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in terms of the U.S., even more important than translating a new theoretical concepts to the marketplace <em>efficiently,</em> is the ability to do so <em>profitably.</em> If someone can't make a buck doing it, they're not going to invest in tooling up to produce it. The only divergence from this paradigm is when the government (NASA, the military, etc.), not driven by the profit motive, produces a working form of a new technology because it is &quot;mission critical,&quot; and at some later date, the general public mayl eventually benefit by way of &quot;trickle-down.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly true.  All of my work included costing in the efficiency numbers.</p>
<p>Due to machine utilization needs, even having to slow down to obtain better curing of the coating would eat away at profit.</p>
<p>I had one trial formulation that worked great in bench testing and even showed promise when converted to coin cells but once it was scaled, no slurry delivery systems that I had or could reasonably piece together could get it to the coater without becoming near-solid in moments.</p>
<p>As you obviously know, the real world is not a Phd. paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets not forget that battery journalism is really terrible.  Often you will see something that says &quot;This battery charges in 20 seconds!&quot; with no mention of capacity or &quot;This battery holds 2x the amount of current batteries!&quot; with no mention of number of charge cycles or charge time.</p>
<p>Like all fields, there are tradeoffs. Energy density, charge time, charge cycles, all of these factors are extremely important when talking about a future battery, yet only 1 is ever mentioned in any of the journalism about new batteries.</p>
<p>And of course, manufacturing is a distant afterthought that really is the difference between &quot;in every device&quot; and &quot;Never going to happen&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Arrrgh... that is very, very true!</p>
<p>The most irritating words to a manufacturing engineer come from the mouths of R&amp;D, &quot;We have a new formulation for you to run - it works great in the lab!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi. I've decided to ELI5 this response. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Batteries are not complicated devices; this means they can't be improved through design changes as much as other devices. We have to improve the type of chemicals and substances used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're moving around energy currently using the 'best' elements for it; we've reached the limit of what traditional chemistry can get us. </p>
</li>
<li>Storing energy in a small space is inherently unsafe. That means a researcher has to create new materials and structures that may, or may not, be safe to use. This results in a lot of time and energy invested into every step. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not that batteries are complicated; electronics are too, but we shrink those all the time. Batteries are basically chemical reactions housed in a box that can only hold so much energy at a given size. Shrinking down the size of a battery logically infers loss of storage, where shrinking parts to a complex machine does not necessarily hinder its purpose</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things:</p>
<p>1) That answers why battery technology progresses slowly, but not why we hear about battery advancements but never seem to see much improvement.</p>
<p>2) ELI5: Why does an older battery hold less charge than a newer battery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 - It's a problem of scale.  To rehash just one point I made before - Scientists are great at dreaming up the material it takes to solve their problem, but they aren't so great at making it.</p>
<p>When they inevitably <em>do</em> make it, they become really great at making tiny amounts of it, and then later someone has to figure out if they can make lots of it, if they can make it at a cost that makes it feasible, and (and this last one is the most important) whether or not the physics and chemistry of whatever they made continues to work on a larger scale.  Some materials just don't retain their electronic properties when found in bulk vs. found in smaller varieties or structures.</p>
<p>Edit - I omitted the second question entirely.</p>
<p>2) This explanation isn't the whole truth, but it's the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>Batteries are basically just containers for chemical reactions.  The reaction happens, energy (electrons) gets released, and whatever you're using gets power.  Unfortunately, chemical reactions are never perfect, and reversing them is super difficult.  So you've got your battery, and it performs it's reaction to release energy.  That reaction doesn't <em>quite</em> happen 100% completely.  Now you plug in your device, and energy goes back into the battery, forcing the chemical reaction to happen in reverse.  This <em>also</em> doesn't happen 100%.  Let that cycle repeat itself even just a few dozen times, and you've got batteries that are less capable of holding charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you hear about in press releases is usually overblown.  A lot of press releases/articles I've seen saying stuff like &quot;This material will CHANGE BATTERIES!&quot; are actually saying things more like &quot;This material has an interesting idea, but performance is actually not thaaaat much better than the average for the field.&quot;</p>
<p>Scaling up from lab to production can be very tough...  However, it isn't entirely true that we know what we need to make but making it is hard, as some others have said.  For a lot new battery tech - silicon anode, sulfur cathode, etc - we know the core material we want to use, but we don't know how to make it work well.  You have to do clever things with these - make these into particular shapes, combine it with the right other materials, etc - before they work well.  Also, there are still gaps in our basic understanding of how some things work (for example, solid electrolytes, which are safer than liquid electrolytes due to low flammability), and so it's hard to make those materials better efficiently.</p></div>		</li>
