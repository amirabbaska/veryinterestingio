			<div class="markdown"><p>Different people respond differently.  It has much more to do with your body reducing circulation to your fingers (so the blood doesn't keep it warm) than it does the external temperature.  So to you a chilly office may do it (especially if you have poor circulation), while to somebody used to cold climates, well fed, hydrated, and undergoing strenuous physical activity could have warm hands at much colder temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
