<p>I used to think that this preoccupation for health only appeared later.
Also, did armies not exercise their soldiers before Victorian Era?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm taking a class this semester at uni specifically about the physical culture movement and the required reading before class began was a book about the McFadden. Never even heard about the dude before but he's certainly an interesting fella. He had some interesting ideas (fasting while sick, eating sand to help digest food) but was also a little nutty like being vehemently against vaccinations.</p>

<p>I know it's crazy to think about but all of our current ideas about exercising and dieting all originated here in the mid 19th century and not many people know about the physical culture movement.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>They did, but it's not as black and white as my original comment would lead one to believe. I made sweeping generalizations that I would have preferred not to have made, but I was trying to keep it relatively simple (a la ELI5).</p>
<p>At the top of the Victorian army were officers who descended from high class families. At the time, it was a very noble job that was glorified by the elites and it would be an accomplishment for a rich man's son to become an enlisted officer. Because of their financial well-being, they had the time to keep in shape from the typical sports and other activities in their spare time.</p>
<p>However, enlisted officers only comprised a small percent of the manpower of the army and in times of war more bodies were needed to man the battlefield. Before industrial times, finding able bodies wasn't difficult as most men worked in the fields, plowing, farming, etc, you know doing things with their bodies. But as industry sprang, vast swaths of the population began moving to cities to work in the new factories. Many of these factory workers didn't perform nearly the same amount of work that was required from agricultural work.</p>
<p>Of course there were still people in fit shape throughout society, but there were clear signs that many were unfit. </p></div>		</li>
