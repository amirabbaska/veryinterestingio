<p>Cats should be on an all meat diet for their health and for the smell factor in ones home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a vet but I have recently changed my cats diet according to my vet and will chime in.</p>
<p>My cat gets a mix of wet and dry food.</p>
<p>1) There are high protein and grain free dry foods. They are a bit more expensive but as your cat will be getting more of the nutrients that he or she actually needs and less of the extra they can't process, they will eat less.</p>
<p>2) Dry food is good for their teeth. But cats aren't good at drinking enoigh water so dry food only can lead to a dehydrated cat and utis.</p>
<p>3) Wet food is often high protein (double check but most of them are). It's also good for helping cats stay hydrated.</p>
<p>My cat gets 1.3 oz of wet food in the morning. 1/3 cup of dry food to graze on throughout the day. And another 1.3 oz of wet food at night (and usually has a few kibbles left of dry food).</p>
<p>She is pooping less because more of the food she eats is actually nutrients she can use.</p>
<p>She is eating less than when I had her on cheap dry food. So even though the food is more expensive I am saving money.</p>
<p>And she is maintaining weight and able to regulate her food better. She used to eat her whole bowl and then be mad at me for a few hours until her next feeding. Her dry kibble lasts her all day now.</p>
<p>I am not a vet. Your best option is to do some research and talk to your vet about it. My cat is also young and a healthy cat with no diet restrictions.</p>
<p>Key things to look at on food is protein content as well as the actual ingredients. You want your top few ingredients to be meat. If they aren't move along to the next one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The kibble contributes to general dehydration and carb overload for cats.  Going to canned is better and I personally use meat to make my own cat food.  I only use canned as an enticement for ill or stubborn cats.  Making my own cat food is half the cost of canned and I control what they eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actual meat or very high protein content cat food that is properly designed and manufactured.  Wet food will introduce more water into their diet and result in some softer stool.  However most indoor cats are dehydrated because people only give them dry food and cats get a lot of their hydration via food versus water dishes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I researched this after my two <del>jerks</del> best friends were having tummy issues and pooping so foul I could smell it from outside my door. Switched to all meat and now they poop odorless clay colored litter cookies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Through dietary changes I have managed to do clean poos. Essentially not eating meat, eating no processed foods, just whole grains and fruit and veg, and kefir, after about 2 weeks my turds leave no trace and don't smell.</p>
<p>I never managed it for more than a week though, because the temptation to go back to normal Western eating is too strong. It only takes one sausage or beefburger to make me drop a stinking marker pen shit down the toilet.</p></div>		</li>
