			<div class="markdown"><p>This response is a bit misleading. Planck temperature is not an upper limit to possible temperatures, it's just the temperature at which we expect our current understanding of physics to break down and weird stuff to happen. So it's not an upper limit at all in the sense OP is asking about. Absolute zero is a lower limit in that nothing can be colder than that, but things could be hotter than Planck temperature, we just don't know what would happen if they were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not a dumb question at all! It's a very smart question, and I'm glad you asked. Most people think of temperature as a measure of how fast the particles in an object are moving. This is true to a certain extent, but it's also not 100% accurate.</p>
<p>In reality, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. Since moving faster means more kinetic energy, the hotter -&gt; faster moving particles is generally correct. However, in relativity a particle's speed cannot exceed c. But it can still have greater and greater kinetic energy! There is no limit to how much kinetic energy a particle can have since the correct, relativistic formula for kinetic energy isn't proportional to a power of the speed. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/releng.html#c6" target="_blank">It is more complicated.</a> As the kinetic energy gets bigger and bigger, the particle's speed gets closer and closer to c but never gets there (having its speed become c requires the kinetic energy to be infinite).</p>
<p>All of this is to say that even though the speeds of the particles cannot exceed c, their kinetic energies can continue to grow unbounded, and as they do, so does the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add, the reason why we are so close to absolute zero, and so far away from the plank temperature, is that for life to exist, things needs to move a little bit, but not too much. </p>
<p>If you can imagine an office with workers in it, they don't really need to move that much to make that office functional, typing on the computer and the occasional walk to and from the bathroom. Putting a jetpack on each of them and have them shoot around at the speed of sound would not make for a productive environment. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A very good way to put it! (It might, however, be more fun that way.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate for OP, the Planck constants were derived from an idea that there is not infinite energy. The conclusion from this assumption is that at the quantum level, energy is not analog; it’s sent as discrete packets. For example, a candle emits a certain range of electromagnetic radiation. If energy was spread across the entire emission range as an analog function, that would mean that between any two wavelengths, you can still divide that distance infinitely many times and energy must occupy those intermediate wavelengths. Therefore, an infinite amount of places to find a very small amount of energy is still infinite energy. </p>
<p>So how do we not have infinite energy? Planck constants. They dictate the smallest physical amount of “stuff” that can exist whether it be time, energy, distance, or whatever. </p>
<p>At least that’s as far as I understand. </p></div>		</li>
