<p>We currently believe we can keep the warming around 2C because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. In the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2C.</p>

<p>Isn't 2C the conservative estimate, based on a very optimistic scenario of significant and immediate action? I've heard climate scientists say that it is no longer a realistic target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been out of the loop for a few years now so take my knowledge with a grain of salt. I remember 2015 as being the breaking point from which emissions had to rapidly decrease in order to hit the 2C goal, which did not happen, and that even then there would be about a 50/50 chance. Some scientists at the time I was fairly well read, around 2010, strongly argued for a 350ppm concentration goal which required even more drastic actions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that it's largely unknown just where the point-of-no-return is or was, and we'll only learn that well after the fact. I think 2C was always a stretch goal and a relatively arbitrary one chosen because it seemed borderline achievable. Same with 350ppm. I think the situation is pretty grim, but that's not a great message. Regardless, we had better get on this as quickly as possible, no matter how bad the odds are that it will change the trend.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends what side of the aisle they are on. There a lot of money and politics in it as well. Arguing the temp will be even .1 degree higher may award tens of millions of dollars extra for their cause. Equally the other way around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Methane is a more efficient greenhouse gas than water and CO2 (because it has more vibrational modes, which are (kind of) a necessary condition for absorbing infrared radiation), but it's less abundant (parts per billion methane vs parts per million CO2 and a widely varying (but higher) number density for water).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you expand on this a little more? I understand that having a vibrational mode of the right energy will allow a molecule to absorb infrared radiation and become excited, but the &quot;kind of&quot; implies there is more to the story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also depends wether you look at it over 20-50 or a hunred years, methane degrades quicker than CO2 so Co2eq over 20 years is much higher than CO2eq over 100 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;important.&quot; As I understand it, methane is MUCH more potent in terms of heat capture but both falls out of the atmosphere much more quickly and is in much lower concentrations (measured in parts per BILLION whereas CO2 is in ppm). So it is top of the list in terms of heat capture but not overall effect. Hope that makes sense!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So methane currently breaks down pretty quickly in the lower atmosphere, mostly into water vapor and co2.</p>
<p>It can persist longer in the upper atmosphere, though, and it will persist longer and longer as atmospheric concentrations increase.</p>
<p>To quote wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most effective sink of atmospheric methane is the hydroxyl radical in the troposphere, or the lowest portion of Earth’s atmosphere. As methane rises into the air, it reacts with the hydroxyl radical to create water vapor and carbon dioxide. <strong>The lifespan of methane in the atmosphere was estimated at 9.6 years as of 2001; however, increasing emissions of methane over time reduce the concentration of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere</strong>. With less OH˚ to react with, the lifespan of methane could also increase, resulting in greater concentrations of atmospheric methane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#Troposphere" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#Troposphere</a></p>
<p>In other words, it's not in the top two GHGs because</p>
<p>1) It breaks down into the top two (water vapor and co2) and</p>
<p>2) The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is currently small, but that will increase over time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically all large-scale experiments with carbon sequestration so far have been a failure. And even once we have technology, we still have no idea how to solve the economic and political problems of deploying it on the scale that's required. Everything we've done so far has been achieved based on the win-win model of &quot;the less energy you use, the more money you save&quot;. That won't be the case with carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of the scale that will be required, reforestation (i.e. planting trees where there currently aren't any) sequesters <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40562.pdf" target="_blank">around 2 tons of CO₂ per acre per year</a>. We need to reach negative carbon emissions of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3369.epdf" target="_blank">10-20 GtCO2 per year</a> by 2100. That means
that if we accomplished this just with reforestation, we'd need to reforest something like 11 million square miles, or about twice the size of Russia. There simply isn't anywhere near that amount of land available that would be suitable for reforestation. And even if there were, it would probably requiring converting a lot of crop land to forest.</p></div>		</li>
