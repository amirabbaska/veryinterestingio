			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your great answer. Explains it perfectly.</p>
<p>Also 52 foot tides must be pretty crazy!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also... I am totally waiting for someone to come in to this thread with breaking news about Harmonic Oscillation of Tidal Groundwater (HOTG), which shows that there is tidal forces acting on groundwater on millennia  scale or something. </p>
<p>We will see.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the 52 foot tide is the result of a resonance and/or constructive wave interference because the bay is shaped just perfectly to amplify the ocean tide at the mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;A tide is about 6 hours, so it is moving about 0.5 feet an hours. </p>
<p>In bay of Fundy (Nova Scotia), where there are 11 to 52 foot tides (2 to 10 feet an hour),&quot;</p>
<p>Just a clarification on the movement of water.
It's not a simple up and down at a steady rate.
It's more of a sine wave...
The rule of thumb I learnt for sailing is the rule of twelfths.
High tide
Hour 1 - 1/12th
Hour 2 - 2/12ths
Hour 3 - 3/12ths
Hour 4 - 3/12ths
Hour 5 - 2/12ths
Hour 6 - 1/12th.
Low tide, and so on.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that is so cool, thanks for sharing, I'd never heard about the rule of 1/12ths.  It's amazing how useful the number 12 is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's a product of how we divide the day up. If we had a 20 hour clock, there would be 5 hour tides and we'd have the rule of 1/10ths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is correct here. The groundwater simply moves with the solid body tide but not independent of it.</p></div>		</li>
