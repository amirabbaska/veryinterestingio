			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure that was right.... but it may just be words making things difficult.</p>
<p>Sand doesn't move until you so something to it.... stir it with a stick or something. Just because it's not moving doesn't mean it's a brick; it's still sand.</p>
<p>Any interaction at all with helium at absolute zero will cause it to move like a liquid... but that interaction means things aren't really at 0 any more so it becomes an issue of definition.</p>
<p>It's almost like quantum uncertainty. You can't tell if it exhibits the properties of a liquid or a solid without causing some kind of action; that action ensures it's no longer at 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to say it in a way that would be simpler, but basically what I'm saying is, the intermolecular forces aren't strong enough to make it a solid, even though none of the molecules are moving</p></div>		</li>
