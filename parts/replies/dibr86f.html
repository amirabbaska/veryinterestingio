			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>Also, I think I misused the word &quot;cause.&quot; What I meant was, how widely accepted is it that the main underlying <em>impairment</em> in ADHD is in executive function rather than attention, as Dr. Barkley argues? </p>
<p>It sounds like it is pretty widely accepted. And I'll say that it certainly fits my own experience of the disorder much better than the old &quot;no input filter&quot; description that I heard growing up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can imagine any disease as a graph of causes and and effects where each effect itself can be a cause. In ADHD we might see something like this (a real model would be much more complicated). What I'm trying to show is that executive function issues are both caused by the pathology of ADHD while also being the cause of some of ADHDs symptoms.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SPECIFICALLY~ Is this why Dr. Barkely calls it &quot;...INTENTION deficit disorder&quot;, because the brain is conflicted between pursuing delayed executive (high reward) tasks, and more immediate low reward tasks? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. Assessing for executive functioning deficits is standard procedure in neuropsychological testing. Also, Barkley is one of the top names in the field if ADHD research. Multiple of his screening measures are widely used in neuropsychological assessment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Attentional control <em>is</em> one of the primary executive function processes. Is Dr. Barkley just saying that ADHD encompasses more than <em>just</em> attentional deficits? (I haven't looked into what he's said)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: yes. Longer answer: he would argue that calling it an attention disorder is deeply misleading and causes people to not understand what the actual problem is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you give a similar (high-level) answer on what's the current consensus (if there is one) on the relation between ADHD and autism spectrum disorders?</p>
<p>Executive function deficiencies are a shared feature of both disorders, or am I misinformed? If so, would that point to a common cause (some partial causal overlap, at least), or is it likely to be coincidental?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're quite different disorders. ADHD is caused by abnormal neurotransmitter levels. ASD is caused by the brain developing abnormally causing abnormal connections between different areas in the brain. However it's becoming more recognised that a high percentage of people with ASD also have comorbid ADHD (estimated 25-30% of people with ASD in the UK), and it's important to have both diagnosed as the effects of each can appear quite similar but require different forms of intervention.
Issues with executive function are present in both, however the way the two conditions are diagnosed are quite different so they can normally be confident of both diagnoses</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think the current explanation can explain a lot of the comorbidities between ADHD and mood disorders?</p>
<p>I was not diagnosed until I was an adult however always had ongoing periods of anxiety and depression. Once I was diagnosed and got on Vyvanse I was eventually able to discontinue Prozac and have not had a return in mood disorder symptoms since switching. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know a lot less about what depression is under the hood than ADHD. It is correlated to lower serotonin and dopamine, and dopamine clicks here, but correlation is all we know AFAIK.</p>
<p>There's a huge psychological causation: the frustrations of ADHD, the constant rejections and negative feedback, the shattered self-esteem... they all can make one deeply depressed. Rejection sensitivity dysphoria is a big link here, but we don't know whether it's a learned reaction or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting diagnosed with ADHD? It's just a battery of tests administered optimally by a psychologist who specializes in that area. I was diagnosed as having the inattentive kind about 25 years ago, by an MD who set up shop mainly to treat ADD in adults. That was when it was just making headlines that adults can have it, and that people don't just &quot;outgrow&quot; ADHD. Now it's typically a psychologist who has a special interest in it. </p></div>		</li>
