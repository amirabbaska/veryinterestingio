			<div class="markdown"><p>While everyone agrees the prototype has been built, most physicists are extremely skeptical about it and attribute the small amounts of thrust generate (0.0001 N) to originate from other sources (heat, charge build-up, measurement error (interference from the device), etc).  </p>
<p>None of the results have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.  Physicists don't buy the results for the same reason you don't accept people who claim to have built perpetual motion machines -- when someone claims to violate a fundamental law (conservation of momentum or 2nd law of thermodynamics) you need to see very very strong experimental evidence of it (preferably with theoretic underpinning) and even then you'll still be skeptical.</p></div>		</li>
