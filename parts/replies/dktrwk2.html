			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said!</p>
<p>To expand, the eye has rods and cones all over the place.  But there are more cones concentrated in the center of our vision (where we do most of our focusing) leaving less room for the rods.  The opposite is true of our peripheral vision.  </p>
<p>There are two at home tests you can do for this.  Get a handful of gummie bears (ask your mom).  Hold one behind you without looking at it.  Slowly extend your arm and move it into your periphial vision.  You will have trouble figuring out what color it is.  It could even &quot;change&quot; color as you move it more forward!</p>
<p>The other test is one you've already figured out.  Look for a dim light source in a dark environment.  A dim LED will be hard/impossible to see when you look right at it, but when you look away... BAM there it was the whole time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This same thing happened to me, but looking at a small LED at night instead of a star. I thought maybe it was just eye damage due to looking directly at the sun a lot when I was a kid. Good to know I'm normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really?!  So you're legally blind?  You don't see a dark spot...it's just really blurry?  Does this suggest that the retinal damage healed or wasn't that bad but there was damage to the lens?  That sucks.</p></div>		</li>
