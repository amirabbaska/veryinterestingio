<p>the CDU in Germany, which is relatively economically to the right, but socially still more to the left that even the most leftist of US Dems</p>

<p>yeah, nah, not even close. On most social issues (immigration and minorities, LGBT rights, environmentalism, and so on) they're much more conservative than most US leftists. They're absolutely not 'socially liberal'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you aware that Germany doesn't have gay marriage and the CDU doesn't support it? To be fair, it has a left-wing position on refugees. I'd say it is a fairly centrist party with some rightward leanings  on economics and social policy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, the best sorting of these things comes from the Democracy series of games. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a03gx9HF9dQ" target="_blank">3 minute Youtube clip</a> and the wiki: <a href="http://democracygame.wikia.com/wiki/Voter_group" target="_blank">http://democracygame.wikia.com/wiki/Voter_group</a></p>
<p>Liberal in Democracy is opposed by Conservative, while in monetary concerns it is mostly Capitalists versus Socialists. Any given voter belongs to about ten different voting groups at varying degrees of influence which determines their overall vote and approval rating.</p>
<p>I like it because it clears up the confusion caused by social-liberal, market-liberal and libertarians.</p></div>		</li>
