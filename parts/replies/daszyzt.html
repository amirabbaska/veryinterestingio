			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with that, you're able to constantly adjust your temperature if you're under a blanket. A little too hot? Put an arm outside the blanket. Feet are cold? Get em under the blanket. If the entire room is slightly too hot you can't just put your arm in a different room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dorm room in college was this way: hot as shit in the summer without AC, too hot/too cold in the winter because if the heater was on, it was too hot, so, to cool down we had to have the window open, which would eventually make it too cold.   </p>
<p>(There wasn't a thermostat on the heater, or ours was just broken.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The neoprene of the wetsuit is porous, but only very slightly. Most of the water transfer is through the cuffs and collar. When you first get into cool water in your wetsuit, it's still effing cold. Soon, though, the water trapped against your body warms and you get comfy.</p>
<p>However, the mechanism of regulating the heat is different than a blanket.The reason you don't boil in a wetsuit, over time, is that the water is constantly circulating through as you move. So, you are constantly losing some of your warm water and gaining some cool. However, it happens so slowly that that you don't freeze.</p></div>		</li>
