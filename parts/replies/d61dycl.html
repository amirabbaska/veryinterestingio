			<p>Just like salmon, that live in the ocean and spawn in fresh water streams, when they migrate to their spawning grounds they sit at the mouth of the river (where the river meets the ocean), the fresh water pouring in dilutes the salt water so they can sit and gradually get accustomed to the change before swimming up stream. Which is also why a mouth of a river makes such good fishing spots!👍</p>		</li>
