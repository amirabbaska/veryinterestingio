			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer so far. In terms of commercial flight #1 is the main reason.  Hugely surprised none of the top answers mention turbulence. 37,000 feet keeps the plane safely above <a href="https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/courses/atsc113/flying/met_concepts/03-met_concepts/03f-BL_obstacle_wake/index.html" target="_blank">boundary-layer turbulence</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree. I was scrolling seeing when someone mentioned turbulence. Keeping it that high is for your benefit flying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think #3 is definetly undervalued.</p>
<p>Height gives you time, distance, or speed to resolve problems.  The Gimli Glider incident is a good example of how the extra height helped mitigate a complete engine failure.</p>
<p>In that case, they maintained a 12:1 glide ratio, meaning 35k feet would give a plane something like 80 miles of range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been reading through this whole thing ready to post about smoother air if I found none.  </p>
<p>The only thing you left out is it gives more room for ALL types of flying things to play together, and the planes will be cleaner from less bird/bug/GA strikes. </p></div>		</li>
