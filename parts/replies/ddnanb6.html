			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is wrong. To root your phone you are not going to replace the bootloader. You unlock it, you disable a security feature which is a feature of the bootloader (usually). </p>
<p>After that you aren't going to do anything with it, except flash a custom recovery like TWRP, which also doesn't replace the bootloader partition. It replaces the recovery partition, so if you mess that up you can just try again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You're not changing the bootloader, just the recovery. </p>
<p>Sometimes you can find some custom bootloader for some phones but it's rare and I really don't recommend it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only works on dual bios. If you abort a firmware upgrade you'll be on the mercy on the firmware designer that he put an non-erasable usb copier in it.</p>
<p>Steps go like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bios: check if Im complete.</li>
<li>If not, copy bios.bin from usb port 0.</li>
<li>Turn all the side chips on. (Display, disks, sound)</li>
<li>Find disks.</li>
<li>Start operating system from disk.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2 used to be common during the floppy ages.
It isn't now since USB requires more code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be nice if they added a tiny extra non-reprogrammable chip capable of accepting data over a UART connection and writing it to the BIOS chip. Would make a great final fallback if all other recovery methods failed. But extra chips cost money, and very few people would ever need it.</p></div>		</li>
