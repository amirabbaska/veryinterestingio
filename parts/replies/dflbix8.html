<blockquote>
<p>Based on a comprehensive examination of ninety-eight issues, this volume demonstrates that sixty percent of recent lobbying campaigns failed to change policy despite millions of dollars spent trying. Why? The authors find that resources explain less than five percent of the difference between successful and unsuccessful efforts. Moreover, they show, these attempts must overcome an entrenched Washington system with a tremendous bias in favor of the status quo.</p>

<p>However, if the lobbyists says, &quot;Remember that bill we talked about the other day? I saw you voted the way we like. It is clear that your worldview and ours are compatible, and since we like you so much, here's $500 for your campaign&quot;, then that's not corruption. It is perfectly legal.</p>

<p>This is so important to recognize. If you made it illegal for lobbyists to donate for this reason then it would essentially make it illegal for private citizens to donate. After all, how do you know that $10 donation to senator sanders wasn't a bribe!?!??!?!</p></div>		</li>
