<p>We'd spent a long day in the burning sun. He was feeling very peculiar and ended up needing medical treatment. Didn't know what was wrong with himself. </p>
<p>Turns out he was sunburnt. Had never happened to him previously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the accepted explanation for why people who are native to more equatorial places have darker skin.  </p>
<p>The melanin that makes skin darker has the primary purpose of absorbing the UV radiation and preventing it from damaging the skin.  Studies have shown a direct correlation between the color of a person's skin and how much sun exposure it takes for them to burn.  Simply put, areas of the world that get more sunlight produced people better adapted to the sunlight.</p>
<p>This is also why &quot;tanning&quot; occurs.  When someone is subjected to more sunlight, their skin responds by producing more melanin and making them darker.  However, everyone still has a relatively limited range of how dark or light their skin can get.</p>
<p>This does produce some medically relevant effects on a more global population.  Not everyone currently lives in areas that get similar amounts of sunlight to where their ancestors lived.  People who live in areas with less sunlight find themselves as strangers to sunburns and skin cancer (not that they are immune, just that the conditions are rare for them).  At the same time, these people often suffer from vitamin D deficiency because their skin absorbs too much UV light to synthesis the vitamin properly.  The opposite also occurs with people who live in areas with more sunlight in that they will have an elevated risk of sunburn and skin cancer, but vitamin D deficiency will be rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that the mechanism to absorb UV light to prevent it from damaging the cells' DNA isn't connected to the mechanism to absorb UV light for synthesis of vitamin D?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because evolution often doesn't design a perfectly efficient machine, but rather one that works &quot;good enough&quot;.  I'm sure that if we got a team of engineers to sit down and design the human body, they could make it happen.  However, a mechanism that functions that way simply never evolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans originally evolved to have dark skin, with melanin blocking most of the UV radiation and preventing (or greatly reducing) sunburns.</p>
<p>Really it's light-skinned people that have deviated from that norm. It's still up for debate, but the general working hypothesis is that it had to do with getting more vitamin D - because melanin blocking UV is great in equatorial regions, but closer to the poles (eg. in Europe) its protection against sunburn is less necessary, and instead the reduction in vitamin D generation (driven by UV radiation) takes precedence as a negative effect.</p>
<p>This also correlates well with the observation that women tend to have lighter skin than men. Women are more dependent on vitamin D during pregnancy and breastfeeding, because vitamin D boosts calcium absorbtion.</p></div>		</li>
