			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. </p>
<p>There was an excellent article in the Health Physical Journal recently that covered the differences (and health consequences) of a ground-detonated vs aerial-detonated device.  Lots of the points in the paper are relevant to the discussion here. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sedan  crater was actually part of operation plowshare, it was looking into non war uses of nukes like blasting a canal.   <a href="https://www.nnss.gov/pages/PublicAffairsOutreach/NNSStours.html" target="_blank">We got to go right up to the edge of the crater on the tour, here is a link to sign up if you want to take it.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really need to go and do that.</p>
<p>Sedan is an odd one for naming schemes - it's part of Plowshare, but the devices used were generally under other programs, so many of the test names aren't Plowshare.</p>
<p>So like Sedan, one would think, is Plowshare Sedan, but it's actually Storax</p>
<p>Gnome, the shot in New Mexico to &quot;study the possibility of converting the heat produced by a nuclear explosion into steam for the production of electric power&quot; is part of Nougat</p></div>		</li>
