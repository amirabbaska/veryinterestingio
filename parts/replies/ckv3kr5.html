			<p>I've never had an Ocean Engineering class, but I've been down (SCUBA) on the seafloor when a large wave has passed over. There is sort of a pressure that picks you up a bit, the sea floor doesn't do much except stir around a bit, 100% spot on. Unrelated: Dolphins love to ride waves and will often school up and ride them for fun. I just remembered that thread about whether animals do things for fun. Guaranteed dolphins and seals do.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for sharing that image.  It's exactly what I was remembering from my own oceanography course years ago.  A very big wind-blown wave would presumably affect sea life near the surface insofar as the big, rolling motions in the water column.  But those creatures are just kind of...used to that ebb and flow.  I don't know that tsunami, with their much longer wavelengths, are propagated the same way, though.  It seems to me that it would be more of a shallow water phenomenon that would affect only a few feet of the water column as gravity pushes the water across open ocean.  Until it reaches the shore, of course; then everything in its path will feel it. </p>		</li>

			<p>I read somewhere that the water level at a beach can drop significantly before a tsunami, is this true?<br><br>During one tsunami people were waking out to pickup fish and shells where water had just been a few minutes before, not realizing what was coming.<br><br>Does this always happen? And should one run like hell if the water level suddenly drops?</p>		</li>
