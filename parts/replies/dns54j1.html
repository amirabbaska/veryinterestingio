			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you negotiate on price and trade-in value first. Have a good loan from somewhere else, like your bank or credit union before walking in. Then when they ask about financing, you can compare what they offer with what you have. But always negotiate the price first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But any salesman worth his salt will find out what you are trading in right away.   If you say &quot;No trade in&quot; then the price will be higher, as that gives them less wiggle room.   If you later say &quot;Oh, by the way, I want to trade in my current car&quot;, but you've already agreed on the price of the new car, you've just handed them a gift.   They don't have to negotiate the price of the trade at that point, they can just give you a take it or leave it price.   Probably much lower than you would have gotten if you had mentioned it in the beginning as they know you are on the hook already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can't get a salesman to haggle on the trade-in, though, you can still walk away, if you're willing to. I recently bought a car, and got everything I wanted on price, APR, and trade-in value. I was just willing to walk away after the negotiations were nearly done. Trade-in was the last thing to be negotiated, and I was standing up to leave because they offered me a pitiful amount for the car. The car's trade-in value was probably around $2700, and they tried to offer me $250. Seriously? Nah. I ended up getting $2500 for it. Just have to be willing to walk out at any time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They want your money, they wont back down from a sale unless you are going for that brand new Civic type R or Roush Stang. Last year i negotiated on a limited WRX 31,500 with everything out the door, left and waited for the call back. Informed them i wanted to trade in my other vehicle. Got what i wanted out of both the trade in and new car. Point is do your homework before going in. Know what people paid for the same vehicle and know what people are getting for their trade ins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Negative, you negotiate the price of the car you are willing to buy. Then the next day when they call back inform then you have decided to trade in a vehicle. They will cry and squirm and try to change numbers around, dont let them.</p></div>		</li>
