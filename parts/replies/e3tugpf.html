<p>Simply explained; alcohol slows down bloodflow in the area of the brain brain that reduces/controls aggression</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this were true then it would have to be true that EVERYONE who consumes alcohol MUST become aggressive at some stage and we know this is not the case. What happens is that you become more and more unable to be in control GENERALLY. Where that takes an individual varies considerably depending on how far into their psyche their fear centres lay and what triggers them, how much they drink, who they are with, what specifically happens and under what circumstances, what their weight is and even what they have had to eat. That’s why sometimes a person just gets giggly or just falls asleep or goes off into one because they are being challenged - especially over mating rights and control of choice. An opportunity to impress is a very bad thing for many people, especially people with high levels of testosterone, and it is what leads to all those car crashes full of kids - not an impairment of action or reaction speed but an impairment of risk evaluation and spatial perception. A, “Watch this!”, moment. What we should be struggling over is that the people who decide who gets punished in which way for what are also responsible for alcohol and education in our shiny ‘democratic’ systems. Qui bono?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why tho?</p>
<p>Alcohol affects everyone differently. I didn't say &quot;everyone who drinks alcohol always becomes angry&quot;. Reducing bloodflow to the &quot;anger center&quot; doesn't necessarily make you angry, it depends on the drinker and how they generally handle it. Reduced bloodflow means 'impaired', not 'shut down' or 'disabled while drinking'. I have not once turned violent in all my days of drinking.</p>
<p>You know how some people get gassy after eating cheese but others don't? That's kind of similar to how alcohol makes some angry and not others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>More interestingly to me is what you have to say about the psyche.  It sounds like you can learn a huge amount about someone by getting fucking wasted with them.</p></div>		</li>
