			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'business plan' of the SETI Institute is based around the idea stated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation" target="_blank">Drake Equation</a>. It provides a way to estimate the chances of finding intelligent life by multiplying the factors that lead to it. The SETI Institute is working to better constrain each of the components of the equation to have a better sense for the probability of intelligence.  </p>
<p>One of the terms of the equation is how many planets per star have life. Right now, we know of only one. If we find life on Mars, then that value doubles, and provides much more information on the probability of life elsewhere.  </p>
