			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say no color, but I realized it depends on the type of night vision. Infrared will be monochrome, but photomultipliers pick up different colors, just not very well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: oh, you meant the output is monochromatic. Nvm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is a spectrum of infrared, typically only one wavelength is used. Typically this is either 780, 808, 850, or 950 nanometers. I think that's what he meant by monochromatic. Like if you have a red light in a room, a blue object will look dark read instead of blue, loss of color when only using one wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if the display is green I'd think so. But the rods (black and white sensors) would be more important in low light than the cones (color sensors) in your eyes, so it might not be all that much of a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation makes the most sense because a lot of imaging devices and software like Photoshop break color down into grayscale channels of Red, Green and Blue which then can be manipulated individually or combined. The digital capture has more data than the human eye can normally see. By using only the Green grayscale channel which has the more detail and would reduce the memory required, and manipulating it to bring out detail in the darkest areas, and displaying it in Green rather than black and white, increases the ability to see the data captured. </p></div>		</li>
