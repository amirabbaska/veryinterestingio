			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to drink all my drinks at room temperature, water, soda, juice, beer.  I was like this for 20+ years but society and the Ice Oligarchs of America and their pro cold beverage propaganda eventually turned me and I put my sodas in the fridge, but water in good with straight from the tap, bottles are fine room temp or refrigerated.</p>
<p>When my options were always cold or had to become refrigerated after opening society eventually changed my tastes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I were talking about this last week. Apparently, in her industry (convenience store) they're very specific about stocking &quot;ambient&quot; water as well as the water in the coolers. Her company knows that there are a lot of people who like room temperature water so they make sure to have as much &quot;ambient&quot; temp water on hand as they do for the chilled water. </p>
<p>And the rest of the weekend we called any liquid that was room temperature &quot;ambient&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
