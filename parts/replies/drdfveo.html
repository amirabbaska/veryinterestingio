			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer the last part of the question about how do they sharpen really tough material: eventually they use abrasives rather than other metals. To sharpen hardened metals like drill bits, you would use a grinding wheel, which is made of glued together mineral/rock grains. The abrasive material is harder than the metal and can grind it away, the grains in the grinding wheel chip away but there are more underneath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most important point. The ultimate &quot;cutting tool&quot; may be made of tungsten carbide, but the ultimate in removing metal is actually minerals and oxides (diamond, aluminum oxide, etc.) in shard form. They're extremely hard and their brittleness works in their favor as they break into new sharp edges rather than round off and dull.</p>
<p>You could, if you had the time and will, make drill bit from sandpaper wrapped around a narrow bar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is also how a water jet can cut through just about anything. It's really just grinding using extremely hard particles suspended in water. (I'm sure you know this, just building off what you said.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, part of this is the diamond would be the final answer for OP perhaps. </p>
<p>Being the hardest material it's often used abrasively or as a coating on drill bits, edged on saws, etc. And in his scenario of one upmanship would be the hardest material to then make the next hardest sharp. lol...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They used powder metallurgy.  They put put tungsten carbide powder in a mold and press it together.  Then they heat it to a temperature just below it’s melting point. The powder bonds together at this temper and creates a solid part.  </p>
<p>The biggest downfall is that powder metallurgy creates a part that is slightly less dense than pure tungsten carbide</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tungsten carbide has a ridiculously high melting point; there are almost no materials you could make a form out of for this. </p>
<p>Instead, the powder used for sintering contains cobalt [or other high melting point metal] as a binder. Since cobalt's melting point is nearly 1400C lower than WC, it can be heated high enough to make it flow without resorting to truly exotic means.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a metal matrix composite, cobalt is the matrix in this instance and you are correct. The mix is presses and heated to just below the melting point of the cobalt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I have a 6000 grit stone for my wood working chisels. And they make a mirror finish on the metal...but I could still take the chisel and hold it vertically, Slam it with a hammer and cut right through the sharpening stone... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odd they call it a saw. It’s much more like a grinder with lapped diamonds in a wheel. You’re really abrading away the WC (tungsten carbide) than making a chip cutting it. </p>
<p>Then the next question is: how do you shape/form the diamonds in such a wheel?</p>
<p>That is where super abrasives and diamond grinding wheels come into play, allowing you to slowly grind away the diamonds in the saw wheel with much larger diamond impregnated grinding wheels. </p>
<p>It’s turtles all the way down from there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>WC (tungsten carbide)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of us who were wondering &quot;why do they abbreviate it WC?&quot;, it's because <strong>W</strong> is used as the symbol for Tungsten on the periodic table and Carbide is made of carbon, which is <strong>C</strong> on the periodic table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At where I work we have to occasionally cut tungsten carbide inserts for some components. We will use EDM since it's a zero force cutting operation and it means we don't have to keep special tooling specifically for that.</p>
