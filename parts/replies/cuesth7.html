<p>So you you are saying Tropicanna only needs 5 oranges to fill a glass. I think OP's question still stands - 5 oranges cost a lot more than the juice they produce.</p>
<p>From what I know, the economics has a lot to do with the quality of the oranges, the cost of shipping, and the timing. Oranges are seasonal so once a year you have whole heck of a lot of oranges. You take the best ones, and carefully pack them and ship them to supermarkets in refrigerated trucks where they are displayed for sale for $1 a piece.</p>
<p>Then you take the ugly ones that the supermarkets don't want. And the extra ones that are not going to be sold fresh since that is a limited market, and you grind them up, extract the juice, and put the juice in a refrigerated tank until the bottler needs it. If you are not Tropicana, you concentrate the juice so that your storage costs are even lower.  Then for the rest of the year you send tanker trucks of juice to the bottler as needed. </p>
<p>Finding a  way to deal with seasonal crops is kind of standard in the food industry - grains go into silos, vegetables are frozen or canned, berries are made into jams,... </p>
<p>BTW, Tang was invented as a way of dealing with surplus seasonal oranges.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you know there is a train called the &quot;Juice Train&quot; that runs daily from Florida to New Jersey? CSX/GE/Tropicana are famous for it in the train world.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't they also use oranges that wouldn't be suitable for retail sale and would likely go to waste otherwise?  i.e., fruit that's blemished or otherwise visually unattractive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that. Consider what would happen if the shit ton of oranges that are used for juice went to retail as separate oranges instead---nobody's going to buy all those oranges to keep the selling price of oranges as high as it is. The <del>cost</del> price of oranges would drop significantly. At least with orange juice being sold, they can make money off higher individual orange prices and charge for something that there is a large demand for that is still economical in terms of producing and getting to retail. Also, putting oranges into juice form changes a relatively fast perishing/mold growing item into something that will store well longer in a box, is easier to transport, and can be frozen. </p>
<p>Tldr; as long as so many oranges are produced, it makes sense to turn a lot of them into juice. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, many of the oranges used for juice are not varieties popular as food. Many of those popular as food oranges don't juice as well. We've been using oranges as a whole food, as a juice source, and as an ingredient for long enough that there are varietals grown for specific uses.</p></div>		</li>
