			<p>You know, even though my grandparents lived there for a few years in the early 80's, I never noticed a characteristic smell to Orlando other than 'exhaust and smog.' I suppose once you get down around Kissimmee, there's also 'overpriced theme park sunscreen and desperation,' though.<br><br>There's no smell that can compete with a paper factory, though. We lived up in Perry, FL for three years when I was a kid, and some days you could smell that damn paper factory 20 miles away. They say you get used to it so you don't smell it anymore, but I never did.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also they really dont care what the oranges look like, their condition, or how close they are to rotting.  </p>		</li>

			<p>My mom works at a medical marijuana facility and has to wash her hair 2 or 3 times to get the smell of pot out of it. Oranges sound like a blessing...and delicious </p>		</li>

			<p>Has she tried getting a big mason jar and putting it over her head? From experience, those contain the smell pretty well.</p>		</li>
