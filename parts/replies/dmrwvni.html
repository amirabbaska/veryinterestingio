			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangential question!</p>
<p>Is the lack of a supporting ecosystem the reason why nothing the size of dinosaurs has ever evolved since? (If that makes sense..)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes you think nothing the size of dinosaurs have evolved since then? Not all dinosaurs were towering behemoths.</p>
<p>But another reason is that after the Dino's went extinct, warm blooded animals started to take over. Warm blooded animals are less efficient compared to cold blooded animals in their metabolic rates since cold blooded animals don't regulate their body heat. This means that more food is needed to support a large mammal than a large lizard meaning food becomes slightly more scarce making smaller animals better fit for survival.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, I know that - but giraffes and elephants are about as large as we've got now, we don't really have anything on the scale of Diplodocus for example..</p>
<p>Good point on the blood though - I'd forgotten that!</p></div>		</li>
