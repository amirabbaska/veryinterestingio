<p>You can use heat flow to come up with simple rule of thumb: If an unused charger isn’t warm to the touch, it’s using less than a penny of electricity a day. For a small smartphone charger, if it’s not warm to the touch, it’s using less than a penny a year.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long can my car stay in storage before the battery dies if I leave a USB charger plugged into the 12V thing. </p>
<p>EDIT: The car I drive was designed at a time when the 12V outlet was used only to light your cigarette. It is entirely possible it draws current when the key isn't in ignition. Cigarette lighters have this nifty feature, they only receive power if you push them in, and pop out when the coils get red hot. So not sure the engineers thought of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically as long as your battery drains naturally.  The lead acid batteries in your car do not hold a charge indefinitely (I don't think any battery does...).  Even if you just unplugged the battery from your car, chemical reactions are still going to occur in your battery at a slow rate, discharging the energy and a minimal amount of heat.
Most car batteries will run out of charge after 6 months to a year of sitting.</p>
<p>A car charger disconnected will change that by maybe a matter of hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the interests of science I've just done a small test.  I have a 12v charger with a mini-USB output - originally supplied for a Garmin satnav. I'll assume this is fairly typical of such devices.</p>
<p>With nothing connected to the USB output, when 12v is supplied to the charger I measured a current of 4.7mA.  So 1Ah of charge will be taken from the car battery every 212 hours - or just under 9 days.</p>
<p>Leave the charger plugged-in for 3 months (approx. 90 days) and that's 10Ah taken out of the battery - and I'd say that's beginning to become significant.  Your battery probably has a capacity of about 50Ah, and on top of the natural loss of charge over time, plus any other current drawn by circuits in the car (alarm, radio, etc.) the charger has taken 20% of the battery's capacity - and you probably want to be able to start the car at the end of its time in storage!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the likelihood of death depends on which side of the charger the cat chews. </p>
<p>If the cat chews on the side of the charger closer to the wall, or they chew on something that connects directly to the wall, they will be exposed to very high voltages at alternating current. High voltages mean that a lot of current will flow. Alternating current means that the current changes directions periodically... which has the unfortunate consequence of forcing your muscles to spasm or freeze. That's why people who are electrocuted often can't move their hand away.</p>
<p>If the cat chews on the side after the converter then it depends on what voltage it's working at. Higher voltages mean higher currents. 3-12V <em>may</em> just cause a nasty shock. 12-48V are more likely to cause lasting harm. Either way, the fact that it's direct current means there's a better chance of surviving because it won't cause muscles to freeze up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way this is worded could lead to a false sense of security around DC. DC is the most dangerous of the 2 specifically because you don't spasm, you just clench. You spasm with AC because it crosses 0 repeatedly which also gives you the chance of knocking yourself free.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tx69er" target="_blank">tx69er</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh, actually all else being the same (same voltage, current capability) DC is more dangerous. It will certainly make your muscles spasm. AC crosses zero typically 100 or 120 times per second.</p>
<p>Also, 3-12v is not going to give you a shock, you would get a tingle if you put your tongue across but that's it. Go ahead and touch both terminals of a car battery, you won't feel a thing, your internal resistance is too high. You need to get into the 70-100v+ range really to do damage. Doesn't take too much current but you need enough voltage to be able to drive enough current through the resistance of a body. </p></div>		</li>
