			<div class="markdown"><p>To take a slightly different perspective, the speed of light is simply 1, a unitless number equal to unity. Our relationship, whether we consider the speed of light to be fast or slow is then scaled by the values of the physical constants such as the electron mass. The number 299,792,458 is then a human invention moreso under-appreciating just how large a distance a second is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;What, if anything, prevents the speed of light from being greater than it currently is, why does it take years for light from other stars to reach us.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because years are how long it takes our planet to orbit its star, because the distance between stars is some length scale that is many many planets wide. </p>
<p>All of the physical ways you can rearrange the question always invoke the fact that our universe has a certain form. Atoms are 'this' wide, the speed of sound in an atomic lattice is roughly 'this' fast, cesium takes roughly 'this' long to transition between various hyperfine states. Each of those 'facts' is a result of a variety of fundamental constants like c, h, G, m<em><em>e</em></em>, q<em><em>e</em></em>, and so on. </p>
<p>The only real question is why do all those fundamental constants have the relative values they do? And there's really not an answer for that yet in science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our system of measurement of time and distance are artificial constructs based on a local frame of reference (measurement of the earth and how fast it goes around the sun and how fast it spins). Ideally we should have picked more universal units. Yes the second and metre have been redefined to be based on the oscillations of a cesium atom but it's still somewhat arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>or in other words (sorry for my bad english):</p>
<p>A changing electric field creates a magnetic field and vise versa. Because light is a wave you have an oscillation electric field which moves. Because of the osciallation the rate at which the field changes oscillaties, too (e.g. the field E is propotional to sin(kx-wt) where t is time, x the position and k and w are constants ... so the changing rate is simple the derivation which is proportinal to cos(kx-wt)). The Maxwell equations say, that (if there is no electric current) the magnetic field is proportional to the changing rate of the electric field. Therefore the magnetic field also osciating (and moving). This again creates a eletric field and so on ...
This all only can work with an certain expansion speed of the wave. And this is the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely a bad way to look at it, considering the non-zero values for those quantities.<br />
An interesting side note is that this is also, as far as I understand it, the explanation for mass itself in that certain particles are subject to &quot;more&quot; friction within the Higgs field than others and, thus, are more &quot;massive&quot;.<br />
This may not be entirely accurate though as the intrinsic properties of the particles themselves are what determine whether they will be affected, and by how much, within the Higgs field.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this obscures where EM fields come from. Ultimately magnetic and electric fields arise from the presence and motion of electric charge. A changing electric field is accompanied and associated with a changing magnetic field but they don't cause each other since they occur at the same time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take the maxwell equations in vacuum and set charge density to zero everywhere (see the first set of equations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave_equation#The_origin_of_the_electromagnetic_wave_equation" target="_blank">here</a>) it's pretty immediately obvious that changing B-fields produce E-fields and changing E-fields produce B-fields, entirely independently of whether there's charge involved.  That's how EM waves (e.g. light from the sun) propagate through vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure exactly why, but the realization that all magnetism comes from the motion of electric charge really struck me as wild. Even the movement of electrons around the nucleus (which apparently isn't really movement, so that's even weirder) creates permanent magnets when they all get lined up.</p></div>		</li>
