<p>Well that one we do have an answer for, and in some cases why questions are easy to answer in math, the 'why' is in the proof of the fact. With universal constants you can imagine a (potentially unpleasant) universe where they are different, you can't imagine having a rational pi without getting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational" target="_blank">contradiction</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to expand on your point... to generalize this, universal physical constants and math are fundamentally different. The universal constants might have some underlying reason that we can't access, but they're dependent on something and they have physical reality. They're measurable.</p>
<p>Math constants, and mathematics in general, are systems of logic. They are the same everywhere, in any time, in any universe, and in fact, they exist as logical statements without a universe existing at all. It's because they are abstractions without physical reality, only true statements of logic, exactly like stating &quot;a set of one element unioned with a set of another element gives a set of two elements.&quot;  (or, 1+1=2). The definition of pi, and all pure mathematics, is exactly the same as that.</p>
<p>The mathematics that describes our universe are <em>abstract models</em> of the universe. They are not the universe. They're a reduction of the universe, just like a model of a P-51 Mustang airplane is not a P-51 Mustang, but it models the reality.</p>
<p>That's why it's somewhat silly to be amazed when mathematics predicts something about the universe, as though &quot;The universe is made of mathematics!!&quot; No, it's that we deliberately chose <em>specific</em> mathematics that modeled our observations. To use the P-51 analogy, we created the model to match the reality. It's not too amazing if the ratio of wings to length is the same as the reality, even if we didn't specifically think about that when we built the model from the overall dimensions of a real P-51.</p>
<p>tl/dr: Universal constants have physical reality and (most likely) some underlying reason, which may be changeable. Mathematics are pure abstract logic and are unchanging and unchangeable in any reality or even non-reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but the various demonstrations of quantum theory are not in any way irrational. They are completely logical, predictable and understandable phenomena. The problem is that we insist on interpreting them through the filter of analogy. We want them to be <em>like</em> something we can easily observe and understand. This is a failing with the essential symbolic logic that our linguistically-optimized brain uses. It's the same as if someone were to insist that women were like cabbages. They would never be able to understand women using those concepts. But we can override this thinking. Women are not cabbages. Light is not a particle. It is not a wave. It is a quantum phenomenon that can be clearly and accurately modeled by wave equations.</p>
<p>Just like you can't understand the following phrase 한국어 모르면, you can't understand this thoroughly if you don't know the language (advanced math and physics). But people should not confuse their own ignorance with irrationality. Humans can understand quantum phenomena, but they have to make a strong effort to learn the language and then stop trying to reduce those phenomena to inappropriate analogies.</p>
<p>And remember: Those <em>brassica</em> websites will not help you with real women, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, I'm not saying it can't be modeled and proven or that it doesn't function in consistent and repeatable ways.  It's an example to express the point.  I'm saying it's an example of where human reasoning begins to fail us.  All the double slit experiment shows us is that quantum behavior is entirely different than atomic and molecular behavior, but a very large portion of the population will never understand it.  A fair portion of the population will actively disbelieve it!</p>
<p>Think of it like this.  I briefly used the example of the impossibility of teaching a dog calculus.  The point of that is to say that there are things which are beyond some levels of intelligence.  A system of math exists which is too complicated for a dog to understand.  So, then, could there not exist a system which cannot be understood by <em>human</em> intelligence?  The math is too complicated or too alien for our minds to comprehend, or whatever.</p>
<p>So, then, is the universe obligated to behave in a way that human level intelligence is capable of understanding it?</p>
<p><em>No.</em></p>
<p>We must accept that not only are there known unknowns and unknown unknowns, but also very likely <em>unknowable</em> unknowns.  Things that we don't know and we are not even capable of knowing <em>because we are human beings</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't, &quot;Oooooo!  The universe is full of wooooo!&quot;  It's, &quot;You're human.  That comes with limitations.  That isn't changing.  Accept it and move on.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be true, that quantum theory follows <em>mathematical</em> logic. I think OP's point is that it doesn't follow <em>human</em> logic. He describes the double slit experiment as the universe giving &quot;rational thought&quot; a big middle finger, but maybe it's more like the universe saying, &quot;Listen guys, you've done a great job with these funny little brains of yours, but they weren't built for this; keep going, it's great, but don't be surprised if you just stop understanding things at some point here.&quot;</p>
<p>That's essentially your argument, right? That quantum theory doesn't mesh with the way our brains think about new complicated things via analogies to the old simpler things our brains were built to understand (via natural selection)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great discussion, however I think your fundamental pessimism on 'why' questions is a bit unwarranted. Science <em>does</em> eventually tend to find answers to questions previously thought unanswerable. They may not be completely satisfying answers, but nonetheless we have so far not run up against any absolute limits to our knowledge. </p>
<p>As a for example, early chemists and even early alchemists were aware that there were primary substances ('elements') and that those substances tended to have a weight particular to that substance. Some of them may even have suspected that the weight of elements is related somehow to other characteristics of the elements, for example their ability to form compounds with other elements. </p>
<p>Along comes electromagnetic theory and atomic theory, and a group of brilliant experiments designed to probe the fundamental atomic structure of various materials, and suddenly we have a partial answer to the question &quot;why do particular elements have a particular weight?&quot; And the answer is that different elements by definition are composed of different numbers of protons, electrons (and neutrons). Heavier elements have more subatomic particles, lighter elements have fewer. Atomic &amp; EM theory also provide an answer to the question &quot;why are certain elements able to form certain compounds with other elements&quot;? </p>
<p>This answer turns around and raises questions of its own, namely &quot;why do subatomic particles have mass in the first place?&quot; But there's no doubt that it offers a quantifiable, observable answer to an age-old, previously unanswerable question. </p>
<p>And today, with work going on at CERN, we're getting closer to perhaps answering the &quot;why&quot; question about subatomic particle masses as well. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - Science does in fact find itself able to answer &quot;unanswerable&quot; questions from time to time.</strong></p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course we have.</p>
<p>What happened before the big bang?</p>
<p>Our best scientific understanding is that there was no &quot;before&quot; the big bang. Nothing after the big bang is causally linked to anything before it, ergo the time we exist in started at the big bang and &quot;before&quot; doesn't make sense. Except that's begging the question.</p>
<p>Anything we're causally connected to should be within the limits of our knowledge. Things we're not causally connected to or in the future become causally disconnected from will then be beyond our limits of knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To take a slightly different perspective, the speed of light is simply 1, a unitless number equal to unity. Our relationship, whether we consider the speed of light to be fast or slow is then scaled by the values of the physical constants such as the electron mass.

			<div class="markdown"><p>because years are how long it takes our planet to orbit its star, because the distance between stars is some length scale that is many many planets wide. </p>
<p>All of the physical ways you can rearrange the question always invoke the fact that our universe has a certain form. Atoms are 'this' wide, the speed of sound in an atomic lattice is roughly 'this' fast, cesium takes roughly 'this' long to transition between various hyperfine states. Each of those 'facts' is a result of a variety of fundamental constants like c, h, G, m<em><em>e</em></em>, q<em><em>e</em></em>, and so on. </p>
<p>The only real question is why do all those fundamental constants have the relative values they do? And there's really not an answer for that yet in science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>or in other words (sorry for my bad english):</p>
<p>A changing electric field creates a magnetic field and vise versa. Because light is a wave you have an oscillation electric field which moves. Because of the osciallation the rate at which the field changes oscillaties, too (e.g. the field E is propotional to sin(kx-wt) where t is time, x the position and k and w are constants ... so the changing rate is simple the derivation which is proportinal to cos(kx-wt)). The Maxwell equations say, that (if there is no electric current) the magnetic field is proportional to the changing rate of the electric field. Therefore the magnetic field also osciating (and moving). This again creates a eletric field and so on ...
This all only can work with an certain expansion speed of the wave. And this is the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely a bad way to look at it, considering the non-zero values for those quantities.<br />
An interesting side note is that this is also, as far as I understand it, the explanation for mass itself in that certain particles are subject to &quot;more&quot; friction within the Higgs field than others and, thus, are more &quot;massive&quot;.<br />
This may not be entirely accurate though as the intrinsic properties of the particles themselves are what determine whether they will be affected, and by how much, within the Higgs field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this obscures where EM fields come from. Ultimately magnetic and electric fields arise from the presence and motion of electric charge. A changing electric field is accompanied and associated with a changing magnetic field but they don't cause each other since they occur at the same time</p></div>		</li>
