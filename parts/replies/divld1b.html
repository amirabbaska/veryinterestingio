			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I feel a bit silly now, I'm not sure why I was so far off with oxygen, I suppose my question regarding anti-H^(2)O fed into it.</p>
<p>I suppose the energy required to create an anti-counterpart goes up quite a bit with additional atomic mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this isn't something I'm an expert on, it would be my understanding that the heavier the atom, the more energy required. As far as synthesizing antimolecules, I'm not sure of the complexity compared to synthesizing anti-elements, though I suspect it would be more difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-particles are particles with conjugate charge.
For example there are electrons which behave like regular electrons but have positive charge instead of negative. </p>
<p>A particle will annihilate with it's anti particle, releasing the energy of both particles (mostly as light).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. That's a question that's yet to be adequately answered. Most physicists subscribe to the idea that crazy amounts of CP violation in the early universe caused the imbalance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though what I was really getting at was the symmetry inherent to the electromagnetic interaction. Two electrons and two positrons behave exactly the same with respect to the U(1) interaction, so one would expect chemical bonding to work practically the same for matter and antimatter.</p></div>		</li>
