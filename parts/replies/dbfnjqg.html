			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of true but ignores the fact that you can have some of a vitamin while not having enough for all the functions in your body that need it. It also ignores the fact that there are functions of the body that are not an immediate requirement to life and not having the 'key' to those functions could just mean you don't feel well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but most people with a western diet are getting a sufficient amount of most vitamins.  </p>
<p>And don't forget that, while research into getting <em>too much</em> of vitamins and minerals is relatively new, it does indicate that it can be bad for your health.  Too much Vitamin A increases the risk of lung cancer in at risk populations (smokers, for example), lots of vitamins increase the risk of prostate cancer (vitamin E, B-16, folic acid), etc.  </p>
<p>The best answer isn't taking a multivitamin.  It's getting adequate nutrition from food sources.  </p>
<p>The second best answer isn't taking a multivitamin.  It's taking a targeted supplement that contains only what you need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some evidence to suggest that too many anti-oxidants (a category which includes a bunch of vitamins, and is one of the health food 'magic bullet' words) can actually increase your risk of quite a few cancers, and damage your immune system. </p>
<p>The current best understanding of this is that those 'harmful' free radicals we're trying so desperately to get rid of actually help the body kill certain types of hostile microbe, as well as playing a part in the process which stops cell growth, as certain tumour-suppressing genes are activated when DNA is damaged by free radicals.</p>

<p>That's probably part of why so much of the multivitamin will end up in your urine. I'd say that if your body wanted this stuff, it would keep it, rather than excreting it, so trying to trick it into absorbing more is either futile or dangerous. </p>
<p>Of course, I'm not a doctor, but I would be very skeptical about the current trend in multivitamins which contain more than the recommended daily amount of vitamins or minerals. I've seen supplements with 5000% RDA of some things, which just seems bonkers to me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what do you do if you are pregnant and the doctor and society tell you that you have to take supplements? I eat a well rounded diet but I keep being told that I have to take folic acid and calcium. I can't win if taking an excess is bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically wealthy, educated people eating western diets get their complete dietary needs met by food. Unfortunately most people can't afford well-balanced meals three times a day that include vegetables and or  fruit . In addition there are many cultures where vegetables play little to no role in the diet that consists heavenly of dark meat and carbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand your auto analogy... what if the vitamin is metaphorically the transmission fluid and you have a leak... and if you top off the transmission fluid you'll be able to drive for for most of the day but towards the end of the day it will stop working.</p>
<p>Now if you put enough transmission fluid to get you through each 1 hour trip throughout the day, it will always have enough fluid to keep going.</p>
<p>This analogy better represents the OP's question, is this a reasonable assumption for the OP?</p></div>		</li>
