			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points all.  One other thing to note is that steuctures built out of reinforced polymers need to be very carefully designed.  They are really strong in tension and weak as hell in compression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do, but the plastic will still shatter at a much lower compression strength than tensile. If you layer the fibers on both sides of the plastic surface, though, you'll have good flexing strength in all directions, which is quite nice and usually critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important distinction to make is where the load is applied.  For instance, a woven composite thermoset will be great in a distributed through the thickness compression, or a tension along the fibers.  But it will be poor in a tension through the thickness or a compression along the fibers.  This is due to the fact that in the last 2 load cases, you're relying on the lamination between the plies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tensile and compressive stiffness are based on the same material property.  With compression though you have the issue of buckling which is a geometric instability.  If you could keep a carbon fiber perfectly straight while loading it would be just as strong in compression as it is in tension.  A more surprising example of this is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtUZcIDrwoo" target="_blank">paper is actually really strong</a> if you create your built up structure properly to avoid buckling.  There's no composite involved here, just paper.  The friction between layers prevents them from sliding apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. Glass will still break and fatigue under repeated tension though.  Kevlar is less stiff but harder to actually break the strand, it's also lighter than the glass strand. Carbon is stiffer, even spring like, but very brittle when pushed past it's limit, it never really fatigues until it breaks, it's lighter than Kevlar as well. When compressed as a spring (think of a fishing rod casting) it remains constant over years, until it fails.  This is a good comparison of the fibers at work in a resin layup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can also be an advantage, at least when it comes to carbon fiber.  And &quot;weak as hell&quot; can still be very strong indeed.  </p>
<p>In F1 for example, they'll take advantage of the stiffness of the CF to keep it rigid in one direction, but flexible in another.  For example, there's often controversy over &quot;wing flexing&quot; seemingly every season.  The wings are supposed to be, and tested to ensure, that they are rigid and do not flex beyond a certain allowable certain amount.  But by laying the CF down in just the right way, they could pass the tests, but still have the wing flex and flatten when the car started going faster and faster (this reduces drag on the straights, since the angle of attack of the wing is reduced as it flattened out). </p>
<p>I know that's a very specific example, and I'm struggling to think of a more practical one, but it illustrates the point well enough that CF's properties can be used to good effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's only fibreglass which is fibres bonded with plastic? Kevlar is itself a very strong fibre which, when woven into a fabric, can resist impacts. Carbon fibre is often bonded to plastic, but in some applications, for example, carbon arrows used in target shooting, the carbon fibre may be bonded with metal or with a different kind of fibre.</p>
<p>Kevlar's strength comes from its molecular structure: when you make a fibre out of Kevlar, each fibre is made up of many polymer strands; long molecules which form a chain. In Kevlar, these chains line up next to one another and form additional inter-molecular bonds, which make it very difficult to pull one polymer chain apart from its neighbour, in turn making the fibre very strong. These strands alone are more difficult to pull apart than the same weight of steel, without being bonded to anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The factor which most makes kevlar bulletproof is, as you mentioned, the inability for the molecular chains to slip past each other. This makes kevlar have 0 stretch and a very high breaking point, so it can take a lot of force before it breaks and in the mean time, it won't stretch. Bulletproof vests are also made of many layers of kevlar, since the impact of the bullet is strong enough to break the fibers; but by having multiple layers, the bullet looses a tremendous amount of energy breaking through each layer until it's eventually stopped a few layers down. </p>
<p>Can you imagine a bulletproof vest made of super strong elastic? Even if the bullet never pierced the elastic, the elastic would stretch into the body and still kill you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why kevlar vests are not reusable and are essentially completely compromised after the first hit. The strength of the fibers is so high that an impact strong enough to break them at any point on the armor is most likely going to damage all of the interwoven fibers in the layer(s). At that point you are hoping that either the bullet spread is large enough that additional hits to the vest are as far away from the initial impact as possible (therefore hopefully hitting an area that didn't experience catastrophic damage) or there are sufficient additional intact layers under the compromised ones to absorb another impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to it's use in flexible fabrics, Kevlar is also used like carbon or glass fibre to manufacture rigid composites by bonding with plastic materials.</p>
<p>Carbon fibre is almost always embedded in plastic because naked carbon fibre is brittle and would wear very quickly. In the case of the arrow you described, the carbon fibre would be bonded to the metal with plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also textile reinforced concrete which uses the same corrosion resistant fibres only woven into a textile, allowing really slim composites to be produced. It enables the construction of very thin concrete elements (~1cm) which IMO is really cool. But it is not widely used yet. </p></div>		</li>
