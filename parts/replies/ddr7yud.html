			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiative heat transfer is largely irrelevant without open flames. The temperature difference goes to the 4th power.</p>
<p>Out of the three heat transfer mechanisms convection, <del>direct transfer</del> conduction and radiation, convection is the one our ovens use. It is just that air, especially air circulating only by natural convection, is a very poor heat transfer medium.  Forced convection ovens like in fan-assisted ovens have an improved heat exchange thanks to higher velocities and Reynolds numbers. </p>
<p>Heat exchange with a non-condensing gas is highly inefficient at common operating conditions though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top answer. Most of what we cook in an oven is fairly similar when you think about it. If we wanted to &quot;cook&quot; rocks (i.e. change their molecular structure similarly to how we change the molecular structure of dough when we bake it into bread), we would cook it at a far higher temperature. Food - be it pizza, lamb leg, or a potatoes - is still food at the end of the day.  </p>
<p>Also, a lot of food is baked at the same temperature, but for drastically different times. You can bake perfectly delicious chicken at 425 F and you can make awesome sliced zucchini in a 425 F oven, but one will stay in much longer than the other.  </p>
<p>These common temperatures are just convenient for us. In specialized settings (e.g. a restaurant that serves a lot of pizza), you'll see people baking things as low as 170 F and as high as 700 F. But for the home cook, it really doesn't make much sense to cook anything at 700 F - you'd need cookware that can handle super-high heat, probably a new oven, and you'd need to re-calibrate your entire intuition about cooking times.  </p>
<p>(source: was a restaurant cook for 14 years. Lost a lot of arm hair to a 700 degree pizza oven).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this makes sense. And really, there is quite a bit of variation in cooking temperature of various foods, all things considered.</p></div>		</li>
