<p>Not like sea levels just drop or rise over night ??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 3 foot drop in 39 years would be bad, it takes time to redredge channels, and then rebuild port.</p>
<p>It would just take a small drop before freighters would no longer be able to clear channel depth.</p>
<p>I know a marina that due  to dropping sea levels is now dry land.  The owner spent a lot of time, and money trying to redredge to keep channel to bay clear, ultimately he ran out of money.</p>
<p>My beachfront house would no longer be beachfront. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but wouldn't that traffic naturally move to an area more suited for it that maybe wasn't well suited previously?</p>
<p>When a new major highway is constructed the economy of the old supporting highway dies off and slowly gets replaced with new markets popping up along the new highway.  The people there don't starve and die though, it's not apocalyptic - they just slowly move away.  Why would this really be much different?  Why wouldn't new ports just open up elsewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure what you're asking... but shorelines constructs are engineered with high/low tide in mind.  </p>
<p>Over the course of a century, the sea level really shouldn't change in any noticeable way.  It is though because of global warming. </p>
<p>So depending on the scale to which sea levels might rise, some structures will certainly collapse unless they're reconstructed.  But if sea-levels rise 10 feet over the course of 100 years, there will already be other, more pressing concerns at hand.</p></div>		</li>
