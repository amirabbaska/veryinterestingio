			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is the required ingredient. Also called toffee, depending on your country. The butter thing is a specific type of caramel.</p>
<p>Point is, when heated above 100°C (i.e after the water boils away), you first get lemon concentrate, then caramel/toffee not &quot;sugar gas&quot;,  and to continue, the sugar will have broken down into water (which boils off) and carbon (which boils at 4827°C).</p></div>		</li>
