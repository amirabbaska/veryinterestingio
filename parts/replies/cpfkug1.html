			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey. Honestly thank you for that.   It was fucked up but I really am grateful for it.   It still is part of me and has made me who I am now.   I think my life perspective is so much better and I just have a lot of love in my heart for anyone struggling with events that change who they are.
Especially Veterans, Overseas active duty, Law Enforcement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes you wonder why something happened.  The answer seems to be it gives you perspective to understand what some people go through in life.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. Thanks.   I kind of put below in some other comments.   But mostly emotional.    Just hard to get back into normal life.  Not a lot seems as important after almost dying (for me anyway)..    But it is much easier to connect with people and see the good in them.   Because now I understand that a lot of people go through all kinds of stuff, and just need someone to acknowledge it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey.  Yeah.
It's hard to explain in a paragraph.   But for me -  the out of body part made me think differently about God/spirit/space/purpose for living and all that heavy shit.   So that's a big one.   I was literally floating above the scene in my hospital gown, watching all of it.<br />
After all of it, through therapy I figured out i had PTSD.  Just from the events.   Mostly nightmares of the event and feeling like I was dying all over again, hundreds of times. Avoiding anything having to do with newborn babies (I still don't like holding babies).  Being in a quiet space alone and still feeling the commotion of that time/panic.  Depression.   Serious depression.  Which actually i am just getting fully better now (5 years later)
Things that matter to you before a traumatic event - will not likely be things that matter after.   Work.  Schedules.  Some relationships.  Material things.  Fitting back into what people expect of you.  Not a whole lot bothers me anymore.    I can have anger now that I can't control.  Sometimes I snap and I scare myself.   Impulse control.  Etc etc...  none of which I struggled with prior. </p>
<p>And let me say - this isn't just coma victims.   People go through shit all the time &amp; have traumatic experiences that can alter their life.   This was just What it was for me.</p></div>		</li>
