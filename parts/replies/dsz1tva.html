<p>Sound will also curve away or towards the ground due to a temperature gradient since the speed of sound is dependent air density. This can cause sound shadows where the receiver cannot hear a sound despite being &quot;close&quot; to the source.</p>

<p>Also happens in water.  Sound will curve up toward less dense water, and will curve down down toward colder water; this is called a &quot;divergent zone&quot;.  A skilled sub crew can sneak up close to an enemy sub by staying in the gap between the two curves.</p>
<p>If you're above a thermocline, sound will curve down, reflect off the interface, go back up, then arc back down, reflect, etc.  It <em>sounds</em> like the source is nearby, but it can be several divergent zones away.  Takes a skilled sonar operator to figure out the true range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not quite sure how to answer that question in the context of the original question. </p>
<p>Regarding the general question the answer is yes, through psychoacoustics it is incredibly common to have a sound appear to come from somewhere it isn't. Just listen to any well mixed stereo piece of music and notice how different instruments appear in specific places (we call this &quot;imaging&quot;).</p>
<p>In terms of temperature effects, I'm not sure how the perceived direction and distance of sound is perceived with a gradient, but the volume effects are well known. Say you have an acoustic barrier outside between your house and a highway, its efficacy is going to get worse if the sound can bend back down over the barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Effectively yes.</p>
<p>A few years ago at the Glastonbury festival, there was a weird temperature gradient that meant that the sound bent up (away from the audience), then curved back down into the valley off-site, thus causing sound complaints despite the PA being nearly off from he point-of-view of the audience.</p>
<p>I can't find the papers that were written at the time, but <a href="https://www.funktion-one.com/dl/files/365.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> mentions it to a certain extent.</p></div>		</li>
