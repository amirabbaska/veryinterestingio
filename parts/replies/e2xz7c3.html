			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be the thermite reaction because in order for Aluminium and Iron Oxide to react, you need to have them directly contact (or ion exchange, sometimes). Aluminium forms an oxide layer extremely quickly, and its not something you can scrub off before it reforms. Also if it was the thermite reaction, then there would be elemential Iron getting plated to the surface that you are scrubbing.</p>
<p>Edit: A bit of research says that the Aluminum Oxide reacts with the vinegar to form acetate salts, which react with the Iron Oxide. Not sure if the reaction is just a double replacement (meaning Iron Acetate is formed, pulling it into solution) or if its something a bit more complex</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right the extremely exothermic component of the thermite reaction is the bonding of the oxide ions to the aluminum ions, I only meant the same redox reaction </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am almost certain this is actually what's happening. The purpose of the vinegar is to solublize the oxide layer, and the elemental iron, chromium, etc is what replaces the stain. Aluminum electroplating would just not be energetically favorable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the iron/chromium/carbon are what replaces the stain when the aluminum reduces the iron ions in the stain. I looked up the standard reduction potentials and this reaction is energetically spontaneous whereas plating aluminun would not be </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this would probably work, it depends on how deeply rusted the vehicle is. This method might work for lightly rusted spots but if a whole section is rusted through there is absolutely no way this method works. </p></div>		</li>
