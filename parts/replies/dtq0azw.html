			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything about <em>The Post</em>'s depiction of producing a newspaper brought my theater party of journos to tears. This explanation almost started the waterworks again ... I just realized that halftone is among those things (like pica rules) whose value will now be a mystery to new generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Halftoning is still used today. Have a close look at the print on a t-shirt or a modern newspaper or book and you'll see the dots, even in color images.</p>
<p>It's still the best and cheapest way to mass-print an image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is sad that those things are fading away from culture at large but letterpress is still going to be a craft. It was very much a part of art and design classes I took in college. Now, my boyfriend and I are getting a certificate in cylinder letterpress at a center that also provides classes and certificates in bookbinding and paper making. They have a really active and sizable community and all of the classes are taught by people who do these things professionally for commercial gigs, not just art. It gives me hope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever see a Heidelberg windmill press?  The design is over a hundred years old, and people still use them.  I was a press mechanic for many years, you had to put yourself into the shoes of the techs of that time to figure out how to work on them.  Not intuitive at times.  One of the crazier things I ever saw--back in the early '80s, one night on the news, the story was covering the war in Lebanon at the time.  The video showed a cement block building that had taken a direct hit from artillery.  Looking through the destroyed wall was a row of windmill presses, running to beat the band, cranking out pics of the mullah flavor of the day nonstop.  Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'.  Most people won't even recognize that reference nowadays.</p></div>		</li>
