			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman's example!</p>
<p>Your shirt is a fabric, but zoom in and there are many tiny broken pieces of thread sticking out.  Each of these catch and refract light, making the fabric appear a bit lighter.  This is also part of why clothes 'lose color' in the wash as more threads break, and wear begins to become more noticeable.  When you apply water, these non-uniform fibers get pressed down or are completely glossed over by said water (like OP said), which means the fibers are no longer able to refract and diffuse light to the degree they were doing so beforehand, making them appear darker.  It hasn't actually changed colors, it's simply unable to reflect as much light overall through the water as it could without the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, yes!  In other cases, it simply points all the light in one direction.  In yet other cases, my expertise which is really only an enthusiast's interest, completely fails me. :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the material, but yea. A smoother surface would likely have much less impact on the resulting 'darker' color perceived if it became wet. Most things we see 'change color' when wet are very fibrous. (Take this with a grain of salt; it's been a few years since my last photonics course.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It decreases the optical contrast at the interface, so the light is not refracted so much. In consequence, the light tends to carry straight on instead of bouncing back and reaching the eye.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, technically it has, it's just that color is not an intrinsic, immutable property of matter the way we usually like to think of it. It's an emergent property that arises from the interaction of light with a surface, as interpreted by our eyes and brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the inherit physical properties that give it its color hasn't changed, it's not more or less red, it's simply going through a slightly darker filter.  Otherwise shades actually do just change the color of the entire world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water doesnâ€™t change the frequency of the light, just the amplitude and direction. Since frequency is what our brain interprets as color, no the color has not changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad OP asked this question cause it wasn't more then a week ago that I was wondering the same thing, thanks for this explanation. Now I got a followup question, almost everything to my knowledge appears darker when wet, now how come that doesn't apply to skin/flesh? </p>
<p>I was washing my hand the other day in the sink and the water would splash on my hand up to a certain point, now unlike most things, my skin didn't appear darker where it got wet and lighter where it didn't get wet. I stood there for a good minute or two just looking at my hand seeing if I could see a difference and honestly if there was a difference, it was very very minor if at all, so are you able to explain this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does! :D  It's just wet most of the time already!  Your body is constantly secreting oils and water; don't forget, you're full of the stuff!</p>
<p>Ever have your hands or elbow get super dry?  They get really chalky and scratchy?  That's your skin breaking and flaking and these tears in the outermost layers of skin are doing the exact same thing as that frayed clothing.  And sure enough, if you apply moisture to these dried out patches of skin, it 'darkens' back to its original color!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light is reflecting off of all the different surfaces of all your dry shirt fibers. These all get smoothed over when the water contacts it and gets sucked in, which is its natural tendency when encountering fibers. A sheet of plastic is pretty smooth to begin with so the surface of water isn't that different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light is an electromagnetic wave, and so the physical and electrical properties of conductors come into play. </p>
<p>For the physical, when the light off an object looks &quot;soft&quot;, it is due to the object being irregular in some way (either having a rough texture, or its crystalline structure being irregular). Because of this irregularity, the light on the objects gets reflected in many directions: we call this a diffuse reflection. Metals, however, have a very regular crystalline structure. Light incident on them is generally bounced in one direction: a specular reflection.</p>
<p>Now this might be sufficient if you wanted to know why your mirror isn't blurry, but it doesn't absorb much energy and dim your image. For this we can consider the electrical properties of a conductor. In a conductor, electrons are much more free to flow. When a light wave is incident on a conductor, the electrons follow and are easily moved around by the electric field in the light wave. This movement itself generates an electric field in the metal, which pushes the electrons back. All this pushing and pulling <strong>generates another light wave</strong>, going away from the metal. Since the electrons in conductors are so free to move, the resulting light that is emitted has lost nearly no energy.</p></div>		</li>
