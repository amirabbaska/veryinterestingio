<p>According to quantum gravity, between two points closer to each other than the planck length, the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum effects, which would make it impossible to determine their distance. That means the planck length is believed to be the shortest theoretically measurable length. It has no other physical significance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These people don't really know what the point of the planck units are.</p>
<p>Planck units are a system of units that scale so that all the following constants are equal to 1:</p>
<p>the speed of light in a vacuum, c,
the gravitational constant, G,
the reduced Planck constant, ħ,
the Coulomb constant, 1/4(pi)ε_0
the Boltzmann constant, k_B</p>
<p>The units themselves don't mean anything significant currently and are just used so that each of these can be nicely organised mathematically. In plank units, one planck time for example is equal to 1 plank length over the speed of light, where one plank length is equal to the root of ħG/c. </p>
<p>This can be useful in many situations. For example, the gravitational force between two objects is the product of their masses, times G, over the distance: F = G M m /r^2. The gravitational force between two plank masses at one plank length is thus one plank force, 1x1x1/1^2 = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. So Planck length has nothing to do with Newtonian concept of displacement.</p>
<p>Is there any smallest known length where Newtonian concept of displacement starts making sense? What about quantum travel? Is there a displacement quanta?</p>
<p>This thread is kinda awkward. It is too serious (not a single you know what joke) but only one thought provoking answer: yours.</p></div>		</li>
