			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the note about capacitors, read about the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague" target="_blank">Capacitor Plague</a> that were still feeling the effects of. From 1999-2007, millions upon millions of capacitors were produced using poor quality raw materials from a handful of Taiwanese factories. They had far shorter than average lifespans, in the range of 2 or 3 years. Because of this, by the time anyone knew what was going on, they were already out in the market. Dell was especially hit hard by this as it earned them a terrible reputation for reliability. </p>
<p>That's why you often saw products advertising &quot;100% Japanese made caps&quot; as a selling point. You still this today on some products like motherboards. </p>
<p>Edit: On a personal note, I had a freezer and a home theater receiver impacted by this. The freezer was an easy solder job with one cap needing to be replaced. The receiver had about 10 of the super tiny caps. I shipped that one off to a guy whose whole job was repairing these and similar electronics on eBay for like $50.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fucking capacitor plague... I've had to replace caps for myself and family members on Samsung Monitors, Linksys Powerline adapters, Sony TVs and multiple motherboards and computer power supplies.</p>
<p>Absolutely ridiculous when all this expensive technological shit is crapping out after only 12-18 months of use but thankfully I haven't had anything affected for about 5 years now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I burned through 3 capacitors in our 2007 large (200l) air compressor, replaced It last time in around 2010 and its been worked harder than ever and not blown since then. Makes sense now that there was a capacitor plague.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things to add: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague" target="_blank">Capacitor Plague</a>, it's relevant to your question and quite interesting</p>
</li>
<li>If you want to extend the life of your computer, replace the fans!  They are likely to be the first thing that fails (because they have moving parts, which get gummed up with dust and cause the tiny little cheap motor to get overtaxed and burn out), which will make everything else get dusty and overheated and much more likely to fail for one of the reasons described in the above answer.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when this first started kicking off in 99 I bought 2 MSI motherboards in a row that was victim to this.  At the time I had no idea what was causing it.  It was such a pain in the ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to repair Canon photocopiers, and we had a machine catch on fire, likely due to the capacitor plague, or just faulty caps.<br />
After that happened, we had to go to every machine and cut these particular caps off and add an auxiliary board to replace them.  I remember at least one where the caps were already starting to leak</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overheating components are another issue. If cooling is insufficient, or if some other issue (software or hardware) leads to more power in some component than planned, components can get too hot and die. Overheated resistors can change their resistance, overheated transistors can stop conducting or will always conduct (or conduct along a path they shouldn't do).</p>
<p>Radiation can be an issue, but this rarely affects consumer electronics as the radiation levels are low. There is always natural background radiation, leading to fast charged particles that can travel through a transistor, and ionize atoms there. Suddenly you get charges where you don't want them. In the worst case, this can destroy a transistor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such an interesting effect. Transistors, when too hot, will actually have electrons taken from their atoms and used in conduction. This leads to way too much electrons being used, over current, and a breakdown of the doping that makes the silicon a semiconductor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that capacitors' lifespans are based on their operating temperatures. The higher the internal temperatures, the faster the electrolytics will dry out and render the device useless. </p></div>		</li>
