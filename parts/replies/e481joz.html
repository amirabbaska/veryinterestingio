			<div class="markdown"><p>It's helpful to remember how deep the Earth's mantle is. <a href="http://www.iupui.edu/~g115/assets/mod04/earth_structure1_big.jpg" target="_blank">The solid crust is a relatively thin layer floating atop a really deep (and hot) sea of liquid rock.</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OXREZOoNt7M?t=336" target="_blank">Currents are turbulent down there</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/UwWWuttntio?t=20" target="_blank">the plates don't follow any obvious path.</a> </p>
<p>People often think of continental drift as landmasses ramming into one another under their own momentum, but it's (metaphorically) much more similar to the wrinkling and tearing of the &quot;skin&quot; that forms atop a pudding as it congeals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just correcting a common misconception - the mantle is not liquid. It’s made of solid rock that, over long time scales (eg. millions of years), flows by viscous creep like any other solid does at a high enough temperature. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is tangential, but watching that video made me wonder - is there a reference frame for the Earth whose definition doesn't involve the location of the continents/crust? Like a geographic coordinate system that is defined in some other measurable feature of the Earth that is not dynamic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc the term is plastic or plasticity or something. It’s not solid all the way but not liquid either, just really high viscosity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the timeline is long and the movement inperceviable, the power involved is unfathomable.</p>
<p>We like to think of mountains as unmovable due to their mass, but tectonic shift does more move (and form) mountains. It moves the Trillions of tons that are entire continents and more since it extends beyond just visible land.</p>
<p>Mankind couldn’t achieve this with all the power we’ve ever harnessed including nuclear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let’s say each nuke moves a square mile or whatever of earth. That’s one thousands square miles which is still F all of a continent. </p>
<p>Let’s say you used a million nukes. Then you’ve got 1 million square miles. You’ve still far short of the 3.8 million square miles of the U.S and you’ve just tenderised the soil to one mile depth which doesn’t set it off in any direction. </p></div>		</li>
