			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I suffer from (non-diabetic and fairly mild) hypoglycemia. If I ever feel nauseous, I know I need to eat something like fruit and wait it out. I always carry around one or two pouches of applesauce (the kind that don't have to be refrigerated) in my purse just in case. </p>
<p>But you're right, the way our bodies react to glucagon is so weird. When we feel nauseous, the absolute last thing we want to do is eat, yet that's exactly what our body needs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have reactive hypoglycemia and when I get nauseated due to low blood sugar, medical cannabis is a God send. Especially mornings because it's been at least 8 hours since eating so I get really hungry but really nauseous at the same time, and if I don't eat, I will be worthless the whole day like I'm in a half coma and severely fatigued and shaking. It's not just people on chemo and with seizures who rely on cannabis in order to stabilize their health. Legalizing let's people know what's in the product and let's them choose the method of ingestion that works best for their body. Without it I would be screwed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be pretty shitty to deal with. Fortunately mine isn't that bad. If I don't eat breakfast/eat a late breakfast I'll definitely feel nauseous, but I usually grab a piece of fruit first thing in the morning to prevent that from happening. </p>
<p>You should definitely use whatever resources you can to manage your glucose levels. Hypoglycemia is no joke, and I'm glad you found something that helps with that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the idea here not exactly be eating is what the body needs, but more the body noted it hasn't eaten in a while, and assumes it might eat for a while longer. Therefor acting in a way that lets it get by?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but it really doesn't make sense. Before my doctor figured out I was hypoglycemic, I'd sometimes be so nauseous I'd dry heave, my skin would become pale and cold and clammy, I'd have difficulty concentrating, standing would make me dizzy, it felt like the flu. And the absolute last thing I'd want to do is put anything at all in my stomach. Not only that, but it made it impossible for me to function. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it the glucagon directly that causes nausea or is it just the process of switching from glucose to glucagon? Because the nausea seems to be temporary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no switching from glucose to glucagon, I'm assuming you mean conversion from glycogen to glucose within the liver. This is a pretty common occurrence in the liver and doesn't cause nausea. The nausea is indeed caused by the presence of glucagon on the blood. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, that's exactly what I meant. Why the nausea is temporary tho? Most people just wait it out, until their appetite is somewhat back</p></div>		</li>
