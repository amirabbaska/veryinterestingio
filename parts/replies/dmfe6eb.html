<p>When scuba diving you rise 60ft/min which for a rule of thumb is about as quickly as your air bubbles rise. Although in today's diving you almost always measure this with a dive computer which is a much better practice as it is more accurate. You do not have to rise at a slope, when I do deep water dives I usually go straight down and straight back up. </p>
<p>There is a safety stop at about 15ft/5m you perform that further reduces risk from the bends. If you stop more often you are doing technical diving which requires stops at increments to let nitrogen out of the blood. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rule is a maximum 60' a minute, or 1 foot a second, with a 3 minute safety stop at 15 feet, but most dive computers have algorithms built in to cap it at 30' a minute. If you are predisposed to DCS (decompression sickness) with factors like age, being overweight, dehydration, hung over, etc., slower is always better. </p>
<p>If you have exceeded recreational dive limits (depth of 130' or excessive bottom time for your given depth) you have to follow a decompression schedule on the way up that will be different and based on the particulars of your dive profile. Source: am an instructor</p></div>		</li>

<p>So take your average 2 liter bottle of soda and shake it up. We know that the sealed bottle has c02 in it, but we don't see any bubbles in the bottle. This is because as pressure goes up the gases become soluble and are actually dissolved in the liquid.  Now if we open the bottle, the pressure will decrease and the gas will come out of solution into bubbles. If you open the cap very quickly, all the gas will come out of solution very quickly and uncontrollably. However, if you allow the bottle to sit or open the cap very slowly, the pressure will decrease very slowly, allowing the gas to come out of solution in a controlled natural manner.</p>
<p>This is why you don't want to rise to quickly after diving for a while. If those bubbles form rapidly, they are more likely to form in a place you don't want them and that can be very dangerous. </p></div>		</li>
