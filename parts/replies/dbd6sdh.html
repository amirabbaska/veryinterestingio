			<div class="markdown"><p>What is hacking and how is Shannon information theory relevant to it? All I know is that it can be applied to making safer systems. I'm asking you since I presume you know a lot about this. So to hack into another computer you can do it with a Trojan, but that's the only type I'm familiar with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not in the field anymore (and was just barely back &quot;in the day&quot;) but I'll try to respond to you.</p>
<p>If we define &quot;hacking&quot; simply as &quot;exploiting a system to perform in a new desired way&quot; we can include Trojan attacks (malware and the like), but there are also the classic DDOS (Denial of Service) where you bombard a system so much it basically locks up, as well as redirects (looking in the wrong place), you can include any form of phishing as hacking, and you can also include hardware hacks as well as software, a classic being the pay phone hack, or a delay/repeater device which can interrupt an on/off signal to allow undesired actions to happen in the interim.</p>
<p>When it comes to security (and my experience) the weakest point is usually the user (phishing/trojan), followed up by the network (ddos, wifi interceptor, RF reader, thumbnail/CD auto exe). Guessing a password is usually hard (or should be), same with decrypting access. There are always &quot;backdoors&quot; and &quot;shortcuts&quot; in the code from the development stage. I'm sure it is possible to eventually remove all of those but a lot of them are access points for other software to engage to.</p>
<p>There is a lot to it and it is outside my bailiwick now mostly (thank god) and I'm not the most current resource, but I still try to pay somewhat attention to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So tell me more about what a backdoor or open spot in code is like, I'm learning python right now and want to learn c++. I'm eventually making a software that analyzes digital signals and I just want to know more about coding. I'm learning the hardware workings of a computer and now the software and I want to be able to have an idea of where they mesh. For example, with internet based programs like Microsoft 365 they must be vulnerable to some sort of re-routing exploitation where someone could use the internet as another wire/relay in organizing a cyber attack and the frequency of the signal could function as an encryption, or as a blind is this right?</p></div>		</li>
