			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that it is possible for everyone who takes the class to get an A. Many classes arent weighted by students. On one hand that avoids the problem of a good student being given a B because his peers happened to be smart that semester. On the other hand when everyone gets a 4.0 gpa then it means nothing. The reason 4.0 means anything is because not everyone has it, so it means you have out competed your peers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>are your tests really that easy? Our exams usually require 45-50% to pass with a D and even that isn't easy. Most exams have a failure rate of 40-60% so a 4.0 GPA is really hard to achieve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depends on what you mean easy.   if your tests let you pass by only answering half the questions correctly, then I think that's a really poor indicator of your understanding of the material.    everything that was taught in class should be grasped by the student.   if the test questions test you on material that was taught in class, then you better have understood all of it.   </p>
<p>some college level teachers specifically will test you on material that was not covered in class.  and that's what gets you an A and not a C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that it's generally easier to get a 4.0 GPA than, say, a first class degree in England (which is 70%). The fact that a 3.7 is seen as an equivalent to an upper 2.1/1st borderline (second class, upper division (~67%+, otherwise known as a 'high 2.1') for postgraduate purposes further supports this. I know a few people who have studied both in America and in England, and they all say a first is more difficult to achieve. I'm not saying a 4.0 is easy or somehow trivial, just that 4.0 students get a little too erect about the '95%' scores when it's so much easier to gain raw percentage points.</p></div>		</li>

<p>which means on the same test, an american barely passing grade of 70% would be a reasonable high test score in Finland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that's the thing. It's definitely a bit of a headscrew for US students to get but the tests aren't the same in these systems to the ones you're used to. Every mark is progressively harder to get than the previous one. </p>
<p>So, for an example engineering exam, you could have 6 long form questions where you have to pick 4 to complete in the 3 hr exam. </p>
<p>In each of those questions, you typically have 3 sections - one explicit basic knowledge/application (5 marks available), one intermediate &quot;bread and butter&quot; application (5 marks available), and one advanced &quot;do you understand the nuances&quot; application (15 marks available). So, to pass (40%), you need to nail all your basic and intermediate questions perfectly or have a moderate grasp of them and some ability to at least get some &quot;valid attempt&quot; marks on the advanced questions.</p>
<p>Speaking for our own degree scale, a 70%+ would be a First Class Honours - you'd expect between 5 and 15% of a class to get one in an exam. For a sense of scale, typically a Second class first division (60%) at the end of your degree would be seen as adequate for entry to a PhD - in the US, the same entry would be a 3.0 GPA.</p></div>		</li>
