			<div class="markdown"><p>All great points. And a perfect question for ELI5.</p>
<p>I just wanted to mention that the earth's rotational forces are important here too. If it was only a question of warmth and coldness, wind-patterns would merely move in North-South patterns.</p>
<p>The fact that the earth's rotation creates <em>rotational forces</em>, however, changes this. </p>
<p>A strong force (sun light) makes air move as the middle of the earth is hot, and the poles (bottom/top) are cold. This makes air move all over the place from cold to warm places (and vice versa as elevated air cools down). However, the rotation impacts the direction of these air-flows. In the northern hemisphere the rotational forces of the earth forces these winds into a (a clockwise) spiral creating an eastern pattern, while in the southern hemisphere these forces shape these winds into a counter clockwise spiral, creating a western pattern.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarification. It is not the rotation itself that causes winds, but the rotational forces, and the impact these forces have on the movement of cold/hot air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make this piggyback pile even taller, different types of terrain contribute by changing temperature are different rates.</p>
<p>An easy example of this is the sea: during the day, it soaks up sun and gets warm. The land heats up quicker, so the cool air over the sea rushes in where the warm overland air rises. This is an inland sea breeze. At night, the reverse happens - the sea stays warm longer, so the cool air from the shore blows out to sea.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different levels at which wind is &quot;made.&quot; Sun-related North/South movement, the Coriolis effect from the earth's rotation, coastal temperatures, sneezing trees, etc. etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moisture has an effect to play as well.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but air with a high humidity is actually less dense than air with a lower humidity, so it will rise more vigorously.  When this warm air is over a warm ocean, that warm updraft will rise extremely fast, sucking in more air, which picks up more moisture, which cyclically feeds the system.  This is how powerful storms, most notably hurricanes, are born.  They are a giant water-moving machines, with updrafts sending moisture up into the atmosphere where it condenses into thick clouds.  This effect is why you hear the news outlets talk about hurricanes getting stronger when they cross &quot;warm patches&quot; of water.  The warm water will strengthen the updraft and, by proxy, the whole system.  It's also a major factor in why global warming is a huge problem, because warmer air and warmer seas can produce stronger storms this way.</p>
<p>And, as an addendum to two comments above, the earth's rotation is what drives these massive storms in one direction - it's why you never see hurricanes bash, say, the African coast, or a typhoon wreaking havoc on California.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said is not quite correct.  The rotation of the earth does not just &quot;force these winds in an eastern pattern&quot; in the northern hemisphere and &quot;force these winds in a western pattern&quot; in the southern hemisphere.  </p>
<p><a href="http://i.cdn-surfline.com/forecasters/blog/2012/10_oct/101012-2.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.cdn-surfline.com/forecasters/blog/2012/10_oct/101012-2.jpg</a></p>
<p>This chart shows that in parts of the northern hemisphere, winds tend to move east, <em>and in other parts of the northern hemisphere winds tend to move west.</em>  Why?  Primarily because air rises at the equator and settles back down at the &quot;horse latitudes&quot; (this is additionally why there is lots of rain at the equator, caused by rising air, and deserts across the horse latitudes, caused by descending air).  A second rotation of air occurs between these latitudes and the poles, but in the opposite direction (so that air is still descending on these latitudes).  These circulations, coupled with the rotation of the earth (and the Coriolis Effect), dictate which direction winds generally move at which altitude.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm certainly not expert on the topic, but as someone who has lived in a hurricane prone area, I am <em>well aware</em> that hurricanes (ones that exist entirely in the northern hemisphere) move from east to west when closer to the equator, and then hook back out east once they move north past the so-called &quot;horse latitudes&quot; <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Retired_Atlantic_hurricane_tracks.png" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, and that is called the Coriolis Effect. <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/coriolis-effect" target="_blank">http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/coriolis-effect</a>.</p>

<p>Slightly more complex explanation:</p>
<p>The sun is the driving force behind the global wind patterns. As the sun heats the equator, the air is heated and rises, moving North and South, away from the equator. Cold air rushes in to take itsâ€™ place. This creates a convection cell that extends from the equator to about 30 degrees North and South Latitude. This cell is called the Hadley cell after it discoverer George Hadley in 1735. The next cell is the Ferrell cell, which was identified by the American William Ferrell in the 1800s. This cell connects the sinking air at the 30th parallels to the Westerlies. It was Ferrell who noted that the currents in the Westerlies tend to give rise to cyclonic action as a result of winds moving around a spinning Earth. The Ferrell Cells sink at the 30th parallels and rise again at the 60th parallels where the Polar Cells begin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A note on this, the sun causes only the surface to heat. The air directly above it is then heated by the ground.  This is why thermal updrafts can be more prominent over certain types of surfaces that better reflect heat, ie: over pavement, rock, open fields in direct sunlight ect. And mostly absent over others that better absorb heat, such as tree canopies and bodies of water.  This is info us paraglider, hanglider, and sailplane pilots put to good use in order to stay up longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body warms up a layer of air around you that gets blown off when you move too fast or are hit with a breeze.</p>
<p>Also if any water or sweat is being evaporated off of you (which sucks up heat off of your skin and into the air), the wind blowing past you allows for more rapid evaporation, so it feels even colder.</p></div>		</li>
