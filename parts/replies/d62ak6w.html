			<p>I found that really interesting.  I never heard of a cormorant before. The birds are actually used to catch fish.<br><br>Found a link<br><br><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant_fishing" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormorant_fishing</a><br><br>It doesn't mention counting in that article but here is some info<br><br><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_intelligence" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_intelligence</a><br><br><a href="http://www.birdminds.com/Cormorant.php" target="_blank">http://www.birdminds.com/Cormorant.php</a><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Here's a BBC video on the cormorants:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEplaYZtpI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEplaYZtpI</a><br><br>At the end of the video they talk about the counting to 7 briefly. I remember from other sources that the cormorants would stubbornly refuse to work anymore until it got it's reward. I assume the Chinese fishermen gave a reward at 8 because that number is lucky in the culture.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>These birds are amazing. Where I live there are always some of them around when going out on a boat. And one very interesting fact is that they have specialised feathers that improve their underwater movement (hunting) but in return they have to air dry their wings. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Spread-Wing_Postures.html" target="_blank">https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Spread-Wing_Postures.html</a><br><br>So you will often see them standing on fishing poles spreading their wings to dry.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do you think that the ability to subsitize relates to how many babies a species has at once (if they are then tasked with raising the young like humans and birds do)? </p>		</li>

			<p>Humans being able to subsitize to four already is evidence against this as we predominantly only have one offspring at a time.</p>		</li>

			<p>At some point in the past, were we expected to keep track of 4 at a time? What about the social aspect of our species, were certain people, maybe grandparents expected to keep track of the young while the fit adults went out to forage? </p>		</li>

			<p>Not necessarily, considering the amount of time to fully mature compared to litter size and gestation period.</p>		</li>
