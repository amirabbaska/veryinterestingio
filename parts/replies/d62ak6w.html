			<div class="markdown"><p>I found that really interesting.  I never heard of a cormorant before. The birds are actually used to catch fish.</p>
<p>Found a link</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a BBC video on the cormorants:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEplaYZtpI" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNEplaYZtpI</a></p>
<p>At the end of the video they talk about the counting to 7 briefly. I remember from other sources that the cormorants would stubbornly refuse to work anymore until it got it's reward. I assume the Chinese fishermen gave a reward at 8 because that number is lucky in the culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These birds are amazing. Where I live there are always some of them around when going out on a boat. And one very interesting fact is that they have specialised feathers that improve their underwater movement (hunting) but in return they have to air dry their wings. <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Spread-Wing_Postures.html" target="_blank">https://web.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Spread-Wing_Postures.html</a></p>
<p>So you will often see them standing on fishing poles spreading their wings to dry.</p></div>		</li>
