			<div class="markdown"><p>Still got an old Sony CD player that has lots of buttons on the remote including Index buttons and the option to type a track number in (even a specific &quot;Over 10&quot; button to get to tracks 10-19, or press it twice for tracks 20-29 etc).</p>
<p>Sadly it needs some attention as it doesn't read CD's any more, not sure if the laser is just dirty or if it's bust, or if something else is bust. Not had the time to haul it out and look at it in detail. The Sony record deck we have also needs some attention, it's not spinning fast enough and needs the pots adjusted, but to do so you need to take the entire arm assembly off so you can unscrew the top case from the underside so you can get at the pots for speed adjustment. It's a mammoth task that requires being very careful to take it apart and set it all back up again for an extremely light head weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a C701ES, sadly the turntable for the CD Changer has gone crazy and it never stops moving. Putting a CD in is a game of skill, and the table stopping by the reader is a game of luck but when it does land on a disc it still works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has an LCD Panel but I haven't seen inside it so I couldn't say if it has a ton of empty space inside. It is kinda big though so it may well have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How high does the over 10 button go? The CD standard allows a maximum of 99 tracks, so in theory it should go to the 90s.The highest I've ever seen was a game called Tuneland, which has one data track and 97 audio tracks (<a href="http://redump.org/disc/17239/" target="_blank">http://redump.org/disc/17239/</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Short Music For Short People&quot; from Fat Wreck Chords contains 101 songs, but only 99 actual tracks - the last three songs are on the same audio track. I was super disappointed to discover this fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea. We don't have a CD with 99 tracks on it. I figure if the original CD Standard supported 99 tracks then I guess it should support the &quot;Over 10&quot; button being pressed 9 times before another number is entered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an early CD of Wish You Were Here that I bought new back in the mid 80's that has just <em>two</em> tracks on it, one for side 1 of the original album and the other for side 2.  The Index function was the only way to move around within the two long tracks (other than FF/Rew).   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, indexes were supposed to be used for sections within larger works. In the classical world, that meant Symphony No. 5 would be one track and Symphony No. 6 would the second track. To access individual movements, you use the index marks.</p>
<p>Thing is, almost no one used them. So the CD manufacturers never did either. So Symphony No. 5 has 4 tracks, one for each movement.</p></div>		</li>
