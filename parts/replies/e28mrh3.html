<p>I would imagine lifting a piece of steel from a piece of wood would be easier than twisting it off, especially if both were porous. Perhaps it has something to with molecular attachment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to do this simply and clearly lol.  </p>
<p>Any force on an object has to be carried through it. A bridge takes load in the middle, sends it horizontally until it hits the supports, and then it goes down to the ground and the bridge stands up. Yay!  </p>
<p>Any material can fail in essentially one of three ways: compression (crushing), tension (pulling), or shear (two parts of it sliding in different directions, like an earthquake fault line). In most real world cases, it's some combination of these, and that's what matters for your question.  </p>
<p>If you hold a small wooden board in your hands in front of you, you can rip it by pulling your hands apart, crush it by slamming them together, or try to shear it by pulling one toward your stomach and pressing one away (without rotating the block - easier said than done, because wood is stronger than you lol).  </p>
<p>Orrrrrrr, you can pull both hands apart while also moving one toward you and one away from you at the same time. This combines tension and shear.  </p>
<p>It depends on the forces and materials and angles and a few other things, but this is often the easiest way to break something. In many cases, some combination of shear and tension will be the easiest way to get a material or connection to fail. It sounds like this happens to be the case for oreos.  </p>
<p>Probably the closest I can get you without getting into triginometry and physics and actually teaching material science lol. Did that help at all? Any clarifying questions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I have a somewhat related question. Suppose I have a piece of cylindrical string of length <em>L</em> and tensile strength <em>A</em>, and I connect it to a surface (say the ceiling) using glue. Assume that the glue has the same cross section of the string, but has a different tensile strength (so it's a cylinder of the same radius, but of length <em>s</em> and tensile strength <em>b</em>). Is there a simple expression for the tensile strength of the glued rope?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A piece of steel that's glued to a piece of wood? Are they bonded somehow?</p>

<p>Definitely. </p>
<p>Found some further discussion</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_any_relationship_between_shear_strength_and_tensile_strength_of_a_metal2" target="_blank">https://www.researchgate.net/post/Is_there_any_relationship_between_shear_strength_and_tensile_strength_of_a_metal2</a></p>
<p>So roughly it takes 2x as much strength to pull a material apart then it is to slide it apart. </p>
<p>Also this is not exactly twisting. I wonder if there's a relationship between those two separating motions. </p>
<p>Here's another one</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-always-true-that-materials-are-weaker-in-shear-why" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/Is-it-always-true-that-materials-are-weaker-in-shear-why</a></p>
<p>Part of it may lie in the fact that to measure the sheer strength - you have to sheer it. Sheering material induces a very high stress concentration on the edges and will cause early failure which will propagate. Tensile tests go out of their way to not cause stress concentrations.</p>
<p>I didn't know this part!</p>
<p>Generally, only Ductile materials are weaker in shear. And brittle materials are weaker in tension.</p></div>		</li>
