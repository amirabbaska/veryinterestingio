<p>Towards the back of the trail, its just entering low pressure as it gets wider. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am actually curious about another thing but don't find it to warrant its own post so will be hitchhiking on yours:</p>
<p>Was it a possible marketing move by Space X? It seems to be that it garnered a lot of attention from onlookers, while usually space stuff is just something we watch from behind a screen and thus this event actually makes us see space efforts with more clarity and makes us feel more involved.</p>
<p>So is it possible this was also a way to garner the attention of the masses to increase the publics awareness and potential funding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most launches of the Shuttle were during daytime, but <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oR0WWQX.jpg" target="_blank">here's a picture</a> of STS-31, showing an early morning launch. </p>
<p>Most of the plume on the right is only visible by the light of the solid rocket boosters, and when they shut off, it was essentially invisible until the Shuttle rose high enough to catch the morning light of dawn on the left of the image. You can clearly see it split into three arcs in that area caused by the layout of the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UWjNVu4.jpg" target="_blank">Shuttle's main engines</a>.</p></div>		</li>
