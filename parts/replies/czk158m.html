			<div class="markdown"><p>This I understand. But it leaves me with more questions so excuse my ignorance for a moment. How do diseases/bacteria etc. know what breaks down our functions vs. enhances our functions? Surely it would be something like trial and error, in which case, wouldn't you see some examples of diseases that enhance us before they figure out they should be doing the opposite and mutate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>here is a fun thing to think about: every cell in your body is a little organism, you are a colony of creatures working together for their mutual benefit. </p>
<p>so what does that mean? well the &quot;goal&quot; of evolution, where a goal can be said to exist, is the passing on of our genes. they are what survive us and anything which helps those genes replicate and spread are selected for. so why do all the cells in your body help you? because if you live their genetic lineage is guaranteed. so anything they can do to help keep you alive and passing on those genes they do. </p>
<p>so what about stray pathogens? well it's complicated. some are new to this whole &quot;infecting humans&quot; thing, and they just reproduce like crazy...they also tend to kill off their hosts before they can spread. some, like influenza, get you sick and made you react to them so they can use your reaction to jump to another body, but generally leaves you ok after a little bit. some live in you and never cause any problems...they don't HELP but they don't HURT either. there is a virus in your genome called LINE which exists solely to make more copies of itself in your DNA...it's just read, copied, and re-inserted. this is how it keeps IT'S genetic lineage. some are actually helpful, living in your gut and helping to digest food and out competing potentially harmful ones (a reason to be careful with broad spectrum antibiotics...among many.)</p>
<p>basically, the bacteria and viruses have no real INTENT to do harm, and replicating wildly and trashing the host is not always the best solution for long term survival, just as all the cells in your body decided it was better to work together for a common goal, so to do pathogens learn it's best to keep the host alive and well.</p>
<p>if you want something that infects you and turns you into spiderman though...no such luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you point out is a great way to think about cancer... cancer is nothing but cells that found a way to bypass the bodies regulatory system that tells certain cells to die or certain cells to stop growing/dividing.  These are mutated cells that found a way to stay alive and propagate in the ecosystem that is your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not true that bacteria/viruses have no intent to do harm. Most don't, but the ones that are considered pathogens are indeed trying to actively harm/kill us.</p>
<p>For example, S. aureus secretes a number of toxins that have downright scary effects. Alpha, beta and delta toxins lyse (kill) blood cells. The TSST1 toxin essentially hyperactivates your immune cells, causing septic shock and eventual death. Particularly virulent strains (e.g. MRSA) secrete Panton-Valentine leukocidin that will lyse white blood cells. </p>
<p>Plenty of other nasty bacteria like Group A strep (famously &quot;flesh-eating&quot;), enterohemorrhagic E.coli (causes bloody diarrhea), and so on. I won't bore you with details, but all of these guys have their own arsenal of toxins and virulence factors to damage the host. </p>
<p>Viruses also evolved some insidious tricks. The HPV virus actively impairs DNA repair processes, causing cervical cancer. It's not fully understood why the virus wants the cells to become cancerous, but the common hypothesis is that this accelerates the virus' replication. </p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that many pathogens have found an effective strategy to infect, debilitate, possibly even kill the host before jumping to the next. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bacteria or virus doesn't know or care how it affects the host. All they're trying to do is replicate and since they're in the same environment as the host cell, using the resources that the host cell has available to it is usually bad for the host cell.</p>
<p>A really basic example is that of a virus. A virus is just some DNA or RNA surrouned by a protein coat to protect it. It doesn't have all the proteins and other tools that cells have that can replicate the virus. So when a virus infects a cell, it injects the genetic information straight into the nucleus and into the cell's genetic information. Now where normally the cell would be reading it's own DNA/RNA and making proteins that would benefit itself, it's now reading and replicating viral genetic information and making viral protein coats. Since the cell can't build proteins for itself it'll eventually die releasing all of the newly made viruses to infect other cells.</p>
<p>Some examples of a positive or mutualistic relationships between a host and parasite is mentioned in other posts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are for themselves. They don't care if it benefits us or kills us. If it benefits both parties, everything will stay the same until another factor tips that balance. If it's the case of either us or them then it gets interesting, we enter an arms race. Mutations and all that shit. Now add millions of years into that equation and you end up with the most complex processes to get rid of each other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I did see those, but they are bacteria that you are supposed to have already so they are really just bringing you back to the status quo, and not actually improving you beyond what is typical. I was just kidding anyway though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses don't have a metabolism so they can't really.</p>
<p>Bacteria could but usually the immune system doesn't like that either and goes crazy on them.</p>
<p>If it wouldn't you would starve to death though so I guess it's not that bad :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely. The vast, vast majority of organisms in our body are harmless, benificial, or only mildly irritating. These are the successful ones. They flourish in our gut and on our skin mostly. Many strains of bacteria have infected every human on the planet and then some.</p>
<p>The little fucks that are harmful are in the minority, and even those typically are not very successful at what they do. If a strain of bacteria kills its host, that means that it has to find a new one, which is a complicated and risky process. If a strain of bacteria is dangerous to its host, then its host will probably send its immune system after it, and its host will be weakened, making it more likely to be killed by the infection itself, or by natural causes. Either way, this could end up being very dangerous to the parasite, as there's no guarantee that it will be able to survive elsewhere. </p></div>		</li>
