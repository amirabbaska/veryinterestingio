			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been struggling with this my entire life : when I was young I didn't want to eat along with my family, I sometimes dread going to restaurants (depends who I'm going with...), I often find myself having killing thoughts about other people in the line at the supermarket or in the bus, and sometimes I hate my boyfriend... I guess my question is : how did you get it to be &quot;not as bad as it once was&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part, bloody mindedness, but the whole process was kicked off with being on anti-depressants for a while (for depression rather than the misophonia). After a while, I noticed that I wasn't as bothered by it as I used to be. I've since come off the anti-depressants and have been primarily relying on the basic concepts of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and it seems to help across a variety of areas. Have a look at <a href="https://moodgym.com.au/" target="_blank">https://moodgym.com.au/</a> for an online CBT course (free in Australia, not sure how it's handled for people elsewhere).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Misophonia! Glad to have a term now. Noisy eaters (sometimes not even with mouth open) and jingly sounds (people with keys on their belt for example) make me irrationally irritated and I have to push myself really hard to &quot;choose my attitude&quot; while the &quot;offender&quot; can't understand what my issue is. Interestingly, I've also been avoiding medicated solutions to depression (you mentioned below), and now I'm wondering if that might help this issue too. My aversion to certain sounds creates some stress with my partner so trying new things might be a good idea. Thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>
