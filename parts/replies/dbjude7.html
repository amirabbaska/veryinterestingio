<p>Edit: lol, I like how I'm downvoted instead of answered. Aren't we in a sub where we ask questions? Didn't realize that was frowned upon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Head to ground
Close.  Maybe head to tail?  (Since they aren't producing new charge or sliding a ground shield around, they must be making an electric dipole.)  Out one end and in the other.  Could be out side and in the other.  The thing where they lift their heads out of the water would make the electric field more dense, as most of the field would want to stay in the water.</p>

<p>Eels have now moved up several rungs on the cool ladder. Thank you for the info. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Eels have been recorded producing larger pulses for over an hour.  The individual pulses are short in duration (milliseconds) so it's not like they are pushing electrons at full output for a long time. Think about how your muscles can work at lower output for longer time periods or at higher output for shorter periods. Also, eels can vary their output to suit their need.  They use low power pulses to detect prey, higher output to stun prey into rigor, and massive pulses to incapacitate larger prey or to defend against aggressors.  All this said, they will eventually get discharged and have to rest.</p></div>		</li>
