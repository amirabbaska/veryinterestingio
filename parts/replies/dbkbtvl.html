<p>I know this is a sidebar, but can you elaborate on this? I thought the electrons I buy from the electric company are converted to light, heat, work, etc.</p></div>		</li>

Nope, and that's the classic misconception taught by nearly all grade-school textbooks.  Even Bill Nye and Mrs. Frizzel get it wrong.   See <a href="http://amasci.com/miscon/eleca.html#electron" target="_blank">miscon</a>    Heh, it's a &quot;don't even git me started&quot; topic.   <em>Oops, too late!</em>   I can type really fast.  :)</p>

<p>Electric companies, they just force the metal's own electrons to move slowly, (or if AC, to wiggle slightly back and forth.) At the same time, waves of electric energy are traveling along the columns of electrons; energy moving as light-speed EM waves; waves that are located in the space just outside the wires.  (If you jerk a rope, the rope molecules all move slowly towards you, while the energy zooms almost instantly to the far end of the rope.)   Electric companies are actually selling us wave-energy, magnetic fields and electric fields:  60Hz electromagnetism.    The waves can make their way to our homes because they are able to vibrate the electricity which always exists inside power lines (inside all metal wires.)</p>
<p>So, the electricity (electrons) within a wire behave much like a drive belt.   Metals are jam-pack filled with movable electrons, all the time.  That means any metal wire contains a section of &quot;invisible drive-belt.&quot;  Form the wires into a long, complete circle!   The &quot;invisible drive belt&quot; inside the metal circle moves fairly slow, yet the energy moves along the belt almost instantly.  And our electrons-drive-belts are not created by the &quot;pulleys&quot; which make it move.  Instead the belt must already exist, even before the &quot;pulley-dynamo&quot; starts turning.</p>
<p>So, the &quot;complete circuit&quot; rule becomes obvious, because, heh, pieces of a drive-belt can only work if they're formed into complete circles.   Of course this means that all metals are always packed full of electricity, all the time, like aquariums, or like hoses which are pre-filled with water (no bubbles allowed.)   The electrical water analogy is also called the &quot;full pipes analogy.&quot;   This all makes perfect sense if we're taught that &quot;electric conductor&quot; means &quot;material which is full of movable electricity.&quot;    Insulators, they're like pipes full of solid ice.</p>
<p>The above situation isn't that complicated, since air behaves much the same way.   We have air, but we also have air-currents called &quot;wind.&quot;   But we also have air-energy, the waves which flash along through the atmosphere at incredible speed. It's called &quot;sound.&quot;   The analogy goes like this:</p>
<p>air molecules -&gt; electrons<br />
air or atmosphere -&gt; the sea of movable charge within conductive materials<br />
wind -&gt; electric currents<br />
sound -&gt; EM energy, the KWH<br />
sound propagates through air molecules -&gt; EM energy propagates through electrons<br />
nitrogen is not sound -&gt; electricity is not electrical energy  </p>
<p>Electricity is like air molecules, while EM energy is like sound waves.  Sorta.  Vaguely.   It's an analogy.</p>
<p>Yet in grade-school, they teach that electrons are the &quot;electricity,&quot;  then they teach that the current is the &quot;electricity,&quot; then they teach that the energy is the &quot;electricity.&quot;   Imagine trying to understand sound, if we had no words for &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;wind,&quot; but just said that sound was air, wind was air, and nitrogen was air.   That's how we're all taught about &quot;electricity.&quot;   Very twisted.</p>
<p>So basically, electric companies are selling us &quot;electrical sound&quot; composed of EM waves, while the wires themselves are completely packed full of &quot;air molecules&quot; (the electrons) which then allow the waves travel along wires.  The KWH of electrical energy that electric companies send to us is wave-energy composed of EM fields.    And finally, <em>electricity isn't actually a form of energy.</em>    Books that say this, they've confused &quot;sound&quot; with &quot;air.&quot;</p>
<p>Any book that says electricity is a form of energy, they're badly screwing you up.  That phrase is like teaching kids that nitrogen molecules are a form of sound energy.  Those K-6 textbook writers all need to go back to grade school.   Oops, they can't! Because all the grade-school textbooks are teaching the same bogus physics, where their word &quot;electricity&quot; doesn't have the normal scientific definition, and the result is vast confusion.   To get the correct stuff, we need college textbooks.  But that doesn't help much, because those books do it all via math, and they never actually come out and say simple things like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>quantity of electricity is measured in coulombs, not joules.  That means <em>electricity is not a form of energy.</em>  That's our starting point for slicing through all the BS.</li>
<li>all wires are already full of electricity all the time.   It's called &quot;electron-sea of metals.&quot;  Wires are weird, they're like electron-matter, like solidified plasma.</li>
<li>during normal circuit operation, no electricity is created or destroyed.  Instead it flows in a complete circle, with none being gained or lost.</li>
<li>when the electricity found inside a metal is forced to move, we call it &quot;electric current.&quot;   But when energy is moving, we call it &quot;electric power.&quot;    Amperes are not watts, just like wind is not sound.</li>
<li>electric current, like water currents in rivers and oceans, normally moves in complete circles.</li>
<li>the path for current is <em>through</em> batteries.  The acid or salt-water is a good conductor.  The battery plates do not store or accumulate any electricity whatsoever.  Batteries are charge-pumps.</li>
<li>when a dynamo generates a current, it's much like a paddle stirring a bucket; it's a pumping process.  The flow of water in the bucket (and flows of electricity in the dynamo coils,) must be circular.   But with dynamos, the &quot;paddle&quot; is a moving magnet. The magnetic field &quot;pumps&quot; the charges, and this forces the whole circuit to begin moving like a long, long belt.</li>
<li>basically our whole civilization is powered by &quot;radio waves&quot; at 60Hz frequency, with the EM waves running along the outside of wires.  The magnetic fields of the energy-waves are connected to the electric currents within the wires, and the e-fields of the energy waves are connected to the voltage and the surface-charge of the wires.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a cool result:  if you go stand between a couple of 3-phase electric pylons out in the countryside, you're standing right in the wattage-flow going to the city, since the megawatts are all in the space around the wires, with no energy at all inside the wires.  (The wires are full of electricity, not energy.)   Hold up a fluorescent tube or a neon sign, and it lights up, just like with a Tesla Coil.    In this way, electric circuits aren't like water hoses.  With water hoses the energy travels inside the long water columns.  With &quot;electricity hoses&quot; the energy is connected to the long columns of 'fluid' electrons, but the energy actually travels just outside the wires, as EM fields.</p>
<p>Once we slice away all the misconceptions and the distorted grade-school materials, <em>Science Hangs Together,</em> it tells understandable stories, and connects to all sorts of separate things to form a complete, satisfying whole.  It's like completing a puzzle with every piece fitting.   If reality is like a picture-puzzle, then our usual in-ability to understand physics is not our own fault.  Instead it's caused by defective puzzle-pieces which all of us were carefully given during grade-school.  To assemble the complete puzzle, first we must first locate and discard the defective pieces with crazy shapes that do not fit.   One defective piece is &quot;electricity is a form of energy.&quot;   Nope, wrong.   Another big one is &quot;electrons travel at the speed of light.&quot;   No, they're like wind, not like sound, and they travel slow   ...or back and forth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common analogy is to substitute electricity with water. If you imagine water being pumped through your house in a pipe and being run through a pipe with an internal water wheel to produce motion, friction, heat etc. the water never disappears, but its energy is used to run your appliances. After passing through, there is a continuous loop back to the power source. </p>
<p>In reality it is a little more complicated than that, because we all run on AC as opposed to DC, and technically the electrons don't actually travel very far or fast. </p>
<p>Edit: I just finished writing and realized I didn't really answer your question... Maybe a physicist could better explain the actual particle level interactions that take place in lights and heating elements but my understanding is that the electrons transfer energy to their surroundings, excite them, but aren't destroyed in the process. The &quot;excited&quot; material can then relax and release light or heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electricity travels <em>through</em> the toaster, then back out again, with no electricity being used up.   Electricity always travels in complete circles.  The amperes going in are the same as the amperes going out.</p>
<p>But amperes are not watts, and electricity is not energy.</p>
<p>ELI5: two completely separate things are flowing along electric circuits, the electricity and the energy.  Electricity is like a rubber drive-belt, and goes in a circle, while the energy is like the &quot;horsepower&quot; that zooms across the moving drive-belt, going instantly from the drive-pulley to the driven-pulley.</p>
<p>Suppose we erase the word &quot;rubber&quot; from all textbooks.   Instead we can call it &quot;mechanicity!&quot;  Not rubber belt, it's a &quot;mechanicity circuit!&quot;    Much more complicated and impressive.   Only our top physicists will ever understand the drive-belt concept, or ever be able to grasp the existence of that exotic matter called &quot;canvas reinforced black neoprene loops.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.   But perhaps it went through the path of electrical &quot;sonar,&quot; as some fish use, and slowly evolved into a weapon.</p>
<p>If a fish can use muscles to generate an underwater pulsed e-field, and if it can somehow sense changes to the e-field, then it can use the field to locate objects or prey.  This would be most useful in blackout conditions (muddy rivers, etc.)  The muscles turn into an &quot;electric organ,&quot; then end up as high-power batteries, while &quot;nostrils&quot; turn into e-field sensors.    Soon, like pistol shrimp, the fish can stun prey with its &quot;transmitter&quot; that had evolved for a completely different use.</p></div>		</li>
