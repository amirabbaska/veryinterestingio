			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this makes total sense. So essentially, when something that glows in the dark stops glowing, is the reasoning behind it that it simply ran out of energy? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, all the electrons have returned to their low energy state. To make it glow again you just need to add energy via exposing it to light again. Over time though these phosphors may deteriorate and the glow intensity might fade. Different phosphors give off different colors because their electrons release the energy in a different wavelength. The amount of energy needed to make the electrons jump up a shell/level determines what wavelength is released, and therefore what color you see. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thry mix two chemicals together which are separated by glass (hence the snapping and crunching when bent)</p>
<p>They interact and produce a new chemical and light</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For added fun - you may have heard of tritium being used in things like gun sights or fire exit signs. Tritium is radioactive, emitting low energy beta particles (electrons). The energy in the beta particles keeps knocking the electrons in the phosphorescent material into those higher energy states, where they can then drop back down and release visible light. </p>
<p>The result is a glow in the dark object that just keeps on glowing even when not exposed to light.</p>
<p>The tritium decays away, half of it every 12 years. But since our eyesight is very non-linear, the reduction in brightness from the loss of tritium is not really significant for decades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you add energy in the form of heat to a rock it heats up. If you remove that heat source the rock still gives off energy in the form of heat for a while. </p>
<p>Same thing with glow in the dark stuff. You add light, and after you remove the light it gives off the energy as light for a while. That's as shallow as I can go lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything you can see 'glows'. When light hits it, it is absorbed and re-emitted.</p>
<p>Glow in the dark stuff just takes longer to do the second part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bohr model is the standard model everyone sees, even at a young age. </p>
<p>How bout, you put energy into the atoms via light, and it releases light. </p>
<p>That gives almost no information other than what's directly observable. Going into the Bohr model gives the OP some extra insight as to how it actually works. Like they asked.  I even described what the Bohr model was in plain English </p></div>		</li>
