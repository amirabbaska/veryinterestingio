			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course not. You shouldn't put anything in a bundle that hasn't slowed sales significantly. It's heavily discounting your game to a group that is unlikely to play it long enough to recommend it to others.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>All major credit cards accepted. Payments via bank account are also supported by PayPal and Amazon Payments. Payment processing fees will be deducted proportionally from the payment amounts you indicate on your slider(s). Fees typically average 5 to 6% across all transactions, but may vary depending on a number of factors, including your location, purchase price, and payment method. We deduct consumption taxes, where applicable, in the same manner. Payments to charitable organizations are made via the PayPal Giving Fund.
