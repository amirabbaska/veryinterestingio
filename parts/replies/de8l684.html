			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd divide that hypothetical into a few groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1) Professional graduates (Dr's, Lawyers, IT, Engineers, etc.) who will not buy a car when they're 20 on account of still being in school, but by 25-30 now out-earn those who never went to school, and could have feasibly paid off their debts or balanced their spending to pay off debts and buy a car. (delayed spenders)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2) Liberal Arts Majors (constant punching bags for the sake of this argument) who graduate in debt but without better salaries. Con: They have to address their debt and delayed entrance to the workforce, Pro: When they do enter the workforce they (potentially) are better educated than their peers, leading to them being better employees over the course of their lives and hopefully generating more for the economy than had they not learned how to critically analyze 3 lines from a 200 year old poem. OR they just have crippling debt, make a mean Latte, and ultimately are the worse off for themselves and the economy. (never spenders)</p>
</li>
<li>3) Someone who never went to school. Starts working full time at 18, makes a decent (but diminishing) salary in the manufacturing industry and stays comfortably within an income bracket, providing a backbone but not a growth of the economy. BUT they can afford a new car. (constant spenders)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two sides of the economy that are constantly conflated to advance political agendas. Sometimes the difference between the two are trivial but in these scenarios it’s important to appreciate the distinctions. The following is a veeeeeeery watered down explanation.</p>
<p>The Long Run: In the long run we assume all our variables will be in equilibrium with each other. This isn’t an outrageous assumption as all variables in our economy do move towards equilibrium. When we ask the question “Are student loans slowly killing our economy” this is a question for the long run. The fact that we have an effectively poorer generation of graduates is entirely irrelevant to the question because the money hasn’t disappeared. It’s just in someone else’s pocket to spend on what they want. We don’t want to look at money we want to look at productivity. The question you want to be asking yourself is whether or not people will be more of less productive as a result of student loans. One might argue ‘more’ because student loans enable citizens to get a college education, and educated citizens are always more productive than uneducated. On the other hand another might argue ‘less’ because the production lost from maintaining the infrastructure to educate these citizens (professors, labs, buildings, gyms, dining halls, etc.) wouldn’t be needed without the inflated demand for college, and the production lost to this isn’t made up for by the production gained from educated citizens.</p>
<p>The Short Run: This is more towards your original question. When we’re debating events that could knock our economy out of equilibrium (such as lending bubbles) we consider things in the short run. Here money distribution plays a key role. Let’s say college prices were to double next year. In this scenario we would see a substantial shift in purchasing power from graduates to colleges. We may see some serious short term effects as the corporations who depended on graduates spending money (the auto industry for example) would not experience the level of demand they were accustomed to.   Because the economy cannot shift itself instantaneously to replace the lost manufacturing jobs with the new jobs colleges need to spend their new wealth on (construction, professors, etc.), a recession is possible. But when we consider the long run implications of the tuition hike the questions we ask ourselves are completely different.</p>
<p>tl;dr A decrease in purchasing power doesn’t necessarily mean a weaker economy. Just like an increase in purchasing power doesn’t necessarily mean a stronger economy (looking at you Reagan).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you're putting a political slant on it.  Not allowing anyone except the children of wealthy families to attend college would slow our economy even more, and that's what happens when you don't offer student loans.</p>
<p>What needs to happen is that tuition prices need to be regulated by the government, potentially as a condition of accepting federal student loan dollars.  That would mean that universities can charge whatever they want, but only if the government isn't paying for it.  That sounds fair to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that eliminate competition between public and private universities? </p>
<p>Rich parents would just send their kids to the expensive, private universities to get degrees that are more valuable to the job market.</p>
<p>Now, I'm just a liberal arts student, but it sounds like this would contribute to more &quot;rule by the 1%&quot; problem we've been encountering, especially because most of our politicians went to Ivy Leagues. <em>wink, wink</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and no.  it limits the spending power of people aged 20-30.  but it also theoretically allows these people to get a college education and have better careers.  the thing that is really hurting our economy is people who have student loans, then get a degree that is basically useless and they end up in a career they could have without a college degrees, are 5 years behind on their career trajectory, and have lots of debt/interest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy to say but hard to put into practice... just because they get a job not in their field doesn't mean they weren't/aren't trying to... with how many older people who aren't passing the torch and staying in their field well passed then they should causes us to look for shitty work that people who are retired or too young should be doing. </p>
<p>The boomers should be passing the torch but they &quot;want to keep busy&quot; so let's take the jobs from the young... then go &quot;omg lazy youngsters... don't wanna get a job... back in my day....&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That entirely assumes the only people with student loans are 20-30, while it's simply the majority--- also assumes they'll have a job after all that debt. Remove those two assumptions and, yeah, that'll seriously delay people financially for decades ultimately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an inconvenient truth much of reddit doesn't want to accept because many of us fall within that group of individuals. Simply put, if the government is funding something that, in the end, no value is received from, it doesn't help the economy. It's not entirely the fault of the student for choosing these career paths, considering how available and encouraged they are in high school, but no one should make the excuse that boomers need to retire because the number of psychology/music/art history jobs are being taken by them. It's simply careers that are over saturated. </p></div>		</li>
