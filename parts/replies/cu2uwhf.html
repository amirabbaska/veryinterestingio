			<p>Right, Wikipedia says there some thousands of species of cicadas, but I had trouble finding information about cicadas on the east coast other than 13/17 year species. It answers half of my question though - the one I'm hearing outside are possibly a different species than the 13/17 year cicada. <br><br>But the second part of my question - do cicadas with multi-year life cycles ever come out of sync with each other (perhaps due to internal clocks getting fucked up due to weird weather patterns?), and is this a mechanism for cicadas to speciate? Are there <em>some</em> 13/17 year cicadas every year?</p>		</li>

			<p>Awesome map!<br><br>My hometown is not on it, as they're in southeast Ohio across from West Virginia, but they're in-sync with region V, which it looks like if the pattern continues off the given map area, should be correct for them.  I remember being surprised when I was teenager and went a southwest into south Central Ohio that there were no more cicadas.<br><br>There are so many trees in that region and the number of cicadas in 1999 was unbelievable.  The air literally pulsed outside, and you could still hear it inside, too from dawn until dusk.  I really learned what a 'plague of locusts' looks like.<br><br>I think my family is trying to make plans to be away all next summer already..</p>		</li>

			<p>I remember the 1999 locust season in Athens. It was like no other. I used to cut the grass in the large fields and prairies in Stroud's Run State Park. I was riding my tractor while thousands would be attracted to the noise/vibration of the machine and would land on me and mate. I looked like one of those people completely covered in bees but instead, I was just a walking cicada orgy. Shooing them away was futile so I just accepted it and kept mowing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh my gosh, I had forgotten that aspect of it.  Yes, they were attracted to lawnmowers and to cars too.  I remember the back roads would literally make popping sounds because you were driving over so many cicadas.  I can't imagine mowing on the Park scale with them.<br><br>The only plus that came from that mess was that the birds were so busy eating the cicadas that the small flowering tree in the front yard finally bore fruit that wasn't immediately eaten - and it turned out to be a cherry tree.<br><br>Edit:  I feel them crawling just after reading all this.</p>		</li>

			<p>They ones you are hearing now are most likely annual cicadas. They are green and white and don't fly nearly as much as the 13/17 year ones, which are black and orange. <br><br>We know that the magicicada do get out of sync as different locations have them emerge at different years. For instance in 2010 I traveled to Nashville, where they were everywhere. In 2016 they are expected to come out in the western Pennsylvania area. <br><br>Edit for spelling</p>		</li>

			<p>It really bothers me when the word &quot;strategy&quot; is used to describe events in evolution. It perpetuates the myth that evolution has a &quot;goal,&quot; or, worse, brings to mind ideas of an intelligent designer. I wish I knew enough about Wikipedia editing to make that note or replace the word, but I have a feeling since they're quoting another source I have no basis to change it.<br><br>Edit: I feel that all the replies I've gotten make the mistake of ignoring how someone who doesn't understand evolution is affected by the terminology. I know all of you get natural selection, but the bay majority of people don't. My mom is a fairly intelligent person and she thinks giraffes have long necks because they streeeeetched up really high to eat leaves. She's the kind of person whose understanding is negatively impact by the use of the word &quot;strategy,&quot; for example.</p>		</li>

			<p>The way I see it, strategy still exists regardless of whether anyone is playing the game. So if a particular system that would prove useful to a species is eventually used by a species, it doesn't really indicate weird usage of evolutionary events or implied intelligent design.<br><br>Furthermore, a lot of strategies (by how many people use the term colloquially at least) are more of a set of heuristics rather than fully-planned, intelligent strategies.</p>		</li>

			<p>I respectfully disagree. Strategy is a means to an end. It completely flips the process of evolution on it's head.<br><br>In evolution, stuff happens. Stuff happens for no reason.

			<p>When you reference strategy as it applies to evolution you are generally talking about game theory not military theory. Strategy in game theory is a set of heuristics as was said above. Moreover there are different types of strategies in game theory any of which could apply to a given evolutionary strategy. Check out some literature on Evolutionarily Stable Strategies.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I respectfully disagree. Strategy is a means to an end. It completely flips the process of evolution on it's head.<br><br>I understand your argument. You are right that using words like 'strategy' that imply planning can be misleading. But aside from the intentional design connotation that goes with it, 'strategy' is a word that is a good fit for what we see. <br><br>Can you suggest a better word that has a similar meaning but that does not imply intention or planning?

An expert looks on and sees that he, by chance, it's employing the &quot;flugenhoffer strategy&quot; (this is where it becomes obvious I don't know any chess strategy).

			<p>Don't get thrown by the terminology - we use the term 'strategy' as if genes and organisms had some intentionality.  Nobody thinks they do, but they 'act' like they do.  As long as you don't get confused by the term it's a very useful shorthand for framing what happens.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes.  A small portion of cicadas will come out +- 1 year and potentially grow to create a second swarm.  Predation pressure will often ensure that not too many broods are active at the same time.  If circumstances cause the main brood to be eradicated, then these off-cycle ones will carry on the torch.</p>		</li>
