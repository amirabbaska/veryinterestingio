			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, Wikipedia says there some thousands of species of cicadas, but I had trouble finding information about cicadas on the east coast other than 13/17 year species. It answers half of my question though - the one I'm hearing outside are possibly a different species than the 13/17 year cicada. </p>
<p>But the second part of my question - do cicadas with multi-year life cycles ever come out of sync with each other (perhaps due to internal clocks getting fucked up due to weird weather patterns?), and is this a mechanism for cicadas to speciate? Are there <em>some</em> 13/17 year cicadas every year?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago</p>

<p>In general these are geographically divided - each has its own range. You haven't said where you are, but <a href="http://www.cicadas.info/new_body_2013.jpg" target="_blank">here's a map</a> of Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. EDIT: <a href="http://entomology.osu.edu/~bugdoc/PerioCicada/CicadaImages/CICOHIOCsm.gif" target="_blank">And Ohio.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome map!</p>
<p>My hometown is not on it, as they're in southeast Ohio across from West Virginia, but they're in-sync with region V, which it looks like if the pattern continues off the given map area, should be correct for them.  I remember being surprised when I was teenager and went a southwest into south Central Ohio that there were no more cicadas.</p>
<p>There are so many trees in that region and the number of cicadas in 1999 was unbelievable.  The air literally pulsed outside, and you could still hear it inside, too from dawn until dusk.  I really learned what a 'plague of locusts' looks like.</p>
<p>I think my family is trying to make plans to be away all next summer already..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting that this is a partial map of the broods and importantly exludes the 2 broods (IV, XXIII) that are active this year.</p>
<p>Can't find a map of them all with their years, but <a href="http://magicicada.org/about/brood_pages/broods.php" target="_blank">here</a> is a list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They ones you are hearing now are most likely annual cicadas. They are green and white and don't fly nearly as much as the 13/17 year ones, which are black and orange. </p>
<p>We know that the magicicada do get out of sync as different locations have them emerge at different years. For instance in 2010 I traveled to Nashville, where they were everywhere. In 2016 they are expected to come out in the western Pennsylvania area. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn... I've never heard if this 13/17 year old cicada thing, guess I'm not old enough. What years are next? How is that it is so strictly set to reproduce only after that many years?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting... I've been seeing cicadas for decades now and they've always been the green and white kind.  I don't think I ever recall seeing a black and orange one.  Is it possible that I live in an area that only gets the annual variety?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  A small portion of cicadas will come out +- 1 year and potentially grow to create a second swarm.  Predation pressure will often ensure that not too many broods are active at the same time.  If circumstances cause the main brood to be eradicated, then these off-cycle ones will carry on the torch.</p></div>		</li>
