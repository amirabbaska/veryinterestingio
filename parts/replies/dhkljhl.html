			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! Many rumors or theories exist, such as &quot;I can feel it in my bones.&quot; And they're not exactly wrong, either. </p>
<p>Imagine the tissues and sinews in your body are like a memory foam pillow, and imagine someone laying on the pillow is the atmosphere. With relative higher pressure, more force is exerted (when you lay down, it compresses the foam). When the barometric pressure drops and becomes relatively lower, the pressure exerted becomes less (like when you sit up, and the foam begins to decompress/expand). </p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that it's somewhat counterintuitive: instead of higher pressure causing pressure or pain, it actually helps keep tendons and tissues more...compressed, so to say. When the pressure drops, they expand and can cause pressure to be exerted on nerves and joints. </p>
<p>On a related note, when it comes to sinus pressure then a drop in pressure followed by a rise in pressure will cause sinus pain (or worse). When the pressure drops, things expand; when it starts rising again, that exerts a lot of pressure on your sinuses. For anyone who has ever started to feel sick before catching a flight and then upon landing your sinuses hurt really bad or your inner ear feels blocked and painful (won't equalize), this is what you're experiencing. </p>
<p>So yeah, a drop in pressure is detrimental to some conditions and a rise in pressure is detrimental to others. </p></div>		</li>
