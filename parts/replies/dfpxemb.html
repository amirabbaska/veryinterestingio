			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how this relates to the question. Sure, those factor in to matching your speed to the wind, but the question as I read it is assuming that's already accomplished. Are you suggesting that tyre/road interaction affects the wind <em>that you're feeling from the car window</em> beyond having an effect on your speed? If so, I'd be interested to know what you mean specifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is going to be some ground effect from the tires, wheels, the shape of the car, and the road surface that causes turbulent flow around the car, so the air won't be moving at exactly 25 mph everywhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. The ground effect does like to mess things up wherever possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about tires, but I would think for OP to feel nothing from the window, the car in question would have to be a hypothetical car that is aerodynamically perfect. In the case of a real-world car on a real-world road, the car's shape would still disturb the air I would think. Not to mention other objects along the road. That's just a layman's guess though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically what I was thinking - which is why I thought a focus on tyre interactions etc. was odd. Seeing as I'm also just a layperson though, I was wondering if I was missing something about that interaction that might make it more significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I add that because I'm an engineer and don't work in perfect physics land. </p>
<p>The tires are not stationary with respect to the car and air frame of reference, they are spinning.  They spin 25mph backwards as they sweep across the road, which is now 25mph into the wind. This would drag air back and kick it up to where passengers can feel it. It would not be significant, but it would be there. </p>
<p>Same with the road, it is not stationary in that frame of reference and may produced interactions. Any bumps or obstacles would slow and disturb our perfect 25mph wind, which the passengers would feel as a airflow in the backwards direction.</p>
<p>So in perfect physics land, they will feel no airflow. In the real world they will feel modest airflow from disturbing factors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get where you're coming from, I'm just not convinced that any of these factors add up to something that could actually be felt at the height of the window - especially considering the car is travelling away from where the disturbance is being caused continuously so it shouldn't be able to add up to much. I'm not saying it's wrong by any stretch, I just think it confuses the issue more than answers the original question, especially without additional context - which I think it's good you've added in this message.</p></div>		</li>
