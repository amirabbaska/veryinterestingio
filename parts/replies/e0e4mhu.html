			<div class="markdown"><p>The top surface of the coffee is where it is in contact with air. Coffee is a combination of solid particles and water.</p>
<p>Wherever water is exposed to air it'll evaporate, faster if it's hot. Hot coffee when left sitting will evaporate at the top surface only. Water is removed, solids stay. The remaining solids stick to the coffee cup, leaving a ring and staining the cup</p></div>		</li>

All those obese old guys have so much free cholesterol floating around in their systems that they actually grunt out greasy loads into your fartbox and that's why when you go to fingerblast your shitter you end up with oily hands. That's flavor country. </p></div>		</li>
