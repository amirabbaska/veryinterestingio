			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this relative to anxiety while eating? Recently I've been experiencing &quot;choking&quot; on my food. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or actual choking but almost every time I eat, the food feels wedged in my throat and I feel like I can't breathe. The only way to overcome it is to drink A LOT of water after every bite and take small bites. It's super weird and just started happening over the past couple weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, it can be psychosomatic for sure but sounds like you should have it checked out because there are any number of things it <em>could</em> be. I wont diagnose you over the internet, sorry haha. </p>
<p>other possibiities include med side effect, strictures, diverticuli, nerve/muscle issues, general dysmotility, reflux/hiatal hernias and as always with just about everything, neoplasm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I don't chew my food very well it gets stuck in my throat. It actually gets stuck enough that if I try to swallow some water while it's there the water will get stuck on top of it and I end up coughing it back up. I've had this happen my whole life pretty much. Do you ever see people with this issue? Is it possible I just have a thin esophagus? I'm curious because unlike the guy above me, I have to drink very small amounts of water to help the food go down because a normal gulp will overflow back up into my mouth and not go down since it can't get past the food lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a late reply, and I'm not sure if this was mentioned before, but I have been diagnosed with EOE which is exactly this. Eosinophilic Esophagitis is a disorder that basically means you have either a small/inflamed esophagus, or a stricture in your esophagus. Either way, it's a newly (last 20 years or so) found disorder. It is treatable as I am part of a 3rd round medical trial. Things are going much better for me now. </p>
<p>The only way to be properly diagnosed is to do an endoscopy and have biopsies tested for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this problem pretty much my entire life. Happened most frequently eating rice, beef, or pasta. Drinking a lot of water would either painfully push it down, or make me throw up with enough force to also get the food out. I've recently got it to almost stop altogether by cutting out sodas completely, and by drinking milk or eating ice cream at night. So in my case it definitely seems acid reflux related. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this too. I eventually got it checked out and was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. They had me take ppis for a while, which is an easy fix for some people because it can be caused by acid reflux. Then I tried avoiding common allergen foods, wheat, dairy, eggs etc. These are the cause around 15-20% of the time. Didn't work for me either. A few years later and it's gotten worse. They checked me out with a second egd, and prescribed ppis and a fluticasone inhaler. Instead of inhaling it you swallow the mist so the steroids coat your esophagus. I noticed it getting better starting three days in. I'm supposed to take it for 6-8 weeks then I'll probably be fine for a few years.
Apparently this is a new disease, which is super common these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this issue for years, and actually started avoiding whatever foods I noticed it happened with the most (for me, pasta, beef, steak and heavy sauces). It still happens every few meals. I&quot;ll have to try the milk/ice cream combo to see if it helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this damage the lower part of the esophagus at all? If the pill is in the lower esophagus will it start to dissolve there?</p></div>		</li>
