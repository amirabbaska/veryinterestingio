<p>I can cook healthy &amp; delicious food, but boy is it not fun. Not as fun as a pizza or a few donuts anyway. Hedonic hunger is torture, and that pleasure response from eating sets the standard for fun so damn high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get used to being hungry and try to find out the difference of being hungry and wanting food. If I'm not hungry enough to actually eat any of the stuff I got at home, I might just as well wait some more time. It gets easier to tolerate the inconvenient craving for food and eat when you actually need to.</p>
<p>Got my ex to change from stuffing herself all day long and being pissed when 'hungry' to skipping meals if she didn't actually need to eat anything. Took several years, but once it clicked she lost weight and felt better.</p>
<p>That's just my opinion on that matter. Listen to your body, deny your greedy mind unnecessary food and, once it's time, stuff your filthy feed-hole with whatever you want. Hunger gets much easier over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, this is impossible for me. I can stand being hungry, it sucks but I can. The thing is that, for me, it's just as hard every time, it doesn't get any easier over time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its this mentality that both tortures and comforts me when im hungry. Im glad to hear it reduces over the years though, im definitely willing to play the long game when it comes to dietary decisions if it means i gain more control over my body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I only ate when I was hungry I'd be in trouble. O need way more calories than I hunger for. This really depends a lot on your activity level and how often you happen to feel hungry. I can go a couple days without feeling hungry, but my tdee is close to 3000 calories. Then on day 3 I still don't feel hungry but I get light headed and can't do a lot of stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this but I enjoy the cooking and experimenting aspect. But also the reality is if you want to eat something “unhealthy” it won’t make you fat. Like let’s say you’re craving pizza, rather make/order an entire pizza just order a slice. Personally I love candy cookies etc but I know if I buy a large amount I’ll just binge them so instead I just allow myself the snickers bar at the checkout satisfy the cravings and move don’t bring a bunch of bad food home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to crave bad things often. Then I started binge eating them often. Then I became disgusted. So disgusted that now the things I once craved give me a disgusted feeling just looking at them. </p></div>		</li>
