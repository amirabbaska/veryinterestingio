			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh franklin mint....I hate them so much, I buy and sell coins for a living and you won't believe how many people I've had who get upset with me because they got scammed by them. </p>
<p>A example: people bought gold coin replicas of rare gold coins with a &quot;certificate&quot; on the certificate it says &quot;this original rare coin is now worth €34000&quot; with a description of the original coin on the left like you see in the coin catalogue. Then on the right of the paper is a description of the actual coin but in plain text if you read carefully it says the replica is made of a lower gold content and has less weight and it is then implied that since the original is worth so much these replicas will also increase in value over time. </p>
<p>But the poor saps buy these coins for ridiculous prices and then are surprised they lost money on their &quot;investment&quot; 20 years later</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got this great idea 
Why don't we pitch it to the Franklin Fucking Mint 
Fine pewter portraits of 
General apathy and major boredom singing
Whatever and ever Amen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of them are legal tender... in Liberia. The deception of this is that it allows them to market them as &quot;100% Legal Tender&quot; and sell the coins for what appears to be face value (discounting the exchange rate) so they're selling a coin with the face value of $10 (Liberian) for $10 (USD) so people think they're getting a good deal despite the exchange value only being about 8.5 cents (USD).</p></div>		</li>
