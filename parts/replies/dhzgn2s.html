<p>Also one more question that maybe you won't have an answer to, but... We domesticated pigs, but nobody drinks pig milk. Why not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good questions!</p>
<p>Sheep, goat, and cow were all domesticated around the Fertile Crescent, so it's likely that we started drinking their milk in the same place and around roughly the same time, with sheep and goats first.</p>
<p>Yak and camel (and reindeer, for that matter) live elsewhere, so logic would suggest they were separate, but it's possible that our consumption of their milk was catalyzed to some degree by the introduction of goats or sheep (which were already being milked) to their areas.</p>
<p>Pigs don't like being milked: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2011/02/why-dont-we-drink-pigs-milk.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/food/2011/02/why-dont-we-drink-pigs-milk.shtml</a></p>
<p>If you want to learn about milk, buy &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; by Harold McGee. Here's a fascinating chart about milk nutrients from the milk chapter. WHALE MILK! <a href="http://imgur.com/a/insJR" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/insJR</a></p></div>		</li>
