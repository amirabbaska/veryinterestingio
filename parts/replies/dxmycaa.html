			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously try this.</p>
<p>I used to have horrible sores, 4-8 per month and they would last at least a week each. After trying everything else out there I finally switched to a non-sodium-laural-sulfate toothpaste. Sensodine in my case (read the ingredients though, several Sensodine brands still have SLS in them)</p>
<p>Exact same diet, I changed nothing else, and now I get 1 every 4-6 months at most. It's been a huge relief.</p>
<p>SLS is in almost every brand of toothpaste, I would brush 4-5 times a day when I had sores because it would soothe them for a bit but in reality it just made the situation much worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sensodyne works for me. I'll still get them if I bite my cheek, get sick, or eat something sharp/very acidic, but my toothpaste was definitely aggravating and preventing them from healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bunch.  Sensidyne is widely available.  Botanically Bright from Tom's( but not the other Tom's lines).  Now have something called Kiss My Face lol.  Got it from whole foods.  Just check ingredients!!  Good luck</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if my toothpaste is SLS free.  I used to get these sores all the time, it was awful, but for 10 years or so I have rarely had one and when they happen, typically from an injury, they go away quicker.  Some time ago I switched to Crest Pro Health, I can't recall when and don't know if it was related, but this could make sense.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly.  I have never checked that brand out.  But yeah, I'm the same now.  If I bite my gums, I know one will come.  Annoying as fuck!!</p></div>		</li>
