			<div class="markdown"><p>God I wish more people knew this!! My cousin is a physical therapist &amp; says it is the biggest lie that women refuse to let go of when explains you cannot &quot;Target the belly bloat&quot; away with certain foods or work outs. That's not how weight loss works. You can tone different muscles but that's not how losing weight works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Supposedly there’s some probiotic or something in it that actually is decent for you, but I haven’t seen a whole lot of evidence to support drinking the stuff, since it’s so alkaline, but that doesn’t stop my mom from drinking it anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planking will certainly reduce the APPEARANCE of belly fat. By developing the muscle that holds the belly in you will develop better posture and a flatter abdomen. It will still be covered in fat, but less bloat behind the fat looks better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weighted abdominal workouts can deepen the ridges of the muscle by growing outward. This can help with the appearance of belly fat as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, bloating isn’t from fat though. It’s a combination of inflammation, water retention, gas, and constipation that makes your stomach protrude. Certain foods can cause bloating in some people, so it stands to reason that changing one’s diet to exclude those foods can help with this condition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget abs. Weak abdominal muscles, paired with the issues you mentioned, give that huge beer belly look, even if there isn't a huge amount of abdominal fat. Strengthen the core and fix the posture, and that gut won't be spilling all over the place any more.</p>
<p>It's also good for the back. The more your muscles hold you upright, the less pressure on your spine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was using the phrase more colloquially like you see in a million &quot;womens&quot; magazines. You know the ones that have big headlines about losing 15 pounds of &quot;belly bloat in a week&quot; but also have a picture of a 5 layer chocolate cake that says &quot;our most decadent recipe yet&quot; on the cover. Usually the &quot;weight loss trick&quot; is a seriously unhealthy crash diet, endorsed by a shady &quot;nutritional consultant&quot; and involves eating less than 800 kcals a day.</p>
<p>What I was trying to convey is that if you are like me &amp; millions of other women &amp; carry weight in your tummy and hips, doing crunches might help strengthen your core and you can tone muscles but fat loss can not at all be targeted. Scientific studies have proven time &amp; time again that working out one area does not necessarily mean you will lose fat in that area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone fasting to lose weight currently I can confirm this aspect of &quot;first in last out&quot;. I have lost far more inches off my waist line than I have my hips and thighs. Even at my fattest I never had a beer belly of sorts, rather just pudge, while my thighs and buttocks have always been noticeably larger comparatively. It's annoying but it's how it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I&quot;d be happy.  I gained 30 pounds after birth and 90% of that went to my belly.  I looked like Humpty-Dumptey. Slim legs and butt but zero hip to waist ratio and my belly made my boobs disappear, as it was two times larger.  I was so jealous for my friend,  that had more of that typical butt and leg fat and was more feminine pear shaped. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's any consolation, I'm a guy and am just as unlucky as you when it comes to body fat distribution, we're just the opposites in this bad joke we call genetics. The good news is we are at least in control of <em>how much</em> body fat is on us, so we can keep strong until it's all gone.</p></div>		</li>
