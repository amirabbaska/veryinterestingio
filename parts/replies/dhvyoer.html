			<div class="markdown"><p>As an engineering student myself, I've never heard of this phenomenon. Can you explain more broadly or provide a link? I'm interested but I don't see any other references to this from anyone else or on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shower-curtain_effect" target="_blank">&quot;Shower-curtain effect&quot; Wikipedia page</a> that others have linked.</p></div>		</li>
