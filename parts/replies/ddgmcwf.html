			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I also live in the Portland area (Beaverton specifically). I've heard that our area tends to have more Internet issues than most. I know I lose connection for ~20sec several times a night (Comcast). Is there an infrastructure reason for this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Beaverton myself and have Comcast because Frontier is a clusterfuck, stephouse or century link isn't available on the west side. I can recall maybe 1 time in 3 years that comcast has gone dark in the area.   I would venture a guess you are using wifi, and if so, its just configured the same as everyone else on Comcast.</p>
<p>That said, the all in one &quot;modems&quot; they provide aren't very good and usually only support wifi 2.4ghz bands. You'll be better off buying a higher end Motorola/Arris surfboard modem and a decent 802.11ac router that supports 2.4 and 5ghz bands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always <em>heard</em> about people having problems with Comcast in the Portland area, but in more than 10 years I think I've had 2 problems total and one was because my cats like to chew wires. Sorry for your problems, if I were you I would call Comcast explain either they fix it, or you leave. They may not only fix it, but also offer you a cheaper <del>package</del> rate to keep you around. Last year I told them I was going to switch to Century link because they offered better service (Upload/Download rates) not only did they increase my speed they also lowered my bill. Win/Win!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could threaten that, but in my building Century Link only provides speeds up to 3Mbps down. So I think Comcast knows I'm stuck with them. </p>
<p>I have to call and sit through customer support every few months just because they keep sneaking my bill up by $5 to $10. It's unbelievable how blatantly horrible they are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had them bring 2 guys out already. They just say &quot;well I have internet this instance, so clearly there is no problem&quot; without making the connection that the problem is with it cutting out randomly (though my speeds are also significantly lower than advertised). </p>
<p>I'll try the &quot;I'm leaving&quot; call then. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually work for Comcast in Portland. I second the person who says to call them. There is most likely something wrong within 200 ft of your router, and they will fix it for free. </p>
<p>There's this idea that you should pay for more speed than you need, so you can get what you want with Comcast, but the truth is that idea is several years old, for the reasons listed in the parent comment. I've actually never left a customer with less than 20 Mbps over what they're paying for. The truth is, Portland actually has the best internet in the country. We're the flagship city for Comcast. They try all their new ideas here first, and they pay attention to the quality here the most. Largely, this is because we're so temperate maintenance is easier, part is just random luck.</p>
<p>Anyways, reasons this can happen include; flux due to excess wire wraps, squirrel chewing on the cable, water in the cable, old cable that has frozen and unfrozen too much, bad cable fittings letting excess radio signal onto system, too many outlets connected for proper signal strength, etc. Point is, all those things are eminently fixable. So, if you don't call them, the only person to blame for your bad internet, is yourself. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am guessing the US military has a pretty good idea of every ship or submarine that may be capable of doing that as soon as it gets in the ocean. It sees like if you have the means you need to be really big like a state, and no state would risk a clear act of war like that. </p>
<p>I am also guessing there are satellite links that while slower are also a nice backup for very important applications. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Speaking of that, I wonder where the cables make landfall on the Oregon and California coast. I'd love to see that </p></div>		</li>
