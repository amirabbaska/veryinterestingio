			<div class="markdown"><p>he's basically describing wind chill.   If you have moving air it can take heat away faster. By shaking the can you constantly expose the outside to material inside that isn't warmed up so it can remove heat faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>heat transfer is the class you'll be taking that in, it's a much more direct handling of the material compared to fluid and thermo. much more fun too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only happens if you release the pressure, and it is essentially the reverse of the process to pressurize the can. Pressurizing heats it up, depressurizing cools it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Iâ€™ve been wondering, when handling fridges, AC systems in houses and cars, we need to get these systems professionally evacuated before working on them because spillage is bad for the enviroment. </p>
<p>In the meantime, this IT guy is using one can after another filled with the exact same substance and just releasing this stuff into the air. </p>
<p>Why is this allowed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of them are pretty much just butane. I was surprised to read the label of canned &quot;air&quot; and discover that, given that it makes for some serious fire risks for those that don't read the can (which is forgivable for something as simple to use as (what you think is) compressed air).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, any gas compressed to liquid and put into a can will get very cold when you release some of the gas.</p>
<p>This is either due to latent heat loss from the phase change (liquid --&gt; gas) or (as I learned today) from the gas being released from a solution.</p>
<p>As a result, if you try to empty a 'canned air' (which is apparently not even air) you will end up with frost on the outside of the can once you put it down, unless you were holding it at the bottom and you now have cold hands.</p></div>		</li>
