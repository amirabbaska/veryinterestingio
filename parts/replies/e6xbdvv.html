			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The blurriness youâ€™re referring to might just be that you are so used to seeing 29 frames per second, that seeing 25 frames per second would come across as blurry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PAL content that we generally see here in the states has been converted to NTSC so that it can be broadcast over our NTSC systems. The blurriness comes from converting those 25 pictures per second into 29.97  pictures.</p>
<p>If you watch PAL content in its native 25fps format (such as from a PAL DVD using PAL compatible equipment) you will not get that blurry effect.</p></div>		</li>
