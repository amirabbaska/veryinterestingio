			<div class="markdown"><p>An obvious solution is to simply hike the eligibility age, but there is a big problem with this: poor Americans, who need SS the most, have not seen the same lifespan gains as wealthier Americans, <em>and</em> they are more likely to be in poor health and unable to work later in life. So uniformly raising the age from, say, 65 to 70 would screw over a lot of people who don't have a good alternative.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It also has to be a fairly big hike. I don't have the numbers off hand, but hiking it from say, 65 to 67 didn't produce very impressive savings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what has happened. The government has invested that money into other projects. Letting the government borrow money from the social security trust fund is a sensible solution as it allows the fund to make interest with a very low risk of defaulting. Saying the government spent the money is like saying that Chase spent the money that's in my bank account. </p>
<p>Also, the issue is not really draining the trust fund. The issue is that the money going into the fund is less than the money coming out. That problem has nothing to do with congressional mismanagement, it's just the simple consequence of what happens when you have more old people receiving benefits and less young people to be taxed to pay them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More money coming out of the trust fund than is going in isn't a problem, either. That was by design. There was no SSA trust fund until about 1983. It only exists because the baby boomers are all retiring now. They projected that the post-boom generation wouldn't be able to pay for the boomers without giving up a third of their paychecks. They increased the payroll tax, and I believe they  tweaked the cost-of-living adjustments to cut payouts long-term without directly cutting current benefits. The extra collections built up the trust fund, which would start to dwindle as boomers retired. Any hysteria about Social Security going broke is due to demagoguery and ignorance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Social Security Trust Fund goes into Treasury Bonds because they are considered a very safe investment. It is the money from those bonds that the government spends.</p>
<p>The Trust Fund is still there in a filing cabinet at the SSA.</p>
<p>The trick is that very soon if not already the SSA is going to have to start cashing in those bonds. Since we run a structural deficit we won't have the money to pay them for the bonds. We will either have to print more money or issue more bonds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're a safe investment for everyone who isn't the government, but for our government, they're not really an investment at all (they only mean savings if you trust that the government will eventually shift away from spending to repay them when the fund needs money back from the government).  </p></div>		</li>
