			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is correct. And pennate muscles allow muscles to perform at their optimum on the length tension curve. Also <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/105/5/1745.full" target="_blank">variable gearing</a> means that as pennate muscles contract they rotate in accordance with the load. And the more they rotate, the less force they produce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a mechanical engineering student and I'm trying to understand that in relation to a machine. </p>
<p>Can the muscles that change angles (if im understanding that correctly) be compared to a pulley system that is increasing the amount of torque your muscles can exert?</p>
<p>Also are the CS areas your referencing determining the force that can be applied (I.e. Bigger muscle automatically means more force) or are you referencing basically the UTS of the muscle before it tears? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quads are like a feather, with the little hair things being the muscle fibers. When the muscle contracts the whole feather shortens, but really each hair is shortening at an angle. It's basically a tradeoff between maximal force (greater with pennate muscles because you can fit so much more cross sectional area in) versus maximum shortening velocity (greater in non-pennate muscles like the biceps). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where the square-cube law comes into play with the design of animals. </p>
<p>As size increases, mass (dependent on volume) increases at cubic (X^3 ) rate and muscle strength (dependent on muscle CSA) increases at a square (X^2 ) rate. This is why elephants have such enormous bone mass when compared to say, a horse. If you shrunk an elephant down to the size of a horse, it's bones would be much larger than the horses. And if you enlarged a horse to the size of an elephant, it would collapse under its own weight. Its also why the largest animals are all waterborne, where it is much easier to deal with the mass.</p>
<p>For these reasons you should always choose to fight the horse-sized duck, since its skeletal and muscle frame would be insufficient to support its mass, and it would collapse. Twenty horse sized ducks, on the other hand, would be an overwhelming foe.</p></div>		</li>
