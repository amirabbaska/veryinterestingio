			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm amazed that &quot;mouth movement&quot; wasn't one of the first things they hit on in years of speech therapy. I had a similar problem growing up (incapable of pronouncing &quot;r&quot;), and I was given speech therapy at school in third and fourth grade. One of the first things they did was show how to pronounce &quot;r&quot; with an emphasis on lips/tongue movement, which ended up helping me and solving the problem completely.</p>
<p>I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that there's such a gulf in the quality of speech therapy available. Or perhaps your SO is older then I, and lips/mouth movement emphasis wasn't part of the package? Either way, very interesting, and thank you for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's in his late 20s now, and apparently no one had ever taught him specifically how to move his mouth to pronounce Rs and Ls until I did. He got years of speech therapy, too. Seems a bit ridiculous to me, because as far as I can tell whatever caused his speech issues in the first place had gone away completely, he'd just built up the habit of saying those two letters that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well shit, I'm in my late 20s now, so who knows. In my case, it was just a bad habit - if there was some physiological or neurological reason behind it, it was definitely gone by the time I was in third grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i also had problems to pronounce &quot;R&quot; in my first school year. i had some extra lessons with a trained teacher for that kind of stuff and within a few weeks the problem was gone.</p>
<p>i dont think something special caused this, i just had to learn it probably..</p></div>		</li>
