			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Folks often use spreadsheets as a generic &quot;table editor&quot;, but that's not really what they're designed for. A spreadsheet is really a <em>very weird programming language</em> for doing numeric calculations.</p>
<p>If you want to create a generic table layout for putting text into, you're probably better off using something like Google Docs and inserting a table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>J use the hell out of Excel because although my sheets are largely text, I almost always need to perform numerical calculations or pull from a database.  This,  limiting input through pick lists, automatic highlights, an the ability to keep a layout consistent by NOT wrapping text leads me to almost exclusively use it over word oriented programs. </p></div>		</li>
