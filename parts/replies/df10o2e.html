			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind it wasn't until the mid 1800s that Semmelweis suggested physicians should be washing their hands before operating on or working with patients. Of course, it was even longer until this actually became a common practice among medical professionals.</p>
<p>It's an interesting story though: he noticed that the infant mortality rates were much higher when it was doctors giving birth compared to the rates when it was midwives giving birth. From there he hypothesized the higher mortality rates were from the doctors coming in to facilitate births straight from working with cadavers, without washing their hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even about the bacteria or possible infection/illness. What about the <em>SMELL</em>? Rinsing poo off your hand would only help a little bit. You really have to scrub to get rid of poo smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In India and Nepal and other rural Asian places I visited it goes like this. </p>
<p>Next to the hole there is a bucket. In the bucket is a ladle dipper thing. And there is also a tap in the bucket for rinsing with after. </p>
<p>I think one is supposed to kinda splash there bum, then wash with the tap the hand used. </p>
<p>Some places didn't have the ladle and your lefty was the tool. </p>
<p>Makes the pink balloon knot fresher than just rubbing it with paper</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just rural .often in workplaces with a lot of indians you'll see a cup in the bathroom, that's what it's for.  Most bathrooms I've seen won't have toilet paper unless lots of westerners come often. Bidets are everywhere </p></div>		</li>

<p>If anyone is ever forced to make soap: if your soap comes out caustic just add more of the fat that you used to make the soap in the first place. Problem solved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In my region of the world it was corn cobs, specifically red ones and white ones. First you used the red, then you used the white to see if you needed another red.</p></div>		</li>
