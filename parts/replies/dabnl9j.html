			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer.</p>
<p>It is the only one that gets at the core of question being asked. The question seems to indirectly be asking about it in a biological/evolutionary reason with its use of the word &quot;naturally.&quot;</p>
<p>So, it is that our body doesn't naturally consider anything lazy. Everything we do (even when sleeping we dream!), our mind is working.</p>
<p>The difference is that &quot;lazy&quot; activities are more immediate satisfaction.</p>
<p>Now... you could continue the question though. Why would our body reward us so heavily for such immediate satisfaction?</p>
<p>Let us take the same analogy at the end: lazy activities are like simple carbohydrates (I.e. sugar).</p>
<p>The reason we overeat sugar so easily is because before technology allowed it, it was difficult to attain this so our body rewarded us for it.</p>
<p>Is it the same for mental activities?</p>
<p>What was different about our standard mental use before technology? </p>
<p>Is the standard &quot;productive&quot; (i.e. not lazy) mental use something unique in recent human history?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder too, though I'm not sure whether we're wondering the same thing.</p>
<p>I know it's hard for me and many of my contemporaries to choose mental activities that have more &quot;vitamins&quot; because there are so many attractive alternatives that accomplish less and also help our mental development less.</p>
<p>I suspect every generation for the last few hundred years had many ways to 'goof off' mentally.  I think that the electronic information age has allowed the creation of dopamine dispensers and dopamine farms and very very attractive goof-off choices to a degree unapproached in history.  I wonder if I'm right.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I didn't have TV but I had school libraries and read every genre novel I could get while ignoring homework and chores.  When I was out of those novels, I pursued other, arguably more productive, books (literary fiction or nonfiction) or activities (learning basic programming or going out to play.)  If I'd had the ability to look at effectively infinite stuff on the web?  No idea what I'd have done.  Probably not much.  It blows my mind that I could spend a month without sleep reading comics for free online and never run out.</p>
<p>2000-plus years ago Confucius once said (paraphrased) &quot;look, y'all, don't sit around doing NOTHING.  Even the people playing [irresponsible goof-off] games like go are keeping their brain active, at least.&quot;  Now?  Playing Chess and Go is seen as super head-vitamin pastime.</p>
<p>So I think farther back, before genre fiction and before board games and all the way to Ugg and Ogg (or whatever) doing their hunting and gathering and using their brains to improve their ability to do both.  I wonder how they goofed off?  Maybe by inventing, telling, and listening to stories?</p>
<p>I dunno.</p></div>		</li>
