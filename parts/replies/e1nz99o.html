			<div class="markdown"><p>The alternative to (sometimes) replacing the water pipes is to build new neighborhoods in what was once forest - where you are guaranteed to need to install water pipes! And when you install the new pipes, they have to be longer to reach customers who are further apart.</p>
<p>The result is that low-density suburbs have higher infrastructure costs, both in construction and long-term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes 100% this, our city has pretty much exclusively green field development for this reason! :/ and we also have a huge road repair/transit/etc funding problem because our low density suburbs pay WAY less in property tax than what they’re costing the city. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, makes me appreciate our cities (Minneapolis/St Paul) where nearly every street has at least a 6&quot; water main.</p>
<p>I just wonder how on earth they can expect any growth with such short-sighted plans.  Our entire metro just completed a 20 year plan to upgrade all the water mains through every neighborhood, from galvanized pipe and/or  lead pipe installed back in the late 19th century to 6&quot; minimum on every street.  I know because I had to replace the water main from the street to my house after my galvanized pipe broke and had to pay to tap into the 6&quot; main.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The secret is, they don’t expect growth upwards, and building residential streets with tiny pipes doesn’t prevent growth outwards... just connect every new McMansion suburb to the 5 foot wide super size pipe that runs along a main road, and you’ll never have to worry about growth again! Ha ha :(</p>
<p>I actually used to do designs for water main replacements so it’s cool to hear about the way it’s done in different cities! Galvanized pipe is garbage and we’ve had to replace a ton of it (so so so much) but interestingly some parts of the city actually have WOOD pipes that work just fine. What I was told is that basically any pipe built from the start of WW1 to the end of WW2 is crap, but the older ones were surprisingly well built and some of them are still in great condition today.</p>
<p>6” water mains are tiny, though! It’s been half a decade so don’t quote me on this, but I believe the minimum for a block of apartments with our fire code is 12” or maybe 18”. In some parts of town I recommended 750mm (2.5 ft ish?) pipes! The pipe leading from the street to the house is typically 6” I think.</p></div>		</li>
