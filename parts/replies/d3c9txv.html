			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when making things like pastry you have to knead the dough a bit, but not too much. Once it's wet the gluten proteins in the flour start to bind together and too much kneading makes the dough tough. If you try you mix the ingredients after you add the liquid you have to knead too much for the dough to work properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't even cook and I love Alton Brown. I think he's the Bill Nye of cooking.</p>
<p>The stuff he made always looked great, and I really enjoyed learning <em>why</em> certain things were cooked certain ways and why it mattered. His dramatizations were quirky and funny, but they got things through to me.</p>
<p>I still watch Good Eats from time to time, and I'm always glad to see him on random internet videos. Still very smart, very witty, and totally unafraid of being goofy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alton Brown was in tv production by trade, specifically behind the camera IIRC. He never worked as a professional chef or a restaurant kitchen. I feel like the logic was to put the normal cooking show on its head and have someone skilled in production learn to be the talent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I sit here, stuffing my face with gas station pizza and watching the Auntie Puddin episode of Good Eats. I DVR the episodes that come on the Cooking Channel during the week. Helps me meal plan. My 2 year old loves the yeast sock puppets.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Alton Brown has been one of the most important figures on TV for cooking instruction. Most shows are just &quot;follow this recipe&quot; but Good Eats gives you all the background, science, experiments and myth busting you need to walk away actually understanding everything.</p></div>		</li>
