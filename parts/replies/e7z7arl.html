			<div class="markdown"><p>how did this cesium 133 thing even develop? like when people were inventing the concept of a second did they just say &quot;hey let's use the number of oscillations that occur in cesium 133&quot; ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like &quot;we need a physical constant to define a second! Hey, that isotope acts with incredible consistency. How many times does it do that in a second? Okay, that's the official second now.&quot;</p>
<p>Most units were created before we had such reliable ways to define them based on natural constants. We create the constant definitions so there's no need for an artifact that may change over time to be used as the reference. We're still trying to do that for the kilogram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably a dumb question, but how did they count how many times it oscillated in a second without having the definition for a second? Was it just using the previous standard?</p>
<p>In fact, how was the first second ever defined, it seems like such an arbitrary measurement of time? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the cesium second, does the earth really take 24 hours to rotate once? Or was the definition of the second based on how many ossilations occurred for one earth rotation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve always loved that definition because it’s so incredibly specific, and yet absolutely arbitrary. It’s just what came closest to what we were already using as the definition of 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;When the outermost electron bounces between levels 9,192,631,770 times, the clock ticks one second&quot;</p>
<p>This isn't correct. The way the atomic clock works is that it calibrates a radio wave to the frequency that excites the transition of the electron to the excited state in the caesium atom &quot;the most&quot;. I.e. The atomic clock finds the resonant frequency of the caesium atom for this situation. This frequency is by definition 9192631770 hz. So once the radio wave is calibrated, the clock ticks a second when the radiowave, not the electron, oscillates 9192631770 times.</p></div>		</li>
