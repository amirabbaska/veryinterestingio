			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, I just learned a cool thing, thanks! I presume that's why a bunch of people in Russia died recently because they drank... I think it was hand sanitiser or something? Does ethanol taste the same as isopropanol?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to the taste difference but I remember something my grandfather told me when I was little.  </p>
<p>He was stationed at the Panama Canal during WWII and when I asked if he saw any casualties he said, &quot;Only one.  A buddy of mine kept getting his off-base privileges revoked because he would mess up little things and our CO didn't like him. One day they couldn't find him for guard duty.  We found him in a supply closet passed out with about twelve empty cans of shaving cream next to him.  Seems he hadn't been off base for a few weeks and couldn't go any longer without a drink.  He saw that the shaving cream had alcohol in it.  Damn fool didn't know it wasn't the same thing.  Died that night in the infirmary.&quot;  </p>
<p>I was 6.  I didn't ask him any more questions after that.  Ever.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they died of methanol poisoning not isopropanol. Methanol is still toxic though. My hunch says they would have similar (bitter) taste with some variation. I would definitely recommend against testing this however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, methanol is even more toxic than isopropanol. Can cause blindness with very small doses and is abosorbed through the skin. Pretty dangerous</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that isopropyl alcohol is 2-4 times as powerful in terms of getting drunk than plain ethanol. That's why some shady characters lace normal EtOH drinks with isopropyl and largely get away with it. Too much and it kills people but just a bit makes ethanol go much further, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like most poisons, acetone occurs naturally in the environment, including in the human body. Just in small enough amounts not to have an ill effect.</p>
<p>Another example is many fruit seeds contain cyanide, including apple seeds.</p></div>		</li>
