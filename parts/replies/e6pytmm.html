			<div class="markdown"><p>The names kind of say it all, eh? You seem pretty knowledgeable so I'll ask a follow-up: I heard that the compounds generated in rotting fish are in fact <em>not</em> harmful for humans to eat, just, ya know, unappetizing. Is that true? Rotting shellfish can slay you pretty freakin' fast, so it seems intuitive that putrid fish is also very dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a scientist, but I think it’s likely a gradient. Like drinking dirty water.</p>
<p>You probably won’t die, you might not get sick at all, but it is still an unacceptable risk. </p>
<p>I would guess that almost any dead thing (food) will have some amount of decay and/or bacteria, but we cook most of it out, and the trace amounts left aren’t a significant risk as long as the safety measures we have found to work are used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with rotten food is usually neither the food itself being broken down, nor alive bacteria. But rather toxins that those bacteria produced while alive. Cooking does kill the bacteria, but it doesn't usually destroy the toxins.</p>
<p>If a can for example has expanded, but you cooked the food it's not the C. botulinum that kills you, but rather the botulinum toxin.</p>
<p>That's why you make sure the bacteria never get the chance to start multiplying by keeping the food chain cool, or frozen or dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with all things, the dose makes the poison. Eat buckets and you'll get ill. That's not the problem though. </p>
<p>Our noses are <em>super</em> sensitive to these types of compounds, so there isn't actually all that much present. </p>
<p>Anyway, it's not the putrescene that makes you ill, it's the bacterial infection that's converting amino acids to putrescene. The putrescene is just a marker of the amount of infection. </p>
<p>As an interesting aside, this table is excellent at showing how the shape of compounds affects their smell: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/jameskennedymonash.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/table-of-organic-compounds-and-their-smells-revised-edition/amp/" target="_blank">https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/jameskennedymonash.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/table-of-organic-compounds-and-their-smells-revised-edition/amp/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Note that propane/natural gas (methane) doesn't have a smell. They have to add something stinky to it so you can smell leaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, there is often a significant portion of the population in land-locked areas that don't have access to the freshest fish who prefer that &quot;fishy&quot; smell.  Fresh fish should have a neutral, briney smell and extremely mild flavor. Often times uneducated consumers will want that the smell to know and/or feel like they are eating fish.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point (and happy cake day).  I meant from my experience that consumers uneducated of what the characteristics of higher quality fresh fish are tend to think the &quot;fishy&quot; odor is an indicator of good quality.  I, personally, like my steak well done even though I know that is not typically how to experience a quality piece of beef.... but screw anybody that wants to judge me for it!</p></div>		</li>
