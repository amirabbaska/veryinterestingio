<p>Before aircraft carriers started having angled decks, they could only ever either have planes taking off, or planes landing, but not both at the same time.</p>
<p>Introducing the angled deck allowed planes to be landing on the angled deck, while simultaneously planes could be taking off from the non-angled deck via catapults. That is why often you will see the angled deck being clear (because the carrier has planes in the air), while the non angled part is packed full of planes (because to launch any given plane they just need to take it up to a catapult on the non-angled part).</p></div>		</li>
