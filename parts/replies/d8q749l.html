			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the worst moment of my life... the 1st month! Thinking it might grow louder. Actually, I was the problem... since I was focussing on the noise so much, my brain became really sensitive to the frequency. Gliding my finger over a sheet of paper was pearcing my ear. People talking felt like they were screaming to me. I was not suicidal, but I would have gladly welcomed death at that time... What saved me was to stop seeing this noise as a threat, but a friend... and to manage that, I started having conversation with it before going to sleep. The noise became a very talkative friend to whomI would speak about my day. Eventually, It dropped to the point where I had to really focus to hear it. </p>
<p>Now, 20 years later, stress is the only thing that can make it worst for me, but knowing about it helps me to stop focusing on it. Sleeping with a fan helps and when the noise gets louder because of stress or alcohol, just breath heavily and steadily and focus on the sound of your breathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You literally just described my battle with it haha. 1st month was the worst month of my life. Tinnitus led to stress, stress led to anxiety, anxiety led to depression. </p>

<p>I told my wife the exact same thing, I would never end it all but if I died I wouldn't be sad.</p>
<p>I wore and ear plug for almost 3 months straight just because noises killed my ear I was so hypersensitive to sound.</p>
<p>I also sleep with a fan nightly and it helps when it gets louder haha.</p>
<p>Stress is the same for me, only thing that makes it worse for me, now I just use it as a stress gauge :) Sounds weird but if it all just cleared up I think I might miss it now that I can actually tell when I am over stressed or not getting good sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad you're doing better now ! That shit can make you crazy and it's hard for people w/o it to understand how it affects us. I would fear my bed like the plague... fearing to go to sleep and get an anxiety attack. Man I'm glad it's over  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I had always dreaded getting tinnitus. I suffer quite badly from claustrophobia and the idea of having some permanent ringing in the ears that you couldn't escape from terrified me. </p>
<p>I ended up having to have brain surgery for a tumour, a consequence of which was a went permanently deaf in one ear, but also developed tinnitus in that ear. </p>
<p>It was awful at first, I didn't believe it would ever get better, and being deaf in that ear meant I couldn't even play something to try and  mask it. I was in a constant state of panic, it was like I was trapped in a lift with no possibility of escape. </p>
<p>It has gotten better over time - I still notice it but I can tune it out most of the time. Some days it is worse than others but the fear has gone.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, sounds like you have been through a ton of crap, and here I am complaining about just having tinnitus :) glad to hear the fear is gone, I think that is the big key of getting past it, not fearing it, not dreading it being there all the time, then it gets easier to ignore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, wow.  Reading some random post, and recognized your name.  How's The Culling going?</p>
<p>I've had tinnitus for nearly 20 years now.  When it first happened I saw an ENT doctor, who pretty much said &quot;Sorry, we know of nothing that can cure it.  One of our patients had it so badly, he was willing to try anything, so we surgically removed his inner ear...still had the tinnitus.  That's when we knew it wasn't even originating from the ear.&quot;</p>
<p>Thankfully I live just fine with mine now, and it doesn't bother me.  It would be nice to know &quot;silence&quot; again though.  I know cures are still being researched, because there is a lot of money in it for whoever makes the discovery.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's up man! Yea I live on reddit during the day haha, culling is meh, needs some work for sure. </p>
<p>As far as tinnitus goes yep had mine for about 5 years now, doesn't bother me in the least anymore but my ENT and neurologist both said the same, not much you can do about it. After I got past focusing on it 24/7 it just didn't bug me anymore, I guess the brain kind of phases it out, but man those first few months were a nightmare. I saw this ELI5 and had to comment, I remember scouring forums and the only thing I found that helped was someone posting about how they eventually learned to deal with it and that their life was just as good as it was before they got it. Lot of relief found in that for me.</p></div>		</li>
