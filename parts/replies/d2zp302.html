			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  </p>
<p>As much as I appreciate that reddit is a lot of different people with a lot of different views, there is definitely a heavy scientistic bent and a lot of discomfort with regard to anything that hasn't been proven in a lab or a study.  Additionally, there is a strong sense that luxury goods are aimed at suckers.  Studies (no matter how poorly conducted) which take so-called wine experts and get them to write red wine notes for dyed white wines, or confuse $150 wines for $5 wines when the bottles are switched confirm those biases and bounce merrily around the echo chamber on here.   </p>
<p>There is no question that a great deal of wine enthusiasm is subjective and psychological.  There is no way that the expensive bottle of vintage champagne I had with my girlfriend on valentine's day in a nice hotel would ever have tasted as good alone in my apartment on a rainy Tuesday after work, from a plastic cup, especially if I didn't know what it was and didn't spend 30 minutes deciding on the 'perfect' bottle.  But I don't actually have a problem with that.  Wine is about the memories you create around it and the people you share it with, and if paying more makes something feel more special, all that matters is that I enjoy that moment and hold it in my memory as something that was worth at least what I paid.  </p>
<p>I don't think I know anyone who truly loves wine that thinks <em>only</em> expensive/rare wine is good, and everyone who spends any time looking into it is aware of price inflation that occurs as a result of critic scores, scarcity, trends, etc., so it's not like we're all being duped.  </p>
<p>Perhaps it's just that wine snobs are by-and-large a pretentious lot, and an easy target for college-age kids taking their first steps into independent thought.  Also, it just so happens that we're at a point in history where cheap wine is better than it's ever been, but also much more tuned to consumer tastes. </p>
<p>I suppose that the only way to really understand wine is through exposure, and with the current craft beer revolution, and to a certain extent the third-wave coffee scene, a lot of people are understanding that simple beverages can, with care and attention, become something sublime and worth more time and effort to learn about and enjoy.  Personally, I also believe that the kinds of unique experiences afforded by well-made food and drink are going to become increasingly treasured in a world where everything is easily replicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've long thought that wine scores (especially the problematic 100 point scale) does more harm than good. As I'm sure you've found, learning more about wine seems to be this constant process of realise how little you know about wine. That sounds trite, but... it's just the truth! I've often found myself surprised and concerned by how &quot;wrong&quot; I'd got a wine tasted under work/trade conditions (a few sips from a very long lineup of wines) when I revisited it a few months later and found it drastically different.</p>
<p>I think wine writing would be far better served by embracing the subjectivity that's unavoidable, and ceasing to pretend that it can be reliably scored. That system was very useful in an era when wine was extremely variable, and often really bad. But as you've pointed out, it's a lot harder for consumers to stumble upon shocking bottles today.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, I'm still yet to find any other beverage or food that's as finely attuned to communicating terroir. Beer and whisky can certainly be regional, but that seems to reflect process rather than place in my experience. Tea has been suggested before, but that's beyond my understanding.</p></div>		</li>

I came late to this discussion, proceeded to write an indignant essay in response to the top comment that for some reason maligns sommeliers for no particularly good reason, but didn't scroll far enough. How on earth you're not the top comment I will never know. Thanks for existing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You obviously know a great deal about making wine so let me ask you a question. Doesn't:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) Heavy use of fungicides kills many of the natural yeasts and bacteria on the grapes. This means that getting a reliable fermentation going will require a packaged yeast. A huge number of the flavours that come out of wine depend on the fermentation byproducts, many of which are particular to individual strains of yeast. Compare the difference between wonderbread (made with commercial yeast) and sourdough bread (made with natural, local yeast). Because natural fermentations start slower, you get a whole host of different yeasts and bacteria forming before s. cerevisiae takes over and finishes the job. If you dose commercial yeast (always a strain of s. cerevisiae) right at the beginning, the flavour profile of the wine is noticeably different. In general, commercial yeasts provide a more consistent result and reduce the chances of funny flavours, so pesticide use is not the only reason people would use commercial yeast, but it does make it more likely that you'd need to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>belie your point?</p>
<p>If complexity is derived from the diversity microorganisms that colonize the must, then killing them or attenuating their growth - and then using a monoculture - logically limits complexity. I'm aware it gives more consistent results but, if you've been making wine this way for a while, and it works for you, why change. You could say you taste the lack of pesticides in the wine and you would be justified.</p>
<p>Your example of sourdough bread illustrates this. So do lambic beers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is my point, if I've understood you correctly.  I am saying that the greater need for the use of commercial yeasts brought on by heavy pesticide use <strong>is</strong> one of the ways in which pesticide use <strong>does</strong> manifestly alter the flavour of the wine.  </p>
<p>I am fully behind winemakers using natural yeasts, so long as it's accompanied with the required care and hygiene that preserves complexity without leading to an overabundance of off flavours.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>romantic notions that Mosel Rieslings taste of slate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not a romantic notion, actually. If you try a slate from a Mosel vineyard and then try the wine made there, you will sense a definite flavour of slate in the wine.</p>
<p>Now, I do not think this is caused by roots or literally minerals. There might be other ways for flavour to transfer from stones to grapes. Maybe some stone dust ends up on grapes, maybe some aromatic molecules evaporate and end up on grape skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a huge Riesling fan, and a Chablis fan for that matter.  I definitely get the slate and chalk tasting notes, but I think it's much more a factor of our minds attributing the flavours based on specific cues.  For instance the flinty note that many people get from Loire chenin and also Chablis has been found to be caused by some reduced sulfur compounds.  But damn it if it doesn't taste like flint.  And I'm pretty sure the cat pee in kiwi SB isn't due to some territorial vineyard cats.  The exceptions I can think of are eucalyptus, which does deposit strong aromatic oils on nearby grapes, and garrigue which is possibly blown around the vineyards by the strong Rh√¥ne winds (and again, many of the herbs concerned contain strongly flavoured oils).  </p>
<p>Maybe a bit of slate dust gets in with the grapes, but most rieslings are clarified to some extent before fermentation, so the amount of time in contact with the slate dust would be pretty low even if it did get in.  Also, if there was a significant amount of slate dust around vineyards, I'd expect the winemakers to develop some respiratory problems over the years, given the effects the same stuff has on slate miners.   </p>
<p>Perhaps future studies will shed more light on what accounts for the minerality we perceive in wines, but at the moment most of it seems to be accounted for by a combination of acid and reduction.  </p></div>		</li>
