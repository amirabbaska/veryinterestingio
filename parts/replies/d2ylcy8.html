			<div class="markdown"><p>Older devices had a further gap between tracking,newer devices,they are alot smaller and closer.humidity causes a thin layer of &quot;water&quot; which can short circuit the newer circuits,as they are placed closer together (close tracking, less resistance+humidity = failure) </p>
<p>Eli5 it's not corrosion,but it's closer &quot;tracking&quot; (what I call the 'lines' that carry electricity) that in humid temperaments, tend to gather more moisture due to being in a humid environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are called 'traces'.Electricity leakage between traces is often called 'surface tracking' and can indeed by made worse by humidity or contamination. Especially important for high voltage parts where it might actually arc over and burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I never had a term for that,but now I do.I usually just call it a pain in the arse.haha jk I see it alot in High Frequency starters on TIG welders.high voltage and water (moisture) or iron filings will cause this.add to that Chinese made machines with no resistors to drain capacitors equals a nightmare if you have to drain a cap manually in a tight unit!!lol thanks for the term to use </p></div>		</li>
