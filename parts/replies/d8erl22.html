<p>We were in all a fraternity, he was like 30 still livin the dream in a college town. </p>
<p>After they each give him $700 to order a few hundred of his new brand of t shirts that never went to market, he was arrested with a couple pounds of weed. They still thought the t shirts were coming. They didn't seem any more dumb than you're average person. They probably weren't, to be honest. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I love the &quot;sales&quot; techniques and lingo, which is basically like PUA shit, but for your wallet instead of women. </p>
<p>&quot;This is a stupid product; no one's gonna pay for it - no one's gonna recoup their membership dues.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I'm sorry, Mike: you don't like success? I didn't realise you were happy not being a winner. That's OK, bro, it's cool. I understand that not ever has the stomach to be a true succeeder and seize on opportunities and have the personal strength to make them grow. Not everyone can <em>see the win</em> and take it. Some people just aren't like that. I know, I might sound mean, but really, I'm a great guy. Maybe I'll give you a job cleaning my pool one day, Mikey.&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, Vemma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exact speech was given to me when I called a lady out for tricking me into attending a MaryKay recruitment meeting.  She originally told me she wanted to do my makeup and take pictures for her portfolio, before I know it I'm sitting in a room and she's telling me all the reasons I'm meant to be a MaryKay sales person.  After about 15 minutes I realized she never needed me for her &quot;portfolio&quot; and told her I wasn't interested and didn't appreciate the tricks she used to get me there.  She then went on a rant about how I was scared to reach my full potential and too timid for success. She told me to get used to mediocre living, also something about how I was rejecting my destiny.  Sounded more like a cult than a makeup company.  </p>
<p>Fast forward a few years.. one sleepless night I  had an epiphany and realized she was right and that it was my path in life to be a makeup sales person. Its what I was created to be.  Now I work at a makeup counter inside Dillard's. Never have I been happier or more fulfilled.  Not to mention the $13 an hour im raking in.  </p>
<p>Thanks MaryKay lady who tricked me then insulted me in front of a group of people. You really woke me up to reaching my full potential.</p></div>		</li>

It's all baloney and my dad eventually realized that, not sure how my gf's friend can justify spending hundreds of dollars on oil that smells 90% the same &quot;to sell&quot;, though. She ordered 600 dollars worth of oil about a month ago and hasn't sold any. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't even remember what the scam was, but I had the same experience. It was like reselling through Amazon or something, but it was clearly a pyramid scheme. What really tipped me off is when the guy started to show me pictures of his lavish house and lifestyle and claimed he was looking to put in a <em>helicopter pad</em> at his house. Meanwhile we're basically just sitting in a pie shop in some no-name part of town because the guy &quot;really liked the pie there&quot;. Like, if I were this successful I'm not sure I'd be doing a business presentation at some lame-ass pie shop. Anyway I digress, I finally told him I wasn't really interested in what he was offering and he started to hit me with the hard &quot;so I guess you don't like success then? I guess its not for everybody.&quot; Like the switch in tone really told me this guy was selling snake oil instead of anything legitimate, but it makes me sad to think a lot of people probably fall for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That shit just works on some people. A few buddies and I ended up getting roped into going to one of those meetings when we were like seniors in high school. The rest of us saw through it pretty quick but my one friend just got fucking brainwashed or something. Not only did he not see anything wrong with it, he was super-hyped about it. I can't really remember how that situation ended. I'm sure he wasted some of his $ and then never brought it up again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a couple where a seemingly good prize (like a laptop) is offered for a low price with the caveat that you only get the item after enough extra people have bought it. </p>
<p>They're uncommon because they're so similar to pyramid schemes but they don't work as well. Both pyramid and matrix schemes work best when people aggressively recruit new people to join. A pyramid scheme is set up to reward that behavior: you get your reward when you recruit people. Doesn't matter how late you are to join the scheme; if you can find enough suckers then you can get your payout. </p>
<p>With a matrix scheme you're just rewarded for joining early. Once you've joined there's little incentive to recruit others. Sure, if you get 10 more people to join then you'll bump yourself up the list by one, but that's far too little reward for the amount of work. </p>
<p>That also makes matrix schemes more transparent. It's easier to look at them and realize that youll never make your return so people are less likely to join in the first place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a timeshare. I wouldn't say it meets the strictest definition of a matrix scheme, but it comes pretty close. </p>
<p>Say you have this $200k apartment by the beach. You buy in with 6 other people for $34k each - and each of you have the right to use it for 2 months each. But chances are, everyone will want to use it in July/August - so one person will have to pay the other timeshare holders a premium for reserving the prime months - so you have to &quot;pay to play&quot; again if you want to actually use your timeshare. Now, a lot of other people won't be able to use that apartment during the rest of the year. So, only one or maybe 2 people (like an elderly retired snowbird couple) could feasibly benefit from the timeshare out of the group of 6. And from a financial investment perspective, you're certain to lose money since you can pick up timeshares on eBay for like $2k - it will <em>never</em> appreciate beyond what you originally paid for it since the second-hand market is so saturated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've always gotten that they were scams but had no idea about the resale market. I see a lot on offer for $1...does that mean they're trying to dump something that has some kind of annual fee? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like one of those refer a friend deals.</p>
<p>Back in the early 2000s you would see sites advertising referral deals to get a free item like say an iPod</p>
<p>If you clicked an ad. Signed up to a deal and then referred someone you'd help the person at the top of the list rank up.
Once they hit ten of each you'd get the item for free and everyone below you moves up. Its a deal for the person at the top as the item is paid for by their and the other 9 ppls efforts. But everyone below them risks wasting effort if nobody signs up under them</p>
<p>Ppl do it in hopes they are at least the tenth last person to ever do so</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not at least the tenth last, at least the 0.9*Nth last, N being the number of people who sign up. If 10 sign up, 9 lose. If 20 sign up, 18 lose. If 1000 sign up, 900 lose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're just hoping to &quot;get in early&quot;, you can just as well start your own pyramid.</p>
<p>Just ask 10 of your friends to give you money, and in return, they get to ask ten of <em>their</em> friends to also give you money and to give some money to the original friends.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a spectacularly retarded idea, it's because it is. But that's how pyramid schemes work.</p>
<hr />
<p>If starting your own pyramid sounds like too much of a hassle, don't worry: I just started one for you!</p>
<p>So I'm at level one of Wendell's pyramid, and you have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get in at level two! Just send me money, and you'll get several times what you paid if only enough people join at the lower levels. </p>

<p>I got screwed working for a pyramid scheme (only for 2 weeks) Made nothing close to what they said I would, was driving 150 miles a day so burning through fuel, 12hr days were leaving me exhausted and most days I was either not making sales or when I made sales they'd split it.</p>
<p>whats fucked up is I found out it was a pyramid scheme because they explained their business model to me...laid it all out on the 4th day of orientation...and acted like it wasn't sketchy as fuck. very cult like mentality </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this view is exactly why people fall for pyramid schemes. Their greed overwhelms their sensibility and they try to &quot;get in early&quot; on the fraud. Noone wants to believe they are a sucker, so they view themselves as &quot;in on it,&quot; and fail to sure these schemes are setup to prevent them from profiting. </p>
<p>The very few who profit often end up having their assets seized and ending up in jail. Profitting off of scamming people is generally not the best way of ensuring longterm personal financial success.</p></div>		</li>
