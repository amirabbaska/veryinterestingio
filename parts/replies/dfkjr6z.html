			<div class="markdown"><p>From my rough numbers (and I could totally be doing this wrong), I don't think so. The LD50 for a subcutaneous bite, which is the most applicable in this situation, is 0.32 mg/kg. An adult male giraffe weighs around 1360 kilograms. My number came out to be 435mg of venom needed. A Black Mamba bite tends to be 100 to 120 mg. So maybe if it got multiple bites? Not an expert, just bored at work. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's when half the subjects die right? So a lower than LD50 dose could still be fatal, just less likely to be so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mamba's are known for multiple biting attempts. So I think that while you're getting a range of comments generally speaking a black mamba strike would result in a fatality for a giraffe. It's likely that giraffe's are physiologically more susceptible to the venom, as well as getting hit with nearly or more than that critical volume of venom. Plus the body area they're getting hit is critical for the respiratory pathway. So I'm sure the whole shebang is grab of oh-shit-thats-not-good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the venom doesn't kill outright, I'm assuming the bite happens in the head or neck area. So having your air intake system go numb is probably a really deadly thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always, but usually.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/lightning-stroke-and-electrocution/overview-of-lightning-stroke-and-electrocution" target="_blank">Merck Manual</a> answer. </p>
<p>&quot;Singe marks on or damage to the carcass, damage to the immediate environment, or both, occur in ~90% of cases of lightning stroke but are less likely to be found if the animal is electrocuted by standing on electrified earth.&quot; </p>
<p>If you're wondering how big a lightning bolt can get / how catastrophic it can be, last year 323 reindeer died en-masse from a lightning strike. They weren't burned (most likely) because a huge bolt hit nearby <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/norway-reindeer-lightning-weather/" target="_blank">and electrified the ground.</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as discussed some of the animals get killed by near strikes  that flow through the ground creating an potential difference through their legs , you get his in commercial cattle as well there are no outward signs of a strike </p></div>		</li>
