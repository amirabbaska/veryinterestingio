			<div class="markdown"><p>Toronto also has a pretty unique mess of a microclimate that, beyond its' HIE, includes a (great) lake effect, a massive ravine/national park system that run across/throughout the city, and a smog heat trapping effect (although this specifically has been reducing considerably in recent years as the city has gotten cleaner/coal-free).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan is also great at covering every surface with materials that attract and retain heat. Empty lot? Let us cover that with asphalt for you until someone can build on it. Not much greenery in Tokyo either. It's an odd feeling to walk down the street in insane temperatures and actually feel the heat radiating upwards from the blacktop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since eliminating coal as an energy source in 2014 Torontoâ€™s pollution has significantly decreased. It is down 60%.  Human changes can have an immediate, positive impact on our health and environment, but most people want to bitch their hydro bill went up by a few dollars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cities in general tend to be hotter than countryside. It has much more to do with inherent characteristics of urban area than pollution. Google Urban Heat Island (UHI).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're being honest, city structures and infrastructure are a kind of pollutant. They are great concentrations of materials that are not found in such quantities naturally, they prevent natural biology and ecosystems to take place, and they change the natural temperature and microclimate. </p>
<p>A building that we use is different than huge islands of plastic floating in the ocean, but they act in very similar ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the equator has maximum solar exposure during the spring and fall. In essence, the equator gets two Summers and two winters every year. The sun is most perpendicular to the tropic of cancer during June and most perpendicular to the tropic of capricorn in December. We call these events the solstices, and it's just because the Earth is tilted. So the sun's angle relative to the Earth drifts back and forth between those two points. The equator is half way between them. Hence, it is most perpendicular at the two equinoxes that are half way between June and December. </p></div>		</li>
