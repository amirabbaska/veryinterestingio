<p>The energy is so low that a mesh with a specific aperture is sufficient to deflect the energy without compromising vision.  Like the mesh that shields the window of a microwave oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and actually that's how radio telescopes work. They are often just a metal mesh that can reflect radio waves that have wavelengths longer than the gaps in the mesh. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Although this is ultimately synonymous with what you wrote, the aperture is sufficient to deflect the energy because the wavelength of microwaves is so much larger than the aperture, metaphorically like a tennis ball and a stringed racket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is technically correct, but I think a little misleading in how it is written. The spacing of the mesh relative to the wavelength of the radiation is all that matters; it's more like how you can't fit a round peg in a square hole. It's not really to do with the wave being weak or anything, even though technically yes, longer wavelength = lower energy. It's a question of geometry, not material.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, yes and no. At short range they are, but the inverse square law is a pretty devilish bastard in this respect. So yes, the transmissions we produce on earth are significantly more intense, they are a lot less luminous.</p>
<p>In the satcom industry, twice a year (around the Equinoxes) we have to deal with the issue of Sun Outages. The geometry works out just so that from the point of view of an antenna on Earth, the sun passes directly behind its target satellite. During that period, the sun drowns out the satellite, causing the receiver connected to that dish to lose lock. Depending on the size of the dish, the frequency, and the point where you are in the cycle, the outages can range from 30 seconds all the way up to 12 minutes or so, and they happen every day, at the same time, for about 2 weeks.</p>
<p>The Sun produces a vast amount of wideband RF noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun also suffers from the inverse square law... But yes it is wider band. The earth is much brighter in the bands we emit </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our emissions are much more intense, but there is no way that we're emitting more than a microscopic amount of the energy released by the Sun. As I mentioned elsewhere, the sun easily drowns out satellite transmissions during sun-outage time. While those aren't the most powerful transmissions in the world, they're pretty darned bright.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The other answers haven't addressed your question as directly as they should. Your mobile phone in your pocket is actually much brighter than the sun in radio waves. And if aliens were to look at our solar system in radio, they would see Earth as millions of times brighter than the Sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you provide some numbers to back this up? How bright is the sun in radio? How bright is a popular cell phone? How much radio does the earth give off?</p>
<p>And what do you mean by bright? Total energy emitted per second? Energy per unit of surface area per second? </p></div>		</li>

<p>And by bright, I mean energy per area per second received. The brightness depends on the distance of the object. Luminosity is the term for total energy emitted. Of course the sun would be brighter than a mobile if a mobile was as far away as the sun! But it's in your pocket, which makes the total light per area nearby much higher than that of the sun.  </p></div>		</li>
