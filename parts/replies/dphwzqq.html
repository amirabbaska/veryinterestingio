			<div class="markdown"><p>There are special regulations, but things like this get approved for research all the time. It’s technically ethical because they are not in pain </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did pharmacology and toxicology research on mice. I see how many might feel giving huge doses of amphetamines/phenethylamines and hallucinogens is unethical... But we did everything as humanely as possible (we 'sacrificed'/euthanized mice who had been tested on via cervical dislocation, which kills them instantly and painlessly). The benefit to humans and medical literature justifies it to me. But I hated killing the little guys. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it is important to note that this research was done decades ago, when scientific methodology was less advanced and, probably more importantly, ethical restrictions on animal use in experiments was more....relaxed so it was a lot easier to go from idea to testing on animals than it generally is today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if same is true in humans.</p>
<p>There are charities that treat congenital and developmental cataracts in older children and teenagers (e.g. <a href="http://wonderwork.org/blindness/" target="_blank">http://wonderwork.org/blindness/</a> ) - and the claim that this fully &quot;cures&quot; the blindness is frequently made.</p>
<p>While not entirely the same thing and while the children with cataracts would be able to recognize light, one would imagine that this form of blindness would also have a permanent impact on visual development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same is certainly true in humans.  If these problems are not corrected swiftly, the visual cortex and visual processing pathways fail to develop appropriately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important difference is that the developmental connections will not reform when cataracts are removed from adults because the critical time window has passed. However, due to the plasticity of the brain, higher order regions can compensate to a degree to interpret new visual stimuli that are coming in. It's just like how people can learn to use prosthetic limbs using a new set of muscles. But it's not the same thing as regrowing the neuronal connections that are genetically programmed through development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's the exact question here, though it's related. That research dealt with <strong>critical periods</strong>, times during development that are particularly important for a brain to form the connections to process information. The cats never saw light during their critical period, so they never learned how to understand it. By the time they did see light, it was too late: their brain wasn't able to reconfigure itself to process that information.</p>
<p>A more directly relevant study would sew the cat eyes shut once the cats had already learned to see, then unsew them later.</p>
<p>Similar studies have also been done with kittens in rooms painted with vertical or horizontal stripes on the wall. Those kittens never learn to understand what left versus right is, or what up versus down is, depending on which stimulus they weren't exposed to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s exactly what they did to adult cats. They tested both kittens and adult cats. As far as I understand, that’s why they figured out that a critical period of visual system development exists. </p>

It says there is no effect in adult cats</p></div>		</li>
