			<div class="markdown"><p>Yay, one I can answer! Lived on Subs for a few years.
Nuclear powered boats could run forever, but have some limiting factors. The weakest part is the crew. Food and sanity run thin. </p>
<p>And sometimes equipment malfunctions. The piece of equipment used for water electrolysis is called the Automatic Electrolytic Oxygen Generator or AEOG.  Our AEOG was a turd and didn’t like running, so we had to move to back up measures. Subs are also supplied with “candles”, these are little bricks of material that, when burned, create oxygen. Crew members would measure O2 content and if it dipped lower than acceptable levels, we would light off candles to bring it back up. </p>
<p>//edit: not lithium hydroxide, those are for CO2 removal... my bad</p>
<p>Then when we ran out of those, we would have to come to periscope depth and ventilate the whole boat. If you have any other questions let me know, I’m happy to share!</p>
<p>//edit: this turned into an informal AMA. I gotta go, but I’ll answer questions as I see them. And no, I’m not a chemist so I don’t know much about the candles I only know what they were called and the description that I was given about how they operate.  I was a Fire Control Technician, my expertise lies in different areas, but I’m happy to share what I think I know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a fascinating difference in mentality to this between submarines and surface ships as well.</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers, in the US, are also nuclear. As the joke goes, if a carrier sustains some damage during operations, it will stay on station long enough to complete operations and/or to hand them over to another carrier, and then head straight home to a drydock to get the dents buffed out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a nuclear submarine will literally accept a duct tape fix to a reactor as 'good enough' if it means getting to stay at sea for another few weeks.</p>
<p>Now, that said, there are surprisingly many instances where duct tape is a perfectly safe solution to issues with a reactor, but still...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can just hunt fish and stuff that lives in the ocean and is edible. They have torpedos just shoot at a whale and tie him onto the submarine with scubadivers. and you have a lot of food and it will attract fish like sharks, which scubadivers could hunt or they just cut of pieces from the whale from time to time.
Is it even possible to leave/enter the submarine underwater?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most likely yes, although I'm not sure if you torpedo whaling/whale towing scenario is particularly realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the O2 generators and CO2 scrubbers are not 100 % efficient so the subs come periscope depth to complete air exchanges. Also running things like air compressors reduces the pressure inside the ship as the available atmosphere is stored and compressed. Some of that air is released in to the ship as it is used, but some is consumed or vented out of the ship.</p>
