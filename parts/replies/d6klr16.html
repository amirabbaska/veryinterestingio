			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the theory of 'mutual/parallel mutation' to explain the varied clades that follow fundamental similarities to a certain level, yet are diverse at the same time.</p>
<p>For instance, having the same 'basic ingredients' for a given clade to evolve, and in other regions as well, that evolve laterally, and with different stimuli that brings the ultimately different clade variations among the fundamental core species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are examples of superficial parallel evolution in a few traits. We can find that birds and bats both have wings. But the wings are only superficially similar and they share very few other traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think those traits are less superficial than you elude...</p>
<p>The very fact that these two example species both picked up the idea of flight, used wings to achieve it, understood the 'concept' of flight, and mastered it, developed membrane, feathers, hollow bones, etc..</p>
<p>Question is, what were the catalysts that brought these seemingly very different species to conclude that flight was the best means of locomotion, and the stimuli that caused them to employ such different designs as they evolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the trouble with the clade system. It's a fair approximation and works beautifully in theory. If we start with a cardinal member, from there we can precisely identify, using lineage, whether or not any organism is a derivative member. We can then observe the trends in traits. In practice, however, we don't exactly have a complete birth record. We have the fossil record, which accounts for only a small percentage of organisms and almost never gives any clue as to lineage, so we have to use those trends I talked about earlier. Those trends change over time, and evolution doesn't give a shit who your daddy was. The members of a subclade or even the whole clade can change to be physically indistinguishable from another, and traits that used to be universally identical within a clade may diversify. It is very difficult to pick the right traits for clade sorting to construct a phylogenetic tree. Sometimes people get it wrong. However, recent splits are easy. Humans are definitely genus Homo, which is definitely a great ape genus, which is definitely an ape tribe, which is definitely a primate clade, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The clade problem is most difficult in situations with high evolutionary pressure. Humans and other apes occupy rather unique niches which are relatively recent developments in the global ecology. That's why our delineation is so simple. Meanwhile, the niche of medium-small-to-small apex/semi-apex ambush predator has been around for a long time, which is why so many disparate clades are so hard to distinguish. Cats (basically all of them) fill that niche, as well as skunks, some weasels, certain badgers, and even a few lizard species, to name a few. All have a similar build and size (varying based on size of preferred prey, but pretty much the same size), as well as basically the same muscular structure, brain location/size/shape, hunting structures, and behaviors. Each of these clades, not only have subclades like house cats and skunks that converge on a single design, but most of them also have subclades that vary wildly from each other.</p>
<p>tl;dr yes, it's an issue, but abbreviated genealogy is basically the only system we have that explains both what life was here and when did it live. This job is hard, and no one has anything better.</p></div>		</li>
