( Except to the extent that they are currently malnourished and tired?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are mystified and I think there are a lot of plausible reasons. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/63018-thailand-boys-quarantined-cave-diseases.html" target="_blank">This article</a> discussed the bat guana possibility as well as other diseases but there's a difference between plausible and actual. The eyes of the world are on them, and they're  taking every care not to have any negative publicity associated with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... I’m just gonna jump on this comment and point out the ABC reporter that I saw a couple days ago, crouching through the cave system, touching EVERYTHING that he possibly could.</p>
<p>I don’t know what ABC is doing, but as anyone who spent 5 minutes in a cave in grade school... you don’t touch living caves.  Dude was grabbing on stalactites and stuff, slapping his palm against walls, showing how damp they are.</p>
<p>Whatever he thought he was doing... it did not work.  ABC is off my list of reliable news sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of politics involved in this whole rescue operation. The Thai Navy SEAL diver who died was not an experienced cave diver (in fact none of the military guys were) and the reason the SEALs were involved was because politically it would look terrible to have foreigners heading a rescue operation to rescue Thai children in Thai territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Think about how it would have looked to the remaining families if the first wave of boys survived and the second group did not. Or if a couple of boys succumbed to infection or were released early and died etc etc. Having them quarantined makes them all equal priority in the eyes of the parents, and also protects the boys safety from pathogens and the prying eyes of the media. </p>
<p>It’s actually completely obvious if you put yourself in the planners shoes. </p></div>		</li>
