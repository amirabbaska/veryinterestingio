			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the extensive reply! So this is a thing that can and does occur, but for a complete layman such as me, the question of scale becomes more important to grasp then. From another reply here I gather that the amount of ice on Antarctica is so big that while this effect may take place, it will not happen in such a long time that whatever measures we can ever think of to counter global warming would be well in place since a long time before this ever became a real problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the well referenced answer. Do you know anything about the timescales involved with sort of induced volcanism? I realise there are often implied timescales depending on the field, so I'm going to assume any assumptions I make are wrong since I'm used to hourly to decadal times, very different from geologists!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last glacial maximum in North America was about 26k years ago. Ice sheets covered the entire Canadian country and reached as far south as St Louis. We can see the history of this in the rock record; glacial till and such. Deglaciation started, I think, about 20k years ago. Basically, it's taken 20k years to reach our current glacial state in North America. And during this even there has been some isostatic rebound. I'm not too familiar with it's relationship with volcanism because there just aren't very many volcanoes in N America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are a couple of points I'd like to touch on that make this question interesting to think about. Your deglaciation timescale will indeed be in the thousands of years. It takes a long time to melt an ice cap. However, magma is generated throughout this period of time, as decompression is occurring with each little bit of ice removed from the surface. This magma will begin to move towards the surface as soon as it can because it is less dense than the surrounding mantle rock. Once this magma reaches the boundary between the crust and the mantle (a boundary called the Mojo [mo-ho]) it does one of 2 things. It either pools to form a magma chamber that will then feed volcanos or it will simply keep moving to the surface and erupt. The timescale of this magmatism is somewhat shorter. As far as I know it's more on the order of hundreds of years. Volcanoes can erupt while still capped be a glacier! There's a special type of igneous rock that is generated by this lava-glacier interaction. They're called hyaloclastite. Furthermore, these sub-glacial eruptions can also generate huge amounts of melt water that can come gushing out with tremendous force. In Iceland they are called JÃ¶kulhlaup. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>
