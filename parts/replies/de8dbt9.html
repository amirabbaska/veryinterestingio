			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. TIL. always grew up storing things in boxes/bins to prevent moth bites. Not that I ever saw any -never really understood the concern. Possibly due to it being stored in a basement? Also were stored in a cedar closet so it would bring that smell on too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A basement could be damp. I don't know, I haven't stored textiles in a basement. I've had good luck just using a pillow case for winter bedding  storage in the hall linen closet. It has one of those louver doors to allow air flow. The only time I've had a moth problem is when I used an unheated storage unit for a few months. That was stupid. Oh my pretty cotton sheets. Ouch. One time my husband stored a wool suit in his closet (without cleaning it first) and he must've had a tiny splash of food or beverage on the lapel, because that's where he found a small hole. Now he cleans faithfully and uses suit bags. To be on the safe side, you should probably invest in a few bedding bags. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a top loader. You could dilute the vinegar in water before adding if you're concerned about corrosion. Do a little research and check with your manufacturer and warranty info before you try it. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-Vinegar-to-Laundry" target="_blank">discussion</a> about it. Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Did you see the warning about the dangers of mixing vinegar and bleach? It can create a gas that could be deadly. Please be careful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use regular white distilled vinegar, bought from a grocery store. It's clear and colorless so it won't stain. (as opposed to apple cider vinegar which could cause yellowing)</p></div>		</li>
