			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a little research recently, because I noticed that everyone just seems to assume that getting a beached whale/dolphin/orca back into the ocean will either save or extend its life, or at least reduce its suffering until it passes.</p>
<p>Turns out, <em>doing such may not help the animal, and may in fact increase its suffering and/or speed up its demise. </em> </p>
<p>See <a href="https://particle.scitech.org.au/earth/drsabcd-of-saving-a-beached-whale/" target="_blank">https://particle.scitech.org.au/earth/drsabcd-of-saving-a-beached-whale/</a>
&quot;It might seem obvious to try and refloat the cetacean if it’s alive, but this sometimes does more harm than good. If a cetacean is too weak, injured or young to survive alone, refloating it won’t work. Attempting refloating when it’s not suitable will only make the animal’s final hours more stressful and unpleasant.&quot;</p>
<p>Also <a href="http://us.whales.org/issues/what-to-do-if-you-find-live-stranded-whale-or-dolphin" target="_blank">http://us.whales.org/issues/what-to-do-if-you-find-live-stranded-whale-or-dolphin</a>  This link says &quot;Do not drag the whale or dolphin back to the water. This may cause it a serious injury.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't find the original link I found, and someone correct me if I'm wrong.  I think what can happen is that, like others have been saying, the animal's weight works against itself when taken out of the water.  Their bodies gets so compressed that they experience muscle damage, and this damage causes a chemical change.  These chemicals are held in the muscles, unless the animal is put back into the water.  If that happens, the chemical is then released into the bloodstream and causes the animal great suffering.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: <em>Don't automatically assume that you should put a beached animal back into the water.  Keep it covered with wet towels and clothes until the experts arrive.  Dig holes for the fins to rest in, and put water in the holes.  Be gentle, their skin is super sensitive and likely burning!</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was part of the Marine Mammal stranding Network when I lived out on the East Coast and yeah, most people assume you want to shove the whale or dolphin or whatever it is back in the ocean. Stranding events that end with that are extremely rare because like I said typically the animal is already dying. The sad truth is most of the time the animal has to be euthanized in order to put it out of its misery. And it's always fun explaining to the gathered crowd of children why the scientists are slitting the whale's throat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering how to kill a whale as humanely as possible (as in, least suffering) and slitting it's throat is probably as good as it gets besides blowing it up with dynamite.</p>
<p>Killing large animals in a humane way is difficult. I mean, shooting the whale would barely do anything unless it was a cannon. I doubt a .50 caliber rifle could successfully penetrate a whales skull and kill it unless you stood maybe on top of it and hit the right spot (so much fat and bones in the way. Whales are seriously fat animals)?</p>
<p>But I've seen slitting a whales throat in Iceland and it's not pretty. But damn were the blades they used efficient at cutting through the animal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live on long island, NY and we've been lucky enough to have the humpbacks feed in 20' of water durring October and November the last 2 years. Unfortunately one whale traveled into the bay in high tide. Stupid boaters chased the whale further into the bay to snap more pictures. The tide went out and the whale became stranded. Some people organized a team of dredgers to blast out a channel underneath the animal and all the way to deeper water. Unfortunately the authorities told everyone they'd be arrested if they went by the whale and instead gutted it with a sharp blade on a stick. It was sickening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true.  A healthy marine mammal can be beached if there is one unhealthy member of their pod.  </p>
<p>It might also be an inept dolphin or orca who tried that 'surf onto the beach, grab the prey, and have one's moment carry them back into the water' trick and screwed it up.  Though natural selection has probably weeded out most of the inept ones already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are absolutely times were healthy marine mammals get stranded on beaches. I believe there's somewhere in the Nordic countries where a pod of small I think pilot whales get stranded pretty much every year because they migrate through a narrow strait When the tide comes out and leave them high and dry. It's just that the vast majority of Marine Mammal strandings are with unhealthy specimens</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, that CAN happen, but it's important for folks to know that when an animal is beached the correct action is not to drag it back into the ocean. In the frequent case that they are sick, this reduces its chance of survival. Even if it is just beached by accident, if you aren't trained to handle these animals you can cause serious injury. </p>
<p>The correct course of action is to contact the local sea rescue program. If there is a marine park (SeaWorld etc. ) or aquarium in the area, these folks are usually the ones to call. There are also volunteer animal rehab programs all over the coast. In California it's the &quot;Marine Mammal Center&quot;. If you don't know, just contact local authorities who might know. In the meantime, keep the inevitable crowd away from the animal to reduce stress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, absolutely contact qualified rescue personnel.  Even if you watched the goofball orca beach itself by sucking at land surfing, it's still a large animal that would be difficult for the average person to move without injury to the person or the whale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  That's a big theory as to why a lot of mass strandings happen.  There's still no &quot;proof&quot; but let's just say that research into that is not a popular idea with certain parts of the government.</p></div>		</li>
