			<div class="markdown"><p>The Circadian Rhythms part is the thing that's confusing me though. Surely 2pm is one of, if not the, brightest part of the day and therefore that should be the time when you feel &quot;awake.&quot;</p>
<p>The historical perspective is cool though, especially considering siestas are still a part of many cultures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/opinion/sunday/can-sleep-deprivation-cure-depression.html" target="_blank">really good article</a> a while ago explaining how our genetics can influence our circadian rhythms - my entire family are night owls and I can very rarely fall asleep before midnight. Studies have shown that melatonin production starts at different times depending on your circadian rhythm.</p>
<p>Though one thing that may make a lot of people sleepy in the afternoon is their blood sugar dipping after a carb-heavy lunch. I used to get that when I ate sandwiches for lunch, but never do when I eat salad or soup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems counterintuitive eh? You tied it together where I couldn't find the words. Thank you</p>
<p>I think for early risers/morning people/people in general have little rises and falls in energy throughout the day. This time of day seems to be quite a target time for sleepiness. We have soup advertisements for 3:30itis and nap times at child care centres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on this, studies have shown that going camping for a weekend can &quot;reset&quot; your internal clock. So while genetics is definitely a major factor, how we trick our brains with artificial lighting also appears to be a big factor</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the time honored tradition of the Siesta is law in some countries.  Businesses shut down from 2:00 - 5:00 pm daily  on workdays. Kids are required to be quiet and every adult respects the siesta period - no autohorns blaring, no murders, even dogs barking cease during the Siesta. </p></div>		</li>
