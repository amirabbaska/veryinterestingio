			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer I've read yet. I've used both ENG and DSLRs for TVC production, and the massive ENGs have all manner of options for changing exposure, focal length, zoom, etc on the fly. </p>
<p>The stability that comes from shooting from the shoulder beats holding a DSLR in front of you damn near every day too. </p>
<p>The one other pertinent reason why bigger ENGs are still used is simply cost. At least at the places I've worked, replacing older ENGs only happens if they completely fall to pieces. Cameras are still a significant capital expense, particularly if you're in an office where the main income is from ad sales. </p></div>		</li>

<p>10 minutes of trying to hold a DSLR and not shaking: Aaaaaahhhh please let his be over soon my arms hurt :(</p>
<p>An hour into using a shouldermounted ENG camera: Sure, it's heavy but this is fine.</p></div>		</li>
