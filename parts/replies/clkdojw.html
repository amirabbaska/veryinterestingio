			<div class="markdown"><p>Which isnt to say those things dont exist. My friend has a larger and improved battery pack for his android. It nearly doubles the thickness of the S4 (Big woop its like a whole 2 to 3 centimeters thick now) but gives it a total of 250% battery life I think. Id say its a good thing to have if youre using your phone for a lot of multi-tasking or picture/video taking or streaming videos. It gets him through a few days on one charge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Saying that your mobile phone lasts for 2-3 days is of far far more benefit then the added cost of production</p></div>		</li>
