<p>According to a study released in 2013 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food allergies among children increased approximately 50% between 1997 and 2011</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to mention that this is true for the U.S. and might not be for the rest of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  It might actually be worse in Europe. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>More than 17 million Europeans have a food allergy, and hospital admissions for severe reactions in children have risen seven-fold over the past decade, according to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prevalence of allergies in children varies from 1.7% in Greece to 4% in Italy and Spain, to over 5% in France, UK, Netherlands and Germany. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it was because that it had no positive effects, in that it didn't get anything any cleaner, and that there WAS a link between use and the increase in allergies.     the report was long, boring, and hard to read if you werent a hardcore statistics nerd.  </p>
<p>but basically <em>not</em> allowing children to interact with regular small doses of bacteria and potential allergens means that they never develop a resistance or tollerance, which means that later on, when they DO interact, the response is much greater, and has an vastly increased chance to become autoimmune..  ie, a massive allergic reaction, rather than something mild like a minor rash</p></div>		</li>
