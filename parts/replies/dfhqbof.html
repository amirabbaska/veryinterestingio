			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also like to add that it helps remove frost and debris from in front of the rock. And also add hydroplaining is increased by heating up the ice with the friction of the broom. If you think that is interesting look into the new directional sweeping theories that are being tested and utilized by the best teams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>jayhigher seems to me to be correct. The sweeping action would raise the temperature just enough to make the ice to begin to melt which would reduce the friction, but not enough that the water would remain unfrozen for very long. Had the water remained standing, the actions of the previous team would affect the next team and the ice field would become problematic and harder to manipulate.</p></div>		</li>
