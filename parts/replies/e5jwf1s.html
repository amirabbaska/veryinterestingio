<p>We totally can (and have) slice open rat brains after giving them an SSRI in order to study how it works. We know exactly what they do (now), and how that works, we just don't know why it works.</p></div>		</li>

Very similar, close enough that a LOT of scientific advancements have been made thanks to the furry rodents, but we still can't administer SSRI's to a human then slice open their brains, so while we are very confident on the results of a test like that, lets say 90%, but have no solid way to prove it 100% in humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, even if you take out all the biological differences between mice and humans (different proteins), you'll still be left with dosing/metabolism issues. Drugs can have different effects at different concentrations, and it's difficult to tell what the effective dose conversion from a mouse to humans. You can scale drugs by body mass to administer doses, but this doesn't account for differences in how fast the drug is processed between humans and mice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do NOT know exactly what they do. At the very least, SSRI involvement with the glutamate subsystem has been discovered relatively recently (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23273725" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23273725</a>); in general, we have no reason to believe that we totally understand everything these drugs do and do not do.</p></div>		</li>
