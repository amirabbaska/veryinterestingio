			<p>The eventuality of that is that the entire universe would eventually be black holes right? At a certain point all of matter would eventually be caught and contained in these things and possibly black holes would eventually merge into an infinitely dense super black hole. At a certain point the outlook has to have an 'escape mechanism' in my mind to explain the current state of our galaxy no? Otherwise it would suggest that we are living in a transient form of our universe that will only happen once? <br><br>Tell me when my weak understanding of this starts to reveal itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why? A black hole is not some crazy space vacuum-cleaner, you can orbit it just fine. The gravitation of a black hole is no different than that of other bodies and it’s not like we are crashing into the sun or something like that.<br><br>Is there any mechanism which would inevitably slow down orbiting bodies? I don’t know of any, just tidal locking.</p>		</li>

			<p>I mean, technically gravitational radiation (gravity waves) reduces the energy of an orbiting system, but that's absurdly low most of the time. The Sun-Earth system loses about 20 watts to gravitational radiation, IIRC, which is negligible compared to the total gravitational and kinetic energy of the system. For massive bodies in very close, rapid orbit, however, it can become noticeable.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have done simulations of ferrofluid droplets under a magnetic field in &quot;water&quot;. It is very interesting what happens when you go from treating it as a point to considering it as a several points of fluid with drag, viscosity, different strength of magnetic field across the droplet, etc. I imagine orbiting bodies such as Earth experience similar inefficiencies for not existing at a single point, causing decay in their orbit. In fact, I may simulate this to see if that is true.</p>		</li>

			<p>That is exactly what tidal forces are, an uneven distribution of gravitational force across an object due to it not being a point particle. Once the two bodies reach tidal lock (the same sides are always facing each other) this decay stops.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Black holes do not have a real volume, there being no procedure for visiting the inside and measuring it.<br><br>You mean they have no known, measurable, or defined volume. Otherwise we're making the argument &quot;I can't see what dress my wife is wearing, so she must be naked.&quot; Certainly as our understanding increases, we'll be better able to speculate with evidence what black holes are like without actually entering one.

			<p>Is it possible for matter to contract into a point if the universe doesn't?

			<p>It's well vetted in the sense that two separate empirically well supported theories when mixed together predict it in a domain we expect both theories to behave well.

			<p>You're right I did misread. My bad. Let me try to salvage myself then for the sake of conversation.  <br><br>&gt;What I'm saying is: The absence of competing theories does not make the existing theory more right or wrong. So when someone asks &quot;Are there any other theories?&quot; it's a worthy question... but if the answer is &quot;no&quot; that doesn't mean the Hawking Radiation theory is right.<br><br>I agree with you in principle, but with the caveat that we should always be aware that scientific theories do not exist in isolation from each other. An alternate theory doesn't just slip into the tapestry of all physics leaving everything else intact.<br><br>If Hawking radiation is wrong then quantum mechanics and/or general relativity have serious problems unrelated to Hawking radiation. Any alternate theory needs to really shake things up and be massive in scope and presumably have far reaching testable consequences in other domains. In that way the lack of alternate theories might be a reflect of the lack of possible physics that could &quot;fit in&quot; while also keeping all the features of GR and QM we already know empirically well. Not saying any of this means we should bet more money on Hawking being right, but him being wrong should really give us a big pause.<br><br>As an analogy, if we found out tomorrow the world was actually flat. We wouldn't just stop there. We'd need to rewrite astronomy, physics, geology, possibly biology, possible thermodynamics etc... etc... A lot of things would become inconsolable.</p>		</li>

			<p>Again, I think you are seeing me as a person who has some interest in saying the Hawking Radiation theory is right or wrong (or likely right or wrong). I'm really not. I think it makes some sense, despite being a layman's layman. If it were proven true within my lifetime, I wouldn't be surprised. Nor would I have any crow to eat over it.<br><br>I'm just saying (again for the record): The lack of competing theories doesn't increase the odds that HR theory is right. I'm speaking to logical fallacy only. If it seems like I'm skirting direct discussion of the HR theory, it's because I'm not qualified to do anything but listen. :)<br><br>Seems like a cool theory.

			<p>I once read that Hawkins radiation is basically what happens when matter and anti matter appear of nowhere (something that happens everywhere), with either the matter or anti matter being past the event horizon, causing them not to annihilate each other and one escaping causing the radiation. Is that wrong? If it's not, wouldn't that mean that the radiation is not actually the matter that was 'absorbed' by the black hole?</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't appear from nowhere.<br><br>People forget space isn't empty. It's filled with fields. Particles are not waves, or particles, or sometimes one or the other. They are their own entity which is an excitation of a field.<br><br>Some particles can feel other fields. An electron which is an excitation of the electron field can feel(Couple, interact) with the electromagnetic field(Also known as the photon field, which photons are an excitation of). Moreover other particles that can interact or couple with fields create &quot;disturbances&quot; that other particles that also interact with that field can &quot;feel&quot;(Interact with).<br><br>So a proton can couple with the photon field, which an electron can feel. There is then an attraction. This is all fairly simplified. There is even constituent fields, the proton field is created by the interacting quark gluon fields, as is the neutron.<br><br>Particles can be seen to be &quot;ripples&quot; in a field. Fields permeate all space. A particle is a stable ripple.<br><br>There are instabilities in fields that cancel each other out. So think of non-stable ripples. Say two ripples occur due to instabilities that cancel each other out. <br><br>Normally this requires &quot;no energy&quot; which simply is a simplified way of saying the net energy is zero. In a sense it's &quot;borrowed&quot; briefly then &quot;given back&quot; when the two non-stable ripples collide and cancel out.<br><br>If you could separate these two ripples it would require energy, and you'd create particles. This is a very simplified view but good enough for now.<br><br>So at the event horizon not getting to much into detail two ripples occur. One is beyond the event horizon and can not reach it's counterpart. One falls in, one escapes. A new particle exist. Energy must be conserved. Thus the black hole loses energy.<br><br>In a sense briefly two units of energy are borrowed from the black hole, 1 unit of energy is given back, 1 escapes.<br><br>There is a lot more &quot;weird&quot; stuff happening, but in essence that is how black holes evaporate.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're on the right track, the black hole horizon &quot;cleaves&quot; the pairs apart promoting one of the particles (it doesn't matter which) as radiation and the other is lost to the horizon. Even though the radiation isn't actually from the same matter which fell in, the energy stolen by the radiation reduces the mass of the black hole.  <br><br>Anything which falls in is lost, but the dollar value aka energy is kept and allowed to be used in other physics such as radiation production. Think of energy as nature's money. It can spend and buy it, even though the specific stuff it buys and sells changes.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;the energy stolen by the radiation reduces the mass of the black hole.  <br><br>I don't quite understand how the energy is stolen, considering that nothing leaves the black hole. <br><br>Can one say that the anti matter that is cleaved and taken past the event horizon annihilates the matter inside, effectively reducing the mass while it's matter counter part is radiated? <br><br>If so, won't we theoretically have the same amount of matter and antimatter cleaved past the event horizon and basically not make a difference at all?</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Can one say that the anti matter that is cleaved and taken past the event horizon annihilates the matter inside, effectively reducing the mass while it's matter counter part is radiated?<br><br>No. Because Hawking radiation produces both antimatter and matter and both reduce the mass of the black hole. Also, annihilation doesn't delete energy from the universe. If an electron and positron both fall into a black hole and while inside (but before hitting the singularity) they find each other and annihilate, two or more photons will be produced at the same energy. The photons are still trapped inside and the energy of the black hole does not change from annihilation.  <br><br>The energy to produce the escaping radiation has to come form somewhere. Mathematically in Hawking's work, it is the 'negative energy' flux of radiation falling into the black hole which ensures this. The cartoon picture Hawking gives is that the two radiation fluxes can be pictured as cleaved pairs. You also have to not take the pair production picture too seriously because the radiation an observer sees is frame dependent. It is then only illustrative of what the wave equation solutions &quot;really mean.&quot;<br><br>In a future fuller theory, the matter which fell into the black hole may be somehow connected to the emitted radiation, but in the basic established form they are unrelated. This is the famous information paradox.</p>		</li>
