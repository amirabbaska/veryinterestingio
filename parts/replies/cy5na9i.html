			<div class="markdown"><p>The eventuality of that is that the entire universe would eventually be black holes right? At a certain point all of matter would eventually be caught and contained in these things and possibly black holes would eventually merge into an infinitely dense super black hole. At a certain point the outlook has to have an 'escape mechanism' in my mind to explain the current state of our galaxy no? Otherwise it would suggest that we are living in a transient form of our universe that will only happen once? </p>
<p>Tell me when my weak understanding of this starts to reveal itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? A black hole is not some crazy space vacuum-cleaner, you can orbit it just fine. The gravitation of a black hole is no different than that of other bodies and it’s not like we are crashing into the sun or something like that.</p>
<p>Is there any mechanism which would inevitably slow down orbiting bodies? I don’t know of any, just tidal locking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, technically gravitational radiation (gravity waves) reduces the energy of an orbiting system, but that's absurdly low most of the time. The Sun-Earth system loses about 20 watts to gravitational radiation, IIRC, which is negligible compared to the total gravitational and kinetic energy of the system. For massive bodies in very close, rapid orbit, however, it can become noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do they? I thought that's a non-verified theory for now?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are there any serious alternative theories that make any sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa, that's some logical fallacy there. Just because there aren't viable alternate theories, that doesn't mean the theory in question is somehow more likely to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it seems hard to 100% verify something like that. We'll likely never be close enough to a black hole (at least not in many lifetimes) to <em>absolutely</em> verify it.</p>
<p>So well-vetted theories are the best we've got right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's about as verified as it can get without actually flying out to a black hole and sticking a thermometer in it. We've <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/hawking-radiation-mimicked-in-the-lab-1.16131" target="_blank">created an analogous phenomenon in the lab,</a> and it's also predicted that cosmic rays entering the atmosphere should be creating tiny black holes fairly frequently, which would long since have devoured the Earth if they didn't immediately evaporate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read that Hawkins radiation is basically what happens when matter and anti matter appear of nowhere (something that happens everywhere), with either the matter or anti matter being past the event horizon, causing them not to annihilate each other and one escaping causing the radiation. Is that wrong? If it's not, wouldn't that mean that the radiation is not actually the matter that was 'absorbed' by the black hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't appear from nowhere.</p>
<p>People forget space isn't empty. It's filled with fields. Particles are not waves, or particles, or sometimes one or the other. They are their own entity which is an excitation of a field.</p>
<p>Some particles can feel other fields. An electron which is an excitation of the electron field can feel(Couple, interact) with the electromagnetic field(Also known as the photon field, which photons are an excitation of). Moreover other particles that can interact or couple with fields create &quot;disturbances&quot; that other particles that also interact with that field can &quot;feel&quot;(Interact with).</p>
<p>So a proton can couple with the photon field, which an electron can feel. There is then an attraction. This is all fairly simplified. There is even constituent fields, the proton field is created by the interacting quark gluon fields, as is the neutron.</p>
<p>Particles can be seen to be &quot;ripples&quot; in a field. Fields permeate all space. A particle is a stable ripple.</p>
<p>There are instabilities in fields that cancel each other out. So think of non-stable ripples. Say two ripples occur due to instabilities that cancel each other out. </p>
<p>Normally this requires &quot;no energy&quot; which simply is a simplified way of saying the net energy is zero. In a sense it's &quot;borrowed&quot; briefly then &quot;given back&quot; when the two non-stable ripples collide and cancel out.</p>
<p>If you could separate these two ripples it would require energy, and you'd create particles. This is a very simplified view but good enough for now.</p>
<p>So at the event horizon not getting to much into detail two ripples occur. One is beyond the event horizon and can not reach it's counterpart. One falls in, one escapes. A new particle exist. Energy must be conserved. Thus the black hole loses energy.</p>
<p>In a sense briefly two units of energy are borrowed from the black hole, 1 unit of energy is given back, 1 escapes.</p>
<p>There is a lot more &quot;weird&quot; stuff happening, but in essence that is how black holes evaporate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regardless, Hawking radiation could reduce the mass of a black hole to the point where it's no longer a black hole, allowing the original matter to escape.</p></div>		</li>
