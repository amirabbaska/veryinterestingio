			<div class="markdown"><p>Involuntary manslaughter usually.  Without specifically intending to kill anyone, the shooter committed an act that presented a grave risk of death or severe physical injury to others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it exceeds the norms of accepted safe, legal behavior, thus not simply an unfortunate accident.</p>
<p>manslaughter- &quot;the unlawful killing of another person without premeditation or so-called &quot;malice aforethought&quot; (an evil intent prior to the killing).&quot;</p>
<p>e.g. backing out of your driveway and hitting someone may not be criminal, it's just an accident.  But if you were drunk, it's criminal.  Even though you didn't mean to kill anyone, driving drunk is illegal to start with, and hitting the person will be seen as a direct result of that illegal behavior.</p>
<p>In fact, if a person robs a home and the homeowner confronts him and that homeowner accidentally shoots himself with his own gun, the robber is responsible for manslaughter, because all that happened because he was acting illegally to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much agree. You couldn't argue murder 1 or 2 with transferred intent because there was no intent to kill anyone. And the shooter could have known or should have know that his actions could result in the death of someone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a guy that got shot in the head by a bullet fired into the air. </p>
<p>The police investigated it as a shooting and took the whole thing very seriously, even though he wasn't badly hurt or even know he had been shot.</p>
<p>I should probably explain that. The bullet was on its way down, and didn't have enough force to penetrate his skull. Instead, it hit the top of his skull, passed under the skin as it travelled down the side of his skull, exited the skin at the edge of his jaw, and lodged itself into the skin on top of his shoulder. It was New Years Eve so he thought he had been hit by three falling pieces of a firework. </p>
<p>He went to the walk in clinic for stiches, and didn't know what happened until the medic pulled the bullet out of his shoulder while cleaning the cut.</p>
<p>He was kind of bummed out that the police took it so seriously. They collected the bullet as evidence. He had wanted to keep it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a Myth Busters on this and iirc their conclusion was the same.  </p>
<p>Straight up the terminal falling velocity won't kill you due to air resistance.</p>
<p>At an angle it can kill you since it still has the forward momentum of the bullet trajectory.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that episode was interesting, the &quot;science&quot; in it was complete garbage.</p>
<p>Their in house testing with the vertical wind tunnel completely ignored the stabilizing spin, which can be at over 300,000 rpm for rifle bullets.</p>
<p>In the real world, that spin keeps the bullet pointy-end forwards (and also accuracy), overcoming the natural tendency for the bullet to flip to a more stable heavy base forward orientation.</p>
<p>Even fired straight up, the bullet will still have plenty of spin to stabilize it in an either nose forward or base forward orientation on the way down - it will not be tumbling like they claimed.</p>
<p>With the more aerodynamic orientation of the bullet, terminal velocity will be higher, letting it reach lethal velocities.</p>
<p>If there's a decent horizontal angle, the bullet will follow a ballistic arc, and stay pointy end forward the entire time, ensuring it has maximum terminal velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By no means does every bullet rifle, and all bullets lose spin eventually, some within a range.  </p>
<p>I thought the in-house testing wasn't that good, but overall it was one of the most thorough of their tests.  Their practical test out on the salt pan was very good... I'm buying their conclusions.</p>
<p>Now, don't get me started on their conclusions about splinter injuries from cannon shots in the age of sail...</p></div>		</li>
