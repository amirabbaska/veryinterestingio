			<div class="markdown"><p>You can stifle inflammation with non steroidal anti inflammatories like ibuprofen or big gun steroids. There are side effects to both, more severe in the latter. Some people have immune deficiency syndromes where certain tracks of the immune inflammatory cascade is “broken” for lack of a better word. These individuals, depending on the compromised pathway (T or B cells, etc.)  get sick very easily on a variable scale of severity or die very young. We are in the throws of a very interesting time in science with immunotherapies and the like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the up and coming star of anti-inflammatories, Cannabidiol. Side effect wise it's looking to be less harmful than NSAIDs which have issues in long term use, and it's also easy on the stomach.</p>
<p>With marijuana reforms sweeping many countries, I think we're going to see this see a lot more popular use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My anatomy professor told us that when mast cells (fancy immune system cells that wander through the lower part of your skin) detect broken collagen (a protein fiber that makes your skin strong and tough) they release chemicals that tell other cells &quot;Hey! There's a problem over here! Come quick!&quot; Hence, the blood vessels get bigger to let more blood through (why it looks red) so that more immune system cells can get to the area quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mast cells (a type of white blood cell) are all over the place, not just the skin. But yes, in this case the mast cells in the skin vessels are encountering allergens/chemokines and releasing histamine/other cytokines, which cause inflammation. Collagen fragments are pretty minor component of the MC inflammatory response (although they can induce mast cell degranulation, and MCs do modify the extracellular matrix); it's more the exposure to a variety of different immune mediators as outlined in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5096814/" target="_blank">this</a> article.</p></div>		</li>
