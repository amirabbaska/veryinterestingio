			<div class="markdown"><p>People with a certain type of stutter can sing properly even if their stutter is severe when speaking. It doesn't mean the stutter is voluntary or anything, just that the mechanism by which you sing is different than that by which you speak.</p>
<p>Secondary languages learned after the developmental years (later than around 4 years old) are stored in a different part of the brain. There have been cases where a person suffered a brain injury and could only speak their native tongue. They lost all their extra languages.</p>
<p>This part is speculation, but maybe the type of stutter you have is caused by an issue in the language portion of the brain where your native tongue is stored. Maybe not. It could totally be the confidence thing you suggested, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach a kid who speaks English as a second language, and I've seen him stutter twice. I was honestly surprised that he did stutter, because its the first time I've noticed it! </p>
<p>I think it was because his parents were watching him, adding more stress? But I was really surprised. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kind of sounds like you think in your mother language quicker but your mouth can't keep up. Since the 2nd language may come to you slower, it gives you more time to formulate the words. Not sure if that's what really is going on but that's what it seems like to me. </p></div>		</li>
