Is there not a way to re-issue new SS cards? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IDs of other nations are in principle random numbers. This ensures that you cannot guess another persons number and gain his/her identity.</p>
<p>Yes it is &quot;quite&quot; easy, if that is what you want, to access private information once you have a matching pair of name and SSN.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nah, defo not completely random, but they usually have some numbers added that are either a checksum or some other 'random' bit. I'm from Estonia, our ID number format is NYYMMDDXXXX, where N is a number that gives both gender and century of birth (5 for males born in the 21st century, 6 for females), YYMMDD is the birthdate, and the 4 Xs are checksum numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically social security isn't mandatory, you can refuse an SSN for your children when they're born. But since the IRS adopted using it for identification, it is mandatory if you want to legally work or take advantage of a government run assistance programs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, I think 99% of people using such numbers are SSN-ineligible illegal aliens, but it is still an option.</p></div>		</li>
