			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something else I wondered about.  Baseball is a game of statistics, and the sheer volume is staggering. How much, when and how detailed is the information a player gets before he steps up to bat?  It's crazy that a player can have to consider the current game situation, the pitchers entire history and habits, his own strengths, and have to make a decision in a 10th of a second to hit an object the size of an apple coming at him at 90MPH.</p>
<p>Baseball is much more a mental game than I think most people give it credit for.</p>
<p>Also, you should commentate baseball games man, you made it really intense and interesting.  Most games I listen to seem to be commentated by two or three old guys, talking about their day, who are occasionally interrupted by a baseball game that just happens to be going on (Although that does have it's own charm, I'll admit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! It'd be a dream to commentate baseball but at this point I'm likely destined to just be a fan. Though my wife loves yelling at the pros &quot;my husband just said that!&quot; when I've pointed out something interesting before the sports guys do on TV.</p>
<p>Edit: and to answer your other question, players are given detailed reports on opponents before games and then during games they can review tape of their at bats between innings. A lot of teams are using tablet computers in the dugouts now. So think of that - you've had two at bats and you're getting ready for your third and you are watching detailed video of your previous at bats you just took in the previous hour. The information is detailed and fast these days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, that's crazy. I had no idea they did video reviews in real time like that.  A big part of baseball's identity seems to be maintaining traditions, but good to know they keep up with the times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think overall you hit the nail on the head but I would disagree somewhat with the degree to which you're saying the pitcher has studied the batter's tendencies. The pitcher will face 9+ batters each game and likely doesn't have &quot;(1) what pitch counts he likes to swing, (2) where he favors the ball, (3) what types of pitches he tends to hit, and (4) his timing/swing/posture at the plate&quot; memorized.</p>
<p>It's more that they might have studied general characteristics about guys. For example: Baez for the Cubs can't lay off the breaking pitch out of the strike zone or (last year) Heyward can't catch up to an inside fastball. With that knowledge and knowing what pitch to throw based on a certain count, in any situation, the pitcher can make good decisions. </p>
<p>On the flip side, the batters likely have more intensively studied the pitcher seeing as how there's only 1 starting pitcher to study pre-game. </p>
<p>I just mean to say that, for example, Kershaw doesn't memorize what batting posture and favorable swing location each guy on the opposing team has. He might know that for the Bryce Harpers of the sport, but generally he's going to dominate based on execution of his overall gameplan that he doesn't alter but so much for a given lineup. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll assume you're in the US because baseball. If you want to commentate I can guarantee there's a youth or school team that can use an announcer. They might not have the detailed background and history you get with the pros but if you know the game that's enough. I'm an adult and play hockey on an amateur league. During high school I did camera work for my school football team at my level so I've seen Junior and Varsity environments. I can't think of a single player who has an active dislike of announcers, and for the most part the parents and kids love it.</p>
<p>One thing that sucks about Junior Varsity and amateur leagues is the lack of announcers, the lack of full stadiums, and all that. Adding something in makes that game feel important and it does up the excitement and full level. Especially younger kids feel really excited when the loudspeakers start screaming they scored a touchdown/goal/point or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't already I would definitely recommend reading MoneyBall. I was not a huge fan of the game before I read the book a few years ago and now I'm obsessed with baseball and all of its statistics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this comment ( and go on a slight tangent ).  There's a book called &quot;The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets&quot;.  They do a pretty good summary of sabrmetrics and the statistics behind baseball.  I recommend it.  And its The Simpsons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is totally going to sound like I'm being an ass, and maybe I am.  But remember that you're the person who asked if batters are just trying to hit home runs every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha true, I may have shot myself in the foot there slightly.</p>
<p>My point of comparison was soccer.  A lot of people I know find it boring because of the low goal count.  I try and explain the complexities that happen in midfield, and how passing plays can be as exciting as goals.</p>
<p>Similarly, I knew that baseball couldn't be a bunch of guys standing around trying to clear the fence.  There had to be more under the surface, I just didn't know what.  Didn't expect the response to be this big however!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of one of my favorite baseball stories and it involves Greg Maddux, one of the smartest pitchers to ever play the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maddux was pitching a shutout with a large lead late in a game early in the season when Bagwell came to bat. He repeatedly shook off catcher Eddie Perez's signs and threw Bagwell an inside fastball which they both knew was his favorite pitch. Bagwell clocked it for a home run and angry Perez confronted Maddux in the clubhouse asking him why he would throw that pitch. Maddux explained that sometime later that season he would face Bagwell in a more important situation and he would be expecting that pitch. Perez was still annoyed that he had &quot;blown&quot; a shutout. Towards the end of that season, the Braves did indeed play an important game against the Astros and Maddux struck Bagwell out late in the game with the bases loaded. Maddux asked Perez if he remembered the game months ago when he deliberately gave Bagwell the pitch he wanted. Perez had forgotten, but Maddux hadn't.</p>
