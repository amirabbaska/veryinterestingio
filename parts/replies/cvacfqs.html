			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, no one forced him to exploit the market. However, there was a big opportunity and the reward made it beneficial for him to act.</p>
<p>You have a good point about some of the players making the game. That all can be fixed if the public were more aware/engaged which will even out the political dialogue. Like many are saying in this thread, today in the U.S. corporations are really good at lobbying for their interests, but the average citizen is usually left out in the conversation. With a bit more public interaction I see the potential of this changing drastically.</p>
<p>I understand your &quot;hate the game and player&quot; attitude, but I think the best solution is not to nit pick at individuals such as Martin over &quot;moral grounds,&quot; and instead make policy changes that will prevent multiple occurrences in the future. Which do you think is a better use of energy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>And just because you lobby for the rules to change, doesn't mean you'll get the intended effect. Society is not entitled to the work of others.</p>
<p>Changing the rules could very well cause most pharma companies exit the market because its more profitable for their biochemists/chemists to make paints or plastics or something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. Changing the rules could be costly when not properly analyzed (especially decisions based on emotions). Looking at it from a fundamental level of supply/demand aspect, the supply was artificially suppressed via FDA. People can complain all they want, but expect higher prices when you ask government for help. In this case, the FDA ( result of government ) did have a hand in the price surge by requiring strict regulation. Asking the government for more regulation is like asking for trouble. If government was the solution, then we wouldn't be having these kind of topics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is probably wrong since the players currently are creating the game and setting the rules through lobbying and regulatory capture.  </p>
<p>The system is defined by the players so blaming the players that are doing something unethical but perhaps legal is perfectly justified.  In the US it really seems that profits &gt; legal &gt; ethics whereas ideally it should be ethics &gt; law &gt; profits.  </p>
<p>The system isn't the problem it is the culture that is defining the system.  This can be seen clearly by the complete lack of business ethics found in the US.  I am not sure changing the rules is really going to solve our current problems until we have a culture shift towards more ethical behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Price arbitrage is totally legal and ethical - it produces more favorable outcomes for more people, more of the time.</p>
<p>Consider the case of airline tickets.  Is it unethical that on a flight of 300 people, all starting and ending at the same time and place, there are typically 40-50 different ticket price points?  </p>
<p>Wouldn't it be more fair for Southwest to simply sell every seat for the same low price, first come/first served, and be done with it?</p>
<p>The answer is: it may be more &quot;fair&quot;, but it produces fewer positive outcomes.  The flight will full of deal shoppers, who only buy the ticket for casual travel if the price is right.  The person trying to get to a funeral who is willing to be triple the price or more to get there will never be able to get a last minute ticket.  The business person who wants to get home before the weekend and is willing to pay will never get a ticket.  And when the single price goes up because of increased fuel costs or taxes, casual travelers will pull back, the flight will be mostly empty, and it will end up cancelled.</p>
<p>This CEO charging $750 for people who can afford it and $0 for people who can't is the same exact thing - market segmentation.  For rich people with insurance and a treatable disease, the drug is pricey.  For poor people, the drug is free.  </p>
<p>Certain policies feel better than they work.  Basically free prescription drugs is a perfect example of something that feels better than it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually this is what I was kind of getting at. Make the public more aware -&gt; leads to culture shift -&gt; leads to more &quot;players&quot; in the game, not just the lobbyists/regulatory capture (as you put it) having control of the rules -&gt; finally, more balanced laws are created.</p>
<p>So, to refine my earlier point.... don't hate the player for playing by the rules (which is what happened above,) because that's basically on the public for allowing such rules to pass in the first place. Hate the people who made such sloppy rules (who may or may not be the abusive players) and push to continually improve the system.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't say I'm conflating as much as I am acknowledging the context of the discussion.</p>
<p>When it comes to small pockets of society, &quot;acceptable&quot; often comes down to unwritten rules and is less reliant on law. But when it comes to society, as a whole, then law <strong>is</strong> what is acceptable. It has to be that way. And where law fails to adequately reflect what society views as acceptable, then it is on society to either (a) be more flexible with what they view as acceptable, or (b) change the law to be less flexible.</p>
<p>The reality is that sometimes a legislative scalpel doesn't exist fine-enough to cut away that which we abhor from that which we love (this is why Westboro Baptist Church is a great litmus test for first-amendment rights). So we have created general rules about property rights, and liberties pertaining to commerce, and added in various structures to make things as fair as possible -- but there are limits to how much we can legislate. We can't legislate &quot;be moral&quot; or &quot;be ethical.&quot; It requires a level of articulation that is difficult.</p>
<p>Getting back to the point... there are many business decisions that are constrained by &quot;what is right&quot; based on social perception but not necessarily legal restrictions because an action is deemed not acceptable and the consequences outweigh the benefits of going against that grain (boycotts are a great example). This is a perfectly acceptable way that society keeps businesses in check.</p>
<p>But here, you have a business model that is completely insulated from public opinion, or public views of what is &quot;acceptable.&quot; So the only <strong>relevant issue</strong> is &quot;is it legal?&quot; Why? Because our goal isn't to just shame this guy... it is to prevent the harm he may cause. If you want to shame him, sure, call it immoral or unethical, and--if he cares about that--maybe it'll sway him to stop.</p>
<p>But when faced with someone who is unwilling to voluntarily do what is deemed &quot;acceptable,&quot; the only tools available are legal tools... the ultimate standard of what is not just socially acceptable, but what is socially permitted. Laws provide the fail-safe level of objectively stating whether something is acceptable.</p>
<p>Here, as a matter of law and reality, we, as a society, have not yet cared enough about this type of problem to say &quot;it is so unacceptable that you aren't allowed to do it.&quot; That's important... because there's plenty of things that society says, &quot;That's not acceptable,&quot; yet people still do it (this can range from porn to deep fried twinkies and binge drinking) and are allowed to decide whether or not they care to opt-in to social standards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regulations are usually reactionary and are minimum standards that we as a society expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is good... regulations should generally be reactionary, otherwise it is, at best, a waste of resources to plan against things that may never come to be and, at worst, a barrier to innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I for one do not look forward to a world in which we ask if it is legal. I look more forward to a world in which we ask if it is reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then your choices are either (a) give up on that hope, (b) move to some isolated area of the world where the population is so small that it is possible to define what is &quot;reasonable&quot; generation to generation without ever having to write it down [good luck with that], or (c) hold on to that hope while the rest of us rational folks try to come up with viable solutions to the real world we live in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So he has no option to actually do something? A CEO can act recklessly, in regards to the lives that require the medication they exploited, but he cannot do anything else? Why?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So every law has been a good one? It has been acceptable? If all laws are acceptable, why would they ever be changed? You seem to be ignoring that some people don't care about the laws more than they care about what is benevolent. </p>
<p>You also need to consider that legal power, like martial power or any kind of power, is best understood by those who have it. And in the US legal power is the only power that can legally affect change. But, people with the time, money, and desire can exploit this law, the same way a gorilla can mate with all the females in a pack if he beats up the other males enough. Legal power, and its exploitation, has no check-and-balance scenario in the US. And legal power can be hoarded, isolated, and exploited. </p>
<p>&quot;Truck, tractor, and delivery drivers&quot; are the largest job in the US (at least according to NPR, but this is more of a theoretical point than a real-application one). Shouldn't they have the most legal power? But, since their life focus isn't legal power (which, if it was everybodies', would cause the world to have a severe lack of production in every other job), they can't compete with legal-focused people who can focus on legal power and using it, along with $$$, time, and other stuff (favors, blackmail, etc...) </p>
<p>Expecting the normal population to match CEOs and the like in a legal and business arena is a completely unfair fight. Not everyone wants to be a lawyer, politician, or businessman. But, when those roles are designed to exploit &quot;the only relevant issue&quot;, the general population can't compete. That's why those roles have become so powerful, because they do not have a balancing force, because no other force is allowed. It's like if everything in the world was settled with a 1v1 fight, and saying everyone has the same opportunity as Fabricio Werdum or Jon Jones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the only relevant issue is &quot;is it legal?&quot; Why? Because our goal isn't to just shame this guy... it is to prevent the harm he may cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My point is that's not the only relevant issue. If you have to stop a powerful person from doing something, you don't fight them on their terms. These CEOs are business and law experts. They exploit legal allowances, and cause harm without a return that people are okay with. People have more options. Legality isn't the only relevant issue. If legality was the only relevant issue we wouldn't even think this guy was doing something wrong, because laws would never be examined through a moral (or other) lense. If legality was the only issue, this wouldn't have been noticed at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is great. Nice to see a comment from someone with some perspective on the situation. People don't seem to realize that our 'system' is relatively new, and comparably complex systems have failed miserably in the past, time and again. We're lucky enough to have a structured government, while also having one that can be modified and updated as necessary. We don't have a totalitarian government and we don't have an unregulated free for all. Most places don't, and most of them are trying to find the place between them that works the best. People want the government to be a referee when it's actually supposed to be a peacekeeper. </p></div>		</li>

Usually that means maximizing profits, but executives are give a lot of leeway in their actions.
