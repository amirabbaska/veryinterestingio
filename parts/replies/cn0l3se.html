			<p>I'm from London, so obviously the housing situation is a bit more extreme here than almost anywhere else. I can't speak for Ireland (where as far as I know the economy is WORSE) but if you're lucky and your credit checks out, you are lucky to get a tiny studio room for Â£1000 a month over here. I hear from friends all over Europe that housing prices are rapidly rising and becoming near impossible to afford.</p>		</li>

			<p>I completely agree with you, I'm not denying that housing in cities is unaffordable and more and more people are renting. <br><br><br>I just felt the title was biased and dramatic.<br><br>Except because Irish houses were so outrageously expensive about 4 years ago, our prices have actually decreased in the last few years - quite dramatically back to normal prices. </p>		</li>
