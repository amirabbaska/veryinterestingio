<p>Experience? It is not the first curious result in particle physics, and so far most of them went away with more data.</p>
<p>If it gets confirmed it will be amazing, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer and link. Crivellin forwards the argument that taus and muons could be subject to something that electrons are not, thus braking lepton flavour universality.</p>

<p>I'd wager your field of research would get magnitudes more interesting if this is where the standard model falls short :)</p></div>		</li>
