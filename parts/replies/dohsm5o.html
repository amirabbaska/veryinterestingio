<p>An Embassy of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" target="_blank">Commonwealth Nation</a> (typically, a former British Colony) in another Commonwealth Nation would be called a High Commission. E.g. The US will have an Embassy in Australia, but the U.K. or Pakistan will have a High Commission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distinction is that an ambassador represents their head of state to another head of state. In the case of Commonwealth countries, they (at least formerly) had/have the same head of state. Thus there is no need for an ambassador. So they have a high commissioner instead, who represents their <em>government</em> to the other government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, am Australian, “Embassy Row” in Canberra feels like its half Embassies, and half High Commissions. If you ever visit Australia, a drive around Yarralumla is kinda cool. You get to see all the embassies next to one another and a lot of them are built based on the architecture of the country they represent. It’s also partly a residential suburb, so like the next street over, it’s just normal brick veneer houses. But, that’s Canberra. </p>
<p>But we still have UK (and other commonwealth countries, such as NZ or Canada) Consulates in major cities. They aren’t named any differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking further:</p>
<p>An embassy will typically be in a state's capital and be a sign that the host state recognizes the embassy state as an independent state with which it has diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>In some instances, it's not politically feasible for one state to have embassies or for another state to host them - for example, contested states (e.g. Taiwan or potentially Catalonia depending on how things play out) may not be recognized by other states.  In other instances, it's beneficial for one state to have a political presence in a part of a country that isn't the country's capital.  In those cases, states might refuse embassies but could accept to host consulates or other offices which have essentially the same function but different, less formal names, in order not to imply recognition of statehood or division of a national capital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking some more: common folk can usually go to the embassy to do paperwork, because embassies also offer consular services. In Italy, for instance, there are three US consulates where US citizens can do paperwork, and one US embassy that also takes care of paperwork. I guess technically, when an American living in Rome says &quot;I have to go renew my passport at the <em>embassy</em>&quot;, they're actually going to deal with the embassy's <em>consular services</em>, which happen to be located in the same building as the embassy.</p>
<p>As a result, countries have multiple consulates that do A, and single embassy that does A+B. So some refer to consulates as &quot;secondary embassies&quot;, kind of like the difference between a supermarket and a neighborhood store, although that's not quite accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't know some of them doubled as each other. An American friend of mine accidentally visited the US embassy in the Netherlands for paperwork when she should have gone to the US consulate, and apparently the embassy workers there were quite pissed off at her 'stupidity'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In New Zealand (where I live) no ordinary folk is going to get through the doors of the US embassy in Wellington (the nation's capitol).  The US consulate in New Zealand is located in Auckland.  Makes sense because Auckland is by far the largest city in the country and most American tourists would pass through Auckland on their way into or out of the country.</p>
<p>The US consulate also sends staff on a road-trip around the country every year or so to offer consulate services to Americans living here (things like registering the birth of an American abroad, etc) to save people the trip to Auckland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, embassies can also provide the services of the consulate too. Generally the embassy is in the capital city of a country and consulates are in smaller cities, although there are exceptions to this (e.g. UK has a full embassy in Dubai and another in Abu Dhabi, although only Abu Dhabi is the capital of the country).</p></div>		</li>
