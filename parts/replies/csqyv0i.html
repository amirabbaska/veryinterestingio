			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this there were 2 versions of digg V4 that were being made. Towards the end they decided to go with the one that was more friendly to advertisers. So what happened was they took the idea of &quot;free internet run by the people for the people and gave advertizes too much power while launching a site that had not really been finished due to the fact they spent so much time creating another version they never used. Also at the same time the creator of Digg.com already left as CEO and took his money and ran (unknown if he left or was kicked out). On the last day people were pissed as started taking all the stories on reddit front page and submitted it to Digg and &quot;upvoted time&quot; to the Digg front page so it basically was the reddit front page.</p>
<p>I stayed on Digg about a year after the collapse and I really got to watch an amazing community get destroyed. The front page had stories with 2-4 thousand &quot;DIGGS&quot; (UPVOTES) that would have 200-300. Stories were normally found from all over the web and had this great mature debate that turned into almost complete silence. You have to understand from this story Digg was WAY WAY more popular then reddit was at the time and was getting 4-5 times more traffic and was on the news and a huge huge huge loyal following. The only main difference is that reddits following is more diverse and tends to be a bit more bark then bite. But time will tell with this one.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were all welcomed at the time. I see posts from the old-old-guard that occasionally talk about how angry users here were that their community was being changed by the Digg exodus, but as a part of that exodus, Reddit was extremely welcoming and very friendly. I didn't see anyone complain, but being a new user maybe I just didn't know where to look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of reddit but without memes, pictures and inside jokes. Just articles from around the web that people talked about without people ragging and cursing. It was just cool stuff being shared and people talking. You got to learn a lot and really felt like you were learning and taking part in a conversation. It was very liberal but not militant at all. I felt like when I left dig I learn things about politics, space, new inventions and upcoming technology and science. As much as I love reddit I feel like I always come away from it seeing cute dogs, inside jokes and comment fighting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kevin Rose has a habit of that. After he left Digg, didn't he try to start a new app that was a version of Digg called Milk? He drummed it up as the new great big app, made a staff to curate it, sold it quickly right as it was petering off, and the app fell apart. </p>
<p>I use to really enjoy him on TechTV back in the day, but seeing what looks like essentially him running a Ponzi scheme in the tech industry, I don't much care for him, or any of the guys from Tech TV (Leo Laporte is a giant douchebag)</p>
<p>Last I heard Kevin was working at Google, probably staring at the wall wondering what he'll screw someone over with next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the main issue was all front page submissions were sponsored advertisements.</p>
<p>They didn't even try to hide it, the actual user name of the submitter was the url for the website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They had it set up so websites would auto submit their content, and submitters or websites with the most followers got sent to the top. Theoretically this would allow non sites to be on top, but realistically ensured sites with strong advertising would dominate regardless of content.</p>
<p>I'm a little fuzzy since I was a redditor for a while before this went down, but I seem to remember they had database issues which meant they couldn't rollback, so they were stuck watching the whole thing burn down around them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also had issues with a small network of power users gaming the process to get their content on top, then selling that ability to marketers.  That was already pissing people off, but rather than fix the problem, Digg went &quot;hey that's not a bad idea&quot; and made it official policy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the reason they removed the &quot;bury&quot; (downvote) option. They could manipulate the algorithm to promote ads on the front page but the system wouldn't have worked predictably if their ads could have been removed by massive numbers of downvotes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Burying (i.e. Digg's version of downvoting)</p>

<p>That what basically killed the site (at least for me). If user couldn't bury things, then there was no control. It became a more horrible version of facebook. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Downvoting was a way the users could have some say in what made the front page. Burying was something that, at times, made Digg a special place. It also made it really odd, because you'd have the &quot;bury brigade&quot;, where basically the whole discussion thread was burying to oblivion. Unlike Reddit, where you're 'not supposed to use the downvote as a disagree button' (despite the fact that its almost always used that way), Digg didn't try to discourage that kind of activity.  </p>
<p>So if the Digg folks wanted paid content, but it sucked it would get burying to oblivion. You couldn't just show up and pay someone, you had to add value to get attention. But then when you could have a say in what content you could see anymore, it made the voting meaningless. Someone could easily create a few hundred accounts and make the front page by upvoting it because no one could burying it (regardless of it quality).  </p></div>		</li>
