<p>The Brits used to be in charge and--at least inasmuch as interactions in daily life inside the US are concerned, that still matters. So much so that claiming British heritage in the US when you're not literally British in the present tense is a little like claiming aristocracy when everyone can plainly see you're not aristocratic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add to that the large amounts of Irish that came into the US (both before and during the 19th century) brought with them even more cultural distaste for anything English, despite living in a country founded by English protestants. (No hate, I've got both lines myself).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, it's crazy: my mom, who was in American high school in the 60's--whose family had been in the US since <em>before</em> the Revolutionary War--tells me about how the Protestant English-American families in her school ( who had also been in America for several generations, as well ) would forbid their children from dating Irish-Americans or Catholics. </p>
<p>I'm so glad the generations after her could give a shit. It would be so tiring to keep up the pretense of making an enemy out of your neighbor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Teeaboo (<a href="http://www.antimoon.com/how/pronunc-soundsipa.htm" target="_blank">ti:É™bu:</a>)</p>
<p>A Teeaboo is someone who worships pretty much anything that is English or related to English culture. The implication is very negative and often is an accusation of wanting to 'be English' (or whatever their warped perception and idealisation of Englishness may be).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always knew about it, but never really pointed it out until I moved to Japan, where lots of people needed help sorting out the fact that they'd meet Americans who didn't seem to have common national customs. Explaining that my family is partially British went a long way in explaining why my family has certain customs that other Americans in Japan might not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, now i'm curious what people in Japan think american national customs are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tend to just know a small handful of non Japanese people casually, and know what those people have told them about themselves. This in an international, semi tourist environment, so the collection of people they know might be like--one African-American dude from New Orleans, a white guy from Mississippi, two Harvard grads, and a trucker from Michigan. All of these friendships blossoming through the veil of about ten percent functional English. </p>
<p>So, when these Japanese people meet me ( I spoke Japanese well enough to go to college in Japan and get a normal job ), they're like, &quot;Dude--what's up with your culture? I hear you eat crawfish, but the dude from Michigan said he'd never had them. What's a crawfish?&quot; and so on. </p>
<p>Honestly, I think Japan--and every other country--is the same way: lots of people, lots of variations in culture. But, in America at least, being able to say, &quot;I'm half Puerto Rican, quarter Filipino--and quarter Irish,&quot; is an important part of explaining culture. </p></div>		</li>
