Potential &quot;cloud colonists&quot; would not need a pressure suit, only an oxygen supply, and enough shielding from sulfuric acid rains.</p>

<p>Oh, well, that sounds reasonable. We just need to figure out how to float in the atmosphere, keep oxygen coming, and keep out acid, but at least we won't need air conditioning. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The pressure won't change the energy required to denature the proteins, no, so your tongue won't get cooked. The evaporation will cool you down, though, so it'll likely have the opposite effect and cause surrounding tissue to freeze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would actually cause the body to suffer instant freezer burn, because the evaporating fluid would draw heat away. Which is not too dissimilar from burning in the ways we need to worry about.</p>
<p>Edit: To be clear the freezing and &quot;burning&quot; are not the same effect. Your flesh would freeze because it loses a ton of heat (it can easily get colder than the atmosphere around it), and it would &quot;burn&quot; because it simultaneously becomes completely dried out. There wouldn't be the sort of chemical change we see from cooking (and then burning) organic tissue, but it would look similar and be just as dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect of extremely low pressures on humans has been studied by the US military. When jet aircraft were developed, the Air Force was concerned that their pilots would not be able to safely eject at the altitudes reached by the new planes. They conducted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_High_Dive" target="_blank">Operation High Dive</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Excelsior" target="_blank">Project Excelsior</a> in Roswell, New Mexico to develop methods for safely returning pilots to earth. Operation High Dive involved dropping dummies off of weather balloons, and Excelsior did the same thing with a human named Joseph Kittinger.</p>
<p>The test &quot;pilot&quot; in Project Excelsior tore his glove during his third ascent, exposing his hand to extremely low pressure. He reported extreme pain and loss of function in his hand. Fortunately, his hand swelled up enough that it sealed off his suit at the wrist, protecting the rest of his body from near-vacuum exposure. He regained use of his hand several days later.</p>
<p>The syndrome caused by exposure of human tissue is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebullism" target="_blank">ebullism</a>. It's sort of similar to the decompression injury experienced by divers who ascend to the surface too quickly, but it is much more pervasive and severe. </p>
<p>You can find a nice summary of all the bad things that happen to people exposed to a vacuum <a href="http://asmameeting.org/asma2013_mp/pdfs/asma2013_present_039.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (if you like powerpoints) or <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2013/00000084/00000002/art00002?token=005d1c9f93056c0db6716720297d76345f7b514a757a4138593b406d3f6a4b6e4e395e4e6b6331b1695b81fb2c2dc" target="_blank">here</a> (if you like scientific review articles).</p></div>		</li>
