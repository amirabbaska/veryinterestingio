			<div class="markdown"><p>Kepler'll get close enough that the earth's gravity will redirect things a bit, but I think it'll actually mean that Kepler will have what would be referred to as a horseshoe orbit, where the earth interactions will put it into higher and lower speed orbits: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meet up as in get within about four lunar distances from Earth, before Earth's gravity boosts it from an earth-trailing to an earth-leading orbit or vice-versa - so if space infrastructure is sufficiently advanced by then, I feel it might be feasible to rendezvous with and capure it in the 2060 or 2117 close approach, to put it into a museum, since the relative velocity is relatively low.</p></div>		</li>
