			<div class="markdown"><p>The explanation I heard is that the expansion of the universe causes light to get more redshifted if it's coming from further away and the light from very far away galaxies is so far into the IR end of the spectrum that it's practically undetectable. </p>
<p>Any truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distant light is detectable by telescopes but the redshift reduces its energy. It basically means that the most distant stars appear much colder and fainter than they physically were.</p>
<p>Same for the cosmic microwave background, it was emitted when all of space was a bit like one giant star. The expansion of space has redshifted that light so much it's now equivalent to the faint thermal radiation of an object a few degrees above absolute zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  The speed of expansion of Space Time is faster between two points as those two points get farther away from each other.  Eventually that expansion is faster than the speed of light, and this does correspond to light getting redshifted to infinity and thus undetectable.  However it’s deeper than that, because this is actually the speed of <em>causality</em> we’re talking about, meaning that threes fundamentally no way for further information to pass between those two points; the frequency of light is just one aspect of this. </p>
<p>Another factor is that in the early years of the universe, matter was still packed densely enough that virtually all light was re-absorbed very soon after it was emitted.  So we can’t see light from, say, 1 second after the Big Bang, because all those photons were intercepted by other matter before they could get very far.  As the universe expanded, the average distance a photon could travel increased, until finally it reached a point where that distance was virtually unbounded.   The light from this moment is what we see as the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.  That’s the earliest light we can see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. If you could see in the entire electromagnetic spectrum, the night sky <em>would</em> be &quot;bright&quot;. Basically you would see what those images of the CMB show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment above is correct. Though would add that there is no section of the sky that is completely dark. You can pick any section and use our most delicate instruments and you would see a field full of astronomical objects, but this is more a limitation of our instruments. (For example, The Hubble Ultra Deep Field : <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field</a></p>
<p>But overall, there is a horizon to the Universe defined by the Observable Universe and the Visible Universe.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe is non-uniform as you look backwards in time.</p>
<p>Lots of giantic low metal stars and galaxy formation if you look back far enough which doesn't look like the universe in our immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>And the CMBR is just light that was 14.5 Byr old or so from when the universe was entirely a 3000K plasma.  We observe the CMBR and we're &quot;seeing&quot; the universe that long ago and it looks nothing like what we see now.  </p>
<p>And if there's an alien race 14.5B light-years away or so, if they point a radiotelescope in our direction what they'll be seeing is the 3000K plasma that used to exist where you're standing now.</p></div>		</li>
