			<div class="markdown"><p>If you work with these (and for so many years)  how can you NOT know that most conditioners have contained silicones<br />
to coat the hair?   Two in one DO often contain the original conditioner ingredients.      Please go read some labels and you will see.   I wish I could bet you.   Silicone,  dimethicone,  and panthenol,   as well as ceramides,   and many other ingredients in conditioner,   are often used in the two in one products.</p>
<p>I read all labels and will double check today.    Silicones by the way can build up horribly on hair over time -- at some point you do have to rinse those out or it just gets dead looking.    That's why many longhaired types (like me)   at some point do a Dawn rinse to get it all off and then re-condition freshly (a LOT.)     Curious to know which manufacturer you work with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never said conditioners don't contain silicone, but definitely ALL conditioners don't.  We pretty much break formulas into two categories: ones that contain silicone (a bitch to clean, special attention to wastewater) and all the others.  Most conditioners we do are just emulsions and no big deal to clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's a whole &quot;movement&quot;  of using &quot;no-cone&quot;   shampoos and conditioners.   It is often the main ingredient in smoothing serums and really they charge way too much for some brands -- claiming they have ingredients better than the rest.   Mostly if not all,   they are the same exact ingredients as the cheapest ones.   Dimethicone is dimethicone.   It coats,   but it doesn't create NEW hair.   What about meadowfoam?   I love what that does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AND -  it stops up bathtub drains - AND typical sulfuric acid doesn't clear it.    Clogs of hair and silicone-based product must be manually cleaned and pushed through to the sewer - AND that's some of the stuff that is treated and recycled through for our drinking water.  Where does the silicone go?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey what I have been doing (sick of the gross clogs)   is using this thing called a hair catcher.   You do have to manually dump it in the garbage  (gross but fascinating to see what it catches)   and yes it is usually mostly conditioner,   the fatty stuff,   stearic acids I think,   that really conditions for those of us with long dead hair.  I got it from Walmart I think,    and its great for not getting yr drain clogged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Having worked on the wastewater side of the industry in the past I can confirm this.  We have on-site wastewater treatment that has to grab the silicone and get it out of the wastewater.  The treatment plants hate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it kinda depends on your hair.  If you're really trying to be stylish, it's probably not good, but then again you're probably using expensive product anyway, not a 2-in-1.  If you're just a regular Joe, it's fine.  I always advise people to use the cheapest stuff possible, because it's all the same anyway.  I get mine for free, so it's hard for me to judge.  Plus pretty much all the people involved in developing and making this stuff are old guys with buzz cuts like me.  I barely need shampoo. </p>
<p>Oh, and in a second, a guy will probably pop in here and tell us how it's not all the same.  But I have the formulas here on my desk.  And I'm sitting 100 yards from a giant silo of surfactant that goes into all the shampoo, from the ones in Wal-mart to the salon brands with the movie star's name on the bottle.  The trace ingredients that are featured prominently on the label do exactly nothing and are in such small amounts that they couldn't have an effect even if they are good for your hair.  I see the formula revisions where the expensive raws get slashed to the minimum FDA allowable levels in order to cut costs but still be able to claim them on the label.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be the truth I didn't want to hear, but secretly knew all along. I've used both very expensive and very cheap shampoos and conditioners and I've noticed very little difference in results, however sometimes the really cheap stuff makes my scalp itch/burn and flake.</p></div>		</li>
