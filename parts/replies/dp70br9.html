<p>Birth rates is a fascinating topic, and this crude model doesn't do it justice.</p>
<p>It implies inevitability, and doesn't account enough for different societies than the post-WWII Western model.</p>
<p>For an extreme example, were it not for WWII, the eugenics policies across Europe would not have been reversed, and especially in Germany you would have seen far higher birth rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting idea. But maybe it would have just been the exception to the rule? There's also the possibility that people would have rebelled against the policy over time if it seemed unnatural to them. I do agree with you that the model is not inevitably true, when I was in grad school they usually seemed to imply that it was just a very strong tendency that seems to have applied across numerous, very different cultures as they modernized. </p>
<p>One other possible exception, will the concept of demographic transition continue to hold up if we end up living in a super affluent &quot;robot future&quot; and people no longer have to devote their lives to work? It seems possible that if there's some sort of welfare, people might start having a ton of kids again just to give themselves purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can examine Romania, which forcibly tried to increase its birth rate after it leveled off in the 1960s. The result was a baby boom - but it wasn't sustainable. By the 1990s birth rates fell again. The same thing would have happened in Germany. There are currently efforts ongoing in Japan to increase the birth rate, to very minor success. However once those policies are removed or end, the birth rate should fall again, in line with demographic determination. </p>
<p>So you can fight demographics via targetted policy, but it doesn't change the underlying phenomenon. You're still rowing against the tide of demographic change, not changing the course of the river.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>What I'm saying is that it is a cultural phenomenon, not an inevitability. The culture changes were inevitable to begin with, but they could be changed further to increase birth rates.</p>
<p>You would have to change the underlying culture, e.g. not shaming women who balance careers and families; accepting births outside marriage; move away from a materialist/consumerist worldview (where children are seen as too expensive, or an annoyance); move to balance the ratio of females:males in areas where the ratio is too extreme.</p>
<p>I used Nazism as an example, because they changed the underlying culture in a radical way; but you can directly compare the birth rates of two technologically equivalent countries (e.g. Germany and Sweden) and find differences in the birth rates to be largely attributable to different cultural values.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Birth rates was a statistic that I was using in another topic</p>
<p>The demographic transition has nothing to do with WWII</p>
<p>At that time it was almost over for those societies that were in the first generation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Were it not for WWII, we'd have a very different demographic transition model. So yes, it has a lot to do with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. Japan and Germany are neck in neck in terms of net population growth, sometimes one is a little lower, sometimes the other.<br />
There are several countries in Europe with significantly higher level of population decline than Japan, but talking about the population decline in non German EU countries isn't sexy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US isn't far behind.  Japan has a fertility rate of 1.5 and the US is only at 1.8.  Both of these are population decline(birthrate must be over 2.0 for population increase to occur).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also be interesting to consider European migrants when looking at European population growth. Millions of people left the continent for the Americas, parts of Asia/Africa and Australia from 1650-1990. By a percentage of the global population there are probably more people of European descent today than prior to the age of colonization.</p></div>		</li>
