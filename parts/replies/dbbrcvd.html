			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think I'm somehow sensitive to moon phases because I would always sleep badly when there was a full moon. Then I made sure my bedroom was dark and no more moon phases. Having a dark (as in &quot;can't see your hands before your eyes&quot; dark) bedroom really helps with sleep. Doesn't take a high-tech gadget to know that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well a high tech gadget would be able to tell you your room's light level is changing on a monthly basis, but it couldn't tell you how prone you are to light based interruption without a statistically large sample size (several months).</p>
<p>That said though, you had a hunch which turned out to help, thats not really something you can gloat over. I could say that turning the TV on full blast helps improve my sleep because I can't sleep properly without it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that if I learnt the proper sleep conditions I wouldn't sleep better, thats what the gadget is for. (Although its not technically a gadget at the light testing level, that would be medical equipment, those things are expensive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical grade ones almost all do, and cost ~$1k+, although they're getting significantly cheaper with smart watch tech improving their systems.</p>
<p>That said though, a combo system would be more useful, with a watch for skin contact and a separate light sensor to tell when you turn out the lights and the ambient light levels during your sleep, but in the interest of simplicity for recording they just deal with the fact you'll put your wrist under the covers sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
