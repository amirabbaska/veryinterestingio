			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the question I have, is what could bacteria before that time digest? Was it the beta linkages on cellulose that prevented them from being to metabolize it for <em>100 million</em> years? Could it be that given the enzymatic palette that bacteria have now, the jump needed to be able to digest plastics would be less prohibitive, and could occur sooner?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just working off wikipedia here, but it looks like the problem material was lignin, a fiber that's used to make bark. Early trees had many times more bark than modern ones, and the bark contained more lignin, to deal with all the herbivorous insects that weren't yet controlled by predators and poisons. According to the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lignin is insoluble, too large to pass through cell walls, too heterogeneous for specific enzymes, and toxic, so that few organisms other than Basidiomycetes fungi can degrade it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even today, there's not much that digests wood, just a handful of organisms that became widespread due to their ability. I honestly have no idea what would be required for something to evolve the ability to eat plastic, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just bark, it's a very strong polymer that helps support most of the cellulose based walls in woody plants (trees). More important in the supporting structures than the outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems it could at some point be beneficial to be a tree that decays. It should provide more nutrients to the coming generation, or could the trees back then get nutrients from dead trees?</p></div>		</li>
