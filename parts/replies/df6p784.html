			<div class="markdown"><p>The expansion of space is only noticeable at the intergalactic level. All of the fundamental forces are exponentially stronger than it and overcome it to keep things near each other as we expect them to be. It basically only affects the distance between galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark energy may still 'work' inside the event horizon of a black hole, but it's not strong enough to cause space to expand in those conditions. Nor, for that matter, is it strong enough to cause space to expand on the scale of the solar system, or even the galaxy.</p>
<p>Essentially, dark energy just provides uniform mass-energy in empty space, such that the equations of general relativity predict expansion at the observed rate. The strange thing about it is that it doesn't dilute as space expands - more space, more dark energy, more expansion, etc. </p>
<p>But it's very thin, so that in a region where there are other sources of mass-energy, there's no predicted expansion.</p></div>		</li>
