			<div class="markdown"><p>An old employer.... in my first week I had been treated worse in my bosses office then I have ever been treated at work in my life.</p>
<p>I am a guy.... and I had to go to a private area and cry.  I had been laid off for 18 months (recession of 08) and this was my first full-time job back - and I had landed here.</p>
<p>2 weeks later I walked into my bosses office and I told her that the way I was treated was abusive and unacaptable.  I spent 5 years in a boiler room as a telemarketer - and the way I was treated was worse.</p>
<p>She looked at me and told me that she didn't understand what I was talking about, this is how adults treat each other.</p>
<p>Later on I kind of figured out what was going on.  The entire corporate culture - from the top down - was abusive.  People treated others like they where being treated.  It was the new normal.  The longer you stayed the more you just figured this is how life is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, the reason why is because they don't know anything else, and they think that the abuse is normal. It's what they grew up with, and what they were raised on. It's familiar to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this to be true in most cases.  Anyone who has ever been around a woman that stays in an abusive relationship over a long period of time can only come to this conclusion.  There's no other valid reason, besides it feels familiar &amp; it's similar to the example of love that they saw (or experienced) as a child.  </p>
<p>Love &amp; abuse get all mixed up together, and they can't feel loved if there's no abuse paired with it.</p></div>		</li>
