<p>if the trucks are pulling out at 0200 in the city before yours and it's a 7 hour drive, load in isn't starting before 0900 no matter what else happens.</p>
<p>the amount of time it takes to set up a show is still the same day to day on a tour whether it's loading in at 0800 or 0900.</p>
<p>have a look at the cities around you that similar bands also play, see if there's one that's further away than the rest and is the stop before you that's regularly the one causing late starts.</p></div>		</li>
