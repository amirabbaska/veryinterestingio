<p>We didn't want to fight Iran directly.  We let Saddam do it.  It was a very bloody conflict for both sides.  You could believe that maybe Iran would have waged its own invasions or sponsored more terrorism or sponsored more radical theocracies in its neighbors if it wasn't at war with Iraq.  Or that OPEC would have consolidated more without that war.  But no one can know that.  </p>
<p>Saddam thought his relationship with the US was strong enough that we'd just complain.  Maybe, privately, the US leaders would celebrate the expansion of his secular rule?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll say. I read a book called 1001 Nights In Iraq, about a guy who had immigrated to the united states when he was a teenager, and became a citizen, but later visited Iraq to see his father, intending only to stay a week or 2. Unfortunately, Saddam invaded Iran and shut off the borders, and forced all military age men to enlist within 72 hours or be shot, including him. He said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing was accomplished whatsoever by the Iran-Iraq. When asked the common question &quot;Who won the war?&quot; —Although Iraq was considered the victor— most Iraqi's would answer &quot;Both sides lost.&quot; The only positive thing that the Iraqis thought came out of the war was the belief that their generation would never see war again. They were convinced that the Iran-Iraq War experience was so horrible that it would deter any man, even one like Saddam Hussein, from engaging in another conflict during his lifetime. In less than 2 years, Saddam Hussein proved them all wrong.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a clear winner in the Iran-Iraq war. The US and its allies. They orchestrated the weakening of two of the most powerful enemies in the Middle East without having to use their own man power and by making money selling weapons to both sides.</p>
<p>Saddam was backed by the US in his take over of the Iraq government and the only intention was for him to do major damage to Iran. Once he was done they coaxed him into invading Kuwait (they told Kuwait, a us ally, not to give any debt forgiveness and to cause animosity with oil drilling and prices) and then started a war to end his reign and fuel the military industrial complex of America (basically make the American military companies rich off American tax payer money). They failed to finish his reign, but probably thought that it would be good since he was essentially KOed and they could do it again later.</p>
<p>Then in 2002 The whole bullshit starts again and the American military industrial complex is fed again (all the major companies that supplied goods to the military backed the invasion 100% even companies like Microsoft). Then when it was too late they say, &quot;oops we didn't have a reason to invade, but your unamerican and a terrorist if you question whether the results of the invasion were good for the country.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's hard to remember now but Saddam really was considered to be a pretty decent secular counter in the region. Friend? Well, not quite friend. Still, a heck of a lot better than the flat out death-to-america crowd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They should not have been suprised. In a book titled The History of the Middle East, it talks about how more then one country in the region was uneasy about Saddam and his power, and they weren't sure if he would stop at just Kuwait. Specifically the Sauds disliked Saddam, and thought he might be seizing oil fields in the region and complained to the US about their concerns. The US then quickly crushed Saddam so he wouldn't seize more oil fields and stop him from going any further. Not only did the Gulf War send a powerful message to the Sauds about our allegiance, but it also maintained a more diverse market of oil providers by not having Saddam control neighboring oil fields of countries who already provide oil to the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US gave lots of money to Saddam, which he used to buy US weapons, in order to fight Iran. A decade prior, the US had given lots of weapons to Persia, then ruled by the Shah, which it considered a bulwark against Communism. The US, upset over the loss of their biggest ally in the region, oh and religious extremism something something, wanted Saddam to fight Iran. Despite his funding, he wasn't able to annex any Iranian territory (if only those religious nuts had been so kind as to return all weapons the Shah had purchased...) </p>
<p>After the expensive war, Iraq was in debt, and the US no longer cared about Iraq because it had shown it wasn't able to fight Iran. The gassing mostly happened while Iraq was fighting Iran (the good Iraq). What happened next, the invasion of a former British protectorate that was a steady oil supplier for Western countries, was the bad Iraq.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, I've heard that Saddam deliberately tried to have high casualties in some of his lesser, ill equipped conscripted units as a means to achieve a political victory, in addition to having a lot of civilians in the crossfire and whatnot. Militarily he didn't stand a chance against the US and I believe he knew that, but politically he did stand a chance to meet his ends. He relied on the notion that he could repeat the Vietnam scenario, where the US public, after witnessing all the carnage through the media, would oppose American intervention in Iraq in the same way that people protested the Vietnam War. </p>
<p>Though we worked with Saddam Hussein in the past, I really don't think he viewed us as an ally. We supplied satellite imagery for his military in the Iran Iraq War in the 80s, for example, but that is mainly because we really didn't like Iran and their new theocratic government and Iran taking over would destabilize the area even more.</p>
<p>All in all, his invasion of Kuwait... was fucking horrible and he's definitely rotting in the lowest level of hell for all he did, but it was a logical enough move given Iraq's economy at the time and how feasible it would be to resolve all their debt by capturing what many Iraqis kinda viewed as part of Iraq anyways, in Kuwait. </p>
<hr />
<p>On another note, I kinda have an unpopular opinion among liberals. Our 2003 invasion was not a mistake. It started off pretty decently. We rolled in got the job done, put an absolute sack of inhuman garbage in the fucking dirt, and had things relatively peaceful for a short period while the dust settled. </p>
<p>Our mistake was having former US diplomat Paul Bremer figure the aftermath of OIF out, because he ruined everything and I think he is the reason for the existence of ISIS in the modern era. Really long story, but basically he disestablished the Iraqi Army (which was a very bad call, as now there were a bunch of unemployed military aged males on the loose <em>and</em> Iraq didn't have a centralized means of defense and stability). Without the Iraqi Army (which for the most part wasn't <em>that</em> loyal to Saddam, more just to Iraq and themselves), it created a power vacuum that allowed groups like Al Qaeda in Iraq to come out of the woodworks. </p>
<p>Then, we fucked up even harder by putting a corrupt Shia shitbag in office (and he purged and put a bunch of Shia figures in Sunni positions) further pissing off all these unemployed Sunni military aged males. Furthermore, we, for some fucking stupid reason, replaced the Ba'athist leaders who maintained the infrastructure. We got rid of the military, we created a weak infrastructure, installed a corrupt government, created some hella unemployment, and... it wasn't that we went to Iraq, it's that we went to Iraq incompetently without a long term plan and fucked everything up. Not that Iraq wasn't already fucked up to begin with though. There's been a long history of differences between the ethnic groups in the area, there was a long series of coups before Saddam, Saddam's regime was a violent shit-show, and the land is honestly probably cursed by some sort of evil wizard or something, because the entire region, despite the really really cool things about it, is the definition of shit hitting the fan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The disbanding of the army was the worst possible idea, and some of the previous officers are now why ISIS is militarily quite effective. I remember hearing about this when it happened, and even Fox News sounded worried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem of the 2003 invasion wasn't the action of our troops. It was the action of our leaders. The entire thing was a half-brained clusterfuck of miscommunication and politically-motivated dick sucking.</p>
<p>Saddam got what was coming. There was no way we could trust him and his regime after all the stunts he pulled. It's just that we invaded Iraq with absolutely no idea of what the fuck we were really going to do. The politicians were just trying to quickly score points while senior military officers trying to get a notch on their belt for another &quot;job well done&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I strongly believe one of the most biggest disasters was when Saddam set fire to the oil fields.  1.5 <del>MMMbbls</del> billion bbls of oil was released in the environment, 300x more than the BP oil spill in Macondo.  There are a few good documentary's about it and it takes balls to control those wells.</p></div>		</li>

I think it was worse when he gassed his people (multiple times), burned down entire forests of Kurdistan, launched attack helicopters on the Kurds, and drained the marshes. I'm not saying it wasn't bad, but I'm saying the extent of Saddam Hussein's evil goes further. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that the burned wells were those that Saddam had accused the Kuwaitis of slant-drilling. It was not this random act of terrorism as American propaganda suggested.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p><a href="http://redactie.radiocentraal.org/2007/Red070804_IrakOlieMap.pdf" target="_blank">Map of Iraqi oilfields</a>, you must zoom in to see the names of individual fields.</p>
<p>The Rumaila South field was the one in greatest contention, but Safwan were also allegedly tapped with slant drilling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-the-oilfield-lying-below-the-iraq-kuwait-dispute.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Article on the dispute over Rumaila South takings</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.kpc.com.kw/InformationCenter/PublishingImages/map.jpg" target="_blank">Map of Kuwaiti oilfields</a>. The Rumaila South field is named Ratqa in Kuwait.</p>
<p>Turns out the Burgan field -- far south from the border -- was also burned by the Iraqis... about 180 wells burned, so I was wrong. Iraq probably set the fires more as a statement about over-quota production than about slant-drilling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubtful.  There is no proof of this, actually there is more evidence to suggest that they didn't slant drill.</p>
<p>Saddam torched wells during 2003 also.  I guess those wells were slant drilled.   Even if they were, the most proper thing to do was to torch them.</p></div>		</li>
