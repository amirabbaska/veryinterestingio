			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post! Only little nitpick is that constriction really works by cutting off blood flow and causing cardiac arrest rather than slowly asphyxiating the prey. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you somehow found your way into a feeding constriction, chances are probably not. They are <em>ridiculously</em> fast. Watching my boa or ball when they strike at a rat is like lightning. They strike and have a coil around it before I can even drop it from the tongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PJ_F64nzzqI?t=543" target="_blank">Here is a video of Brian Barczyk feeding his large constrictors</a> just to get a little sense of the speed of a large constrictor's feeding strike. Even the large ones are fast when they need to be, and since they're almost entirely muscle, a 40 pound snake can easily manhandle a 150+ pound prey. </p>
<p>Biting wouldn't really do too much to a determined snake either. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVRhRzE_AkQ" target="_blank">Here's a video of a Burmese python in Florida taking down and eating a subadult alligator.</a></p>
<p>And constriction is <em>fast</em>. A few minutes tops for the largest prey, and seconds for small prey. </p>
<p>It's highly unlikely that you would ever find yourself in a true feeding constriction though, because even the largest snakes don't particularly see us as food. We are too awkwardly shaped for them. Especially being bipedal with wide shoulders. Even the very largest ones cannot really fit their jaws all the way around our shoulders, so we are pretty much a waste of time and energy for them. Most of the time a story of a snake, especially a pet snake, killing someone is because the snake was defending itself, or trying to get a solid hold on the person holding it because it was scared and being held up. </p>
<p>If you see a snake, especially a large constrictor, in the wild, just watch it from a distance. They're still wild animals that will readily defend themselves, but will almost always try to escape first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah it actually stops the heart itself, not just blood flow to the brain. I'll find a link.</p>

<p>Basically, they apply so much pressure across a large enough area of the body that the heart cannot pump against it, and the main organs go into ischemic shock from lack of blood flow. </p></div>		</li>
