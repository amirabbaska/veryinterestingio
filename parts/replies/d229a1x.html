			<div class="markdown"><p>Lighting also plays a big part. One trick to looking good in pictures is to turn your face slightly away from the camera and point your eyes at the camera. This is particularly useful if a flash is being used. Facing straight at a camera with a flash will make your face look flat since there are no shadows to bring out facial features and contours. </p>
<p>edit: Here's a good example of how turning your face just a little can make for a really nice picture: <a href="http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m06bqaUu6m1qcijoio1_500.jpg" target="_blank">http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m06bqaUu6m1qcijoio1_500.jpg</a></p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>So, with that being the only picture of that girl that I could find, the point isn't quite coming across right. So, here's a subject I find particularly interesting. Emma Stone. Frankly, she is a bit odd looking. That's not bad. In fact, that's part of what makes her so attractive to a lot of people; however, her looking straight at the camera is not a particularly flattering angle. Here are some examples of her facing straight at the camera:</p>

<p>and here is the difference a bit of tilt can make</p>

<p>Of course, there are a lot of factors that will determine how a picture comes out, but this is one very simple trick that will rarely let you down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just kidding. I came here for advice on how to stop looking like an idiot in pictures, and this (hopefully) helped. However, I'm relatively sure I'm going to come out looking like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ace+ventura&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4iaPPrI7MAhVsmYMKHS6-DIkQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=1442&amp;bih=820#imgrc=eWomLks03RnIaM%3A" target="_blank">this</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. Well, my recommendation would be to experiment with the position of your face anytime a picture is taken. If you want to make sure you've nailed it, practice on your own.</p>
<p>Models don't just happen to look good on camera by chance. They practice poses and manipulating facial expressions. In the first example I posted, that girl has most definitely practiced that look.</p>
<p>A lot of times, what you're doing feels very unnatural, but when you look at the picture, it'll look like you weren't trying or forcing anything. You only need to point your nose about half an inch off to one side for there to be a noticeable effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not quite true. Symmetry is not a desirable trait. Mirror anyone attractive across the vertical center line of their face and you have an instant serial killer on your hands.</p>
<p>What is actually attractive is the proportional size of our features and their composition in relation to each other.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be specific, it's 99% of the time about your jawline, correctly due to depth perception. </p>
<p>Saying to stick your chin out will confuse people. Try saying 'move your forehead forward'. It works like a charm.</p>
<p>Other than that you can try raising your lower eyelids. It's difficult at first, but it makes you look 10x more confident, mysterious, sexy and seductive (works fine in corporate photos).</p>
<p>Can provide picture examples from my portfolio, but try for yourself in a selfie and you will see what I'm talking about. It's 2 really basic things I instruct all my clients to do and it works wonders.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that the goal? If so then I'd say &quot;stick your chin out&quot; is not confusing, but advice which if followed without confusion produces the wrong result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do want to bring your head slightly downwards. That is exactly what makes the difference from sticking your chin out, and your forehead out. You want to get as sharp as jawline as possible, which you will not get by bringing your chin forward alone (and it just looks strange), but by bringing your chin down as well, the jawline is way more defined in front of your neck.</p>
<p>The lack of depth perception in cameras is also what allows this trick to work. It will look strange in person, but on a 2d image it's perfectly fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I photograph &quot;non-professionals&quot; for a living.... also known as a wedding and portrait photographer.  Angles and the conversion from 3D to 2D are not the reason that some people look bad in photos. They contribute along with shading/lighting to make a specific photo look good or bad. </p>
<p>However, as a human being you experience so many other cues to  tell you someone is attractive. You'll notice a flitting smile, a great voice, confidence, perfume and probably a lot more. The camera sees one element that existed for a fraction of a second.</p>
<p>Also, some people get freaking awkward the second you point a camera at them.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Some people may ask the next logical question: How can I look better in photos?
My method for working with clients is basically this: I do my best to help create an environment where people can have fun and actually be happy. Yes, angles, lighting composition do change the shape of your face and body. A good photographer knows this, and those types of things are a given. Getting some life and personality to come out in your photos is the biggest struggle for most people. </p>
<p>There is a lot of psychology behind this: If you force yourself to smile and laugh you will eventually become more happy. Working with clients I try not to be so transparent, but I'm working to get people to into a mindset where they actually feel happy, relaxed, and with a significant other, actually in love. The takeaway is this, when you're out with friends and want to look happy in a photo trick yourself into feeling happy. Think about something funny and make yourself laugh slightly before a photo... Or start forcing yourself to smile more a few minutes before a photo if you can.  A fun, happy smile can make up for a lot of other detractors in your appearance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, you have to capture the dynamics of the personality in a single, static image. I was tasked with getting a photo of a dancer, holding a trophy. I'd done some candid shots of this girl before, so I knew what I was up against. She was considered quite good-looking, and has done well in some beauty competitions. But photos never seemed to capture that very well. A lot of it was due to her smile. She was accustomed to smiling big for the camera, but that didn't quite work well. So I had her hold the trophy, got the camera ready, then told her to &quot;not smile&quot;. She was caught by surprise with that request, but complied. I then told her to think of something that she'd done, that her parents wouldn't find out about for twenty years. Then I shot at a high frame rate while she started to crack a fun smile. Got the perfect shot.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it exactly. All the other stuff about angles and lighting is actually secondary to the core issue, which is learning to relax and cultivate a happy, peaceful mental state. Absolutely do not try to force your head or body into poses unless you're a trained model, you're going to look weird and awkward. If you want to look good in a photo think about your happiest memories, the most relaxing thing that ever happened to you, or imagine you're floating in a warm bath on a tropical island somewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do 9 out of 10 professional photographers take photos of me that look nothing like me?  Is this just because they don't have the context of knowing which look is really mine, and so go for an image that &quot;looks good&quot; instead of &quot;looks like me?&quot;</p>
<p>I've found a few times that pros end up over-photoshopping my face, to the point where I need to take my own reference image and add back forehead and eye wrinkles, etc. so that I look like myself again.  And those were the higher-end portrait professionals.  Wedding photographers generally do better, as they spend more time with the subjects.  But I've even been at some weddings where the professionals saw my photos at the end and asked me how I got the shots... that was way back when I was using a point and shoot Minolta Dimage -- I just took about 500x more photographs than they did, and selected the best 100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without knowing more context I'd argue that you really don't know what you look like.  Our impressions of what we look like generally come from looking in the mirror... or selfies. When you're having your picture taken by someone else they're capturing angles and expressions that the rest of the world sees of you all the time.... you're just not used to it.</p></div>		</li>
