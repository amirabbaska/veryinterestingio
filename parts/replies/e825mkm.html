<p>There isn't actually a difference between basic stimuli response and intelligence. Intelligence is just a huge pile of stimuli responses piled on top of each other. This makes the intelligence appear more complex.</p>

<p>This. This is exactly what I was wondering. Is it a true continuum, or is there a &quot;quantum&quot; difference, a tipping point (whatever you want to call it) where it becomes something &quot;more?&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really a hard tipping point. The [link] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox</a>) that /u/-revenant- provided in another comment sums it up very nicely using grains of sand. There isn't really a hard line between whether a bunch of grains of sand are a heap of sand or not. </p>
<p>Because the group definition doesn't have a quantity-based definition, when it comes to stuff like heaps of sand or intelligence, we just kind of zoom out, look at the thing, and decide for ourselves if it is an example of the group or not.</p>
<p>People? Probably a big enough pile of stimulus responders to call it intelligence. Dolphins? Probably enough. Dogs? Certainly a big enough pile to not just be stimuli responders, but maybe not big enough to be intelligence. Ants? Too small of a pile to be intelligence as individuals, but can we consider the collection of individual piles to be one big hive pile, in which case it might be?</p>
<p>It's all very fuzzy.</p></div>		</li>
