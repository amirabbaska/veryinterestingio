			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the reason why the convention is never used is because people are afraid of what would happen if we had another constitutional convention. It was hard enough drafting a constitution when it was a bunch of people who just wanted the best deal for their state. Think about all the special interest involved if it happened again now. It would be a mess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, it would definitely be risky to call one of these. It's not just the special interest groups, either - it's not clear if we could even limit the scope of the convention to one topic. There was actually a serious attempt to call one of these conventions to pass a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment#National_Taxpayers_Union_and_an_Article_V_Constitutional_Convention" target="_blank">balanced budget amendment</a> in the 1980s, which would have prevented the federal government from spending more than it earned each year. Opponents of the convention were concerned that even if that amendment was passed, other amendments could be proposed - and it may not have ended until major parts of the Constitution had been rewritten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To refute your argument about the rejection of nullification, it's really only been tried once (by SC during the &quot;nullification crisis&quot;) and it was never actually challenged in the courts. It was rendered moot when it was essentially &quot;settled out of court&quot; when they replaced the original tariff bill with the compromise tariff of 1833</p>
<p>To be fair I'm going off the top of my head, don't have any sources in front of me so call me on it if I'm wrong </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_v._Aaron" target="_blank"><em>Cooper v. Aaron</em></a> resulted in a much more explicit rejection of nullification. Arkansas had passed laws that tried to prevent desegregation of their schools, and the argument was that the state deemed the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> ruling to be unconstitutional, and that the state therefore had the right to nullify it.</p>
<p>Citing <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, which established the Supreme Court as the final interpreter or the Constitution, the Court held that the <em>Brown</em> decision &quot;can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if it takes 3/4 of state legislators to call an Article V Convention to amend the Constitution making the President, President For Life, then it's just a matter of winning enough state houses to be able to ensure such a Convention would succeed, if those 3/4 of the country were so inclined.</p>
<p>The fact that that can happen is what is so scary. It wouldn't take long either if the judiciary refused to stay any such attempts and the 3/4 of the states were unified enough to want to go through with such a change.</p>
<p>In other words, The Constitution gives itself and the nation the power to kill itself, if enough of the population were so inclined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the Constitution is a piece of paper. If the people want a dictator the people will have a dictator.  It's not like you could write &quot;really really really with a cherry on top&quot; and make the Constitution extra powerful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. It is a piece of paper but it codifies and unites many ideals of human civilization and enshrines the basic freedoms that humans (living in America) have a right to. hold live as it pertains to being a citizen in a functioning and useful government. If humans choose to deny that to themselves, then so be it.</p></div>		</li>
