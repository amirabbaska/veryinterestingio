During my masters in music production I created a tutorial on how to implement this in order to isolate a vocal track from a full mix.  In other words create an accapella. Here you can watch it here: Creating an acapella using phase cancellation.mpg: <a href="http://youtu.be/gWggziOxce4" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/gWggziOxce4</a> it should explain quite nicely what lazyfrag is talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you mean just the accapella?  Yeah I'm sure you could probably find one. The point isn't the end product... it is the concept. Noise filtering is used in many applications (hence the existence of this thread). My tutorial just serves to educate people of the basic theory involved in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something I've been wondering for a while now and thought this was a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Did it used to be known as &quot;noise cancellation&quot; on the consumer side, but so many headphone makers and such also call noise isolation(eg closed cans) by the same name that it lost almost all meaning?</p>
<p>Asking because I swear it used to be a thing, but any more it's almost always just well insulated closed headphones.</p>
<p>/So many on the box specifications are now more buzzwords than useful info, it gets on my nerves. </p>
<p>Secondly, is there computer software that could do this in real time(say, to mute the ambient sounds of computer fans or air conditioning) or would the lag from processing be enough to mess it up?  Just another idle curiosity that i've had rambling around in my skull for a while.  Generally my cans isolate good enough I can tune the stuff out but it'd be fun to play with a little bit if it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, those noise-cancelling headphones have little microphones that analyze the sound and spit out in your ears the phase inversion of it. Sounds is air moving in and out, positive and negative pressure: a wave. When you slightly shift a copy of this wave, to where the &quot;peaks and valleys&quot; (that is, + and -)  and layer it over, it cancels itself out, as a negative plus a positive is a reduction. </p>
<p>This is why multi-miking acoustic instruments, particularly drums, is super tricky: say, one microphones is just positioned by distance to capture the negative pressure while another is capturing the sounds at a positive pressure. Because there will be enough variance in the overall sound each microphone is getting, and because the distances are unlikely to be each capturing the sound in exact opposing phase, the sound will not totally phase out, but can sound altered, hollow, and wierd when the sounds interact with eachother. It'll sounds &quot;flangy&quot; or &quot;phasey&quot;, just like the flanger or phaser guitar-fx (without the movement). This can be resolved with special techniques when positioning the mics, along with shifting signal in the analog or digital realm. In the old days, it was decidedly trickier. </p>
<p>You know what's neat? Imagine you are recording the top and bottom head of a drum: one mic on top, one on bottom. Visualize, in slow motion, what happens when the drum is hit. The two heads move in unison, vibrating back and forth. So as the top head moves in then out (down and up), the bottom head gets pushed out then in. When layering these microphone signals together, it's necessary to flip phase on one signal to get these in alignment when they combine.</p>
<p>A cool trick, just because I'm going off on a tangent, is that a singer who doesn't like wearing headphones when performing can overdub his parts while listening to the backing track through speakers, while still getting his vocal part recorded without picking up (too much) of the backing music. The output of the backing music is summed to mono and is played back through two speaker (so each has the same content) and polarity (phase) of one speaker is flipped. When positioned right and triangulated onto where the mic is, the singer can hear the music, but it gets nulled going into the mic and is not picked up in the recording. James Hetfield likes to do this, I think.</p>
<p>Note that two speakers out of phase sounds wierd, though. You've heard it a million times, but may not have been able to recognize what the particular problem was. It's a sort of &quot;head squishing, coming from the center of your face&quot; kind of effect. If you wire your speakers the wrong way and don't match the colored + and - cables, this'll happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent thought! The honest answer is that I'm not really sure. My initial guess is that such a thing might be impossible due to the length of the launch windows (it'd be hard to just launch them immediately behind the exact path of Voyager) or more likely just the expense of building and launching such relays. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With MCT/FH this may not be true anymore! I cannot wait for the day when our launch cadence is less than a week. (Quickest i think is 18 days)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Voyager missions consisted of several gravity assists. If we launched spacecrafts one after the other, the planets would have moved and the trajectories of the spacecrafts would be widely different.</p>
<p>Then the advantage is that we can build <em>massive</em> antennas on Earth and not care about power or weight. The antennas on a satellite are thus tiny because we can compensate with ground stations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even remotely an expert in this subject area but skimmed the comments and I don't see that anyone else has mentioned that Voyager also doesn't have much expected lifespan remaining (8-13 years according to Wikipedia before the generator runs out of power).</p>

<p>The current method that /u/lazyfrag explains is probably good enough to keep deciphering the signal until it can no longer send one. So on top of the other problems commenters have mentioned relays wouldn't significantly extend its mission.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. </p>
