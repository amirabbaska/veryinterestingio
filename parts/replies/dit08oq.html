			<div class="markdown"><p>This has me even more confused. What's the difference between the two? If I remember a taste or smell it's the same as remembering looking at something. It's not like what you imply, that when I want to remember seeing something the image appears in front of me, obscuring reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way you can remember something happening without really feeling like you are there experiencing it again.  They are just different. I'm skeptical of anyone who says they can actually taste it again, because its a physical sensation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  I can perfectly recreate almost everything I've ever smelled or tasted (for me it doesn't even have to be distinct), with the same clarity that I can recreate visual or auditory stimuli.  Had no idea that most people could not.  I'm not trained in any capacity, just a regular guy who smells and eats things.  I think these differences highlight one of the problems with people compartmentalizing brain physiology and function, because the brain is very plastic and heterogeneous between people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It opens up really interesting questions about how the brain works between different people. A lot of people are saying they can remember smells (like I do), but I'm not hearing much from people who say they can't. I want to ask these people if they can't remember most smells but can remember some. I honestly cannot believe that someone couldn't remember what diahhrea (for example) smells like from memory. Or their favorite food, or pizza, or a lemon, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine the taste of each to some extent, but not necessarily the smell. If you say how does a lemon smell I lack both the vocabulary and the mental smell. Though I can easily create mental images of those things. I have never thought about recalling smells a lot before this thread, possibly because I've never needed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough some people aren't able to picture visual sensations as well.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been thinking the same thing since I saw this post. Sometimes just even thinking about an extremely sour taste that I've encountered makes my whole mouth tingle and feel sour for a second. I thought this was just as normal a thing as any other sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't like, literally see an image or taste something again though right? Because that just sounds like a hallucination.</p>
<p>I can vividly recall images, sounds, smells, and flavors, but it's a distinctly different experience than experiencing a real-life stimulus.</p>
<p>The only time felt like I'm literally re-experiencing a stimulus is when I'm half-asleep, so I kinda chalk that up more-or-less hallucinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that you have particularly good memory for smell and taste, and that OP and some others have particularly bad (or average) memory for smell and taste. Some people have eidetic (&quot;photographic&quot;) memory, normal referring to visual images. You may have similar inclination for smells.</p>
<p>Neurologically, smell has a special place in our memory (and generaly neural processing). Most senses pass through the thalamus before being distributed to the different regions of the brain. Smell goes directly to &quot;lower&quot; (non-cortical) brain centers before hitting the thalamus and making its way to the reasoning/conscious/thinking parts of the brain. It hits the amygdala, for example, which handles emotions, and the hippocampus, which is memory- and emotion-oriented. In a way it's more deeply ingrained in our subconscious self.</p>
<p>Any of the senses can be trained to higher &quot;skill&quot; in discernment and recall, but like anything some people have to work harder for it than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting way to look at it. I have a very sensitive sense of smell and can usually describe what I am smelling. For example, someone walked into my meeting today with a cup of vanilla coffee. From across the room I could smell donuts because to me donuts smell like coffee and icing. Or at least I associate them together. I don't drink coffee but I know the smell. When I think of it I can imagine the smell. </p>
<p>For me, and I think some others here, its not the ability to remember or describe a smell that comes into question, its why you can't smell the memory of the smell without the scent present. When I remember something I have seen I can picture it in my mind's eye. I can play it back like a movie. Its fuzzy but I am imagining an image without it in front of me. With smells, I remember the smell. I feel how the smell makes me feel. I can describe it. But I don't actually smell it. I have a mind's eye, but I don't have a mind's nose. </p>
<p>Tl;dr I know the smell of coffee but thinking about it doesn't make me smell coffee that is not there. </p></div>		</li>
