			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but don't put that colloidal silver shit in your drinks. Your body will not metabolize silver, and it probably doesn't do shit. Instead the silver just accumulates in your tissues. If you accumulate enough of it, you'll develop a neat condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyria" target="_blank">Argyria</a>, in which your skin will turn into a purple-blue color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silver, brass, copper, and I believe bronze but don’t hold me to that.   No bacteria has evolved a way of surviving on these surfaces, at the moment, so these are all considered self sterilizing if clean and dry for about 12 hours.  This is why tons of medical equipment is coated in silver or silvadene (spelling) and why door knobs are typically made of brass!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working through our time-expired bottled 5-year emergency water. It tastes like plastic bottle, and is virtually undrinkable. I contacted the manufacturer, who basically said the water doesn't actually expire, the bottle does.</p>
<p>So anyway, I'll check up on your numbers thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I work outside and if it's particularly hot I might exhaust all my drinks before the day is up. The first thing I'll do is hit a hose with an empty water bottle. Aside from hose related toxins, how bad is it to reuse a water bottle for a day of working in the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better than drinking the original water, as far as the plastic bottle goes. The original fill sat on the shelf for some longish period of time, leaching whatever amount of stuff. Your refill sits there for maybe half a day. </p>
<p>I routinely reuse these bottles, especially when traveling. Dump and refill daily if I don't finish a refill.</p></div>		</li>
