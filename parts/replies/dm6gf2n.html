<p>I've never heard of blaze orange camo. <a href="https://www.realtree.com/sites/default/files/styles/x-large/public/content/camo/realtree-camo-pattern-realtree-ap-blaze-02.jpg?itok=N4BaKLEe" target="_blank">Apparently he's camouflaged to a deer.</a></p>

<p>I would go for the prison look if I were to hunt up there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget the actual numbers, but in Rhode Island it's essentially a hat is required for any hunting involving firearms, and a hat and vest is required by everyone during shotgun deer season. If you are hunting turkey or bow hunting during muzzleloader deer, camo is required when walking to your blind. Also, that applies to anyone in the woods during hunting season, which pretty much none of the non-hunters follow. So you'll see someone going for a nature walk in brown clothes while you're lit up like a Christmas tree looking for deer. And the orange needs to be solid, none of the orange camo allowed </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're hunting deer with shotguns? What kind of deer? Anything larger than a roe deer (<em>Capreolus capreolus</em>) must be shot with a rifle in Denmark. The legal calibers of shotgun are probably smaller in Denmark than in the US of course (what calibers are using by the way?), so that is most likely part of the reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, always assume it's whitetail unless it's very evident they're from the Rocky Mountains or points west. Whitetail are everywhere, they're grossly overpopulated (to the point of being traffic hazards and disease vectors), and they have the least restrictive hunting seasons. </p>
<p>For example, where I'm from, the season harvest limit is six, there's no daily bag limit, and there are bonus cards you can get for additional antlerless deer. Rifles, shotguns (10 gauge and smaller), and archery are all allowed, including crossbows but not automatic weapons. Pistols and blackpowder are also allowed, with some quirks in regulation. </p></div>		</li>
