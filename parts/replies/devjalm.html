			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna post this as a reply so you will actually see it. So /u/tellahthesage and /u/swordgeek are completely right. Just wanted to add my two cents (music and computer science major here).</p>
<p>So basically yes the timbre, attack/transient (initial onset of the sound), and decay all play a huge role in determining what makes one instrument sound different from the next.
Timbre is the basic makeup of a sound. So you will have some basic sound which is called the tonic or prime harmonic. That is the absolute base frequency of the sound and that plays a huge role in determining the pitch of the sound. From there, you have a series of harmonics that occur with any sort of resonant object such as a string or bottle -- if you blow harder into a bottle you will begin to get this harmonic series.</p>
<p>Wiki Article on the harmonic series: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music</a>)</p>
<p>So basically in a complex waveform (anything that isn't generated by a computer or synthesizer) you get these harmonics all stacked up on top of each other which add up to become the body (sustain) of the instruments sound. Every instrument has a different set of harmonics that it produces based on shape, size, material composition, imperfections, string size/material, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to this, you have the attack and decay of the sound. The attack is going to be that initial force that gets the string, tube, or whatever, vibrating and creating the sustained portion of the sound. If you were to look at a drum hit (kick and snare):</p>
<p><a href="http://johnlsayers.com/Recmanual/Images/Transient1.gif" target="_blank">http://johnlsayers.com/Recmanual/Images/Transient1.gif</a></p>
<p>You would see an initial set of peaks that do not look the same as the sustained/tail portion, called a transient. In the case of a piano, you have a bunch of little hammers that strike the string so you would get a sound that is very immediate and has a transient shape similar to the drum example. With a violin, though, you have a bow that has to, in a sense, ramp up the strings and excite them much slower than the piano.</p>
<p>Lastly, you have the decay, which is much much simpler than the rest of this. Basically, on a piano the sound much more gradually decays than on a violin due to the length of the strings and their size. The resonance continues significantly longer on larger strings than it does on a smaller ones.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears up a bit of the loose ends left by people. If I garbled something up let me know other redditors :)</p>
<p>EDIT: added clarifying sentence to explain why different instruments have different harmonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment you replied to mentioned harmonics; your equalizer actually allows you to pass or reject frequency ranges and I'll tie the two together for you.  Say you play an A4 note at 440 Hz (oscillations per second), but you've got some stank on it (via FX on channel or other knob twiddles in the synth), so it's actually got some harmonics, like second (880 Hz), and third (1.32 kHz).  If you drop the 1 kHz slider on the equalizer to -80 dB, that order of harmonic is filtered out to about 1/1000 the amplitude (loudness), so you get (ideally) just the fundamental and second harmonic.  A little different than you thought, and in &quot;real&quot; instruments (lol) these harmonics actually come naturally as material properties change between instrument types (and even with temperature and moisture!).  Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis" target="_blank">Fourier Analysis</a> if you want to get down and danky with the math.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is actually the one that answers your question.</p>
<p>Timbre is characterized by which harmonics are present in a sound sample. The actual note heard is the sum of all the different frequencies (the fundamental frequency being the note you're playing, plus the harmonics).</p></div>		</li>

Is the ELI5 version something like:
&quot;A 'note' is a package of several sound waves, and your instrument adjusts some of them while leaving the main one at a set pitch?&quot;
Not trying to be a smart-ass, just hoping to understand.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lemme break this down a bit further. Let's look at it from the perspective of the waveforms.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://youtu.be/3bCT3YxZfAY" target="_blank">how the original gameboy sounded when you booted it up</a>? If you look at the waveform of that sound, it's a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Simple_sine_wave.svg/1024px-Simple_sine_wave.svg.png" target="_blank">pure sine wave</a>. This is how all sound works. How close the peaks of the wave are together is called frequency - the closer they are together, the higher the frequency (pitch) goes, the farther they are, the lower it goes, too. Amplitude - how HIGH the peaks are - is the volume of the sound.</p>
<p>Now, there are different waveforms, as well. There are <a href="http://recordingology.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Distortion_Square-Wave.gif" target="_blank">square waves</a>, which make a brighter (more &quot;eeee&quot;) sound, as opposed to the perfectly round sine wave (&quot;oooo&quot;). There's also a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Synthesis_triangle.gif/350px-Synthesis_triangle.gif" target="_blank">triangle wave</a>, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Sawtooth_wave.svg/1024px-Sawtooth_wave.svg.png" target="_blank">sawtooth wave</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sound+waveforms&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN3pO2r9TSAhUH9mMKHSOSD2QQ_AUIBigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950" target="_blank">pretty much anything else you can think of</a>. These all affect the &quot;brightness&quot; of the sound and the tone of it.</p>
<p>Waveforms are additive. If you play two different waves at the same time, you get a new single waveform that looks like both of them together, which can <a href="https://swphonetics.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/somvi01o.jpg?w=500&amp;h=333" target="_blank">look something like this</a>.</p>
<p>If you double the frequency of a note, you go up an octave. If you halve it, you go down. The frequencies for notes can be plotted along a logarithmic curve. For instance, 440 Hz is a concert &quot;A&quot;. 880 would be the &quot;A&quot; an octave above that, and 220 would be the octave below that. 1760 and 110 would be the octaves around that. Humans can typically hear from around 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, and most people's high end gradually drops as they get older.</p>
<p>If you have a single waveform at 440 Hz, you get a concert &quot;A&quot;. However, it sounds very electronic. If you add in a second and third waveform, at moderate percentages of the amplitude (volume) of the first and at half and double frequencies, then those are called &quot;harmonics&quot; and the note will start to sound different. The human ear isn't very good at picking out all the frequencies that go into a single note from an instrument; it hears them all summed up. For instance, when you play a note on a piano, it has a complex system of harmonic tones that sounds for each note, at octaves and other intervals across most of the sound range, with the general amplitude and intensity of the frequencies dropping as they get further from the core note. Thus, when we hear that particular pattern of frequencies, we only notice one note and say &quot;that's a piano!&quot; or &quot;that's a violin!&quot;</p>
<p>Beyond just the pure waveforms, there's also attack and decay - how quickly the sound starts and how quickly it drops off, but this is pretty controllable for most instruments, and doesn't really affect what instrument it sounds like.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a much more complete answer to OP's question. I took an intro class on music technology as part of my music degree, and we were told to use the basic tone generator in Audacity to synthesize a clarinet tone. It was super trippy, entering the frequencies for multiple different pitches and then playing it back to hear only one! The waveforms combine, and the ear only discerns the fundamental pitch while filtering out all of the harmonics.</p>
<p>This is the same principle that allows overtone singing / throat singing to work.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit:  I'll expand on a few things you said.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, that <em>is</em> all pure waveforms when looking at it from the perspective of the DFT. All those starts, stops decays etc. can be represented as the summation of sinusoids, but that's not necessarily the best model of how the human ear works.  The ear doesn't hear purely in the frequency domain since there is a limit to the frequency resolution that it can sense, but it can sense when certain sounds happen. This is the result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">uncertainty principal</a>. That said, the sounds of particular instruments is still primarily related the harmonics (and the their ratios) that make up that sound.</p>
<p>On a slightly less technical note, there are some interesting things that happen with stringed instruments that give them unique tonal characteristics, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inharmonicity" target="_blank">inharmonicity</a>. The harmonics aren't spaced out in perfect integer multiples of the fundamental which gives things like pianos, guitars and basses some unique characteristics. It gives instruments a bit of &quot;life&quot; and keeps them from sounding as if they are electronically generated.</p></div>		</li>
