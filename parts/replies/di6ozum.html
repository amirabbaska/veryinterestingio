<p>I came to learn about flies and was also given a fun factoid for life. Thank you :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another.  The word &quot;factoid&quot; originally meant a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true, although that definition has evolved to include useless bits of actually true trivia. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, I found video of a horse falling off a roof and it was way more light hearted than I expected: <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=23a_1422522437" target="_blank">https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=23a_1422522437</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cat survives because it is able to splay itself and reduce its speed to less than that of its terminal velocity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, and sadly, there is a window between where a cat will survive a free fall and where it has time to right itself aerodynamically. In that window the cat dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal velocity is also affected by the square cubed law. Smaller things fall slower, because they have less mass per surface area.</p>
<p>But they also have less pressure on their paws when they hit the ground compared to how much force would be on our feet even landing at the same speed.</p>
<p>Humans can splay themselves too which helps to slow us down, but not enough to prevent fatal injuries from 5 storeys onto solid ground.</p>
<p>Merely placing a blue whale on the ground would cause it fatal internal injuries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're slow.  They fly at like 2 meters per second, max.</p>
<p>You can throw a person at the wall at 2 m/s and they would walk away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it can seem fast in terms of body lengths per second, however the kinetic energy is determined by mass X (velocity squared) so the absolute speed means a lot for how much energy is going to need to be dissipated in the crash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure it's not bad logic. In fact... all things, other than size, being equal... physics favors the small when it comes to sudden deceleration. F=MA is a real thing. </p></div>		</li>
