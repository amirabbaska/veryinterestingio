			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response. Yeah this was generally just a shower thought. I understand how mycelles work with soap but I didn't really know much about origins or fat types used. This is really what I was curious about most. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally a blend of anionic and or non ionic surfactants are used in liquid soap products. A generic hand soap will use sls with cocoaminopropyl butaine with some thickener like cocamide mea or some acrylic polymer. They will have some glycerin add 0.0001 percent of promotional ingredients and add A fragrance and a presevative. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so i have asked about this and looked it up elsewhere but never really gotten the answer i was looking for. I have heard many things about some ingredients used in different types of soaps(i dont really know which ones do what), and their stated links to cancer or harm to the environment. My question is, how can i as a consumer pick something that is less impactful and more healthy. And whats the trade-off? The efficacy of the soap? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy soaps. Thank you for this, seriously. The chemistry and/or mixture of the product matters. </p>
<p>Calling it &quot;soap&quot; vs &quot;body wash&quot; vs &quot;detergent&quot; etc. is strictly marketing. A high-quality dish washing soap may be less harsh on skin than a cheap bath soap. It's all in the mix! Thank you for sharing your soaps facts!</p></div>		</li>
