			<div class="markdown"><p>All the carbon that goes into a plant eventually comes out of the plant when it rots. Mainly as CO2 or occasionally as methane.  </p>
<p>Global warming is occurring because about 100 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, a lot of the CO2 in the atmosphere (there was much, much more back then) was absorbed by huge forests. These forests were then buried and turned into coal, oil, and gas over the ensuing aeons. When we started burning the coal, what we did was undo the work of those ancient forests in removing CO2 from the air (which allowed us to evolve, in the grant scheme of things).  </p>
<p>The only real solution to global warming is to take the C02 and bury it out of the way forever (also; stop burning the coal and gas too). But that's harder than you'd think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most fossil fuels are actually the remains of single celled organisms, not trees. Still the same process pretty much - things die and get buried, sequestering the carbon that it used to grow. Additionally, there are some methods by which we can take CO2 directly out of the air; but the technique needs to be improved a lot before it can have any real impact on global warming. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, for permanent sequestration we need to engineer organisms that will pull CO2 out of the air, use it to build long-chain hydrocarbons (preferably long enough to be liquid and non-volatile at room temperature), and then pump those hydrocarbons underground into geologically stable rock formations? :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly I was making a joke about essentially collecting up all the burnt oil, &quot;un-burning&quot; it, and putting it back where we found it. </p>
<p>But yeah. The stuff you said is the <em>actually</em> good and reasonable course of action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc the organisms that make the white cliffs of dover did exactly that.</p>
<p>Edit: kind of. Algee created layer after layer of calcium carbonate. Problem with using super algee is that they can poison lakes and rivers if they bloom.    </p></div>		</li>
