			<div class="markdown"><p>These kids are fucked. They were just walking around being dumbasses as teens are wont to do, and now a bunch of people are dead and lives are destroyed. Their lives are over before they even started. They killed 14 people including little kids. It's just do stupid and sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they usually publish ages. They can even publish names depending on the state and circumstances, for example if they're being tried as adults or if the newspaper lawfully obtains the names through investigation (juveniles' names are omitted from arrest reports, although in some areas this is up to police discretion based on severity and violence).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mental state should have some role to play in this. They lit a fire 10 miles away, I'm sure they didn't intend to destroy the town or lead to anyone's death. This is exactly what manslaughter is, its just a matter of whether their sentences are served concurrently or consecutively.
People are trying to string these teens up and yet the guy who ran the Ghost Ship is doing interviews...</p></div>		</li>
