			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to touch on this. Glad someone mentioned it. Blood vessels and nerve fibers don't grow with fat. As adipose cells are storage cells, they are sparsely innervated and have little blood flow. Basically these cells stretch around growing fat, which is part of why being obese is hard on your heart and increases hypertension. Long term obesity can cause damage to blood vessels and destroy their plasticity. </p></div>		</li>
