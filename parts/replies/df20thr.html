<p>To be fair, &quot;true randomness&quot; using a shuffle algorithm (which is sort of implied by the name) won't do this until you've played every song at least once, and even then very rarely, and it's still &quot;truly random&quot;.</p>
<p>Also Apples algorithm actually consistently chose certain songs at much higher rates than others based on the shape of your playlist, so even the sort of &quot;truly random&quot; you're talking about isn't an accurate description of their original &quot;shuffling&quot; methodology, which was more &quot;heavily weighted randomness&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Random and shuffle are not the same. Shuffle is like shuffling a deck of cards. Each card would still appear once.
Truly random, however, each time the next song will be chosen at random and sometimes the same song may be chosen again in succession.</p></div>		</li>
