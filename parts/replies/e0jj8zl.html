			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. I actually was just updating my post with some examples. </p>
<p>Thermoplastic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Polycarbonate (plastic used to replace glass on busses)</li>
<li>polypropylene (the squishy plastic in bottle caps and living hinges as in shampoo bottle caps)</li>
<li>polyvinyl chloride (a versitile plastic that can be made hard as in vinyl records, blister packs, and PVC pipe; or soft by adding plasticizers as in showerliners, or Saran wrap)</li>
<li>hot glue sticks</li>
<li>FDM (MakerBot style) 3D print filament like ABS or PLA</li>
</ul>
<p>Thermoset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevlar</li>
<li>SLA (form labs style) 3D print materials like photopolymer resins </li>
<li>fiberglass</li>
<li>memory foam</li>
<li>most liquid adhesives </li>
<li>polyester when used in a fiber</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example of thermoset is most plastics in the hood of your car. Old distributor caps, sensor housings, etc. Which makes perfect sense since it tends to get hot and you don't want them to melt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plastic films offer another challenge to recycling, and not because they are thermoplastic or thermoset. Films are used to package delicate goods like food, medicine, hygiene products, and other household chemicals. These films are generally made of many layers of a variety of plastics, and their exact compositions are trade secrets. Its a major hassle that could not be profitable. </p>
<p>Additionally, plastics overall are not very valuable. The usual incentives in recycling plastics is that it costs less than landfilling, but you end up giving the material away for free just to guarantee it has somewhere to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Mixing plastics can make normally recylcble materials non-recyclable compounds. This happens a lot with food materials</p>
<p>Mylar is PET and aluminum (?) But can't be recylcble together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition,  all Thermoplastics can be in <em>theory</em> be recycled back to plastic pellets and molded into new items. </p>
<p>The real challenge is separation.  This can be expensive.</p>
<p>The different numbers represent different chemistries or Types of plastic.   For the most part these can not be mixed.  Coke bottles can't be mixed with shampoo bottles ( different plastic, different number) so these need to be separated. You either need lots of people to do this or very good automated systems that can distinguish the different types. </p>
<p>For plastics to be reprocessed  they must be relatively clean. For the coke PET ( Poly Ethylene Terephthalate) bottle to be recycled, anything that is not the clear PET plastic  will contaminate the material and ruin its properties. The plastic PP lid and ring will destroy the  properties, the residual phosphoric acid will induce a chemical reaction, and the Sugar will caramelize to black specs. All make it difficult to make a new bottle. </p>
<p>Where the number is printed on the product, it makes separation easier.   No imagine a box of materials with no numbers.  You clean out your toys, and have a mixed box of  Lego Blocks, that Model F15 fighter, your Barbie doll,  Barbie's Dream house and your collection  Dinosaurs.   All different materials that need to be separated and cleaned before they can be reprocessed.   </p>
<p>If the volume of materials does not justify finding a way to automate the separation in a cost effective fashion,   it becomes too expensive to do. </p></div>		</li>
