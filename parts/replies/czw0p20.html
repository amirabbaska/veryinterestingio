			<div class="markdown"><p>Astounding. The Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment was done in 1887 to try and detect the differences in the speed of light in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether (&quot;aether wind&quot;). In 1905, Einstein published a paper first bringing up time dilation, which takes the speed of light as constant and deduces some weird shit that reality should conform to. During 1907-1915 he develops General Relativity, which explains how gravity plays into this. And now, in 2016, a 100 years later; the dude's scientific deductions are still coming true in exciting ways. And, hilariously, the idea of looking at light going in perpendicular directions is again the experiment being done, except with an entirely different outlook on what is expected. What's ironic is we can look at this now as &quot;listening&quot; to the &quot;ether&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing, but also quite common in physics.</p>
<p>Another example would be when Paul Dirac predicted the existence of the anti-electron only using mathematics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One specific thing that could discount General Relativity is the amplitude of the waves detected in relation to the orientation of the source and the detector. In order to measure this, a particular gravity wave signal must be matched to a specific astronomical object observable with another method, which AFAIU may be very difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves HAD to exist from a mathematical standpoint. If you have a &quot;universe&quot; (= here a system of partial differential equations) where information propagates at a finite maximum speed, all your force fields must be able to carry waves, in order to adjust for changes in the configuration of their sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Though back in 2009, there was some concern that string theory would not predict gravity waves because of simply how complex the math is.</p></div>		</li>
