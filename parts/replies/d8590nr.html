			<p>There's a third contributing factor: the absorption characteristics of the atmosphere.  It may absorb/scatter certain frequencies of light so that they don't participate in making the rainbow.  A thick atmosphere (Venus for example?) may scatter out all of the blue before it gets a chance to be refracted in the raindrops.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Good point. <br><br>Should be rephrased as the incident light at point of refraction or something... </p>		</li>
