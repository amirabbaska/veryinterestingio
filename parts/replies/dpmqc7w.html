			<div class="markdown"><p>And there's your answer.  The &quot;unit fraca&quot; is the second, and everything else is defined in terms of some conversion factor thereof.  Talking to other people on your planet or habitat?  Use local terms.  Talking to people anywhere else?  Use seconds, kiloseconds, megaseconds, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do not envy the future programmers who have to deal with all of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, allowing users to change the displayed unit measurement (metric vs imperial) is already a pretty common thing.  This would just apply the same thing to time, with a greater variety of possible units.  Under the hood, similarly to storing datestamps in UTC, everything would be stored in the universal format.  There's a few additional wrinkles (&quot;yestersol&quot; is an actual term over at NASA Mars Ops), but nothing we couldn't handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that some standard units like seconds may stay the same as they are small, but we can kind of count them ourselves with some kind of accuracy (e.g. music being /3, /4, /8, /12, /16) though a year for a certain planet would be different depending on how far the planet is from the sun and how fast it travels (e.g. mars takes 687 days - so nearly 2 earth years). </p>
<p>Conjecture: I suppose that if you were actively living on mars and interacted with many people on mars, then you may just refer to time in the mars-scale instead of the earth-scale.</p>
<p>Weight would depend on the gravitational force between the object and the planet (with other things in the solar system possibly effecting it)... So it's all kind of relative IMO.</p></div>		</li>
