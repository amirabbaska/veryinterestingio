You need to make sure their water conditions are perfect and that they have plenty of nutrient rich food.  Some grow faster than others, and they have slight personalities, there are basically shy inkers and squid that straight up don’t care if I pick them up (I don’t pick them up out of the water, but I put them in my hand sometimes to get them in a beaker to go from one tank to another when they get older). When I raised cuttlefish a few years ago, those guys REALLY had personalities. I was responsible for feeding them and some would come out of their little fake plants all excited to see me because they knew food was coming. I remember one in particular that would bob his little face out of the water when I came in the room it was SO CUTE. It killed me. He would have his fin rippling so fast, it kind of reminded me of a dog wagging its tail The Hawaiian bobtail squid are less friendly. Partially because they’re nocturnal so when I’m in the room at daytime they’re asleep and when I’m in the room at night I have a headlamp on and they get annoyed about the light and bury in the sand. C’est la vie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bobtail squid certainly don't seem to like me even though I've raised them since they hatched, but the cuttlefish and octopus know individual people for sure. I think the bobtail squid also know individual people but they're not as good at connecting positively. So for example, once I draw blood from a squid once, those squid tend to ink at me a lot more once I walk in the room compared to others. They never seem happy to see me though (unlike the cuttlefish and octopuses)</p></div>		</li>
