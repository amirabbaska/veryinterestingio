			<div class="markdown"><p>Those ties she has with that cult goes way back. Her father was a general who seized power back in the day. He later survived a assination attempt but his wife was killed(her mother).</p>
<p>The leader of the cult contacted her and told her he could speak to her dead mother and that's how he gained her trust and influence inside the Korean government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that the first clues happened due to an investigation into the daughter of the cult leader, and the reasons she was accepted to a prestigious school with low test scores, and was receiving good grades while known for not attending classes or doing coursework.  The investigation happened after multiple protests by the student body, eventually linking back to the President.</p>
<p>Also worth pointing out that she's the daughter of the country's last military dictator, and people were rightly paranoid of her candidacy, never mind win.</p></div>		</li>
