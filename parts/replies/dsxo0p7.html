			<div class="markdown"><p>A human liver has 4 lobes, not 2, and yes it does regenerate and &quot;rebuild&quot;, it doesn't just &quot;swell up&quot; to occupy more space. Source: I did liver research for years, have published papers on the subject, here is one of the papers where we reconstituted a diseased liver mouse model with hepatocytes isolated from dead mice:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I was a liver donor 1.5 years ago and my bloodwork shows that my liver is as healthy and happy as it ever was. (Maybe even happier since I cut way back on drinking due to the surgery.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'll never be as effective as a whole, healthy liver, but it's more than enough for normal circumstances. The liver has quite a bit of excess capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You only need about 1/3rd of your liver to be effective though. Say you donate your right lobe, which is about 2/3rds of your liver, you’ll be just fine and that remaining third may grow to accommodate 1/2 of your initial liver output but it’ll never be the same as before. That’s why you definitely shouldn’t drink if you donate half your liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I donated ~60% of my liver 4 years ago. My hepatic flow rates are back to about 80% of where they were before the surgery. </p>
<p>I've never been told not to drink, I'm not sure where you're getting your info from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The blood flow isn't as efficient to spread itself along all the liver cells. The amount of liver function you have at baseline versus the amount you actually need is so much overkill that it doesn't matter. </p></div>		</li>
