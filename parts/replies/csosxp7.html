			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! We did this experiment in University and were within 5% of the correct value. It was a pretty awesome experiment.</p>
<p>We used more than two mirrors. We had at least three, one being rotated by a motor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, it's amazing to me that in 1848 they had a light source that was both bright enough and focused well enough it could be detected after travelling so far (16km total?). Seems like that would be difficult to align, also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They spent A LOT of time an money on optics back then.  It was sort of the equivalent of top secret research of today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't a basic wood fire be bright enough? The light doesn't need to really be concentrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light passed between two cogs on a gear, traveled 16 km (13 miles) and again passed through 2 cogs on a gear. To be able to detect the light, and have it hit a relatively small target over that distance seems rather impressive to me. Whatever you are using would need to be very well focused.</p>
<p>I think you could manage it with sunlight and mirrors, but you'd need to be able to communicate with the person adjusting the other mirror (5 microradians to the left!) in real time to stay on target as the sun moves relative to you. Maybe through a telegraph?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another similar experiment: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson–Morley_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson–Morley_experiment</a></p>
<p>It was designed to measure the &quot;aetherial wind&quot; but ended up proving there is no aether and eventually led to help build the theory of relativity. </p></div>		</li>
