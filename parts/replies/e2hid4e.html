			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna comment this. A lot of hotels give complimentary coffee that are already in little filter bags. I always save them and ask for extra before I leave the hotel. Throw one of those in a pot and it makes some decent campfire coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maxwell House did for a while.  I used to use them to make a quick cup on the way out the door at 4:30am every morning when I did Morning Drive at WXFX-FM.  10 ounces of water in the Sunbeam Hot Shot heater (70 seconds) poured it over the coffee “tea bag”, and headed out the door.  It’d be ready by the time I hit the traffic light at the top of the hill 1 mile up the street.</p>
<p>When I worked Master Control at WNCF-TV, I’d take a round Lipton tea bag for my Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Pot (Hamilton Beach also makes one, and both are still in production, though I can’t find the Lipton round tea bags anywhere any more), and put it in the Bunn Pour-Over coffee maker in the break room.  Made a great 12-cup decanter of hot Black Tea.  So... yes, it can be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made my own version of that a long time ago for a hike.  Put the amount of grounds I'd normally use for a 2 cupper in a standard round coffee filter, pull the filter up over the grounds (loosely, can't be tight) and tie the filter off at the top with a string so it's basically a ball I could dunk like a tea bag.  Keep it moving for a few minutes and it's close enough to the same for someone who prefers meh coffee to no coffee.  It's essentially the same concept as a press, just without the press.  I say this as a non-coffee-snob who drinks a cheapo drip every morning though, I wouldn't expect it to be for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just use an AeroPress...it’s cheap, the cleanup is super easy, and the coffee tastes really good. I also think the filter is compostable or easily biodegradable but I’m not 100% sure about that.</p></div>		</li>
