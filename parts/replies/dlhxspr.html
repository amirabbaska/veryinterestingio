			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple tap water might actually kill them because it already has antimicrobials like chlorine, but the mix of the liquid isn't all that magical. Think of a sparkling clean pool vs a pond of fish and minnows. Probiotics help your gut become a healthy version of the pond and you WANT this for good digestion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cool them down with liquid nitrogen or dry ice/acetone very quickly.  The reason freezing water kill cells is because when water normally freezes, there are large spiky ice crystal projections that pierce the cells. When they're frozen quickly, but ice does not crystallize into shards and cannot puncture the cells.  Then the ice is put under vacuum and slowly gassed off so all those remained is the organic structure from the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of them don't survive simple freeze drying. Because of huge cell counts <a href="https://imgur.com/HXnlyS4?r" target="_blank">(bacteria are tiny)</a> even a 99% mortality leaves a lot of individuals. </p>
<p>In research, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryobiology" target="_blank">water is often replaced by other solvents to reduce mortality of freezing and the build up of intracellular ice crystals.</a>. Then cell cultures / bacteria can be stored at -80Â°C.</p></div>		</li>
