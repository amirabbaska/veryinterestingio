			<div class="markdown"><p>I just can't wrap my head around how the 2 occupants would not experience any slowing down. How 23 years can appear to happen in 3 hours or vice versa. This whole concept of time dilation for a visual person like me is mind boggling. I always thought time passed the time anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time for the two occupants would move at the same rate as it did for the man left on the ship, relative to their positions. 1 second is still 1 second, but one second for you might be different from 1 second for me, depending on any number of variables. Hense, relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my limited understanding, that's what the theory of relativity is. From your perspective, time is the same, the ship is just going faster.</p>
<p>It's like two cars driving alongside one another, at the same speed, and then one falls behind. Without proper instruments, you can't tell if one sped up, or one slowed down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in this scenario, would the the ship appear to be moving super fast when observed from the surface of the planet? In my mind, it would seem that if the ship is staying on the side of the planet that is opposite the black hole, then any perceived motion would just be the planets own rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the ship would appear to be moving faster. I am in no way qualified to answer this but I would think that the ship would inevitably continue to orbit around the planet while the guy on the ship &quot;waited&quot; for the crew to come back. This has to add multiple problems though such as the ship coming much to close to the gravity well of the black hole as it orbits the planet and thus distorting time even more. Also, if the ship is orbiting the planet repeatedly while they are on the surface I have no idea how they would rendezvous properly when they came back without any communication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could, but two way communication would be problematic. You must remember that radio transmissions are actually an electromagnetic wave: if time dilates or stretches you end up with a waveform whose frequency changes. The lander would receive a super highfreq signal, while the orbiter would receive a low freq one.</p>
<p>You also have to take into account the fact that during that time the orbiter would be going around the planet, and when it's closer to the black hole than the surface planet, the effect would slow down and then reverse with this happening everytime the orbiter circles the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a book about something similar by Robert Forward called Dragon's Egg which I read upon recommendation from my Physics teacher.  It goes over how humans in space talk to a species that lives on the surface of a Neutron Star, and how they just perceive the bits of information at a slower rate than the humans are sending it down.  From what I hear the most of the book's physics are sound.</p>
<p>In this case the rate of data transmission would by slowed by a factor of n number of bits per hour/(14 years/hour) to get the received bits rate, which would be a whole lot lower, probably to the point of not being able to use it.</p></div>		</li>
