			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I chased -on foot- a drunk driver who crashed into a bunch of cars on my street and bailed. When I caught up to him, I tackled him and we both fell through the door of a fast food place. The employee who called 911 reported a 6’4’ white guy assaulting a 5’6’ Hispanic guy. I was the white guy, that could have ended badly for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the cop Instructs you(or a Doctor) you can legally perform any task they ask with impunity, even something you believe is illegal (for example violating Traffic Laws, or if a Doctor Instructs you to Tackle a person). Any issue that arises from you performing the task falls on the cop. This is dependent of jurisdiction though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's one that pertains to psychiatric patients specifically, but there are others. The orders that you follow that are against the law, in this case legal use of physical and restraining force, or like the traffic law example, are specific(mainly for things hospital related), not general carte blanche deputation for you as a doctor to order someone to commit burglary... but the point is, if told to do something, by one of those professions in an emergency, you can pretty much guarantee YOU won't be in trouble for following said order.</p></div>		</li>
