			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy! I did the math on a similar problem to this before. </p>
<p>If you were to make a ball of pure TNT and detonate it, would it be able to disperse itself, or would gravity be able to pull it back together? It turns out that with an energy density of about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28+%284.184+gigajoules%2Fton%29+*+%283*+0.055+%28cc%2Fg%29^1%2F3%29+%2F+%283*gravitational+constant%29%29^%283%2F2%29" target="_blank">4.2 gigajoules per ton, the maximum mass of a TNT sphere that can blow itself apart is half the mass of Pluto!</a> So maybe since Charon is about 10% the mass of Pluto, we can take her out with TNT, but for Pluto we'd need nukes (and like /u/whodidyouthink said, we'd need billions of times more nukes than have ever been built by anyone anywhere ever). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Looking into it, 1 Tsar Bomba looks to pretty much exactly match the binding energy of Phobos, with global nuclear yield being 120-ish times that, about the binding energy of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/PIA12593_Prometheus2.jpg" target="_blank">Saturn's moon prometheus</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The math looks good. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binding+energy+of+Promtheus" target="_blank">Prometheus' binding energy is about 2.9x10^19 J</a> and the global nuclear stockpile has a TNT equivalent of about 7,000 megatons - which has a total energy of about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28+%284.184+gigajoules%2Fton%29+*+7000+megatons%29" target="_blank">3.2x10^19 J</a>. </p>
<p>I like the pleasant coincidence of mankind's collective arsenal being <em>just enough</em> to kill the moon named for the titan that gave humans fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of Charon, maybe it is possible to slow down Charon and make it &quot;fall&quot; on Pluto, which will lead to dwarf-plane-size catastrophe. Of course, OP's request could be understood widely from &quot;destroy Pluto as a single planet&quot; (so, several pieces would suffice) to &quot;evaporize Pluto&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what would it look like if the forces were exactly balanced?  The TNT explosion would happen but the volume would stay the same?  Interesting idea, I'm having trouble picturing it though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question.  Could we, in theory, use something OTHER than a bomb.  </p>
<p>Let's say we fly out to Ceres or some other very large object, attach a MASSIVE solar sail to it, and carefully steer it towards Pluto.</p>
<p>Sure, it'd take 1,000 years, but by the time it slammed into Pluto it would technically have enough energy to destroy it, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if we wanted to crash something into Pluto, it would make sense to start with an object that's closer to Pluto's orbit.  There are quite a few objects with sufficient mass in the Kuiper Belt and scattered disk.  Then all we have to do is give it a bump to make sure it collides with Pluto.  Sort of like a cosmic game of billiards, starting with a small object and colliding one into another, getting larger and larger until we have one big enough to destroy Pluto.  It might take a few centuries just to figure out all the objects' orbits just to do the math, and more than a few thermonuclear weapons launched on trajectories to tweak the orbits of comets and dwarf planets, but it's possible.  If we were going through all that trouble though, we may as well use the resources to terraform Mars:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet this defines &quot;destroyed&quot; as &quot;accelerate every piece of pluto so they don't ever fall back together&quot;, right? That means have every single bit drifting away to infinity. There are many states one would define as &quot;total destruction&quot; that require way less energy. On the other hand, it neglects the energy to rip apart solid structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, destroying its structure and &quot;mixing&quot; its layers. If we would crush earths crust completely, and have it melted into the mantles magma again, and so on. Pretty sure that requires some orders of magnitude less energy than sending everything into space.</p></div>		</li>
