			<div class="markdown"><p>In animal models yes. In humans we dont see this. There are satellite cells that lay dormant on the outside of the muscle fibers that are called into action when repair is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting (and similar to the discussion about neurons). I get a feeling that the vast majority of cells aren't abled to duplicate and that is where we get this saying about skeletal and cardiac muscle and neurons cells.</p></div>		</li>
