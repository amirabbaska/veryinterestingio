			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me think of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tibbles-the-cat-and-stephens-island-wren-2014-12?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank">Stephen's Island Wren</a> - TL;DR, tiny (smaller than your hand) flightless song-bird on a small island, wiped out almost entirely by the lighthouse keepers cat. He wanted to keep one his cat brought him as a memento only to later find out it was possibly the last ever one in existence.</p>
<p>In relation to the OP, <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/black-robin/" target="_blank">The Black Robbin</a> must be one of the most famous - come back from the edge of extinction - stories. </p>
<p>Again TL;DR -  Black Robbin down to 7 birds, 2 die after a year without any reproducing. One female is left and twice the average life expectancy and only one fertile male left. So literally one breeding pair, that probably shouldn't have been able to breed, brought the entire species from 5 -&gt; 250+ in ~30 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Both great stories of survival. Thanks for sharing! As for the Black Robbin, I cannot imagine the amount of hand-wringing and genetic mapping that those poor scientists went through to outbreed as much as possible!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to your link, every Black Robin alive today is descended from the single female that happened to live double the normal lifespan.  </p>
<p>I wonder if this has had a permanent effect on the population as a whole?  A full doubling had to have a genetic component beyond good luck and good care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's another great example of a species coming back from the brink of extinction. Had 4 individuals in 1974 and now there are 400 as of 2014.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those fellers are serious.</p>
<p>We had a site in Wyoming going under remediation and someone THOUGHT they saw a siting 5 years before 2 miles away, holy crap did we have to do all kinds of things and extra precautions just in case they were nearby. Couldn't disturb any Prairie dogs, which is very hard in Wyoming.</p>
<p>I get it, need to protect them, but who knows what we would've had to do if it had been a confirmed siting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What type of engineer do you have to be to construct an endangered species habitat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe environmental/civil, but I have to say this sounds like more like a job for a biologist or conservationist.  An environmental engineer might be able to help with designing channels for wetlands or analyzing soil erosion/sedimentation, that sort of thing. They'd be able to help minimize impact during construction, but they wouldn't have a lot to say about what the environment actually consists of.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ferrets are mostly used for hunting rabbits (send the ferret down the hole, rabbits run out right into the nets you've placed over all the burrows) rather than for scent, although thats a useful side effect.</p>
<p>its a very efficient hunting method, any young bunnies or pregnant/lactating does can be immediately released so there's no bycatch</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ferrets were also used to hunt rats. Rat catchers (human) could be hired to clear a house, barn, warehouse etc of rats. They would bring ferrets and terrier dogs. The ferrets would chase the rats out of their holes and the dogs would catch them and kill them. When the rats were cleared out they would fill in the rat holes with cement or steel wool. This would keep the rats out for a while.</p></div>		</li>
