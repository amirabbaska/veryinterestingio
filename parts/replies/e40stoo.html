			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound scientifically educated. If you know the answer would you mind explaining to me something? </p>
<p>I get our atmosphere changes over time (especially with human pollution and such screwing with it) but its mostly the same % of like 70 oxygen 25% nitrogen (i know I'm way off) and then like methane and carbon mono or dioxide and dust and such. </p>
<p>Is some % highly combustible gases like propane or acetylene and therefore the planet has a &quot;flashpoint&quot; of sorts where if we ever got hot enough we'd ignite? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was actually of slight concern during the Manhattan project. The scientists weren't sure whether the thermonuclear explosion could not ignite the entire atmosphere. Although &quot;ignite&quot; in this case meant causing a fusion chain reaction of nitrogen nuclei. So they did some math and figured out this was highly unlikely. <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-scientists-risked-destroying-the-earth-during-nuclear-tests-and-cern.t692/" target="_blank">No, I'm kidding, they were absolutely sure this could not happen</a>. But the initial concern was there before they looked deeper into the matter. And when it came to the development of the hydrogen bomb, the concern surfaced once again and again it was deemed impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I agree wholeheartedly but I'm more asking because I'm curious if any planet with a similar atmosphere is capable of burning like a giant candle or cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol. I know there are planets with temperatures hot enough to ignite our atmosphere but clearly they have different atmospheric compositions? </p>
<p>I'm just wondering if there's room for wicked crazy burning planet photos in our space exploration future. Would it only happen in freak events like a rogue planet getting waaaayyyy too close to a sun? </p>
<p>Edit: feature = future. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Close but backwards, nitrogen is the predominant gas in air at ~78%. </p></div>		</li>
