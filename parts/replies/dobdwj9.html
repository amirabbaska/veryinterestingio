			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add to this excellent answer that once you bottle the wine some of these processes stop. Wines generally do not age in the bottle and in fact, can become significantly worse after a few years. Only a very small selection of (usually expensive) wines are intended to be aged. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, wines do mature in the bottle, as the maturing process consists mostly of tannins polymerizing (which causes the wine to taste less bitter and astringent) and esterizing of acids, which reduces the perceived acidity. This all causes the wine to taste more smooth and certain other processes can also develop extra flavours in the wine.</p>
<p>What stops happening in the bottle is the fermentation, as wines, unlike some craft beers, are filtered before being bottled.</p></div>		</li>
