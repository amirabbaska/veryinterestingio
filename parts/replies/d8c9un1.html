			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I see that Na and K have very similar abundances, and they are similar chemically, so why isn't there more potassium? Is it due to NaCl's almost flat temperature v. solubility curve? Most salts crystallize out when their aqueous solutions are cooled, but NaCl practically doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sodium generally orients itself in to rocks that have a good equilibrium with the water in that they are relatively water soluble. Potassium likes to form feldspars/plagioclase and is a key component of granite, which are comparatively insoluble and lock in the potassium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's due the varying residence times of those elements. Sodium and chlorine have long residence times, while potassium precipitates rather quickly. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_time_(fluid_dynamics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_time_(fluid_dynamics</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't answer the question, it's just putting a name to the quantity he's asking about and explaining the scheme by which it's calculated.  </p>
<p>The best answer about potassium is that chemical equilibrium prefers its incorporation into newly formed seafloor over other monovalent cations, like Na^+.  This has been demonstrated in the stoichiometry of minerals that compose oceanic crust as a function of distance from spreading centers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but your own link and reasoning doesnt actually explain the reality.</p>
<p>For instance, the difference in abundance between Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) is only about 10%, but Na is present almost 30x more than K. </p>
<p>Similarly, Florine is actually more abundant than Chlorine in the crust, yet Cl is present about 1500 times more than F in seawater.</p>
<p>And to be sure, both K and Na, as well as both Cl and F form water soluble salts. Indeed, they are salts relatively commonly used all the time, including to floridate drinking water!</p>
<p>Additionally, this is even more interesting because river water flowing into the seas, actually has more K than Na, and more of things like sulphates than clorides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So for F vs Cl, you are missing the point where I said that some of the species are more reactive with each other. Fluoride is EXTREMELY reactive towards certain elements and this limits its upper concentration in the environment. Don't mix up our ability to add fluoride to drinking water with what happens when it is in the environment. </p>
<p>As for Na and K, I must admit that I do not know. There are many possibilities and all I can say with confidence is there must be some sink that preferentially collects K over Na. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is essentially the right answer. Na and Cl are one of the few ions that dont react (e.g. precipitate) with anything likely to be found in the oceans . Phosphate, sulfate, fluoride, silicate, carbonate etc will combine with other ions such as Mg, so their concentrations are limited. Similarly metal ions such as Ca, Mg, Fe etc will combine with other anions or precipitate as oxides (before there was any oxygen in the atmosphere there was a shitload of iron in the oceans)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluorine loves to bind with calcium, and will do so preferentially over many other cations. CaF2 is largely non-soluble. Fluorine will also bind to sodium and potassium when present, and both of these have limited solubility. We use sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide solutions to scrub fluorine and HF gases from industrial vents. When we do so we have to be careful to prevent too much fluorine from being used on too little caustic. Handling fluids is much easier than handling solids.</p>
<p>So your lack of fluorine as a dominant anion in water is likely because of its tendency to precipitate.</p></div>		</li>
