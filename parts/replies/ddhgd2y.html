			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, see, that's what everyone says.  Yet, as far as I've seen, there's no way to gain personal information via license plate without being in law enforcement or an authorized DMV representative. </p>
<p>Thus ELI5: how would one gain information from a license plate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK at least, we have quite a large problem with cloned cars. Hiding your number plate in images, especially ones that can easily be accessed online can protect you from this quite effective scam.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to clone my current car I would simply search my vehicles specifications in an engine such as AutoTraders, Gumtrees  etc. to find a similar car. For the scam to work efficiently one has to find an <strong>exact</strong> copy or, clone. Same engine, colour, number of doors, alloy wheels and, possibly even identifying model badges on the rear.</p>
<p>You find your clone, being privately sold or by a garage, it does not matter. If the aforementioned number plate is not hidden, removed, blurred, or displaying false plates you can successfully clone the car.</p>
<p>Buy a number plate displaying that cars characters, some websites will only sell you the plate if you can prove you own that car (V5 Registration document). I bet my bottom dollar there are places where this security measure is waved.</p>
<p>When they arrive, replace your plates with the clones. Late for work? No bother, you wont be paying for the fines.</p>
<p>Long winded, apologies about that, not really ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I just got back from the U.K.! </p>
<p>Another issue you guys have is dirty license plates.</p>
<p>My fiancé said it was a £200 fine but I swear I saw a million dirtyed-out license plates. The cops didn't seem to care to much.</p>
<p>Also you need more Q's in your license plates. </p>
<p>We drove 7 hours from Norfolk to Scotland and I tried to play the &quot;ABC&quot; game with the plates of passing cars, I was doing well but then got stuck on Q and spent the next 6 hours looking for a Q. Never found it.</p>
<p>These are serious concerns of mine, please handle them swiftly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That problem doesn't exist in the US because our license plates are government issued. You can't get an already-being-used plate for yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like a lot of hassle for very little gain.  What are the main reasons why someone would want to clone a car? Outside of an elaborate crime / organized crime. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how it's done, but I had someone find out my address using just my name and license plate number. </p>
<p>I teach at a high school, and I learned from one of my students that a different student had a crush on me. Which is fine, I'm pretty young and it happens. But a few days later I was told this same student had found out where I lived, and along with another kid, had driven to where I lived and taken a few pictures in front of the place. </p>
<p>This actually wasn't all that threatening to me for a lot of reasons. What I was more concerned with is how they found my place. I had recently gotten divorced and moved into a new place, and I wanted to do everything I possibly could to avoid my ex finding out where I lived. The only places that knew my new address were the bank and the DMV. Utilities were in someone else's name, I was renting a room so my name wasn't on the place in paperwork, and packages were delivered to my parents. </p>
<p>So speaking to these two students with another teacher they admitted to driving out to my place, and I asked them how they found it. They had figured out which car was mine because I'm often there late, and one of the students said they'd found it using my name and license plate on some site on the deep web. They &quot;didn't remember&quot; the name of it. So idk, maybe they were lying and followed me home or something, but they seemed to be telling the truth. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a bunch of them to be found in the shadier corners of the internet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>idk, when i worked for a security company i was in charge of the swing shift, and one of our responsibilities for the <em>large tech company you have heard of</em> was to take the licence plate numbers of cars parked illegally, and call the government office associated with licence plates. we would give them the licence number and state, and they would give us the full name of the person registered to the car. we were then supposed to send the names to corporate. </p>
<p>i know for a fact people used that system to find out the names of people who tailgated them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for the tailgating... I'm glad my state doesn't use front plates.  They'd either have to wait for me to pass them or otherwise somehow get behind me to get my plate.</p>
<p>Not that I tailgate people.  Unless they're just hanging out in the passing lane on the highway and don't take the hint to move over when I flash my lights at them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except I see people doing this on Facebook BST groups. Like, your name is right there. I can click on your name and figure out plenty about you. I know you're from the local area because you're posting in my area's BST group. Your Facebook profile probably shows me, at a minimum, what you do for a living, where you go to school, and when you were born.</p>
<p>What good did blocking out your license plate do? I laugh every time I see it.</p></div>		</li>
