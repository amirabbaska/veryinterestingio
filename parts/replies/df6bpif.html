			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related: after trees arose, it took about 60M years for something to evolve that could digest wood. For a period almost as long as the time between now and the dinosaurs, dead trees just .... kind of.... piled up. </p>
<p>Over time, the buried dead wood became the coal we mine today, which is why its called the Carboniferous (coal-bearing) era.</p>
<p>Which is also why we <em>really</em> shouldnt mine coal, because the biosphere spent the last 300M years were adapting to a world without that amount of carbon in the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine a world just covered in wood. Wherever you look, wood on the ground, piled up high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true. Coal forms from the coalification of peat. Peat is formed from the anoxic decay of ferns, reeds and moss in anoxic swamp environments. Sure there were trees, but they did in fact rot and break down, and they were not the biggest contributor to the coal we mine today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm taking my Evolution unit test in AP Biology today and could chime in on this one even, life started in the ocean because there was no ozone and life on land was inhospitable. Once the ozone formed, aquatic organisms evolved to arthropods, the arthropods were first to live on land. The amphibians evolved from them and then the reptiles from then and so on. It's quite interesting.</p></div>		</li>
