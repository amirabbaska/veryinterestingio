(In another context, you can use an electron beam to heat a target thatâ€™s right side up to increase its vapor pressure; this is called e-beam evaporation.) Both are PVD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a wets surface prep technician in a fabricator, I can speak to something finally!!  We have a seed layer of copper and use a plating bath to actually plate the copper across the wafers. It really depends on which layer you are working on.  Sometimes you are building TSVs (through silicon vias) and the copper needs to be flowed in all the etch trenches to create the electrical connection to the other layers. Other times you are just blanketing copper to allow a layer for the following layers to connect to.</p></div>		</li>
