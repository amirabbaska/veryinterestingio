			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great info.  Just wondering, I'm a middle aged guy with pretty good hearing, even at the higher frequencies.  As I am into producing music, I do what I can to protect it.</p>
<p>But sometimes I get what seems like short bouts of tinnitus.  It can happen in either ear as a high pitch (not always the same pitch) - but it fades out after about 60 seconds.  It doesn't correlate to any stress or recent loud noises afaik.  I've been told (even by an ENT doctor) that it's normal and not to worry as long as it goes away.  Is that true?  I've always been a little worried that it isnt...</p></div>		</li>

<p>We also know that even when tinnitus is caused by injury to the cochlea (such as by trauma or by drugs that kill hair cells), you can remove the cochlea or cut the auditory nerve (that connects the cochlea to the brain) and the perception of tinnitus (in most people) still remains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drugs that kill hair cells?  Could you talk about this some?  All my google searches keep yielding drugs that regrow these hairs rather than destroy them.  Just want to make sure I avoid that shit at all costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had Tinnitus all my life. It was only recently that I learned not everyone else has the phantom sounds in a quiet room. Hopefully there will be a cure one day. I wonder what it's like not hearing anything.</p></div>		</li>
