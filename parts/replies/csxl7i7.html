			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm....lots of inaccuracy here.  Apples are generally processed in one of two paths:
1--Kept in normal refrigeration and run over a washing-grading-waxing-packing line and sent to grocery stores within a month of being picked.
2--moved &quot;as-is&quot; into controlled atmosphere, which is high NITROGEN, low oxygen, cold storage environment.   (1-MCP is not always used.) Respiration stops, but the apple can still decay if it is punctured, has a bug, or was of poor quality.</p>
<p>When a controlled atmosphere room is opened, apples are then sorted across a packing line--- washed, culls removed, then waxed and packaged.  Why/how would you think that wax could be removed before shipping to the store?</p>
<p>Waxed, bagged apples store well in the fridge for 6-8 weeks--in the middle of winter.  That's the beauty of using &quot;natural&quot; wax--carnauba or shellac--it dramatically increases the refrigerated shelf life of an apple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the grocery stores I worked at, we never washed the apples prior to putting them on the shelf. There might have been a thin layer of wax or maybe a shellac, but we just opened the box and put them on the display.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of that time a McDonald's had a CO2 leak in the back storage room, the CO2 that goes to the soda machine. The manager wasn't around or something when the CO2 guy showed up, so another McD's employee (18 year old kid) hopped over a fence to unlock the door, but never did show up. So the CO2 guy climbed over. Then the manager came back and the CO2 truck was there, but the guy and his employee weren't around. I think the manager opened the door and tried to help them, and even he needed assistance getting out. Firefighters showed up, and the CO2 guy and McDonald's employee were dead.</p>
<p>This story was used in a safety course I took. They told us if you think there's a gas leak of any kind, GET OUT. Don't go back in to try and help people, because you don't have any idea how long you haven't been breathing air, you could go back in and likely never come out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a kitchen in a retirement facility. One night (after the head boss left) we could smell gas in the kitchen and had no idea what was going on so we called 911. The firefighters came, noticed the stove wasn't aligned right and aligned it correctly and cut off the gas flow. I remember one the firefighters (he wasn't wearing gear, just a FF tee, and was significantly smaller than the rest of the guys) getting very angry about wasting time. Ever since then, I'm super hesitant about these kinds of things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Can't smell a lack of oxygen.  You would probably just get dizzy for a few seconds and then hit the deck.  I lost my sense of smell years back and I've been super paranoid about natural gas leaks and such around my place.  I'm constantly checking my carbon monoxide/ smoke detector batteries because of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a HAZWOPR course for tanks and there was a similar story. One dude went into a train car tank and passed out. Next guy went in after him. 3 guys wound up dying before they put on respirators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at an aluminum coil factory. The basement under the machines have a CO2 system in case of fire. The ERT team is to never ever go down there with out their mask and tanks on. One guy went down there during a false alarm without his mask and was fired almost on the spot. If the system went off he would have died almost instantly. Scary stuff indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at CERN, and we have a LOT of liquid helium in the LHC tunnel (which is a pretty narrow tunnel, and the exits may be far enough away that the people working there use bikes to get around). If you are going down there, you have to carry a breathing kit in case of leaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The good thing is you feel CO2 poisoning by the burning sensation in your lungs and the panic in your whole body. So if you are not deep enough in theres still hope to get. Not enough that id bet my life on that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a winery cellar, a guy once crawled into a fermenting tank to clean it once it was emptied. He thought it was a good idea to go in without proper facemask, we had to pull his ass out when we hear him drop. Had we delayed he may have died. In his words, but it was funny. Idiot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know where you get 3 weeks...I only have my own experience (which Redditors tend to count as worthless), but my parents own a farm and we have an orchard with hundreds of apple trees. We don't do any gassing, or anything. It's all &quot;organic&quot; (in quotes because as farmers, we're pretty 'meh' about the whole organic thing), but they easily last a whole year with just refrigeration. Hell, I literally just ate one from last year's harvest and although it's not as pretty, or tasty, it still tastes a lot better than what I can buy in a store...</p>
<p>But that's just for apples. Most fruits go bad really fast. Other than apples, I can't really think of a fruit that lasts that long without any kind of extra chemical dousing or something like that. Even pears with hard skin can't last more than a few months...</p>
<p>Apples have their own wax that protect themselves pretty well. I think the reason why store bought apples need to be sprayed in the first place is because they are cleaned before being put into storage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come on over and I'll give you an apple from last year. <em>shrug</em> Just saying we don't gas, we don't low O2...just throw in in the fridge and we have apples all year. </p>
<p>Just because throwing apples from a tree into the fridge works, doesn't mean your method doesn't also work...Also, you guys can probably keep them prettier and more consistent. We don't go around giving our friends/family year old apples because they just aren't that pretty, and we find that a lot of people tend to care more about how things look than how they taste.</p></div>		</li>
