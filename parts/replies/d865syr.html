			<div class="markdown"><p>I am honestly just curious, but are you an economist? I think it is pretty bold to say that Keynes was proved accurate...I can see why governments promote the idea of Keynesian economics because it can be used to justify major spending, but from what I understand there is a lot of debate about what exactly got us out of the Great Depression. I am not an economist but I hear economists from the opposite side as Keynes argue that government spending actually prolonged the depression.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Modern libertarians claim to be classical liberals </p>

<p>You've got that one backwards. Modern Classical Liberals claim to be Libertarians because we most closely align with them when it comes to policies and the like. You'll notice this if you observe the American Libertarian party, for example, where most members are not actually Libertarian, by the party's own definition, but Classical Liberals of the Milton Friedman variety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which is quite hypocritical since it is the essence of liberalism. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it though? The most basic definition of Classical Liberalism makes me question this assertion, for example this one taken from <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/classical_liberalism.htm" target="_blank">Science Daily</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classical liberalism is a political philosophy and ideology belonging to liberalism in which primary emphasis is placed on securing the freedom of the individual by limiting the power of the government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever our differences, this is essentially what Libertarianism is all about. We tend to be far more hostile to the government, true, but we are doing the same thing. </p></div>		</li>
