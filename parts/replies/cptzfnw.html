			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't the symptoms, it's the virus itself. Immunocompromised people can't completely clear out the virus. Even if they can clear it up to the point where symptoms aren't present, there can still be a small number of viruses hanging around indefinitely. Once they're exposed to the population again these can infect other people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the common cold would be the most advantageous to rid ourselves of. Well, maybe not rhino/entero so much as RSV which is super dangerous to kids and infants. </p>
<p>The flu, well, that's what the flu vaccine is for. If everyone (to whom it's safe to administer) would just <em>get</em> the damn thing...and I realize no vaccine is 100% effective but it's something. </p></div>		</li>
