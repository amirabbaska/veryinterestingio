<p>You have to imagine this in 3d now, like a 3 sided pyramid with 4 point of detected color, and some interpreted color point somewhere in the 3d space of the pyramid.</p>

<p>I think their brain still has usual interpretation, i.e. the 4th point still lies in the plane of the 3 first points, so it doesn't actually span the dimensions further. It only helps to make those colors more distinguishable.</p>
<p>But we can't even tell if there is a &quot;usual interpretation&quot; though, since there is no way to describe how a color looks other than refering to.. your own interpretation of colors. Perhaps what looks like green to me is red for you! So who knows, maybe a few of the already rare tetrachromats have extra dimension or colors!</p></div>		</li>
