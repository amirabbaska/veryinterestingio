<p>A quick test in Photoshop will demonstrate that the colors in the image are blue and golden-brown.</p>
<p>But because we aren't there, we don't actually know how it's lit. Some people assume it's in shadow</p>

<p>I can't wrap my mind around how people are going, &quot;oh, all that blue/black is just shadow and therefore the dress is white and gold.&quot;  Even if it's a subconscious thing and people aren't doing it on purpose, I can't figure out how your brain would label obvious-blue coloring as a shadow on a white object.</p>
<p>And then some people are saying, &quot;I think it's blue and gold&quot; as if their brains can't understand that the &quot;gold&quot; part of the image is just bad lighting on the black collar/frills.  It blows my mind that people can see it as anything other than a badly-lit picture of a black/blue dress.  When I first saw people arguing about it on facebook, I kept refreshing their buzzfeed link because I was certain that buzzfeed had to be randomly swapping in two differently-colored images to create the controversy.</p></div>		</li>
