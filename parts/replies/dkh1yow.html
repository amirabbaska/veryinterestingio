<p>Also, consistency is key in maths</p>

<p>Consistency is important, but it's not a proof, since you can arbitrarily define things (it might not be <em>useful</em>, but you can) with strange definitions.</p>

<p>n! = n * (n-1)!</p>

<p>The problem with invoking this is that it says 0!=0<em> stuff. There's two problems. 1, you're multiplying by 0, and two, (-1)! is undefined (For factorials. for the gamma function, it ends up being infinite so you can kind of fudge it and get a 0</em>1/0 ).</p>
<p>It ends up working out, but you have to be super careful.</p>
<p>It's actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial" target="_blank">convention</a> - one which it makes sense, especially in combinatorics etc, but you don't <em>have</em> to pick it. It's chosen that way because it matches the convention for an empty product. (see stevemegson's comment below for nicer wording)</p></div>		</li>
