			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy needed to move a wall 100mph must be greater than the energy moving you or a car at 100mph. The energy released by stoping a wall would be greater. You would feel the same impact, but instead of stoping like you would, the wall would continue moving at a considerable fraction of that velocity spreading your bits around. The question is how to calculate these energies ? Which frame of reference would we choose ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the kinetic energy of a wall moving at 100 mph be greater than a person moving at 100 mph by a factor of their masses? So the energy transfer shouldn't be the same... Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy transferred by the wall would be the same, but - depending on the scenario - the floor would go on to transfer the same amount of energy to you again as you bounce along it after getting launched away by the wall - and that assumes that the wall decellerates quicker than you do and doesn't fall ontop of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you've basically restated /u/GregHullender's exact comment in a more complicated manner.</p>
<p>Except, car/no car makes zero difference. Getting hit by a wall would be more detrimental in every situation except the vacuum of space, where it would be exactly equal to hitting the wall.</p>
<p>On earth (even if you didn't get stuck to the wall and smeared between it and the ground) if you bounced off the wall and didn't get hit by it again, you would still have gained tremendous momentum, and will be bouncing off the ground and other obstacles until  you come to rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There will be a higher pressure region of air in front of the wall and a low pressure region immediately behind the wall, just like what you'd get against a wall in strong winds, but no aerodynamicist would describe it as a cushion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's just assume the wall is being propelled at you on special real tracks at 100mph and it will stop moving one feet after it hits you (or about a body thickness in length). And compare that to running at 100mph into a stationary wall. Is there no difference really?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those two are not equivalent. To make them equivalent, let's say the wall has a bit of floor moving with it (so it's L-shaped). When you're running into it, you fall on that floor. The wall on rails also has the floor moving with it. In that case, the two are equivalent if the wall does <em>not</em> stop when it hits you.</p>
<p>This assumes that your mass is negligible compared to the mass of the wall.</p></div>		</li>
