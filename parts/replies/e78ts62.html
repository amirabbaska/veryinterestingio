			<div class="markdown"><p>They measure in both hours and miles on the truck itself, but when talking about life expectancy standards they measure in miles. Distance is measured in miles not hours. You may go further in an hour than I do, therefore you have put more wear and tear on your vehicle than I have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No since the majority of diesels are industrial motors that don't move. Most engines either have PTO's that run equipment or are connected directly. Work chassis it's measured in hours, in heavy equip and farm equip its hours, on generators and rig engines it's hours. It's all hours, only smaller vehicles are in miles.</p>
<p>I might drive 10 miles but run my engine high idle in a stationary position for 12 while using a pump or piece of equipment, thats why most are measured in hours. </p>
<p>Just look at how equipment and semi are sold, its always in hours.</p></div>		</li>
