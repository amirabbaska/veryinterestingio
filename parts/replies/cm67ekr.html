			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  I go to that meeting every year, and it was absolutely nuts when they were presenting the preliminary data from the Curiosity rover a few years ago.  You couldn't get into the room where the presentations were given, and the &quot;overflow&quot; rooms (screening live webcasts of the talks going on in the other room) were also incredibly packed.  I expect it to be similar for this.</p>
<p>And I'll be happy to have 15 people come to my presentation :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to know what exactly the data is. Temperature readings? Are ground samples being taken and analysed? I mean, I don't even know what else to ask. Why is the probe their in the first place?  What do they plan to learn? </p>
<p>Sorry for the ramble of questions. I just realize how little i know about what's happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want detailed information, the <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions" target="_blank">ESA FAQ page</a> is probably your best bet to get up to speed.</p>
<p>I think the basic answer is that it's there to try to get as detailed information about what comets are made of and how they're structured. A lot of the data is going to be spectroscopic which can tell you the composition of the comet and what sorts of material is getting ejected as it starts to heat up when it approaches the sun.</p>
<p>How do the volatiles leave the surface and form the coma and tail we associate with comets? Which molecules start to be ejected from the surface when? How complicated and which organic molecules are there floating around on comets? What's at the core of the comet? Is it a rubble pile or are things more densely packed than that? Is the water from the comet consistent with being the same water we have on Earth and support the idea that Earth's water was delivered by comets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always imagined that the &quot;fumes&quot; (is this the correct word?) eject rather forcefully from the comet. So can the probe suffer damage from the coma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question related to OP's question.  Why is 67P a comet?  According to wikipedia, its closest approach to the sun is about 1.25 AU and its furthest is about 5.6 AU, just outside Jupiter's orbit.  Does this comet even have a tail given that its orbit doesn't bring it any closer to the sun than earth?</p>
<p>It's period is about 6.5 years, so you'd think that we'd see it often if it did have much of a tail.</p>
<p>I've always thought comets were objects from the Oort cloud that have extremely eccentric orbits that take them back to the Oort cloud after their extremely close passes with the sun.</p>
<p>Why is 67p not considered just an asteroid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One very cool thing that was done was <a href="http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-12176/#/gallery/17219" target="_blank">radio mapping of the interior of the comet.</a> This allows us to create a 3-d map of comet density. The article I linked has a lot of neat info, and the stuff about radio waves is about halfway down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, this is actually pretty interesting and exciting, and seems responsive to OP's question -- you couldn't really do this accurately without being able to circle around the comet.   Knowing the density map of the comet means that we have a LOT more information about how it might have formed and what stuff it's made of.   (How uniform is it?  Are there rocks in it?  If so, how big are the rocks.   Did it form from gasses collecting via gravity?  Or could it only have been formed from something bigger breaking apart? etc, etc.)   For me personally, I find the gravity effects for such an object to be non-intuitive (e.g., is that enough gravity to form solid materials?  What's the effect of very light gravity for a very, very long time (billions of years)?)    That all seems like it could be really, really interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the little I gathered so far, the biggest surprise is, how hard the surface is. People believed it to be porous, ash-like agglomerations of dust. It turns out that at least the top surface layer is quite hard, probably from repeated cooling and warming over hundreds of millions of years. Which (besides the malfunction of the thruster that was supposed to hold it down) is why the lander did not stay down in the first landing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It appears all the Rosetta preliminary results are scheduled to hijack the meeting on Wednesday, December 17 with talks going from 10:20am to 6pm PST.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hijack&quot; is a bit strong. AGU is an meeting with 20,000ish scientists from almost all fields of earth, planetary and space sciences. The preliminary results from Rosetta will certainly hijack the press' coverage of the meeting, but rest assured there will be plenty of interesting science being presented simultaneously during the Rosetta sessions :)</p></div>		</li>
