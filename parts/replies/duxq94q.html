			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm constantly fidgeting (biting my nails, making beats on desks, never standing still, and many other things) and literally can't stop but I never feel anxious and I'm a pretty stress free person. Any thoughts on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any tips for when my anxiety attack stems from a fear of having a toileting accident due to my fight/flight response at that moment causing my digestive system to want to shut down in preparation for diverting energy to my muscles to fight or run from the tiger aka this upcoming trivial social interaction without the need to actually retreat to the toilet which Im told is a positive feedback loop for the anxiety and could cause it to think 'hrm yes this is definitely the appropriate response to this situation'?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, chewing is commonly a result of hyposensitive sensory processing. Chewing satisfies the nervous system's distracting desire for more sensory information, aiding in one's ability to focus. It could also be a form of stimming, which is like self-soothing when one is anxious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't heard this brought up but wanted to add it. Many people with anxiety like me have too much of the neurotransmitter that makes us alert or not enough of the transmitter that counteracts that alertness. So, my brain is constantly demanding I find a solution to a nonexistent problem. It works the opposite of the way it should. I should be telling my brain when there is a problem and it should be feeding me the chemicals to make me alert in reaction. This is why alcohol is so horrible for people with anxiety. It acts like a counterweight to anxiety and mimics GABA in the brain. It signals that there are no problems, relax. Now, if I am watching television, I will start biting my nails. This is much the same as chewing in autism. It's not nervous energy. The television is feeding us a story with a conflict that needs to be resolved. My brain doesn't know the difference between a situation in real life and a situation being played it harmlessly on television. It just understands conflict is apparent. Again, my brain demands I find a solution. So, biting my fingernails signals to my brain that I am doing work. I am using that stimulation to say, I am working to find a solution. When the solution comes Brain, I'll let you know and you can reward me with reward neurotransmitters. With autism, there is a lack of something called adaptation. Adaptation is what allows your brain to ignore stimulation. If you walk into a room, you will immediately adapt to that environment. Sounds will be acknowledged and your will stop perceiving them. Smells will do the same. But for people with autism, adaptation is shallow. The room and all its stimulation do not go away. Those are all problems that have no solution. They chew to trick their brain into believing they are working on a solution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your story about watching TV resonated with me so much. This is why I'm a gamer. I <strong>need</strong> the interactivity, otherwise I get bored and eventually very uncomfortable. </p>
<p>I've also noticed that in recent years my anxiety gets worse when I go to a movie theater, and while I'll usually force myself to stay for the entire film I'll be very uncomfortable during it and after it for a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not exactly. In a typical, healthy individual with no anxiety, nor any complications with their attention or focus, it wouldn't be more beneficial. I'd like to see the study they're referencing in which they did those tests.</p>
<p>Looking at the site, there isn't even a reference provided. That's actually a terrible thing to go by.</p>
<p>People with those disorders can garner a sense of control that tends to be lacking for them. Anxious individuals usually feel a sense of helplessness, and those small things help to relax them. Since this is ELI5, there's not really much more to delve into, but if you're interested in the physiology of this sort of thing, a good pop-science book (actually, a great one) is:</p>
