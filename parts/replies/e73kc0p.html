<p>Spent a night hooked up to 28 separate sensors a few weeks ago. Movement on multiple limbs and on the face, ECG, EEG, pulse oximetry, microphone (detecting mouth breathing), nasal cannula (detecting nose breathing), etc...</p>
<p>Not the most pleasant night, but hopefully there's some answers in the 1000-odd pages of data that was recorded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a full sleep study with all the equipment supposed to be indicative of a normal night’s sleep? I feel like all the added factors (wires and sensors, etc) would seriously skew the results. Even when I was just hooked up to a single IV in the hospital, I wasn’t able to really get any decent sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a few things they're looking for that are mostly independent. That you will wake up repeatedly and such is almost certainly expected (the nurse administering it had to come in a few times to readjust the pulse oximeter, for instance). They'll still be able to catch excessive snoring, interruptions in breathing, how your brainwaves transition between states (for instance, if you fall straight into REM sleep instead of going through a NREM phase), and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, I don't <em>know</em>. I was the patient, and wikipedia and google only help so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know these patients aren’t going to get a full nights sleep. What we are looking at more is the transition into various sleep stages. Most patients are being evaluated for either a seizure or sleep disorder or apnea.
A misconception with a lot of patients is how much they actually sleep. I’d had patients walk out saying they were very tired and got no sleep, but they had pretty normal sleeping patterns that night.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's me right there.  I know the part inside the vein is a non-sharp, flexible rubber-like tube that can't hurt you, but I just can't bring myself to sleep in any way but flat on my back with my arm basically pinned straight out to the side.  Drives me nuts...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did a sleep study like this as a starving student (they were evaluating potential participants for a sleeping drug). I had a wicked nightmare (involving the doctor and “Igor” coming into room in middle of night, and fighting them off), that the tech showed me the next morning (brainwaves looked like a 9.0 earthquake seismograph representation) and said “that must’ve been a hell of a nightmare “...  it was!</p>
<p>Didn’t get a callback, but did get $80 for sleeping there one night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>those apps are shit. tell your doctor you are having problems sleeping. Dont mention the never wake up, dreams or close to 8 hours. Just tell him that you are EXCESSIVELY sleepy. RELENTLESSLY sleepy and that you would like a referral to a sleep clinic. I would go there as they have the electrodes and can exactly measure whats going</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with devilishgains. Just tell your doc that you do not get enough restful sleep and would like a sleep study done. You won’t be able to take any conclusive data at home. Also—don’t opt for the home sleep studies. They are much more difficult to score, leads can come off, data can be inconclusive or inaccurate. It’s better to be watched by a tech to confirm data and make notes during the study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't believe I came across this post as I was just thinking about my sleep habits earlier today and thought about going in for a study. Question for you. Every time I sleep on my back I experience sleep paralysis. When I sleep on my right side, I have what I can only be described as hallucinatory sleep, where I drift in and out of sleep and it is further compounded by extraordinary physical sensations that linger from the dreams as I oscillate in and out of consciousness. The best way to describe those sensations would be the feeling you get if you take too much benadryl, nyquil, or ambien and you fight the sensation to sleep. It's a liquid heaviness that swishes around your head and body. The only way for me to comfortably sleep is if I sleep on my left side, usually with a pillow or my comforter in between my knees. Any idea what is going on here? Does this have something to do with blood flow/restriction/pressure to certain parts of the brain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super weird. I have never heard of sleeping position affecting sleep paralysis! I will totally look into it. My expertise is not sleep paralysis, rather cataplexy (a diff form of paralysis). I have a two good friends in this field and will shoot them a msg! Send me a pm so i can get back to you!!!! Also, just so you know - just bc you have sleep paralysis does not mean you suffer from narcolepsy. It can happen to healthy individuals. But ill find out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes this could work. never knew it looks at HRV. REM sleep is super erratic with respect to heartrate and respiratory rate. Very cool! thank sfor the PUBMED link cant wait to rip into it tonight!!!!! Edit: bah! no article link. You have this article by any chance? Also, it seems like they tested it but it does not say that fitbit uses the ratio to calculate stages - does fitbit do that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep tech who scores sleep studies all day here. This explanation is accurate, but to add a few more details: </p>
<ol>
<li>All of this is correlative (you don't move that much when you sleep, therefore it assume that is your sleep), but even when it guesses on the stages of sleep it does in fact use some other data (although that's even more of a guess.  </li>
<li>depending on the system, if it tracks your heart rate it can use that to try and guess what stage of sleep one is in (because your relative heart rates and different in different stages of sleep). e.g. Heart rate is slowest during &quot;deep sleep&quot; and faster and much more all over the place during REM.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you combine the two data sets (heart rate &amp; movement) you can sometimes reasonably guess at what stage someone might be in. Although, these are guesses, they're not always bad guesses. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed that my ahtletic watch is somewhat consistent with the stages. I fall asleep hard, and the watch depicts this as my deep sleep right after I go to bed.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I'll wake up in the morning extremely tired and I'll look at the app, and it shows that I was basically in the middle of a REM cycle.</p>
<p>Maybe they're not scientifically as accurate as a real sleep study that studies your brain waves, but they seem to be at least somewhat accurate.</p></div>		</li>
