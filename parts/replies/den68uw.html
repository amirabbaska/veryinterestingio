<p>That means that they have the lowest energies that they possibly can, but their average kinetic energies are not necessarily zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the nucleii have no kinetic energy, but the electrons do?  And since we're at absolute zero, these electrons have no way of transferring their own kinetic energy then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the atoms formed a classical ideal gas all the way down to absolute zero, then the kinetic energy of each atom would go to zero at absolute zero, and the internal average energies of the bound electrons would remain nonzero.</p>
<p>Of course, atoms will <strong>not</strong> behave like classical gases near absolute zero.</p>
<p>If the atoms are bosons, they'll all pile into the lowest energy state (with the electrons still doing their thing internally). If the atoms are fermions, they'll have to fill the lowest levels according to the Pauli principle (again, with the electrons doing what electrons do).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make sense to me. I assume an &quot;atom&quot; is really just a particular arrangement/system/whatever of subatomic particles. Surely, then, since there's not really such a thing as an atom, the energy of the &quot;atom&quot; should be equal to the sum of its parts, otherwise it begs the question &quot;where is the missing energy?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, but we'd know for sure that the electron (assuming a hydrogen-like atom) is in its ground state.</p>
<p>It is still described by a wavefunction, and doesn't have a definite position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood what that means--when you say described by a wavefunction do you mean the electrons go between two points a plus one and negative one as time flows and it can be traced on a a graph/as it can be traced for that scenario? Or do you mean it pulses in and out of existence? Cos essentially it flies in the top layer of a sphere-- ical motion? Or what? Is it all about spin for them? </p></div>		</li>
