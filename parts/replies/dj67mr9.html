<p>I feel like I should point out that cutting a CEO's salary usually has a negligent impact on company finances.</p>

<p>Hmmm, it's discutable. First, not all the CEO in the world are Musk, Brin or Zuckerberg, most of them are still paid huge amounts of money a year regardless of their results. Second, their salaries may not be impactful on the company finances, it still represents many &quot;little salaries&quot; of all the &quot;little hands&quot; that works beneath you in order to produce riches for the company. </p>
<p>1 000 000 a year may be nothing to a company as large as Microsoft for exemple, but it still represents something like 10 month of salaries for ~hundred of those &quot;little hands&quot;. In this case, if I was a CEO, I would prefer to cut my salary to the minimum to rather than be forced to lay off some employees that does not deserve it (if they don't deserved it). </p>
<p>Just because you're into big business stuff doesn't mean you have to be a selfish bitch.</p></div>		</li>
