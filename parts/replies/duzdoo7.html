<p>One day science will find a way to kill horses. Until that day, all we can do is try to stay out of their way and keep farming the oats as they demand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I counter that something that big is fragile specifically because it's so big.  They're a victim of the square-cube law as far as becoming larger makes you heavier faster than it makes you stronger.</p>
<p>Also, breeding.  I suspect wild horses have less of the eating problems you mention.</p></div>		</li>
