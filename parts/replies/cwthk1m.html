			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not always the case, I used to pick up lettuce in California as a single driver, 4 days back up to Toronto Canada.  Then on day 5 it would be delivered to a packager, who would chop it up and bag it, then we would transport it back down into the US for sale at grocery stores.  So 6 to 7 days before it hit shelves for the consumer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True that it's not always a team, different types of lettuce have vastly different shelf lives. I was just demonstrating to OP that the produce is moved to the store shelf very quickly in comparison to how long it stays in the consumers fridge. </p></div>		</li>
