			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s been shown to be the opposite case. Based on the studies I’ve seen, both under and over correction increased myopia. The most effective Rx is to be exactly in focus, at both the macula and periphery. It’s that latter part that seems to be tricky. That’s why current modalities to treat myopia progression include lenses that focus light peripherally, such as ortho-k and multifocal soft lenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So having a somewhat inaccurate Rx in my corrective lenses could have, over time, increased my myopia? </p>
<p>I've always secretly worried about this. I remember complaining about certain, updated prescriptions and being told, &quot;Don't be so picky. It's close enough. Your eyes will adapt.&quot; Is settling for a slightly inaccurate Rx potentially harmful?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for those who progress, even the correct Rx leads to progression. It may be in focus in your center vision, but glasses and even standard contacts lead to a bit of hyperopic defocus in the periphery (~15 degrees from center), which stimulates axial growth (elongation) and myopia increase. Special lenses prevent this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither chickens nor babies experience this effect after they reach a certain age.</p>
<p>Humans do show some plasticity of the optical components during the first year of life, but it's far gone by the typical age of onset for myopia. Otherwise we could cure myopia by simply not wearing glasses.</p></div>		</li>
