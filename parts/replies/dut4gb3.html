			<div class="markdown"><p>But what are they going to do with the rocket boosters after they grab them. They'll be too big to reel into the plane and you can't really land while dragging them. They plan to dump them somewhere where the water is shallow enough to recover them easily or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for the fact that SpaceX is winning contracts over both Lockheed and Boeing. The only thing really making them a bigger force is that ULA already has a reputation built up with our government. SpaceX is just beginning to build the reputation with the added benefit of being cheaper to use than their competitors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! They had salt capsules that would dissolve everything after 2 days if the US couldnâ€™t recover it. A pretty cool program, imo</p></div>		</li>
