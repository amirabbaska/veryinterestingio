			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response! I know memory is an extremely complicated process that my question over simplified. Regardless, you brought up the actual reason why I asked it. I had seen a video of man with alzheimers who could perfectly recall lyrics of songs he listened to when he was younger, and that's what got me wondering about the mechanics of memory loss and what we know so far.  Haha, you definitely got me with your extra &quot;to&quot; ;) and despite knowing how our brain filters out excess information like that, I hadn't even considered how that might be factored into memory storage.. And I've also read about how we never remember a memory, we just remember &quot;remembering&quot; that memory, which is why they grow increasingly vague and with less details the more we recall them, though I don't know how correct that is. Thanks for taking the time to respond though! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the video: it is well known in dementia patients that recent memories are lost quicker than memories from a long time ago. I don't have access to any papers on my phone, but there are different hypotheses as to why this is, some more plausable than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spend some time around people with dementia where English is their second language, and I noticed that they lose the use of the second language over the months and end up only speaking in the language they grew up with. They may even start their sentences with a few English words, so I get the impression that they <em>think</em> they're speaking English the whole time but are in fact speaking Italian/Greek/Russian/etc..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be slightly more precise, the phenomenon you describe (&quot;temporal gradient&quot; of memory loss or Ribot's law) is characteristic of some types of dementia but not of others. There is, for instance, an often discussed distinction between Alzheimer's Disease and Semantic Dementia. AD affects episodic memory (memories of particular events, specific places and moments), and the deterioration follows Ribot's law:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Disruptions to the episodic memory system usually follow Ribot's law, which states that events and items experienced just prior to an ictus are more vulnerable to decay than remote memories [47]. Thus, as episodic memory abilities decline in AD patients, events from the distant past are relatively better remembered than events that occurred after or shortly before the onset of the disease</em>&quot;
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2655107/" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>In contrast, SD patients suffer from damage to the semantic system (general facts, abstract properties of classes of objects). This system forms over many years of data collecting. Here, the temporal gradient is reversed:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>[SD patients] typically show relatively preserved recollection of recent autobiographical memory in the context of poorer remote autobiographical memory (known as the reverse temporal gradient or step-function), reflecting increased semanticisation of past events</em>&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its called filtering, or rather a lack thereof.  The strength of filtering varies in both Autistic and Non-Autitic individuals, but generally becomes weaker the stronger an individual's Autism is.  In addition, for any one individual, your filtering may be stronger in one sense than another.</p>
<p>Neurotypical brains inherently filter out unimportant background information to focus on foreground information.  If someone is talking to you, and you aren't trying to ignore them, you won't be counting the number of ceiling tiles.</p>
<p>Autistic brains work in the reverse manner.  At a mechanical level, the brain is attempting to process out foreground information, and to pay attention to background information.  Autistic individuals will frequently report problems with things like struggling to hear a person speak over the ticking of a clock.  This allows Autistic individuals remember background information more clearly.  It is also one factor as to why many Autistic people dislike eye-contact; if they want to listen intently to a person, then staring off into the distance so their brains will process the voice as background information will make it easier to understand and remember. </p>
<p>There is a scientific theory that I generally support, that these symptoms at one point in human history may have been useful adaptation for small group or solo hunters.  Being hyper organized, remembering the enviroment in great detail, prioritizing background noise; all would contribute positively to a solitary hunter that would not be able to rely on other humans pick up things they missed.  These same adaptations which would make it difficult to function in a modern hyper-social society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a documentary on BBC radio a few years ago (ironically, I forget the details...) which said that elderly people in care homes showed a surprising aptitude for remembering poetry from their youth.</p>
<p>One theory is that the repetitive, rhythmic nature of poetry helped with memory. It was also pointed out that nursery rhymes are some of the earliest things that we learn, so might be quite deeply implanted in the memory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to pick up and extend on this. Don't have studies at the ready, but a couple years of cognitive psych knowledge that should be relatively accurate.</p>
<p>There's probably some difference between the various types of memories, but one of the assumptions implicit in your question is that &quot;memories&quot; are a discrete unit. That's not quite accurate. It seems that all memories (again, probably some slight differences in structure between semantic and procedural) are all constructed from component parts. It's how our brain is structured per schema or category theory; as neurons connect to one another in branching networks, the concepts and factoids that we store on them are distributed on a branched network as well. </p>
<p>This is why eyewitness testimony is so faulty, we never really <em>record</em> a memory, we record the salient points, and reconstruct the memory as needed whenever we access it. So when, as an experiment, you mug an undergrad then ask them to recall the mugging, their memory is: &quot;A Hoodie pointed a weapon and took my stuff&quot; So they describe a hood (can't remember the face) and the gun they had and their feeling of panic. Missing from the recollection is that the mugger threatened them with a banana. The memory wasn't recorded &quot;wrong&quot; just that the recipe for that memory is flawed. Remembering something is really more akin to baking a dish on the fly, you get the ingredients gathered and slap them together ASAP. In the interest of survival, our brains want to get that right, but it's really all ad-hoc reconstruction every time, and each time you access said memory, any drift that occurs seems to become part of the recipe, so there's a bit of a tall tale aspect to events you remember from long ago.</p>
<p>So, since memory is more of an act than a file stored in your brain, I'd say that memory loss in general is just losing the ability to recall a specific recipe. Any specific memory probably exists as a cluster of neurons. Like, petting your favorite pet activates the cluster of &quot;cat&quot; &quot;MY cat&quot; &quot;petting&quot; &quot;love&quot; &quot;coziness&quot; etc neurons. When you remember that one christmas with grumpycat, that memory is really chunks of data spread across that cluster of neurons, which all activate upon recollection. Over time or trauma, some of those connections may become severed or changed. Maybe you get hit on the head and grumpycat is now a doggo, activating a completely different set of neurons who will dutifully reconstruct a memory of you petting the doge at christmas. There's still a memory there, but it's no longer accurate. I'd argue that's the bulk of memory loss: the networks that accurately store memories get corrupted or fade over time. </p>
<p>The &quot;memory&quot; as a discrete computer-type file never existed, it was the act of remembering accurately, and you've lost that. So most forgetting is &quot;losing the ability to access.&quot;</p>
<p>As an example, kids don't remember much from the first 3 years of their life. It's not that they don't have memories then, it's that they don't have a sense of personal identity. Once they develop a sense of self, the self becomes the organizational principle of all subsequent memories. Kids don't lose the memories they had before, but they switch formats basically. And while they're young they can remember their toddler-hood, their brain will soon switch over completely to self-focused memories, and early memory networks from the time before that will quickly fade. The younger memory networks exist, but unless the kids access/update them regularly, they will fade and no longer be accessible as the neurons involved will be devoted to other tasks.</p>
<p>As other evidence, our understanding of the &quot;location&quot; of memory in the brain is pretty vague. Because memories are distributed across a wide network of neurons, which seem to be ad-hoc networks specific to each of us. Our memory is stored all over the place in highly individualized patterns, so scientists can't localize memory effectively. Last I checked at least.</p>
<p>So yeah, when you ask about &quot;The memories themselves&quot; you implicity mean &quot;the ability to activate the network of neurons devoted to storing the bits of this one memory&quot; so saying you've lost a memory is basically saying you can no longer access it properly anymore. So all we ever do is lose access to accurate recollection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah yes, the scientific method.</p>
<p>But seriously, that was enlightening. Thanks for your explanation. Is there a link to emotion that you're aware of? I've noticed that my strongest memories all seem to be linked to an emotional event, or to a particular emotion that I felt - or I remember feeling certain emotions at certain places and times (e.g. high school) but I don't really remember the context.</p>
<p>Basically, if an event doesn't make me feel something, my brain seems to discard it over the long term.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, particularly negative emotion. Having said that, it's not merely a function of 'has strong emotion', otherwise you'd be unlikely to remember the words and letters that are in these sentences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So your childhood memories are like having an old operating system still installed on your hard drive on a completely different network, if you start accessing those files (if the connections and networks are even still there) it all looks weird and is formatted in a completely different way, giving you a completely different perspective from a pretty much &quot;different&quot; version of you.</p>
<p>This probably has a lot to do with why nostalgia feels so interesting - Those old connections probably fire out a bit differently from what you're used to doing at the moment since you've probably changed how you think over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found this relevant to how I feel like my memory works.  I've noticed as I've slowly aged that not only have I forgotten things like random facts and names that aren't very important in life, but my brain seems like it actively forgets trivial or superfluous information right on the spot lately depending on what it is.  And then I can remember very random strings of digits or letters that I know are important or might be, like my newest debit card or what my license plate # is.  It's kind of weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even worse, your brain constantly reinterprets your memories with current experience and values. When people state that they don't know what crossed their minds when doing something as a teenager, they literally can't remember it, because their brain tries to explain the event with current thinking, which often does not match their thinking as a teenager anymore. Sometimes we &quot;forget&quot; things so our brain does not have to deal with paradoxical memories because of that. </p></div>		</li>
