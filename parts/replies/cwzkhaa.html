			<div class="markdown"><p>Here are just two major factors:<br />
1) It's much more difficult to physically get to the United States. Various government agencies and/or security apparatuses are between their country of origin and getting into the United States.<br />
2) The U.S. (and especially major cities like NYC) is much more heavily securitized and surveilled. The FBI, CIA, NYPD, NSA, etc. are infinitely more funded than their French counterparts. Those policies which Snowden revealed, the Patriot Act, etc., while clearly infringing upon civil liberties, were designed to prevent acts like these (you can oppose these pieces of legislation while recognizing this specific merit). Dozens of domestic terrorist plots have been foiled in previous decades.<br />
We should remember though that virtually no amount of legislation and militarization can ever fully prevent attacks from happening. Living in a 'free' society comes with certain risks. There is a trade-off between 'freedom' and security. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea... Here's the real factor: luck.</p>
<p>All those agencies you listed can't do anything to stop an attack like this. Nothing is going to stop a guy from using a gun on a crowd of people. We get monthly reminders of that at our schools, movie theaters, and even military bases.</p>
<p>Look at the Boston Bombers, they were on the radar, but we couldn't stop them. Can you imagine if they brought guns with them to a theater instead of that bomb? They would have slaughtered far more than just the hand full they killed.</p>
<p>Unless we are willing to strip down our liberties enough that we jail probable terrorists so that people like the Boston Bombers could be jailed without having committed any crimes, then there's nothing stopping them.</p>
<p>We are just insanely lucky so far that there's no mass terrorist attacks. We see what can happen when there's a culture of mass shootings. There's shootings every few weeks now. Imagine if coordinated terrorism became a similar contagion and we get more Boston Bomber types.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're entirely ignoring the tens (hundreds?) of thousands of highly trained intelligence and security experts whose job is to thwart such attacks.  I'm not talking about a TSA agent making sure you take your shoes off, I'm talking more about undercover FBI agents who risk their lives to stop potential attacks.</p>
<p>Yeah, we've been lucky.  There have been attempted attacks that have failed because the wannabe-terrorist was just totally inept.  </p>
<p>But there have been plenty of thwarted attacks or potential attacks.  This list has some of both (thwarted attacks and failed attacks):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fullheartedly agree.</p>
<p>We've been lucky there hadn't been a single massively successful gun&amp;bomb Islamic terrorist attack in the West up until now. </p>
<p>These are common worldwide and have occurred recently in KobanÃª, Kenya, Pakistan, and even Russia. Norway experienced one of them as well in 2011 with Anders Behring Breivik. I've always worried about the day when a group of jihadists in the West would decide to graduate from modeling themselves after high school shooters and stop using weak homemade bombs. </p>
<p>The modern Islamic terrorist isn't Four Lions anymore. The Four Lions-types get caught nowadays before they can cause any (limited) harm. The klutzes have made intelligence complacent. The smart terrorist knows how to stay hidden and under the radar. And, as this attack has proven, there are smart terrorists. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope this incredibly successful attack won't inspire further attacks. But that's only a hope. </p>
<p><strong>The November 13 shootings have made an absolute mockery of French intelligence</strong>. These terrorists have demonstrated that it isn't impossible to stage ambitious attacks - they just need to be planned correctly. These guys hit EVERY SINGLE soft target. A bar. A stadium. Several restaurants. A concert. They staged a MASSIVE hostage crisis. They set off MULTIPLE suicide bombings in close proximity to the French president. They set off suicide bombings on live international television. DURING A SPORTS GAME FEATURING THE WORLD CHAMPION FOOTBALL TEAM. </p>
<p>And what exactly can we do? We can't put policemen and soldiers in front of every public building. It's absurd. </p>
<p>We were caught with our pants down and there's nothing we could, or can, do about it. </p>
<p>My heart goes out to my French brethren, with whom I spent the majority of tonight mourning at a candlelight vigil. </p>
<p>This attack is horrifying. It's true terror. It's the most effective terror attack since 9/11. These guys didn't just hit several buildings full of bureaucrats and businessmen - they hit multiple targets, each of which we are all intimately familiar with and would have never considered to be a legitimate terror target. It's 7/7 and Madrid on steroids. It's terrifying. Which is why it's called terrorism. Everywhere is fair game. </p>
<p>This will mark an important change in how we treat terror. Hopefully it'll be for the better. But I'm pessimistic because it shows just how easy it is to carry out an attack like this, and there's not much we can do about it. This attack has risen awareness on just how inept and incapable Western security agencies are at preventing real terrorism.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously, while the world might be getting smaller and smaller, it's considerably easier to smuggle people/guns/weapons in on the ground than it is to do so on planes and ships.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honest question here: didn't the US government get in trouble recently because it was revealed that they were/are spying on France (among other countries)? I'm fairly certain that was the case, and then the question is <em>if these policies were truly imposed for this reason, why didn't it stop the attacks?</em> Surely we could have warned the French beforehand if these policies were actually effective, couldn't we? Or maybe the USG spying is limited to other governments, and not citizens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a grim thought, I know, but is there anything really stopping that from happening?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I expect to get downvoted for this, but there is absolutely something that can stop this. This is happening because of blind hatred and indoctrination, and these two things can be very effectively killed by acceptance and support.</p>
<p>I would never look a victim of 9/11, or a victim of today, in the eye and tell them &quot;love thine enemy&quot;. Everyone is very understandably distraught and furious. But we saw what happened when blind hatred was met with more hatred in 9/11. Another decade of terrorism, a decade of war to find one man, and the death of many innocents on both sides.</p>
<p>At the end of the day...happy people don't kill other people. Accepting the community responsible for this as human beings, trying to understand them even though we disagree with them, trying to provide them with the same education that we have and improve their financial situation so that they can live with the same comfort that we do, is and has proven to be the most effective cure for this kind of ignorant hatred.</p>
<p>I cannot reasonably talk to a Parisian and tell them to the turn the other cheek. So, other than this slip in judgement, I can only say as little as possible and simply cry along with France today. I just hope the vicious cycle won't continue.</p></div>		</li>
