			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on how large the transplant was. If the person had a serious disorder that required the replacement of a large amount of marrow, the percentage of donor DNA could be quite high. I'm not keen on specifics, really just the principle. Although i believe 50/50 or greater is not unheard of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there are marrow transplants, specially for heme based malagencies, donor % can reach 100%, and we routinely run into cases where we have SNPs at 45-55% which are coming from just the donor even though we're testing host DNA. If the marrow transplant is not at 100%, say only 50% donor, we can see donor SNPs at a lower % as well (20-30%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first test after transplant came back 95% donor DNA. Second test was 98%. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m pretty sure! It was a fuzzy memory period for me. </p></div>		</li>
