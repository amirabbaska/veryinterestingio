			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you could account for the capacity of the centrifuge by taking a smaller sample from the diluted blood. As long as the blood is equally mixed throughout the water, then a sample taken of the whole solution should have the same concentration of DNA as the whole, right?</p>
<p>I think the only limiting factor here is the detection limit of the equipment used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA is a physical object so it doesn't dilute like that. It can break apart and may be detectable in an amount though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point.  </p>
<p>A drop of blood is ~5uL.  If you just want to do SNP analysis, I think you only need 100 nL.  There's a 50 fold dilution right there.  However if you want to do next generation sequencing the protocols call for 10 uL of plasma, so you're already at ~1/4 of the suggested amount before starting.</p></div>		</li>
