			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly recommend not doing this with water from the pool, or from any other place that has potentially contaminated (non-drinkable) water.  This can lead to ear infection.  Easier just to put the ball of your thumb against your ear to create a seal, tip your head to the side, and then quickly release your hand.  That change in canal pressure is usually enough to break the surface tension of the water, and you're not inserting anything in your ear (which can cause all sorts of problems).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well wait a sec. . . </p>
<p>If I have pool water deep in my ear, what's worse... leaving that water in there and deciding whether or not I'll take care of it (let's be realistic, if ppl had to get out to take care of it, they wouldn't get out), or using the pool water to take care of it right now?</p>
<p>I get that it'd be optimal not to use the pool water, but wouldn't it be better on a practical level to get it out now instead of waiting till you get out for the day?</p>
<p>(Also, if it were beach seawater, i'd be getting out to take care of it right now.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a false dichotomy.  I've already suggested two non-invasive ways of clearing the water right where you are.  So you don't have to go for the lesser of two evils; just choose an alternative and safe method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, because having already dunked your head under water in said pool for potentially hours is plenty fine and no problem, but heaven forbid you &quot;manually introduce&quot; said water to your ear canal or your head will fall off.. such horse shit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I've already been in the pool for 8 hours. Is that the threshold for infection? 8 hours of submersion is fine, but a table spoon is too much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah same; I don't see how stuffing more water in will help.
A couple violent head tilts and it should be fine :)</p>
<p>Although they do have a point that the surface tension keeps it in most likely.</p></div>		</li>
