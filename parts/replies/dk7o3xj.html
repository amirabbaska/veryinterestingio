			<div class="markdown"><p>I really liked one of the reasons Richard Dawkins gave in his book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>. A mother always knows that her offspring has 50% of her genes --- with a few exceptions like in the case of the cuckoo. So the mother and especially her genes have an interest in the survival of the children, so that the genes have a higher chance of survival and a higher chance to be passed down to new individuals. </p>
<p>The father on the other hand does not have this guarantee. So it is in his interest to invest as little as possible into the children and mate as often as possible, to increase the chance of survival of his genes. If for example most of the males of a species would invest heavily into into their children, without knowing if they are actually theirs, another individual could exploit this behavior. The other individual invests nearly nothing and let the other males care for his offspring. Obviously something like this isn't stable, especially if the caring fathers have little or no offspring at all. The genes of the caring fathers would be removed from the gene pool over time and the genes of the non caring fathers would also become less frequent. A mostly caring father on the other hand, that invests just enough into his children that there is a good chance for them to survive, has a good chance that his genes will stay in the gene pool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called the &quot;paternity certainty&quot; modifier. We can see this in humans, actually. </p>
<p>Maternal grandmothers are the best grandparents for helping out with her daughter's baby! The maternal grandfather has one layer of paternity uncertainty because his wife may have cheated on him. The paternal grandmother has one layer of uncertainty because her daughter in law may have cheated. The paternal grandfather has two layers because his wife and daughter in law may have cheated. We actually know from large-scale data now that the presence of a maternal grandmother has a greater impact on the survival of grandchildren than the presence the direct fathers has. Evolutionarily speaking, this data definitely supports the hypothesis that the evolution of menopause was advantageous because grandmothers are amazing alloparents (allowing humans to be born earlier and grow larger brains and produce more children) compared to more outdated ideas that men are the big providers of the family. Statistically, they don't have much of an effect on youths (though their presence may be important for older children, this is unconfirmed and in terms of evolution most child deaths occur before the age of 5 anyways). </p>
<p>Paternity certainty definitely affects animal dynamics; species that are more sexually dimorphic tend to have greater &quot;reproductive skew&quot; (males have more/fewer offspring than females) and thus you'd expect that in species where the males/females look more different there should be less attentive fathers. Compare that to penguins, who are very monogamous and look very monomorphic and where fathers invest heavily in their offspring. </p>
<p>On the OTHER hand, both male and female gibbons cheat like crazy even though they form life-bonds and fathers help raise children (and they're extremely monomorphic for primates). I guess the logic is that even if the fathers are investing in the infants of other males, another male may be taking care of theirs (I can't see any other way it would work). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the gibbon is extremely monomorphic would the gene pool of gibbons have a lot less variance?</p>
<p>Maybe the father gibbons don't care whose offspring they raise because they are all carrying very similar genes anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for that menopause theory?  The grandmother would still be losing out by sacrificing her ability to produce her own offspring, which would be more related to her.  It was my understanding that menopause is explained by the costliness of a reproductive machinery designed to last a full lifetime.  Menopause occurs approximately at the age at which the average number of years remaining before death is just less than the number of years required to raise offspring to independence.  So the reproductive machinery isn't needed beyond that age, and if it was &quot;designed&quot; to last that long then it would come at the cost of other design constraints on the body/physiology.  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v392/n6678/full/392807a0.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC Darwin never called it &quot;evolution&quot; or &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, he called it &quot;descent with modification&quot;.</p>
<p>Both &quot;natural selection&quot; and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; are terrible monikers because &quot;natural selection&quot; makes it sound like some outer force is doing the selecting, and &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; clashes with the buff bulky action heroes that come to mind when people say &quot;fit&quot;.</p>
<p>The best description is probably something along the lines of &quot;Who Lives, Wins&quot;. But even that can cause confusion because evolution isn't impacted at all by an organism's life after it's reproduced (except if it lives long enough to reproduce again)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking personally, something I've always had a bit of trouble grasping is how certain evolutionary traits are even initiated. For example, that waxy spot that some ducks have above their tails that they use to groom and waterproof themselves. It's easy to point out the advantages of this now that we can observe them, but how does something so odd and specific like that even begin to evolve? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random genetic mutation. A trait can pop up and if it's advantageous (or it just doesn't kill them) the animal might pass down the mutation. For instance, short-nosed dogs have a random mutation from normal dogs. Over many generations, humans have bred that mutation to extremes like the pug. It's the same idea with natural selection, but it takes much longer and is a lot less cleancut. </p></div>		</li>
