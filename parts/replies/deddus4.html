			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct for Classical Latin but not in other contexts.</p>
<p>Academic English-speakers of Latin in the Middle Ages adopted French pronunciation and Catholicism favored the Italian pronunciation, which had drifted itself. Both of those systems featured the fricative V sound we associate the letter with today. </p>
<p>In the 20th C, the Classical Association decided to reconstruct the original Roman pronunciation and it was generally adopted decades later by educators.</p>
<p>Because of that, systems using those early pronunciations (botany, law) retain the French pronunciation. So in court, you say ah-mike-us kur-ee-ee (amicus curiae) and the tree violet is vee-oh-la ar-bor-es-sens (viola arborescens), but if you were orating from Cicero a friend of the court is certainly ah-me-cus cure-ee-eye and Castor would have called a violet wee-oh-la.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment should be higher. Many good points have already been made on this ELI5, but will add that &quot;church Latin&quot; and &quot;classical Latin&quot; vary in a number of pronunciations. So for instance, &quot;veni vidi vici&quot; could be prounounced &quot;wehni widi wiki&quot; or &quot;vehni vidi vichi&quot;. </p>
<p>The big thing here is that u and v were previously more interchangeable, especially in pre-romance languages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case I've been pronouncing 'v' wrong. My Latin book distinguishes between 'u' and 'v', as in 'secundus' and 'valere'. Should I be pronouncing them both the same way? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like the second word would be 'wah-lair-ay'. From what I understand now it is clearer to begin words with the symbol 'v' instead of 'u', but they would've been the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you said it and saved me the time. This is the more correct response than the guy talking about german printing, although it is good information, this latin having v to represent v u and w is the correct answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the past Y and I were interchangable.   A family friend collects ancient letters (mail).   In these, spelling was not yet standardized and y an i were interchanable. A person might spell the same word one way at the beginning of a sentence and another in the middle. It was the wild west of writting. </p>
<p>Personally,  i think y was used for specific inflection or pronounciation. This is uneducated speculation at best. </p></div>		</li>
