			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer! A further question that your answer raises: what tests are effective at detecting adenocarcinoma if conventional pap smears don't do the job well? And are these something that I should ask for, or would a doctor normally bring it up while doing a conventional pap smear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really aren’t any good non-invasive screening tests for cervical adenocarcinoma.  The cervix is a transition area where you go from the glandular cells of the uterus to the squamous cells of the vagina.  When we do Pap tests, we sample the transition zone (where most cervical cancers occur) and then take brushings of upper cervix (which may scrape off some glandular cells).  Aside from doing your pap on the doctor’s schedule, getting the HPV vaccination, and keeping a healthy lifestyle, you’re doing everything you need to be doing.</p>
<p>HPV causes 70-80% of all cervical cancers.  So if you’re fully vaccinatinated, you already have a very low chance of getting cervical cancer.  A large percentage of the rest occur in post-menopausal women who get cervical/uterine cancers just because of age.  But assuming you’re not a post-menopausal woman who’s recently started bleeding again, then I doubt you have much to worry about in that regard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is because hpv specifically causes another type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.  That is what we are seeing a huge improvement as far as early detection and prevention.   I expect it to improve even more with the introduction of the hpv  vaccine.  </p>
<p>Adenocarcinoma is caused by other things, but screening cam result in am incidental finding which may result in earlier treatment as well.  When dealing with cancer, typically the earlier you can start treatment the better the outcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A side point with the questions on population level Healthcare with screening suggestions and incidence rates. </p>
<p>These percentages and incidences don't mean much for the individual, because it's binary on a person to person basis. Saying &quot;disease X can be found with this test and treated successfully 99.9% of the time&quot; sounds good. But if you're a person with disease X who isn't responding to treatment, Disease X has a 0% treatment success, and if you don't have disease X, you personally have a 100% rate. </p>
<p>That being said, still keep up with the screenings so if you get disease X, you know early and can get treated.</p>
<p>Screenings like a pap don't actually prevent diseases. </p>
<p>That's why HPV and other vaccines are important. They work on an individual level as well as a population level. They will prevent you from getting disease X and stop you from passing it on to another person.</p>
<p>Just a soap box moment. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Ooh, Cervical screening is largely looking for pre-cancerous lesions - CIN, rather than cancers (though it finds those too). Treating these absolutely does prevent disease - namely invasive cancer. Bowel cancer screening would be similar by looking to prevent full-bore cancer by treating the precursor polyps. I do take you point about shifting stage distributions though, that's a pretty key goal of screening also.</p>
<p>HPV vaccination is important not only because it helps to stop the spread of a virus but also because screening is not perfect. A negative screen does not mean you are disease free.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ASCUS- Atypical Scquamous Cells of Undetermined Significance.  These are abnormal cells from the cervix but we don’t know if it’s cancer or just some temporary change (Infections like HPV can cause cells to mutate and then the body will kill them and you don’t need to take a biopsy).  We need to do more testing.</p>
<p>ASCH- Atypical Squamous Cells cannot rule out high-grade epithelial lesion.  These cells are like ASCUS but they’re more concerning for cancer.  You’ll probably need colposcopy to take samples of the cervix.</p>
<p>LSIL- Low-grade Squamous Intraepitheial Lesion.  Mildly abnormal cells from pap.  Usually caused by HPV.  We’ll do more testing and repeat the pap in a year, but your body will probably be able to clear these cells on it’s own.</p>
<p>HSIL- High-grade Squamous Intraepitheial Lesion.  Moderately to severely changed cells from pap.  More severe than LSIL, but not quite cancer.  These WILL need to be removed.</p></div>		</li>
