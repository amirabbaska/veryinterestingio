			<div class="markdown"><p>I can finally use my Physics degree! Short answer is pressure-differential. You can demonstrate the same effect when you crack open a car window while traveling. People who smoke will see the smoke getting sucked out the crack in the window. There are some interesting buffeting / cavitation effects as well, ie. the harmonized, and sometimes painful, effects on your eardrums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of pouring liquid out of a water bottle too fast, it will &quot;burp&quot; as too much negative pressure will occur in the bottle, attempting to hold some of the liquid back, but as it's a liquid it &quot;falls apart&quot; and air is able to re-enter, equalizing the pressure, allowing the water to freely come out again.</p>
<p>Same happens with the car, the pressure inside is different, and as it's escaping it's creating quick pressure changes which we pick up as audible noises.</p>
<p>edit: side note, it's quicker to empty a water bottle by making sure it does <strong>not</strong> burp when pouring the water out, or by creating a small cyclone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cavitation is caused by high velocity, generally turbulent, liquid flow. It's often caused in pumps or valves, where the geometry of the piping or moving parts causes a huge pressure differential, by which liquid spontaneously forms vapor bubbles at low temperature. These bubbles can violently collapse and damage mechanical components. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should say cavitation in this case is like a fan blade moving air. Cavitation in liquids is a bit different. But in the case of the car, and a fan blade, the change in pressure creates a harmonic. I would gander that the frequency is proportional to the velocity of the car / fan blades, but the amplitude may just be greater (more noticeable). The cavity would be the lowest pressure point. The buffeting is the whole wave process that causes the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. </p></div>		</li>
