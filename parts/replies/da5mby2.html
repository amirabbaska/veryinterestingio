			<div class="markdown"><p>I was promoted to VP of all Google Engineering in around 2005, and keep that position until a reorganization in 2012, when I was given the position of VP of Knowledge.    Larry Page came up with the title, since he thought Google should not just depend on web sites to answer queries, but we should build a database that understood the relationship between all the entities on the web.   For most of the time before I retired in 2015, Knowledge including Search, Maps, and Research.  The inside joke was that if I did really well at the VP of Knowledge role, they'd promote me to VP of Wisdom :-) AE</p></div>		</li>

<p>High levels of education, knowing the right people, working excruciatingly hard, and getting in at the right time (I believe he started with Google when they were a young company). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>School experience?!? Heh, how cute...</p>
<p>No billion dollar company is going to put you that close to the top just because of your <em>grades</em>. You only get there by repeatedly impressing the right people on the job and climbing the ladder step by step (or, even better, by getting there in a company that's still very small and then growing with it). They'll only care about what you can do right now for the company, not what some professor thought you were doing many years ago.</p>
<p>School experience is rarely ever gonna matter again in your life once you're past entry-level jobs.</p></div>		</li>
