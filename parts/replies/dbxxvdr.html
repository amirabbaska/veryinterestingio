			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good in theory, but neglects an important aspect of a modern HVAC system: the &quot;auxiliary heater.&quot;</p>
<p>Using the compressor to heat a home is quite energy efficient, but if the compressor can't keep up, the electric heater in the air handler kicks on. It uses WAAAY more electricity than the compressor. The thermostat turns on this auxiliary heater whenever the temperature difference between the ambient and target temperature is more than X degrees (a setting in the thermostat)... usually 3 degrees or so.</p>
<p>so, if you are turning your desired temp down way low, say 60, and then turn it way up to 72, your system will use a significant amount of extra energy to get back to 72. Sure, turning down for vacations and such is wise, but as a daily measure, you're probably better off just dropping a few degrees while you are out.</p>
<p>Also, it is wise to only turn your thermostat up a couple degrees at a time and let it catch up before bumping up more for this reason. It keeps it in the zone where the thermostat will keep the AUX heater off.</p>
<p>Whenever you see &quot;AUX&quot; or &quot;EMERGENCY&quot; light up on your thermostat, you are using a huge amount of electricity, like 5 times more than heating with the compressor alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the OP mentioned an old house with a &quot;furnace&quot;, I don't think modern heat-pump-based systems are in use.</p>
<p>But yes, I decided to not mention heating efficiency in my original reply. If you use a heating system that works differently depending on the workload, then there may be a point where leaving the thermostat at some not-too-low value could be beneficial.</p>
<p>For basic electrical (resistance) or fossil fuel powered heating this won't be the case though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, I forget furnaces are still a thing in colder climates. I live south enough where basically everything is heat-pumps, traditional furnaces are quire rare, but north enough to where the system struggles on extremely cold nights and the AUX pops on...</p>
<p>...so basically disregard everything I said if you are a northerner with a traditional furnace. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Furnace&quot; may not be the correct term for what we had.  It was in the basement, it was electric, fairly massive, and blew hot air through the vents.  The house was built in 1910 and so probably originally accommodated a furnace, but I can't say for sure if that term was appropriate.  I don't live there anymore so I can't check.</p>
<p>In any case, thanks for the detailed response!  In my current house, we have underfloor heating, which is lovely and tends to heat rather steadily, so your original answer probably applies.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in warmer climates. Here in Canada pretty much every house has a 60000+ BTU output natural gas fired furnace.  Electric would be way too expensive and a heat pump would work quite poorly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for Denver. This is my first time owning a natural gas furnace, and it's much cheaper to operate due to the comparatively low cost of natural gas. I had a heat pump in northern Florida. It sucked in the winter when the outside temperature got below 50 degrees. I also have an AC compressor that really only gets used for a couple months in summer, since mornings and evenings are generally cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are cold climate heat pumps available these days that work fine down to -25 C.  There are also other heat pumps that don't.  So it's hard to generalize about heat pumps anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do occasionally, usually when I have windows open, the system is off otherwise, and I'm just trying to get fresh air circulating... but other than slightly more even distribution of heating/cooling, is there any real advantage? Some would say &quot;cleaner air&quot; but that's mostly garbage, and very high MERV filters put undue strain on your blower anyway... I buy the cheap spun fiberglass ones.</p>
<p>The filter is there to protect your air handler from large particles, not clean your air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the only benefits are what you listed: circulation and temperature balance. In the summer, for example, the fan can mix the cold basement air with the warmer air in the upper floors to reduce the need for A/C use.</p>
<p>My thermostat has a circulation mode where the blower comes on randomly if it is off for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The cleaner air because it is filtered is BS as you mention.</p></div>		</li>
