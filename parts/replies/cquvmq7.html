			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, we don't get crushed to death. We get suffocated to death since there will be enormous pressure on your stomach. There are fishes down at the bottom of the sea to prove it. They adapted by using lipid instead of regular fat and have minimal to zero air bubble to reduce the effect of the pressure. Pressurized suit are for making sure nitrogen doesn't kill you. I forgot exactly how but nitrogen bubble forms under pressure. In fact, if you take any pills that prevent bubbling effect, you can theoretically go to any depth, providing that you can still breath through enormous pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I recall from my classes in scuba diving instruction, nitrogen will come out of solution in the blood, and you have come ascend gradually, according to a schedule, in order to avoid this.  Scuba tank air is compressed, under pressure.  I don't know anything about pills.
I've been to a depth of 100 feet underwater, and the pressure is pretty great, enough to make breathing labored and make you suck down a tank faster.  Deep dives to 100 feet are short dives, otherwise you spend a <em>long</em> time decompressing underwater.  At less than 30 feet, no decompression is required, and as long as you don't hold your breath, you can come right to the surface.  This is from memory, so if I've made any errors, feel free to correct them.</p></div>		</li>
