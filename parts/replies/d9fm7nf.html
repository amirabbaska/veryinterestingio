			<div class="markdown"><p>Or from just sitting exposed to air in the top of their packaging. Remember that most syrup, unless specificly maple syrup, is mostly just flavored corn syrup. Give it a shake and it would go away until it sits for a while again. If you vaccum sealed it, I doubt you would get that film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might achieve the same thing by laying saran wrap over water.  It is not relative to the temperature.  Just the fluid shifting underneath a semi- hardened skin.</p>
<p>It definitely also happens with fresh elmers glue droplets that are still drying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only places I can think I heard of viscosity from was motor oil commercials.</p>
<p>You?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My old chemistry teacher taught me to think of it in terms of lava. Lava with high viscosity stays high up on the volcano for longer (because it's slow), whilst low viscosity lava quickly reaches the lowlands (because it flows quickly).</p></div>		</li>
