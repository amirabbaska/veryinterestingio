			<div class="markdown"><p>It means can two neutrinos influence each other if they get close enough together.</p>
<p>As a chemist, you primarily deal with particles interacting via the electromagnetic force. Neutrinos aren't affected by the electromagnetic force (they're neutral, hence NEUTRinos). So that's one big interaction method off the list.</p>
<p>There are some other fundamental forces out there though, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity.  Neutrinos don't interact via the strong force either. Neutrinos are ridiculously tiny, so their gravity isn't likely to influence much of anything.</p>
<p>That leaves the weak force. The weak force operates over a ridiculously short range. This means that the effective 'cross section' for interaction of a neutrino is incredibly tiny. A neutrino would have to pass insanely close to another subatomic particle to &quot;bump into&quot; it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't any amount of gravity have some effect, regardless of how small?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they were stationary and there were nothing else in the universe, sure, you'd eventually be able to see gravitational attraction. It does <em>exist</em>. The effect in real life is so small as to be completely meaningless, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered this myself. Is it quantized so that it doesn't actually have any effect or is there really some extremely small effect, regardless of whether we'd be able to measure it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, yes there would be some sort of effect, but in reality it's so incredibly tiny that the gravitational effects of any individual neutrino is extremely unlikely to be detectable or have any measurable influence.</p>
<p>Not only is the mass (and hence, the gravitational force) of a neutrino ridiculously small, but because neutrinos are so light they tend to be moving at extremely high speeds. So their basically immeasurable amount of gravity likely only has an extremely brief window of time to interact any particular other particle before the neutrino is way too far away to have any influence anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not massless. For a while it was thought that they probably were, but it's now believed they have a mass. A very tiny mass, but there is some there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is usually stated that neutrinos interact very weakly/rarely with ordinary matter. So, for example, there is a huge number of neutrinos streaming from the core of the sun at this very moment (the flux is something like 60 billion neutrinos per second, per cm^2 ). </p>
<p>Interactions are a little tautological, but they are just events where the particles interact with each other in someway (charge exchange, etc.). Feynman diagrams are a useful pictorial representation of these, if you have seen these before. There is a lot of mathematics behind those images, but at a face level it is not too important.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the lack of interactions is just a property of neutrinos, but it is calculated through the cross-section of the neutrino-[insert particle] interactions, and is given as an area. While not truly representative, it can be visualised like the 'size of the target' for these interactions to happen (like an arrow and a target), so the larger the value the more likely an interaction is to occur.</p>
<p>The logic of the question was that if the neutrino interacts very rarely with things like the Earth, what about with itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a convenient way for the layperson to think about it is &quot;nutrinos are really really really really really small, so even with billions of them per square cm, it's not likely any will hit anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a convenient way to visualise them. Like the neutrino is a grain of sand, and the normal matter it passes through is like a huge-holed net. </p>
<p>But it is important to hold in mind that the visualisation is not directly correlated to reality.</p>
<p>For example, in my work we collide antiprotons with positronium, and to increase the chances of interacting we excite the positronium to a higher energy level, which has a significant increase to the cross-section of the interaction, even though the sizes haven't changed with anywhere near the same scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Particles interact when they influence each other, exchange energy and momentum, undergo a collision, or change into different particles altogether. Any interaction is mediated by a force carrier. For electromagnetic interactions, the force carrier is the photon for example. The probability of a certain kind of interaction is determined by its cross-section.</p></div>		</li>
