<p>How? Do we even know beyond &quot;it just does&quot;? Lets break down this &quot;instant&quot; a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy is convertible to matter and particles. The photons didn't exist before, they are just a manifestation of the energy that was lost by the electron.</p>
<p>A different analogy to express it (sorry for potential confusion):</p>
<p>Think about the electromagnetic field as a tight, suspended rubber sheet. The electron is a ball rolling around on the sheet.</p>
<p>When the electron loses or gains energy, it abruptly changes its speed on the sheet. This makes the rubber sheet jiggle.</p>
<p>The photon is that jiggle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I was going to mention E=Mc^2 but since photons are technically massless I wasn't sure how that worked out.</p>
<p>But Einsteins most famous equation is partially applicable here. </p>
<p>Energy and mass can be converted from one to another. Most non science people don't realize this, but it's true. Mass contains an IMMENSE amount of energy (hence why nuclear fission reactors are so sought after.) The equation above explains the converson factor between mass and energy. Energy = Mass * (speed of light) squared</p>
<p>In this case, it's actually easier to think of a photon as an electromagnetic wave (which it is, in some instances.) Instead of making a sound wave, the light emitted a &quot;light&quot; wave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more in depth than ELI5, but the answer lies in the laws of electromagnetism. Electrons are charged particles, and as such, follow Maxwell’s equations. One of Maxwell’s equations says that an accelerating charge creates electromagnetic waves, light. Since light can be viewed as either a wave or a particle, we know that photons are created as soon as the electron moves because the waves are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: isn't the universe going towards a more chaotic (entropic) state? I remember this from the Brief history of time book. That it was in harmony before the big bang and now it becomes more and more chaotic? Or did I get that wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other way around. The universe started with all its energy contained in a very small space, which is very chaotic. The 2nd law of thermodynamics predicts that the universe will eventually become very ‘harmonious’ (as you put it) with all energy equally spread out everywhere.</p>
<p>One small problem with this is that it means nothing can ever happen again after that point, so it’s not all that great really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In this direction, the second law of thermodynamics, as famously enunciated by Rudolf Clausius in 1865, states that:</p>
<p>“The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.&quot;</p>
<p>This is from wiki. Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even spacing and harmony are not the same thing. A material can be evenly spaced and highly ordered (the early Universe before gravity made stars and galaxies form) but it can also be evenly spaced and very disordered (after the heat death of the universe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, entropy does tend toward a maximum.</p>
<p>BUT: You REALLY really need to consider your system when making these claims.</p>
<p>Sure, in our tiny little system of an atom it seems to have decreased entropy, but in the grand scheme of things, it likely got higher if you expand your system to include everything around that atom. (Because the photon could interact with something and heat it, therefore increasing entropy.)</p>
<p>Likely, whenever you see something that seems to have &quot;decreased entropy&quot;, take a step back and see how that decrease affected the area around your system.</p>
<p>None of this changes the fact that atoms will ALWAYS &quot;want&quot; to be in their ground state. (If you don't mind the personification of an atom.) I'd argue that we went more chaotic anyway, we started with two atoms vibrating a bit and ended with 2 atoms vibrating a bit less and a particle. Seems more complicated to me.</p></div>		</li>
