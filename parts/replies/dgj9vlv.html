			<div class="markdown"><p>You should speak to a doctor if you experience these symptoms after exercise and are worried about your health.</p>
<p>There are lots of possibilities, e.g running out of glycogen might explain the light-headedness. Light sensitivity could be a migraine - but these guesses on the internet from non doctors shouldn't carry any weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The muscle weakness can be attributed somewhat to lactic acid.  Light headedness can come about when you stop exercising because blood is rushing to re oxygenate muscles and away from your brain as blood pressure fluctuates.  No clue on the light sensitivity, never had that one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would posit a guess that it's related to hydration or a lack of calories available to match the exertion or possibly a predisposition to migraines (including ocular migraines which can manifest themself without other physical symptoms).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would posit this is blood-sugar related. Either 'bonking' from running out of glucose (needed to fuel the brain -leading to light-headedness), or (as was my experience) an overactive insulin response when consuming high-glycemic foods (anything with white flour as primary ingredient was my trigger)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was weightlifting regularly and eating a shitload of sweets and carbs this happened to me too. I'm not diabetic or anything but my blood sugar started to drop when I worked out hard and caused me to pass out a few times. I started bringing a little candy bar or sugary sports drink and it stopped. Fixing my diet made it stop happening altogether though. </p></div>		</li>
