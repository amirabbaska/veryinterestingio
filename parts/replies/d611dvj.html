			<p>Bull sharks can shift their cells to acclimate to living in fresh water, as do salmon when they leave the ocean to lay their eggs in rivers, and some other types of fish. Great Whites, to my knowledge, do not have this ability. If you hear about a shark attack in fresh water rivers or bays, it's a bull.</p>		</li>
