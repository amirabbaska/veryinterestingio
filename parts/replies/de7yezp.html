<p>Chaos theory really has nothing to do with determinism. Basically it's just saying things may be predetermined, but there's a shitton of variables and we can't observe well enough to account for them all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, it doesn't reject determinism; instead it shows that we can't think of science in a fully deterministic fashion due to things like the uncertainty principle or how physics work in a singularity and general chaos. It doesn't mean determinism isn't real, it just means we'll never know and won't really be able to ever implement a way of determining (intended) if it is correct or not</p></div>		</li>
