			<div class="markdown"><p>None of this is accurate. Flash bangs are specifically designed to not to &quot;burst ear drums&quot;.</p>
<p>They work by sensory overload. If you are not expecting them, they interrup your thinking.  If you know they are coming they are completely ineffective past the initial flinch.</p>
<p>Been on both ends and have been exposed to hundreds of noise flash distractionary devices (their fancy name for court purposes). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps if your hearing is really far gone, you have sturdy ear protection, are not in an enclosed space and are faced away from it with your eyes closed. They're pretty effective even when you expect them, particularly because most TTP does not involve a single flashbang, but multiple, just to keep a combatant disoriented and guessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the device. The one I experienced was all bang, very little/no flash. It was marked as a distraction device I believe. </p></div>		</li>
