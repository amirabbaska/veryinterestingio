			<div class="markdown"><p>This is accurate, but it should be noted that electrical components (diodes, capacitors, inductors, etc.) behave in dramatically different fashions when a constant DC voltage is applied. A constant voltage can charge a capacitor or &quot;switch on&quot; a transistor, thus allowing digital logic. Alternating currents cause capacitors and inductors to act as filters, which shape waveform, allowing radio communication. So, to answer your question, AC is not better than DC. AC and DC are just different tools for different jobs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. AC was chosen as our power transmission system 100 years ago simply because it was cheaper to implement and use. The semiconductors that is making HVDC practical and competitive were not developed yet. Now that semiconductors have made HVDC possible, the biggest problem that HVDC faces is asset inertia. No one wants to spend trillions updating the infrastructure when DC is arguably only marginally better than AC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With tyristors.being cheaper to manufacture it is now better to transmitt HVDC than ac.  Less line losses smaller towers for powerlines and relative ease to tie into other grids.   Siemens energy has been building a lot of HVDC transmission projects in europe and north america.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>should maybe also add that the reason why low current means smaller wires is that heat generation is mostly a factor of resistance and current.</p>
<p>Power flowing through a conductor will generate heat through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating" target="_blank">Joule heating</a>. Generally you want to keep the heating at such a level that it just naturally dissipates into the surrounding environment without significantly increasing the temperature of the conductor.</p>
<p>As conductor resistance rises with temperature, this can create a positive feedback loop (temperature rises =&gt; resistance rises =&gt; more heat is generated for the same current =&gt; temperature rises even more) in the conductor which ends in the conductor melting if not kept under control.</p>
<p>To combat this, you either lower the resistance of the conductor by using a thicker conductor, or lower the current by stepping up the voltage.</p>
<p>This is why power lines use such high voltage, as they have practical limits to how thick/heavy the conductors can be. This is also why high power electronics can be difficult to make, since PCB lanes are very thin and thus have high resistance and heat generation when you must send a lot of current through it.</p>
<p>Just do the calculation. Your 240 Watt GPU is fed mainly by a 12 volt rail. This means 20 amps at 12V! (the power fuse for your in-house power for a room is probably only 16 amps, but at 220V AC) This is the whole reason why there are so many wires in parralel going to your GPU for power: to keep the current in each wire low enough. Same goes for your CPU. Part of the reasons why CPUs have so many pins nowadays is to be able to provide enough current through parralel lines in the PCB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course the current flowing thru a given piece of copper, the hotter it will get due to the intrinsic resistance of copper, even if its quite small it adds up over large distances.   So one of the biggest factors in actually sizing a wire, is how hot it will get.   For instance if you used a 5/0 wire for a power line at some current, it might get 20 degrees hotter, which is nothing, but if you used a 1/0, which is smaller, it might raise 100 degrees, which might be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This guy is correct insomuch as he's correct about the principles involved and some benefits. He's not correct in that AC it better. It depends. It depends on the application. For transmission, sure, AC is better. For anything with a computer for example, DC makes much more sense.</p>

<p>It depends. If you want to use mechanical devices, sure. Use semiconductors (e.g., solar panels, peltier devices) or batteries and you're looking at DC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inside all computers is an AC to DC transformer, as all of the innards run on DC. That conversion can be costly in terms of efficiency and heat loss, especially in a facility where you have a large numbers of servers and such. As a result, it is common in large data centers to convert to DC at the facility level, then just feed DC to all the equipment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The principles and concepts behind AC generation are easier to grasp to me, and AC being &quot;better&quot; is a relative term, most people aren't going to care about how electricity is used on network of IC chips. You are, of course, technically correct, the BEST kind of correct, but for the laymen the guy I replied to is the info they want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC is not always better for transmission. As you said, it depends on the application. Long point-to-point distances or between two systems makes HVDC a good choice. The decision between HVDC and HV AC is basically a cost vs distance graph with two mx + b lines with the AC line having a smaller y-intercept and steeper slope while the DC line has a higher y-intercept but a shallow slope. At a certain distance, the capex costs are equal. HVDC costs a lot to install converter stations but much lower wire costs. Also, HVDC systems need special control procedures. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To change DC voltage, you need a dc/dc converter. They use a combination of &quot;switches&quot; (transistors), capacitors and inductors. A simple way to think of it would be charging up the capacitor from a source and dumping it through a load. Yea i know theres a lot more involved, but this is ELI5 right?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There are a few ways, one of the cheap and easy ways is, depending on which way your trying to go, a buck converter (steps down), boost converter (steps up), or buck-boost converter (goes both ways)</p>
<p>in simplest forms, if you take a 100VDC source, and switch it off and on really fast, at lets say 50hertz, and its off and on for the same amount of time,  youd have 50VDC.</p>
<p>most power is generated DC then converted to AC, basically you take a magnet shaped like a disc, and run a wire thru the middle of it.  rotate the disc by your preferred method, and you have DC current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it might change in the future. Solar power works with DC currents.  A lot of costly electronics are needed to generate a good and usable AC from it.    The panels also work decentral, reducing the need for distributed power.</p></div>		</li>
