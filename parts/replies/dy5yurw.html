			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I'm speaking more on the personality changes that, as far as I'm aware, can occur with some types of tumors. </p>
<p>I've read throughout a few different abstracts that one of the aspects of personality change that a tumor could potentially cause is a state of depression.</p>
<p>My question was more focused towards whether an individual who already suffers from a mood disorder, specifically depression, could come to develop a tumor (benign or malignant) that results in the aforementioned personality change, but rather than depression being symptomatically present, the growth results in a baseline, for the lack of a better word, mood or even mania.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly theoretically possible, but would be very rare. Moreso, it would be very difficult to measure if any effect was from the tumor or any other multitude of factors that go into having a brain tumor. There are no good objective measures that would be able to tease this out aside from possibly the DTI imaging that I cited before. </p></div>		</li>
