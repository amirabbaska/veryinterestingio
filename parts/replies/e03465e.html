			<div class="markdown"><p>I take antihistamines all year round, because I must be allergic to different things.. but the last 3 days they've not done a damn thing (and I've been taking two different types a day - not recommended apparently, but one on its own just doesn't suffice). </p>
<p>There must have been some kind of pollen explosion, and my body is just going 'nope, nope, nope, nope'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was listening to a retired Dr a while back and he said when he qualified over 50 years ago it was very uncommon to meet a patient having problems with allergens but before retired the majority of his patients had an allergy to something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Give this a view. I've experimented over the years and learned that avoiding certain foods during peak allergy seasons emphasizing others mitigates the severity. The last two years I've avoided my usual sinus infections so experiment some maybe you'll find something that helps your hay fever. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I had a couple of days last month where I felt I got virtually no sleep due to nocturnal sneezing. That was the worst of it, but I still frequently have to sleep with a tissue &quot;tampon&quot; up my nostrils to stop snot running onto my pillow as I sleep.</p></div>		</li>
