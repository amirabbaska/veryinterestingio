<p>Pizza's characteristics mean it's quite hard to make well at home (mainly, you need time to develop the dough, and a hotter oven than most homes have).</p>

<p>Thank you, the amount of answers here deriding Pizza as low quality simple junk food is bizarre.</p>
<p>Its <em>hard</em> to make well, maybe it's a simple meal, but it takes a lot of time, most of which is preparation, which is perfect for restaurants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that being baked flat, until recently it would require a larger than average oven, correctly he, to bake correctly. Larger fan assisted ovens have helped home baking, but a wood-fired pizza oven was your best bet for evenly cooking something so flat and wide at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add it's not generally a one person meal so the average ticket is going to be higher and more easily justify delivery costs. If McDonald's delivered you could have one person order a sandwich and fries for themselves easily. Pizza is much less likely to be a one person meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's easily solved with a minimum order sum for delivery, which is exactly what many places have where I am. And I indeed can order burgers and fries, just not one serving of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Obviously we are obsessed with having pizza delivered because of our obsession with the mythology of the Pie /s</p></div>		</li>
