			<div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is wired to save you calories physiologically, i.e. telling your cells to breakdown less glycogen, store more fat (under normal circumstances). Laziness is more of a result of poor executive function, which is more of a frontal-lobe 'issue'. I think we're mostly just lazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm not assuming you're a doctor but I would like to ask a question. I had several concussions through high school and semi-pro football. I definitely have had a change in the way I used to think and come to conclusions from actually working a process out in my head to get an answer to what I like to call flashcard memory as the answer I'm looking for pretty much does that now, just flashes without much critical thought. </p>
<p>To do with lazyness, obviously I wasn't lazy at the time but now a couple years out from that and I stuggle to push myself to do meanial tasks. I push myself to do it but I definitely notice a huge pushback by my body to do everything I should. </p>
<p>Definitely from brain damage, yes? Or is that me getting older and my body trying to slow down?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can retrain your brain to get back in shape. Our minds have an extraordinarily powerful ability to change themselves based on the process of neuroplasticity. </p>
<p>Keep pushing past that point whenever you're doing something hard, and slowly just like how you would work out any other muscle, you'll get better and better again. If you have to take a break, a 15 minute nap, whatever, but make that promise to yourself to fully follow through with every task. Mind over matter, it's all about your will power and ability to keep on pushing even when it starts to get tough or tiring. </p>
<p>The more you train your brain, the more you will be able to recover your processing skills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the issue is that it literally costs less energy to do something you've done before than something you've never done before. Consider driving, how hard is that when you first start? How tired do you feel when you first start driving vs when you've been driving for two years? </p>
<p>Habits are formed from three parts, the cue, the behaviour, and the reward. When you are eating shit tons of sugar, the cue might be &quot;Watching a TV show&quot; which triggers the behaviour &quot;eat a delicious snack&quot; and the reward &quot;SUGAR RUSH!!!&quot;</p>
<p>When your are lazy in your habit, the reward becomes &quot;Not using any extra energy&quot;. Sometimes we tell ourselves we're being lazy, but in reality the reward isn't less energy spend, but rather it can be things like &quot;If I do this I might fail&quot; or &quot;I'm a dumb piece of shit, there's no point in trying it's a waste of energy.&quot; Overstimulation (say from playing video games and watching TV and movies) can also fuck up your reward system. Your brain decides that the reward for completing a task, a little bump of dopamine is not worth the exertion of effort, because you can get that dopamine from playing a fun video game instead.</p>
<p>The good news is that we're a biological computer that can be hacked. The great news is that doing that is extremely simple! Just do the habit you want to have over and over, for like 2+ months! </p>
<p>The terrible news is that this task is <em>simple</em> not <em>easy</em>. It requires you fighting against nature, forces you to be actively thinking constantly. It's pretty exhausting.</p>
<p>But if you put your mind to it, it's doable. Then once the habit is set, your brain will say &quot;ugh, it uses a lot less energy to just go for a run, just do it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because our brain isn't a great statistician when it's born. Pragmatic decisions have to be cultivated with knowledge and examples of getting the screwdriver being the better idea. Until you have a history of it being faster, or are fed up enough with the stress of wasting time, or are just perpetually curious, you aren't going to risk expending extra energy to see if it's faster. You will always divert back to the solution that causes the lesser stress. It's the same reason we have such a hard time kicking habits. Shit, our entire economy is built on convenience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Studying works better if you connect it to something useful that you actually need to use it for. Obviously, not all classes will be easy to do this with, but that's how I always did well in school. The more you connect something you need to know to something you care about, the more likely you are to remember it. </p></div>		</li>
