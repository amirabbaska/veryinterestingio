			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, print them out! There was a time, not terribly long ago, when everything was written on typewriters. I imagine things were handwritten before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The YouTube channel objectivity highlights stuff in the royal society archives going back a couple hundred years, and they sometimes show original handwritten submissions that even have words/sentences crossed out and are formatted like letters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong, but it seems like most people will still print physical copies of <em>some</em> papers.  Not just any paper you happen to glance at, but if you want to seriously study one I mean.  I prefer a physical copy still, and I am young - I am guessing older people have more of a bias toward a physical copy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely agree. I often print articles i consider important for my work. I also love to take printouts to the calm and comfy sofa in the library and read it there. Additionaly, it still feels so much more natural to make notes or highlight stuff with a pen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently undertaking a literature review and being able to physically highlight and annotate the copy is so much easier than reading on a screen - the printing fees are a swine though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do that easily with my Samsung tablet and S Pen. What I really miss is physically going through the pages. The way our spatial reasoning works makes it much easier to visualize the structure of an article when you can see all the pages. I try to reduce my paper footprint by annotating using the tablet but when it's really important work or when I'm reviewing my own work I always print.</p></div>		</li>
