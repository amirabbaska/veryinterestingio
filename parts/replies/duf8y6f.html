			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit more to this, since there are hundreds of thousands of different strains of the flu, epidemiologists try to predict which strains will be most prevalent in the coming flu season based on previous seasons’ movements and whatnot. That being said, it tends to be different every year and the immunity to the flu doesn’t actually last only during flu season. Your immunity to those strains will last you for years to come, so if you essentially get multiple different strains of flu vaccines over the years, you’ll also grow immune or more resistant to more than just the strains given in the current season’s flu. One of the variants that aren’t in there may just be one from a previous vaccine. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how many possible combinations of the surface proteins (which still yield a viable virus) are there actually? Couldn’t we make a combined vaccine for all of them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that answer exactly, but I would say somewhere above a thousand. And every year, the flu vaccine is designed to target 4 or 5 (exact number may vary by the season, but I believe they try for the top 5 or less strains. This year is a quadrivalent shot, so there are 4). So then why not try to do every strain? The answer to this comes in a few parts. </p>
<p>The first and main reason I can think of is that it's just not feasible. To make a vaccine for the flu specifically, you need to inject the strains into the embryo of a chicken and grow it from there. Growing each individual strain this way for each individual person (or maybe for multiple people. I don't actually know how many eggs there are per person, but I can't imagine there being more than 1-2 people's worth of vaccine in an egg) takes up tons of eggs and can take up a good part of the year to do (like 6 months-ish). And even then, there are shortages sometimes. </p>
<p>Another reason is because your immune system fights by exposure. They only make antibodies to antigens they come in contact with. So imagine trying to fight off a thousand different things at once? There's a chance (numbers unknown, as this is all speculation in my part) that some antigens won't even be noticed as the part of the immune system that doesn't actually need antigens will clear it up before it even gets its own antibody.</p>
<p>And then there's also the dosing. If we assume a single vaccine shot as opposed to multiple shots in series (which would probably be more effective anyway), the dose would be much greater. First, you need enough of the antigen for a specific strain so the body can make antibodies before it's cleared away. And then you need to add in enough stabilizers, antibiotics (to prevent for contamination), proteins, etc... to keep the vaccine both stable and sterile and effective (there are other proteins and stuff in there that actually make your body react more strongly to the vaccine and promote production of antibodies. This would be other proteins and alluminum and they're known as adjuvants). This all combines together to make a dose of roughly half a mL, which is about the size of vaccines. I don't think there's one that goes higher than 1mL. So you'd have to think of the consequences of increasing it above that. Along with the other reasons above (takes too long. Body may not make antibodies to every strain), I don't know if we're even sure of how the body would react to this sort of thing. It's like a big barrage of multiple different things, as far as the body's concerned. </p>
<p>That's all I can think of for the moment. Again, forgive me if it seems all over the place. I'm working on 3 hours of sleep...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer:  Wiki says 18 H proteins and 11 N proteins currently known for influenza A. Some combinations have been labeled as extinct, but not necessarily because the combination is incompatible, but maybe because the populations that harbored each subtype never encountered each other to create new combinations. </p>
<p>Long answer:  A big problem is even within the same flu subtype there is some variety. I don't know if the old strains have been completely sequenced, but the Spanish flu subtype from the 1918 pandemic was H1N1. This is the &quot;same&quot; subtype as the H1N1 we saw spring up in the news a decade or so ago. However, the health impact of the more recent H1N1 was as you may know, much much different, I imagine even after you account for changes in access to healthcare and quality of care. This is because of the further variety that exists within the subtypes, which isn't necessarily conveyed by our current colloquial naming system.  On top of genetic shift (significant swapping of genes between subtypes and species - how we have H5N1 and H1N1, etc.), genetic drift exists.  Drift is the term used to describe the phenomenon of small mutations over time or in different regions that can create significant variation even within a subtype.  Think same virus, just with a different haircut that changes its personality a little bit. H1 gene/protein from 1918 may have been 40% avian 60% porcine, whereas the recent H1 may have been 40% avian, 55% porcine, 5% novel sequence. This change due to drift could result in significant variations in virulence and susceptibility to our developed antibodies, even if they both end up being named H1.  This example is oversimplified and not a perfectly accurate representation of how the virus evolves, but it does demonstrate the concept of genetic drift. Drift is present in all viruses and creates some problems, but can be outsmarted by vaccine makers. However, when you combine drift and shift, your pool of possible combinations opens up significantly, and makes the problem way more difficult to solve. </p>
<p>To wrap this up, shift is probably the biggest obstacle in making a catch all vaccine. When you've got a virus that has multiple hosts, you decrease the likelihood of ever eradicating that virus. As with smallpox, even though it was very deadly, it was able to be eradicated thanks in part to the lack of other animal hosts. There was no real chance for it to undergo genetic shift, which is part of what makes a virus like influenza such a well-studied but still very problematic virus. Even if you managed to prevent humans from being infected from the current flu subtypes, eventually a subtype that has been evolving in the ways mentioned above in an uncontrollable host, such as birds, might make its way back into human populations with the potential to cause significant disease. I hope this makes sense.</p>
<p>Tl;dr there may be too much potential variation to adequately answer that question, and even if it had an answer, the flu has properties that make it significantly more difficult to completely and indefinitely vaccinate against. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's effectively infinite; even if we could figure out all the configurations of the surface proteins that need to be there (which is pretty well beyond us currently and would still be an enormously large number), the virus can still always add extra surface proteins that don't do anything but confuse your immune system.</p>
<p>That said, there are a couple proteins that don't change very much between influenza strains (because they're critical to making a viable virus). If we can teach the immune system to specifically target those proteins that are almost always the same, we could make a more or less universal flu vaccine. There's been a lot of research in this area and there is at least one attempt starting clinical trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great respone.  One thing I have always wondered is why does he seem to take the human body the approximately same fixed amount of time to ultimately defeat a virus like the flu.   Are their immune system processes, like you mentioned that will always take X hours to complete (like new protein production from your above comment e.g.).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that, if we’ve had the flu a few times (over years) and we get the vaccine yearly, that we will likely have reduced symptoms as we grow older and catch the flu?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely, but that assumes repeated and continued revaccination yearly. The bodys response weakens if not reintroduced to antigens. It's why we have repeated vaccination (boosters) for things like tetanus, hep-a/b, etc. Those are recommended every 10 years. I'm almost certain that if younger people were as affected with pneumonia and shingles as the elderly are, those vaccines would have similar revaccination schedules instead of the once per life after 65 that they currently are. But being, unfortunately, that life after 65 is relatively short (20-30 more years), the risks of problems from vaccination become higher as we near revaccination so we just done do it. </p></div>		</li>
