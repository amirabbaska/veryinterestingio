			<div class="markdown"><p>Brainstorm: could some IT savvy mod or Samaritan put together a dendrogram of say all previous askscience posts that got at least a hundred upvotes clustered by semantic similarity? then when somebody searches they could see where on the tree of a bunch of posts previously dealt with or touched on those topics and drill in deeper there to look at those previous posts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the problem there is that Reddit's search tools are pretty awful. You can substitute Google, but unless you know good Google-fu you're really rolling the dice.</p>
<p>I don't even think it would be a big deal unless you're going to get eight questions a week on why vaccines are causing autism or something. In the context of reposts anywhere else on Reddit, usually some reposting content that hasn't been reposted in ages gets a bit of a frown but is still begrudgingly accepted. It's when it's been reposted on a bi-weekly basis five times that it becomes obnoxious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH, I would suggest you allow repeat questions.   While the person asking the question might be able to search for previous posts of the question, hundreds of thousands of other newer members might not even think to ask the question, unless it pops up on the front page.   </p>
<p>They weren't around the 1st time it was posted, and while i may never think to ask a question (or search old posts) about translucent aluminum, i'd certainly be interested in reading the posting if it were to pop up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak on behalf of /r/askscience but I'd like to note that this is a large, fast-paced public forum. Re-asked questions aren't too terribly annoying or bad - within reason of course.</p>
<p>Not to mention, re-asked questions are viewed by many people for the first time as they may not have seen it asked before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially, you can melt protons and neutrons into this liquid of &quot;free&quot; quarks and gluons. That's a quark gluon plasma. We make them at the relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab, and now at CERN, where they do lead-lead collsions.</p>
<p>Sorry my wife wants to go run errands so I'm in a bit of a rush, so here's an old post about particle jets: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k392q/are_there_any_similarities_between_particle_jets/c2h8ji1" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/k392q/are_there_any_similarities_between_particle_jets/c2h8ji1</a> </p></div>		</li>
