			<div class="markdown"><p>This will be a long and detailed post, which I will try to make accessible to the layperson, but out of time constraints, most of you will have to gloss over (or google) some of the terminology. Sorry. First, tl;dr for those who have even less time: </p>
<ul>
<li>Anonymity is relative, but doesn't cost much to go from zero to pretty good. Going from pretty good to &quot;Even the NSA would choke on my e-peen&quot; is inconvenient and requires solid knowledge of the technology. When I say solid, I mean <em>expert</em>. Fuck ups are easy, and make even one and it's &quot;Bye Felicia.&quot; The FBI operates somewhere between zero and pretty good. Unless you're <em>really</em> special, most people have it within their reach to protect against their efforts. So far, they've only expressed an interest in the large resource expenditures to get past &quot;pretty good&quot; in cases of child porn, drug trade, or terrorism. If you're outside one of those three things, and take precautions, the FBI is probably not a risk for you. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody is trully anonymous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The value of security is not in making it unbreakable, but rather in making the effort of breaking it exceed the value of the thing being protected.</em> </p>
<p>This is the central premise of <em>all</em> information security. It is not difficult to increase the difficulty in attaching a real person to an online identity. Compare Reddit, which has no requirement of any kind for its users to really do much more than select a username (and indeed makes it site policy not to disclose personal information), with that of Facebook, that screams in the other direction. This is an example of a very simple way to enhance anonymity. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web server also have a log with every ip address with a timestamp and what they did</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's generally true, but not always. Any website can choose to simply blackhole the logs. Most don't, but there's no requirement they keep the logs. As you might expect, the ones law enforcement would be interested in tend to be the kind that attach their log output to &quot;/dev/eatdick&quot;. ISPs, on the other hand, to varying degrees, levels of compliance, and legal requirements, sometimes do. But I can only speak in general here. With over 200 countries and innumerable legislative bodies, it's impossible for anyone to comment in more than a general way. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>They get the forum owner info, notice it is a vpn, request info from vpn, but they don't have logs because they are in a country that don't mandate it. request web hosting isp logs then vpn hosting compagny logs and then match the packets flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, at best, misleading. The FBI (as OP specifically named, but this is broadly true of all law enforcement) has a limited jurisdiction. Specifically, it's largely confined to domestic surveillance and criminal investigation <em>within</em> the United States. The internet is global. For any investigation of any significant scope, cooperation of other countries is essential. The Pirate Bay for almost a decade laughed hysterically posting form-mails with DMCA takedown notices, and would take great pleasure in penning sarcastic replies to US-based companies that fired them off to Finland (where TPB was based), which gave no fucks about the DMCA because it wasn't America. </p>
<p>It's been decades since the internet became a household word. Our judiciary still has trouble offering electronic filing in a lot of places because it's just &quot;too new&quot;. Laws always lag behind technological development, and increasingly so as technology is now evolving at an exponential rate. International cooperation has been a big focus in both the law enforcement and intelligence communities globally. But considering how often it makes the news that countries can't play nice with each other, well... it's not always easy. </p>
<p>To get around this, we tasked the NSA with creating a global signals intelligence network similar to (but not the same as) ECHELON. Basically, the NSA does a lot of &quot;007&quot; black bag stuff like embedding monitoring devices deep inside PCs, routers, etc. Other countries are doing this too -- China's been caught a few times now. Basically, it uses plausible deniability to get around having to ask permission. If you can't <em>prove</em> the United States has bugged the shit out of your infrastructure, you can't do anything diplomatically or otherwise and you look like a tinfoil hat wearing nut if you do. Even if you are right. People forget about Snowden and his warnings -- and massive stockpile of &quot;stolen&quot; documentation outlining this. It's been years since then. Their capabilities have grown, in some cases significantly. Not as far as data acquisition so much, but in terms of analytics, they've been making jaw-dropping levels of progress. </p>
<p>And they have to. Believe it or not, a lot of countries don't <em>want</em> to help our country's law enforcement efforts. Especially not when we've got a President now throwing their hard-won intelligence victories under a bus for peanuts. When we start talking about international cooperation regarding criminal activity online, we start dovetailing to intelligence gathering. A lot of countries feel left out (and with good reason) because other countries' citizens come to their part of the internet and abuse and defraud it, but the host countries don't really feel like making the effort to help them. So, in turn, it goes the other way. That's one of the reasons why most cyberattacks are coming from China, Russia, and Russia's allies. They have a policy of non-cooperation with most western countries. See also: &quot;But her e-mails!&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for TOR, the same can be applied: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it can't, but you deserve more than a dismissal. Tor is also known as &quot;onion&quot; routing. It's main vulnerability is traffic analysis. There's solutions for that, and a lot of technobabble to go into how all this works and what's needed. The short version is, the packets going through each point on the network are going to be roughly the same size and will be exiting the node largely in the order they come in at -- so if you can watch the traffic of each node, along with the entry and exit points, you can make a pretty good guess as to what someone is accessing <em>through</em> the Tor network. It's not easy to do this -- afterall, if it were, nobody would use Tor. But it can be done. There's no proof it has -- but there was a pile of child porn cases the FBI later dropped because it didn't want to reveal <em>how</em> it caught them. Yes, the FBI let a couple hundred pedophiles go rather than tell us they broke Tor. They later caught (probably) most of them using something they <em>would</em> disclose. They just quietly arrested the owner of the website that only existed inside Tor, and loaded their own FBI-branded malware on it, and pwned anyone who visited the site. Attacking Tor directly is a huge resource expenditure. That's what Tor is designed for -- going back to first principles: Breaking cost &gt; value, then security = good. That's why the FBI hacked the website instead: It was cheaper. And not by a little. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>each step get harder to convince a judge that the data is still valid and no error has been made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historically, that hasn't been much of a problem. Warrants and convictions are handed out like candy these days because very few judges understand the technical ins and out. Most juries don't either, so unless your technical expert can write an ELI5 shorter than I just did on this... it probably won't help your defense much. It's just not that easy to talk about this stuff in layman terms without either (a) making it really long like this post, or (b) losing so much of the substance it loses cohesion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all good, interesting stuff, thanks for taking the time to explain. </p>
<p>The trouble is if you're <em>right</em> - and I think you probably are -  about &quot;if breaking cost &gt; value, then security = good&quot;, then we need to distinguish between <em>perceived</em> breaking cost, and actual breaking cost. </p>
<p>As your observations on the FBI letting people go confirms, it's clearly in law enforcement's interest to make people <em>believe</em> that their security is better than it actually is. </p>
<p>Which is why, if I were in charge of a security agency, I would be sacking the arse off my subordinates if they weren't already running half a dozen well-reputed VPN services. At the end of the day, we take a hell of a lot on trust with VPNs.</p>
<p>If internet startup companies can run and successfully promote VPNs which are perceived as trustworthy, the best-funded intelligence agencies on the planet can certainly do it. <em>If</em> they do it, we're already entrusting all the web activity we want to keep secret to them. If they're not doing it... why the hell aren't they?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, perceptions not reality, underpin most of societies technology and institutions. It's not reasonable to change that for reasons that would deep dive into philosophy and human nature. I haven't yet imbibed enough caffeine to go there. Tl;Dr we have to trust others, even strangers, or we can't develop beyond tribal sized social groupings.</p>
<p>Law enforcement does not depend on breaking these things. How did they catch criminals before the internet? Why can't that work now? Criminals have to interact socially as well as digitally. Law enforcement has drank the koolaid like most people have. They equated convenience with necessity. </p>
<p>They don't need a VPN. They just need to keep their work... At work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost &gt; Value applies to all companies. Risk analysis is another term you'll hear.   </p>
<p>It doesn't make sense to spend millions protecting a picture of your dog, but it might to protect the personal information of your customers.  </p>
<p>Additionally it might not make sense to spend the time and money protecting something when you could just plan for the worst and prepare for that. It's cheaper and easier to deal with the cleanup than it is to waste excess resources for something that might never be relevant.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to note this since it always comes up: Tor is not secure. It <em>used</em> to be secure, until things like AWS allowed researchers to deploy hundreds/thousands/tens of thousands of nodes to the Tor network.</p>
<p>Tor is supposed to provide anonymity by jumping through many &quot;nodes&quot; (basically just proxy servers) which obfuscates the trail and makes it difficult or impossible to trace all the way back to the original user. All those extra jumps are meaningless, however, if one entity (a researcher or, say, the NSA) controls 80% of the nodes in the network. Even if someone tunnels through 20 different nodes, 16 of them are going to be monitored by the same group - it goes from &quot;nearly impossible&quot; to &quot;piss easy&quot; to trace people.</p>
<p>The only way you can get a semblance of anonymity online today is this: First, use public WiFi. If you try downloading kiddy porn or working on plans with ISIS through your home internet connection tied to your address, which you pay for with a credit in your name, you're 1) a dipshit and 2) fucked.</p>
<p>Second, use a zero-log VPN hosted in countries outside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes#Other_international_cooperatives" target="_blank">14 Eyes</a> - a group of countries that work <em>very</em> closely together for &quot;signals intelligence&quot; aka dragnet surveillance. If you get a VPN in Sweden or some such bullshit, your data will be monitored and shared freely with your home country. You're literally just wasting money and in fact you will be tracked <em>more closely</em> through the VPN than you otherwise would have, because &quot;why are you using a VPN? You must be doing something questionable.&quot;</p>
<p>Ideally, tunnel through a few no-log VPNs in countries that don't cooperate with each other. Even better, through countries that are openly hostile to the US. Good luck getting server logs from Mogadishu, state department.</p>
<p>Finally, even though Tor is <em>mostly</em> compromised, use it. It'll still make it slightly harder for them to track you. Keep in mind there is no such thing as 100% anonymity. If somebody wants to find you bad enough, they will.</p>
<p>If you set up this connection to share your investigative journalism (because, let's be real, that's the #1 most important use for anonymity) and then log into anything tied to your name - a bank account, Reddit profile, Facebook (do I really need to mention that?), forum accounts, Instagram, anything. ANYTHING that you have logged into from a home IP or cell phone, you're fucked.</p>
<p>Think of this like having a &quot;work phone&quot; and a &quot;personal phone&quot;, except in this case if you mix the two up you'll spend the rest of your life in prison or you'll just be found with two gunshot wounds to the back of your head and it deemed a &quot;suicide&quot;.</p>
<p>That's why I just make computer videos on YouTube. I'm not really down to get suicided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't wrong about the ability of tor to be compromised in that fashion. That said, the relay nodes are broadcast. They don't accept much traffic until they have been online and stable for awhile. If this happens it will be noticed. It's a theoretical attack. Practical attacks are watching for tor traffic at NAPs and serving NSLs or similar as necessary until they are at the source. Do this systemicly and gg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tor is a LOT more complicated but still doable.  What you need is traffic coming into a controlled TOR node and traffic interacting with the website that match.  Then you have to control a certain number of tor entrance nodes.  With those nodes you start collecting until can one to one match traffic entering your entrance node and traffic leaving the exit node that goes to the site you need while that user is using it.   It is currently believed that you can get a solid match if you control 3% of the entrance/exit nodes with any reliability.  As a result it should be assumed that at the very least the US, Russia, and China can unmask state level actors.   It is unlikely that they will overtly target small problems (sadly they consider pedo's here) in this manner.  It's not worth playing their hand that openly.   It is more likely that they will figure out who the user is and then build a parallel case where they just magically happen to stumble on identity information leaking who he is elsewhere.  It is extremely difficult to determine if the goverment is doing this due to how secret the surveillance systems are.   In addition this is so illegal for law enforcement to do, that any conclusive evidence of this will immediately sink any chances US prosecution has of putting someone in jail.  There is a default status in most US cases of the police being an infallible moral authority and the defendant being a criminal.  If the US authorities are shown to have illegally gathered evidence from supposed foreign surveillance material, it changes this to a perception that the US prosecutors are illegal scumbags that are spying on all americans and using it to cherry-pick partial bits of evidence that cannot be defended against by any real person.</p></div>		</li>
