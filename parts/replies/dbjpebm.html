<p>This is the key point that all of the other top posts are missing.  Everyone is confusing biased news and fake news.  Fake news is fundamentally based on factually incorrect information.  Biased news cherry picks correct facts and data to push a narrative.  </p>
<p>Often the author of fake news knows full well that it's bullshit and just wants the pageviews.  Other times the author misunderstands the source material or is just wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Fox News, MSNBC, etc, are not fake news - everything they publish is more or less true, just presented in a very biased way, sometimes in a way that pushes readers to draw untrue conclusions from it. Fake news is different - it is completely, 100% bullshit, designed from the ground up to get clicks (as opposed to real, bad news, which involves taking a true story and twisting it in a way that would generate clicks)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except during that podcast, there's a bit where Fox News literally picks up a made-up story and broadcasts it. The man they interviewed made up a fake story about people buying marijuana with food stamps in Colorado, and Fox News went on air with it as true. So when you have a news corporation that fact checks so poorly that they publish completely fictional news from a source that is nothing more than a well-designed website, where does that line and up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except when CNN is telling it's viewers that its illegal to read Wikileaks and only journalist are allowed to.</p>
<p>That was 100% false information spread by a &quot;real&quot; news organization in order to influence election results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off your comment, the NY Times also recently ran a piece tracking the origin of one particular &quot;fake news&quot; piece that went viral shortly after the election. It illustrates the point you made regarding the explosion of stories via social media. In this instance, it was Twitter and our very own, /r/The_Donald. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not &quot;fake news&quot;,  that's a guy making a mistake and a bunch of fringe but legitimate right wing blogs and Facebook groups picking up the ball and running with it. The error is obvious but that doesn't make it fake news.</p></div>		</li>
