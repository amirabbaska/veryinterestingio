			<div class="markdown"><p>While these are great answers, let's be honest: 9/11.  We have them because people got paranoid and this was the band-aid to fix that.</p>
<p>Case in point:  Why not just bomb the airport lobby?  Hundreds of people, don't have to pass checkpoints, and if you bomb a major hub like LAX, you can shut down flights across the country and parts of the world.</p>
<p>The point being, it isn't really about safety, it's about the perception of safety.</p>
<p>And to add to another point of yours:  A train has a set path, a plane doesn't.  Your access to a plane begins and ends at the airport.  With a train, all you have to do is stop a truck on the tracks a mile away.  It's basically a no-win situation with security unless you want to go insane.  So why waste money to prevent one way when even the most idiotic criminal could figure out 15 others? </p></div>		</li>

<p>That was my thought for years. Then it happened in Brussels after I moved there and the place I worked was really close to the blast area  (but I was off shift). I thought I jinxed it, but in reality it was obvious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel like cross training one flight attendant/pilot as a sky marshal and go back to pre-911 metal detectors would be far more cost effective.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of it is security theater.</p>
<p>Something few people seem to understand is that you don't have to make a target completely secure to stop an attacker.</p>
<p>All you have to do is make it just difficult enough that it's easier and more desirable for them to attack somewhere else.</p>
<p>Nightclubs and shopping malls are much easier targets than critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants and airports.</p>
<p>Where have we seen terror attacks recently? Not nuclear power plants or airports.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because the ultimate goal isn't body count, or disrupting travel, or hurting the economy. The ultimate goal is to force a change in the status quo. And blowing up an airport lobby might give you some media coverage and help you recruit a bit, but probably won't help you accomplish the ultimate goal, which usually requires manipulating public opinion in your favor.</p>
<p>Even 9/11 was not about killing as many Americans as possible. They could have killed a lot more people if they'd wanted to. It was about attacking a <em>symbol</em>. The idea was that Americans would ask what the hell we're even doing in the Middle East and pull out. Of course, that's not quite what happened. 9/11 was far too destructive for people to respond by becoming introspective, it was too destructive for any response but outrage. Politically, it was a failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true at all. Google bin Ladens motivations. He was hoping to provoke a war between the west and the middle east that would be so costly for the west as to economically destroy us. Seems to have worked pretty well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One quick point to avoid the spreading of myths:</p>
<p>The pressure difference is irrelevant.  A plane will not pop like a balloon poked with a needle when compromised, the fuselage is plenty strong enough.  If you don't believe me, think about sticking a needle into a soda can (or maybe your keys into a beer can if that's more your style :P).  Those cans are under more pressure with much thinner walls.</p>
<p>The main problem with explosions is the close proximity to fuel tanks (or liquid boom as another commenter put it) and significant damage causing a loss of control of the airplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks I was getting ready to point this out. It's not the decompression that kills you in an airplane explosion, it's the plane falling out of the sky. Usually the explosion does other things besides just rupturing the pressure vessel, and that causes a crash.</p>

<p>The term you're looking for is marginal not irrelevant. I've seen my share of exploding airplanes, specifically a test if the power of Richard Reid's shoe bomb. The difference between pressurized hull and non pressurized haul is pretty staggering. But the shoe bomb was powerful enough to destroy the plane regardless of the pressurization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>D.C.-10s had a shitty design once where a cargo hatch could pop open. The depressurization did in fact head to a buckling from within and sometimes catastrophic failures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've heard of things like that happening, but at the end of the day, that's only a problem because the controls run through the floor there, so the buckling severs the controls.</p>
<p>Saw a really cool thing about a plane that had that happened but it had cables that just got pinned instead of hydraulics.  The pilots/autopilot forcing the controls eventually caused the cables to saw themselves a groove so they could move again, and the pilots regained control and landed the plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. </p>
<p>For comparison, the Eurostar which goes under the channel tunnel from London to Paris DOES have screening like the airport. </p>
<p>They have to do passport control and I guess because its in a tunnel its probably more vulnerable?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The passport control is just because France and the UK are not both within Schengen -- so it's just a legal requirement.</p>
<p>As for the security: indeed, because it spends a rather large amount of time in a tunnel literally buried under the sea, it's more vulnerable to attack and thus more precautions are taken. This security is considerably less strict than airline security however, and focuses mostly on things that are a danger to the train in the tunnel. For instance, pocket knives that would be banned from flights are acceptable in the Eurostar train.</p></div>		</li>
