<p>The amount of material you need to store long-term is relatively small - most material is not isotopes but irradiated clothing, water, tools which are categorised as &quot;contaminated&quot; due to overcautious categorisations, but in some cases are less radioactive than the tritium dial in your wristwatch (or the open-air pile of fly-ash next to your coal plant). We need to get real about the stuff that is genuinely safe and just dump it out at sea. Just because it has been used in the office of a nuclear pant does not make it radioactive!</p>
<p>The really nasty high-grade stuff tends to have quite a short half-life (live fast, die young), so we can actually keep that above-ground. We're talking years-decades.</p>
<p>That leaves the nasty actinides and stuff which are quite radioactive, and have long half-lives (thousands of years).</p>
<p>It is absolutely possible to vitrify that shit (the most chemically stable way of storing anything known to physics), dig a hole in a geologically stable formation and bury it.</p>
<p>The <em>problem</em> - yet again - is people. Politics. NIMBYism (Not In My Back Yard). They don't want a geological storage site in their county or canton, even though there is basically no risk. This stuff is inside solid rock, separated from the water table. It's vitrified. It's not soluble and wouldn't contaminate the water table even if you flooded the site.</p></div>		</li>
