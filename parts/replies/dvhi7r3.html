			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a set agonist/antagonist in the relationship or is it just a flexible (hehe) title? Like I assume biceps and triceps are a pair and are an agonist/antagonist combo but how is that decided? Is it decided? Or is it just that the bicep is the antagonist to the tricep and the tricep is the antagonist to the bicep?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latter.</p>
<p>Biceps for elbow flexion, triceps for elbow extension, depending on the movement in question one is either agonist or antagonist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the speed and control of the motion. </p>
<p>During slow, controlled elbow extension, like a wicked slow biceps curl, the biceps is acting as an antagonist and an agonist. </p>
<p>But if you were to forcefully extend the elbow, like throwing your phone to the ground only using elbow extension, the triceps is the agonist and the biceps the antagonist. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. The term is interchangeable, so (per your example) if I was doing a bicep curl - my biceps would be the agonist v my triceps being the antagonist. But if I was doing a triceps extension, the my tris would be the agonist v my biceps being the antagonist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you get into it it gets a little more complex.</p>
<p>Your bicep for example is actually 2 muscles and do more than just been your arm. They affect internal rotation, and grip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. Typically the agonist / antagonist relationship describes skeletal muscle.  Which is mostly my knowledge base, however you also have smooth muscle (muscles lining your digestive tract) and cardiac muscle (heart) both of which are involuntary and controlled by the autonomic portion of your nervous system. Skeletal muscle is consciously controlled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The anal spinchters don't have antagonists, relying on pressure in the sigmoid generated by other muscles to assist in defecation. Other spinchters may be similarly lacking in antagonists, although the Iris has both a dilator and spinchter relating to its specific need for precise dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the abs, you have three layers, the outer layer is for hip flexion, which is probably the one you’re referring too. If you crunch forward, you feel those work. </p>
<p>Now do the opposite motion, when doing so you feel the lower back flex, and that’s for hip extension. So in the case of a crunch the antagonist is the latissimus dorsi </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latissimus dorsi mostly affects the arm, actually, because it inserts on the intertubercular sulcus of the humerus. The antagonist of a crunch would be your erector spinae muscles (iliocostalis, longissimus, and spinalis), and the deep muscles of the back, which are the rotatores, multifidus, and semispinalis muscles.</p>
<p>As for the abs, you do have three layers of obliques (external oblique, internal oblique, and transverse abdominis), but those mainly focus on rotation of the trunk and compression of the abdomen, not hip flexion. Your hip flexors do that (iliacus, psoas major, psoas minor).</p></div>		</li>
