<p>You sure about that?  I've seen pictures of cable-maintenance ships, and they show fiber cables up on-deck being fusion-spliced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To help visualise this point:</p>
<p>If we assume the end points of the cable are drifting apart at 10 cm/year (I believe higher than the actual rate) and that the cable length is 5200 km (this would get one from New York to Dublin), we can figure how much it's going to &quot;stretch&quot; annually.</p>
<p>Well obviously it's going to stretch by 10 cm each year. But let's scale it down to the length of a cable in your house. How about to a 3 m cable? Maybe you've got a 3 m Ethernet cable or extension cord in your house. That's a scaling by a factor of about 1.7 million, which would require you stretching your Ethernet cable by about 60 nm, far less than the width of a human hair.</p>
<p>It's quite possible continental drift isn't even on their radar because so many other dynamics have a bigger effect on the length of the cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oversimplified.  The continents spread at the mid-oceanic ridge only. Not evenly across the entire Atlantic basin.  So the middle few km of the cable get all that stretch. They lay the cable with a loop of slack in that area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That assumes that the cable will stretch along it's entire length when in reality the stretch would be localized to the area around where the plate is moving, maybe only a few miles on either side of the plate boundary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's call it about 5.2 km around a plate boundary (so we're only dealing with orders of magnitude difference). We've now brought the amount you'd stretch your Ethernet cable up to 60 Î¼m or roughly the width of a human hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10cm/year approaches the upper limit of present-day plate motions, so you aren't underestimating that aspect.  Across the Atlantic spreading rates are lower, depending upon where you are (1-4cm/yr).</p>
<p>You have the right idea, but the stretching is accomodated over a km or a few, not the whole thing.  Even so, over a length of a few cm/yr wouldn't amount to much stretching of the cable.  They'd already have enough slack and stretching accomodated within the design of the cable to deal with other issues (e.g., draping over sea-floor terrain, especially near the ridges where it gets more rocky and rugged).</p></div>		</li>
