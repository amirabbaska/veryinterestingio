			<p>A little bonus info on the maintenance loops. When a cable needs to be repaired, they will cut with basically a wire cutter on wheels dragged along the bottom. There's not enough slack to bring the cable all the way to the surface of the water to be worked on. They'll then splice in a new extension of cable to compensate for being able to reconnect both ends on the surface. These are layed down as loops on the ocean floor, which have to be recorded on updated maps.</p>		</li>

			<p>This article is maddeningly terrible. Cables are already shielded by default, and you can't go around adding more armor after the fact unless it's the bits close to shore and you want to spend an absurd amount of money doing so.<br><br>Not to mention Kevlar is generally useless vs knives because of the type of material it is, and shark teeth are basically a bunch of knives chomping down on something.<br><br>I don't have the report in front of me, but of all the cable faults since like, the mid 1980s, a shark attack has accounted for a single incident, and that one was mostly up for debate. The vast majority of cable faults are caused by someone dragging an anchor where they should have been, upwards of 80% of all faults. The rest are caused by some sort of natural disaster (earthquakes, underwater landslides, or tidal currents) or a simple technical issue of some sort on the cable itself (shunt fault, for instance).<br><br>Edit: Here is an article about this. They cite information from the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) which is the organization responsible for cable protection/awareness across the world. They have records of nearly every cable fault and why it happens so if anyone knows, it's them.<br><br><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/lets-be-real-sharks-arent-eating-googles-undersea-internet-cables" target="_blank">http://motherboard.vice.com/read/lets-be-real-sharks-arent-eating-googles-undersea-internet-cables</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Well, it doesn't have to be a rock falling on it, in fact that's probably the least likely way for a break to happen.<br><br>Earthquakes are just incredibly violent, and cause LOTS of sudden/unexpected motion. If it's not the earth moving rapidly itself that does it, an earthquake could cause the surrounding ocean to move violently enough to cause a break.<br><br>Also, you don't have to actually break/cut a cable to cause a fault. If you simply damage the cable enough to cause some sort of electrical short (like in a shunt fault), that would be enough to require a repair ship to come out and pull everything up to repair the issue.</p>		</li>

			<p>The splicing is done on-board a ship.

			<p>I believe the splicing is all performed within the ship maintaining the cable. They'd cut the line below the water level, move as necessary toward one cut end so that it can be lifted into the splicing area. They slice in the new longer section and move on toward the other cut with the longer cable. They now have enough slack to raise the other end of the cut cable out of the water.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's a video of the process above which shows everything before completed on the ship before putting the cable back underwater.  If you've laid thousands of miles of cable already, I doubt adding another 4-5 miles of repair cable is a huge deal.

			<p>To help visualise this point:<br><br>If we assume the end points of the cable are drifting apart at 10 cm/year (I believe higher than the actual rate) and that the cable length is 5200 km (this would get one from New York to Dublin), we can figure how much it's going to &quot;stretch&quot; annually.<br><br>Well obviously it's going to stretch by 10 cm each year. But let's scale it down to the length of a cable in your house. How about to a 3 m cable? Maybe you've got a 3 m Ethernet cable or extension cord in your house. That's a scaling by a factor of about 1.7 million, which would require you stretching your Ethernet cable by about 60 nm, far less than the width of a human hair.<br><br>It's quite possible continental drift isn't even on their radar because so many other dynamics have a bigger effect on the length of the cable.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep, probably not enough to do anything after one year, after 50 years though it's possible.  You also need to consider that plate boundaries can move a lot more than 10 cm a year.  A single earthquake can move a plate tens of meters in a few seconds, and those events do break cables: <a href="http://submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-taiwan-earthquake-2006" target="_blank">http://submarinenetworks.com/news/cables-cut-after-taiwan-earthquake-2006</a></p>		</li>

			<p>10cm/year approaches the upper limit of present-day plate motions, so you aren't underestimating that aspect.  Across the Atlantic spreading rates are lower, depending upon where you are (1-4cm/yr).<br><br>You have the right idea, but the stretching is accomodated over a km or a few, not the whole thing.  Even so, over a length of a few cm/yr wouldn't amount to much stretching of the cable.  They'd already have enough slack and stretching accomodated within the design of the cable to deal with other issues (e.g., draping over sea-floor terrain, especially near the ridges where it gets more rocky and rugged).</p>		</li>
