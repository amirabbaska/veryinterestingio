The meaning of time for a photon is basically meaningless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t how it works, just an eli5 way to look at it, but mass resists acceleration through inertia, and as an object approaches the speed of light you can imagine it’s mass approaching infinity, thus no amount of force can accelerate it faster.  </p>
<p>Only particles whose mass is zero don’t have this effect.</p></div>		</li>
