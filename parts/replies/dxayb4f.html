			<div class="markdown"><p>48 cores are not really unusual. The moment you get to server hardware it is all about scaling.
512gb ram in one machine is pretty normal nowadays and 24 physical -&gt; 48 virtual cores are normal nowadays </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the game industry, do many devs simply carry their workstations back and forth between home and office? Seems like a culture barrier more than a technological barrier, perhaps.</p>
<p>I'm an enterprise dev and I've been seriously considering lugging my desktop to the office and back. I've got a nice watercooled 4ghz rig at home, and it does enterprisey stuff like running our test suite and building our deploys about twice as fast as my work-issued laptop.</p>
<p>First thing I do with my laptop when I get to work or home is tether it up to a bunch of external displays on my desk anyway, y'know? Thinking it wouldn't be <em>that</em> much different to do it with a tower. The tower is only like 15 or 20 pounds even with a watercooling rig, I am a big strong dude, and it's not like I have to walk very far between my car and my desk. I'm sure the LAN party crowd has probably come up with some convenient tower-sized tote bags over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m on my first enterprise job in a Fortune 500 company after years of doing game development in different companies (mobile games, but still all the “fun” environment checkboxes). Best decision I’ve ever made. Better terms (pay etc), much less stress and crunch (and with that none of the politics and the constant toxic complaining about the way things are done). If I enjoy making games, I can work on them in my own free time, in my own terms, and speaking of free times I have much more of it now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably around 7 or 8K. I doubt it's what the company pays for them though. If you look at the part list it adds up quickly. The procesor is about 1.7 to 2K each. video cards are about 1.5K (they're given to us by AMD / Nvidia though). Ram is probably stupid expensive as it's a lot and it's ECC ram, probably like $500? same goes with the motherboard. </p>
<p>The way that it works is that they're rented or leased. The company gets N number of machines per year. Some people have high priority on changing machines, so they get new and shiny stuff. Then machines start getting handed down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably about right, maybe a bit high.  What model is the RAM if it's ECC?  ECC is usually used for servers where there's high throughput but no graphics so the amounts and the clock-speeds are comparatively lower.  What sizes are they?</p>
<p>I ask because I've never seen ECC mentioned for use in enthusiast machines; they've always recommended unbuffered.  In fact, the set that I've had my eyes on is a 64 (16x4) GB DDR4 3466 (PC4-27700) which would currently run me about $1,000 due to the shortages and it's unbuffered.</p></div>		</li>
