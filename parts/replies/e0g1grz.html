			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it's not worth it. It's also kinda demoralizing cause doctors love Lexapro, but I can't stand it. It makes me exhausted. I get like two hours of awake time before a cloud of tiredness descends over me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scuse me, you 2.... But SSRI meds have been life saving for me. I used to be so anxious that I could never talk to anybody and I could hardly even go out in public, especially not alone. Now I can talk to strangers just fine, and even smile in public. Wow huh? I love love Zoloft. My only issue/warning is, please do not drive on this stuff!!! It makes me really laid back and my level of concern for what's happening around me goes waaaay down. I ended up damaging my car driving after having taken a lil higher dosage of Zoloft than usual. But i just shrugged it off at the time. So it definitely clouds your ability to make wise decisions. However, it's more than worth it to be able to interact with other humans and be a part of society. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They prescribe the same medications to all: ssri, anti convulsants, etc. The one size fits all model is kinda one of the weird things about psychiatry. </p></div>		</li>
