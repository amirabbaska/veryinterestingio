			<div class="markdown"><p>To this extent, hibernation has always baffled me. How can anything go without food and water for so long, maintaining a state of sleep for so long?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/black-bear/hibernation/190-do-black-bears-hibernate.html" target="_blank">According to this,</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>grizzly bears hibernate up to 7 Â½ months without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand they store fat and go into 'low maintenance mode', but it still seems absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only absurd when you're projecting your human experiences and expectations onto the animal. If you imagine yourself sleeping for so long then it would seem utterly impossible because it is. But biology allows for much more impressive forms of stasis/hybernation than even bears are capable of.</p>
<p>Snails can hybernate for years, and then there's <a href="https://www.earthtouchnews.com/wtf/wtf/5-animals-1-superbug-that-can-freeze-thaw-live/" target="_blank">this list</a> of creatures that can outperform simple extended sleep by surviving freezing (and in one case pretty much every environmental hazard including outer space). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Respectfully, I disagree.  For a very large, warm-blooded animal to go that long without consuming anything or expelling waste products (other than gases in both directions, I assume) is extremely counter-intuitive considering how rapidly most mammals (not just humans) in an ordinary 'non-hibernation' condition would die without water, in particular, and how physically and chemically active a mammal's biological systems typically are.  </p>
<p>I notice that none of the animals listed on your link are mammals or larger than a small frog or baby turtle, which to me reinforces the point that bears hibernating is quite exceptional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a feature of all marine mammals. They cannot afford to fully fall asleep because they need to resurface to breath so they show unihemispheric sleep. It is possible that migrating birds may show the same feature and sleep with a different side of the brain depending on their position on the flock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read about a theory that most of these questions can be answered by assuming sleeping is the default state of mind and waking up is just for reproduction and finding food.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts? Coming up with hypotheses of sleep function is easy. Proposing and doing the actual experiments to test those hypothesis is not. The hypothesis you referred to is one of the old ones, recently resuscitated by the work of the zimmer lab in Vienna. I personally think it means nothing. It's only a different semantic definition of sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't a great way to test the purpose of sleep decreasing the amount of time slept and analyzing the affects of sleep deprivation? If it were just meant to kill time then losing sleep wouldn't be as detrimental to mental and physical health as it is? Or am I wrong in making that assumption </p></div>		</li>
