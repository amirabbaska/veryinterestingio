			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the strongest answer. Our country is built on the idea that the counter to distasteful speech is more speech. You say something I think is racist, I complain about you saying it, you complain about my complaining, etc.</p>
<p>This seems to be misunderstood by the &quot;free speech advocates,&quot; who seem to be just as bad as anybody about wanting only their side heard. I never hear anyone saying &quot;You know, I think the snowflakes' complaints are stupid, but we  still need to defend their right to complain.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

The shit out of me, but I recognize that both of you have the right to be the annoying, easily-frustrated, overly-sensitive little Snowflakes that you are. Can you guys just try to do the same, and maybe STFU for a minute?&quot;</p>
<p>At the very least I'll bring people together by making them think I'm a totally condescending douchebag.   ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue isn't the &quot;snowflakes&quot; complaining. It's the &quot;snowflakes&quot; trying to push for policy to limit free speech by outlawing certain types of speech they deem offensive.</p>
<p>Many of the people on the far left, in the Perpetually offended crowd want legislation that makes it a crime to make offensive statements about certain &quot;marginalized groups&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. That's straight up unconstitutional and can never fly. They're legally allowed to propose bad ideas just like others are legally allowed to be racist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly, with what is being taught in college campuses 40% of young people are now for using the government to police &quot;offensive speech&quot; but I think this trend may reverse as its ugly side is showing and there is still enough free speech to show its danger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>with a few exceptions </p>

<p>Yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater is usually the first example.</p>
<p>edit: for all of you armchair constitutional lawyers, you can't yell fire in a crowded building:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that 'free speech' has literally nothing to do with you telling me anything, or with me telling you anything.</p>
<p>Somehow, the 'culture' has gotten freedom of speech (the constitutionally protected freedom) all twisted up to mean something it doesn't. </p>
<p>All the 1st amendment does is protect you from government censorship or retaliation. It has no bearing and no effect on the 'private' world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in addition to excluding free speech related issues from criminal prosecution, your civil rights to say what you want to other people are protected. In other words, not only can you not be jailed for your words, but you can't be sued for them, either (with exclusions for slander, etc...). While the first amendment primarily sets up a relationship between the citizenry's right to expression and the government, there are points where it is applicable in citizen-to-citizen interactions, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really not accurate.</p>
<p>Jailing you would be something the government does. You can't be jailed for expressing your beliefs (except for certain exceptions of course).</p>
<p>Civil action, like slander and whatever - completely different thing, and your protections there are under completely different laws and precedent. Not the first amendment, not 'freedom of speech'.</p>
<p>Extremely common misunderstanding.</p></div>		</li>
