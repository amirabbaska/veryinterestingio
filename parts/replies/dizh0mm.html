			<div class="markdown"><p>For you. I've spent my entire life with insomnia before realizing that my schedule is almost entirely alien to the norm. If I don't physically break my schedule, I will sleep at 6:30 <em>AM</em> and wake at 4:30 <em>PM</em> on the button.</p>
<p>The problem lies in physiological differences. Almost my entire family has insomniac schedules. What changes is that we <em>fight</em> it until we win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. But every time I've heard someone like this and delved deeper it's result of shit sleep hygiene and schedule. Late coffee to ward off 2-6pm tiredness. Nap after home from work, and so on. </p>
<p>Reset of sleep schedule, no caffeine at all, morning physical exercise, healthier diet, reduced blue light in evening, none 2hr before sleep, all combine to solve in many cases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when I was 5 years old, I was laying, in the dark, on the couch in the living room with my mom, and I said to her at 9 PM: How do I sleep?</p>
<p>This was taken with a grain of salt, and the response was &quot;just close your eyes.&quot; Until then I had been doing exactly that for exactly 2 hours. Lets not underestimate 2 hours for a five year old autistic boy with ADHD. This is like putting 15-25 cats in a box and then putting A smol FUCK TON of catnip outside of the box.</p>
<p>Even right now my response with lights out in roughly 10 minutes is &quot;Will I sleep tonight?&quot; It's pretty scary when school, social interaction, family, health, well being and job expectations are all hinged on such a stupid question. That stupid question matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this exact problem; if I don't take melatonins before I lay down at night, I stay awake all damn night, tossing and turning.  If I do sleep, I'll have at least 4-5 hours rest before I start feeling tired again around 10-11am.  </p>
<p>I haven't slept yet. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4AM not PM.</p>
<p>Wikipedia: &quot;Diurnal cycles of cortisol levels are found in humans.[4] In humans, the amount of cortisol present in the blood undergoes diurnal variation; the level peaks in the early morning (around 8 am) and reaches its lowest level at about midnight-4 am, &quot;</p>
<p>also I'm having trouble finding any info pertaining cortisol to how energetic you feel</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say it was  the lowest levels, I said at 4pm the levels halves, and try looking it up in an endocrinology book maybe it'll be easier </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my mistake. So if cortisol makes us feel energetic, how does this make any sense?</p>
<p>Sleep loss results in an elevation of cortisol levels the next evening</p>
