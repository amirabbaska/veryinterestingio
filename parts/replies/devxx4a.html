			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right, and just for completeness, there was a guy who figured out how to describe all the 'waveform' stuff as harmonics of sine waves, so even a sawtooth or square wave can be described as pure sine waves plus harmonics which are also pure sine waves. Different amplitudes of the harmonics correspond to the different sounds of different instruments.</p>
<p>That guy's name was Joseph Fourier, and he described this in about 1807. His technique is even more useful now that we have computers fast enough to do audio processing in real time. It's another way of looking at the same thing, but it's an especially useful one in a lot of situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know it. And a modern computational tactic called the Fast Fourier Transform developed I think in the 1960s is what's behind those cool dance-y bar graphs and most music visualizers we see! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would actually be more accurate distinguishing between Fourier transforms and Fourier series. Here we are talking about the series, which states as follows: every periodic signal can be written as an infinite serie of sinusoidal waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I searched far and wide through comments looking for Fourier to be mentioned. I don't understand it much beyond networking data transmission but I was almost positive it first applied to sounds.</p>
<p>My most basic understanding of the Fourier stuff is that any sound is a composition of multiple sounds. Those sounds may each be a different frequency/pitch but they 'merge' together to make a single frequency. The sounds that make up a piano's C and a trumpet's equivalent C are different, but the composition is measured as the same frequency. Is that at least partially right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's almost completely right. The only thing I'd clarify is that the frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. So for a piano and a trumpet, we're actually looking at the same frequencies (the fundamental, 2x the fundamental, 3x, 4x, etc.). It's just that some of those frequencies contribute more or less amplitude depending on the instrument (because of how the sound is generated, and how it is attenuated, for example by the shape and type of wood in a violin body).  </p>
<p>An extreme example is a square wave, which has amplitude on all the odd harmonics, and zero amplitude on all the other frequencies that might otherwise contribute to the sound. For most instruments, none of the amplitudes are zero like that, and they generally contribute less the higher in frequency you go (which is part of why Fourier analysis is so useful, you do the analysis for the first few frequencies, and that generally gives you more of the picture), but you can definitely see unique shapes for the 'envelopes' of the frequency response for different instruments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say electronic sounds do you mean in electronic music? Because synthesizers use a variety of waveforms. Most commonly sine and saw. The difference in sound between an acoustic instrument and a synthesizer is that a synthesizer uses mostly pure waveforms. If you look at the waveforms of a guitar, it might like like a pretty even sine wave but if you look closer there are more waves within the sine shaped wave form. This is called distortion. Different materials make different distortion patterns that make a different sound. This is why a sine wave from a guitar sounds different from a pure sine that you can get from a synthesizer. So it mostly comes down to how materials distort the sound.   </p>
<p>Edit: Also harmonics are a thing, I think someone in another comment explained those though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those beeping noises differ depending on the make. Alarm clocks usually use a saw wave, backing trucks sound more like triangle waves, test tones are sine waves. The kind of waveform doesn't really matter, you still get a &quot;beep&quot; sound if the waveform has no distortion or harmonics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early video game music, on the other hand, loves square waves. When you think 8-bit music (like the NES), you're mostly thinking square waves (although the NES specifically also had a triangle wave channel). Later on came frequency modulation (think Sega Genesis), wavetable (&quot;fonts&quot; that define the form of the wave, think PC-Engine/Turbographx16 as well as one channel on the original game boy), then sample-based music (think Amiga and SNES).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure you would call it distortion. The resonances of the physical materials are what makes a guitar not a diddly bow. I mean, adding harmonics to something is distorting it but the complexities of a guitar strings movement are not a deviation from an original sound. They <em>are</em> the original sound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The percussion one isn't accurate. There are two types or percussion, pitched and unpitched, however all instruments have a note. On unpitched instruments they're built so players can create both a single pitch and a wash of overtones. One such example is a triangle. The points at the open end vibrate and can either vibrate in harmony (parallel) creating a distinct pitch (mines an A) or perpendicular to each other which creates the wash of sounds and the preferable sound of the instrument. This principle can also be seen in a tuning fork. The two tines vibrate parallel to one another and create a distinct pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further down in the comments someone used the example of a piano to point out this flaw as well. You're entirely correct, I was trying to simplify by saying that <del>percussion</del> drums, cymbals, and similar instruments aren't generally thought of as having pitch because they don't resonate well, or in parallel as you say. Even in that example though, they <em>do</em> have a pitch that has to be tuned regularly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's true. In general there are so many different types of percussion instruments and it gets difficult to talk about each, that many leave it off entirely (I'm a percussionist by trade so I try to pay attention to it) </p>
<p>Also, those instruments do resonate well, they have too many harmonic overtones for there to be a single distinguishable note, for example the reason a Tamtam (proper name for what most call a gong) can get so loud in an orchestral setting even though the player can jut touch the mallet to the instrument, is because it resonates so well. It can easily overpower other instruments.</p></div>		</li>
