			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of the draws of Broadway musicals. </p>
<p>You could go listen to the cast recording right now, and it would be good. The performers can use the all the tools of the studio to make an idealized take on the songs in the performance. </p>
<p>But when it's done it's done. It's static, and can't be changed after you listen to it, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. </p>
<p>But if you go to a live performance, it's going to be a unique experience every time. Not necessarily a new experience, since the dialogue and songs are written to be the same. But <em>how</em> the actors execute each performance will be different. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. </p>
<p>And that's exciting. You're there, live with the actors, experiencing what happens with them. </p>
<p>And after a while casts change. New actors are brought in, with wholly new takes on both their characters and the songs they sing. And most of the time updated cast recordings aren't made, so you really are watching something you'll only ever be able to see live. </p>
<p>This also ties into why people pirate movies and tv shows. Whether you view them in the theater, at home, or on your computer it's going to be the same.</p>
<p>Live performances aren't. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an interesting take; I've always found that I prefer the opposite. I don't like &quot;subtle differences&quot; when listening to music that I know, same with theater vs. movies. I'd rather have a polished, well-produced take than a live reenactment with all its imperfections.</p>
<p>But that might be just me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If theater was a viable substitute for film, why doesn't every movie go to theater? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Totally not what I was suggesting...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's a fair point I agree, but again that's not what I was saying. </p>
<p>My point is that live performance has some underrated advantages versus other static mediums. Be it music like in the OP, or for stage performances. </p>
<p>You can't have theater and film go head to head... They're designed differently and are meant to be experienced differently. </p></div>		</li>
