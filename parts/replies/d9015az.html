			<p>Obsidian is virtually structure-less (the rapid cooling from a super heated state prevents conventional molecular organization) unlike metals which are arranged in a specific way at a cellular level. If a practical synthetic obsidian was ever created it would have to be infused with additional elements to provide a more durable structure. Similar to how the carbon in coal is infused with iron to create steel.<br>  </p>		</li>
