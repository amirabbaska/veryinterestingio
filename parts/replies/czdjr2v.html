			<p>But take the penguin example, heres my issue...Antarctica frequently gets to -30f in the winter with some wicked storms. I've never worn a penguin suit before, but I'm fairly sure it wouldn't matter how much fat I built up or how many of my friends also wearing penguin suits I huddled together with - I would 100% die within a couple days of being outside in a -30f antarctic storm in nothing but a penguin suit. What makes them able to survive? </p>		</li>

			<p>Well there are physiological mechanisms that keep animals warm - when their core body temp gets low key mechanisms kick in which try to prevent further cooling. For animals and humans, the <a href="http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/c01/c01links/www.science.mcmaster.ca/biology/4s03/thermoregulation.html" target="_blank">hypothalamus</a> is the body's thermostat. You aren't going to get a single answer because different species have different adaptions to surviving in the cold. There isn't a single way to solve this problem, and the hypothalamus will respond in different ways for different species.<br><br>When cold sensors in your skin are activated your hypothalamus responds by directly or indirectly causing:<br><br>1. Norepinephrine release from sympathetic fibers constricts skin vessels.<br>2. Brown fat (found in infants and some animals) oxidation increases causing thermogenesis.<br>3. Piloerection, occurs which traps air close to skin.<br>4. Epinephrine secretion from adrenal medulla increases thermogenesis. <br>5. A Shivering Center in the hypothalamus is also activated which activates the Brainstem Motor Centers to initiate involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles causing shivering, which generates heat. <br><br><strong>Animal Examples</strong><br><br>Some animals can withstand greater variation in core body temp compared to humans (For example, Camels can survive with a core body temp higher than 41c). Other species will have better behavioural adaptations that kick in when that core body temp drops. (e.g. Humans tend to shiver, other animals will begin to burn brown fat). <br><br>Some animals (e.g. chickadee birds) purposely lower their core body temperature at night so as to not waste extra energy trying to keep warm. Their bodies are physiologically adapted to be able to withstand this drop. Humans cannot withstand even small fluctuations of our core temperature.<br><br>Still other animals have what is essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze_protein#Fish_AFPs" target="_blank">&quot;anti-freeze&quot;</a> circulating in their blood so as to prevent their tissues from freezing. <br><br><strong>Humans &amp; Wearing Animal Skins or Hides</strong><br><br>It isn't just enough that we wear the skin of an animal to keep warm. When we wear their skin we don't suddenly also acquire all those other adaptations that they have to the cold. It isn't just their fur or fat, they have many other adaptions that are highly regulated by their hypothalamus. Unfortunately, we are stuck with our hypothalamus and our physiological responses. Wearing the skin of another animal does not make us suddenly have brown fat to burn, or suddenly allow us tolerate lower core temperatures. Moreover, a skin or pelt is a poor substitution for the actual hide when attached to the animal. Skin is a living tissue, with blood and nerve endings which all help regulate heat loss. When we wear the skin of an animal it does have an insulating effect but it does not have those added benefits of being able to sense and regulate the cold in the way that it did while it was alive and attached to that animal. <br><br>I hope this information helps.<br><br><strong>More Resources</strong><br><br>You might want to read up more on <a href="http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0007.xml" target="_blank">thermoregulation in animals</a> or the <a href="http://www.gfmer.ch/Presentations_En/Pdf/Thermoregulation.pdf" target="_blank">adaptive thermoregulation of different animals</a>.

			<p>&gt; Brown fat (found in infants and some animals) oxidation increases causing thermogenesis.<br><br>From Wikipdia:<br><br>&gt; Further, recent studies using positron emission tomography scanning of adult humans have shown that it is still present in adults in the upper chest and neck (especially paravertebrally). The remaining deposits become more visible (increasing tracer uptake, that is, more metabolically active) with cold exposure, and less visible if an adrenergic beta blocker is given before the scan.<br><br>See also <a href="http://www.joslin.org/diabetes-research/turning-up-the-heat-on-brown-fat.html" target="_blank">http://www.joslin.org/diabetes-research/turning-up-the-heat-on-brown-fat.html</a> which has a nifty graphic near the bottom of where that fat is typically stored.<br><br>I remember seeing an article recently about Eskimos, or people who spend most of their time in an rather cold environment, having much more brown fat.</p>		</li>

			<p>In the giant huddles every penguin gets a chance to be in the center. Sometimes a few penguins will die just because of just how warm it gets in these penguin huddles. Sometimes a few penguins die on the outside of these huddles because of how cold it gets outside the huddle. Either way everyone gets a turn and a few penguins dead is better than all of them.<br><br> You also need to remember that humans are adapted to African climates. The only reason we survive elsewhere is our ability to create tools and clothing and also our ability to teach others and learn from others so that knowledge will get passed on.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sounds ridiculous, but then I was in Norway a month ago: I was <strong>really</strong> not in excessive cold-weather gear. T-shirt, micro-fleece, wool jumper, and a coat (a regular &quot;over a suit&quot; coat you'd see guys go to work in every day in New York or London). Bottom half was boxer shorts, jeans, thermal socks, trainers.<br><br>Basically, then I was in my regular gear plus a microfleece, thermal socks, and a hat/scarf/gloves.<br><br>I went for a walk up a hill and within 5 minutes had removed my gloves and scarf. Within 10 I was overheating, and after 20 minutes I'd stopped to remove my coat+jumper then my fleece, before putting the coat+jumper back on.<br><br>At this point I'm in regular clothes plus thermal socks, and I was still very hot and needing to slow my pace down to stay at a sensible temperature. This wasn't in Antarctica-level temperatures, but it was still pretty damn cold - we were walking through fairly deep snow to a ski slope.<br><br>And that's me, a regular guy, in fairly regular clothes - not an animal who's specifically evolved to combat the cold and stay warm, and I have the ability to shed layers (a penguin doesn't)</p>		</li>

At that temp I'd raise the collar to cover up the neck area which is very exposed normally. If I don't raise it it exposes an area of the chest like a very deep V-neck shirt, which does not even get cold in normal winter weather. For practical reasons I only wear this if it's under -10F, or I'll simply be too warm. </p>		</li>

			<p>I have a sheepskin coat like that guy is talking about. It's crazy warm, way warmer than any of my tech fabrics. <br><br>I don't know about that guy's, but mine is an extremely expensive coat bought from a furrier when we were in New Zealand (G. O. Bowron &amp; Co. Ltd.). Outstanding quality. <br><br>I have other, thinner sheepskins that are nowhere near as warm, so you can't just get whatever sheepskin. I don't know how to tell what makes one better than another, sadly. I didn't buy this coat; my dad did, and it cost more than a thousand dollars in 1998. One notable difference between my coat and every other one I've seen is that it is heavy as fuck and very thick (probably 1.5&quot; if you're not squeezing the fur), and it's not lamb's wool (which is curly; mine is straight and not especially soft).<br><br>Hope that helps you find what you're looking for.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, as a flagger, I find that I can overheat with poor quality clothing, when I move around doing extremely light work. As soon as I stand still, I can't put on enough clothing to keep warm.<br><br>Oddly enough, as a background performer for film, I found the opposite also true. You have to really stand absolutely still to avoid losing heat. When it was cold out, many of my fellow performers started doing light exercises while standing but because they didn't generate enough heat, I could see that they were actually getting even colder. I, on the other hand, was beginning to warm up to a comfortable temperature. If the exercise is too light, then they are effectively fanning their limbs and torsos.<br><br>It's almost as if there is an uncanny valley and and uncanny hill at cold temperatures.<br><br>LPT: when trying to conserve heat, cross your arms on your torso, and curl your fingers up. You want your arms as flat as possible to ensure that as little surface as possible is exposed. This adds insulation to your torso, and reduces heat loss in your arms. I'm planning on inventing a super muff, which can cover the hands up to the elbows, because it makes such a difference.<br><br>LPT: when trying to conserve heat, keep the inner back of your legs together. This reduces heat loss in your legs.<br><br>[edit: last word; phrase to clarify]</p>		</li>

			<p>A polar bear's fur is not white, but clear. Any time it is in sunlight, the light can pass through the fur and be absorbed by the skin. The fur insulates against the transfer of kinetic heat, but allows the incoming radiant heat.<br><br>Often in nature you will find similar mechanisms used for seemingly opposite reasons.

			<p>This is just supposition based on my own non-expert understanding but I assume that any increase in the risk of overheating would be limited by the fact that humans and other animals can adjust their temperature (sweating or panting, changing behavior to limit activity or find cool areas, etc.). Add in that high melanin content produces a meaningful reduction in the health problems that come from sun exposure and overheating ends up being a small cost attached to a big benefit.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, because fat alone isn't usually enough to ward off the cold. As I said, animals will have a number of adaptations that work together to protect the animal from hypothermia, frostbite etc. Humans also have a number of strategies. Unfortunately for us, we accumulate a lot of white fat...which isn't that great for heat production. Other animals have significantly more brown fat, and they burn this in order to produce sufficient body heat to survive. Fat isn't just an insulator - it can also be used as a fuel.</p>		</li>
