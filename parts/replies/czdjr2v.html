			<div class="markdown"><p>But take the penguin example, heres my issue...Antarctica frequently gets to -30f in the winter with some wicked storms. I've never worn a penguin suit before, but I'm fairly sure it wouldn't matter how much fat I built up or how many of my friends also wearing penguin suits I huddled together with - I would 100% die within a couple days of being outside in a -30f antarctic storm in nothing but a penguin suit. What makes them able to survive? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there are physiological mechanisms that keep animals warm - when their core body temp gets low key mechanisms kick in which try to prevent further cooling. For animals and humans, the <a href="http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/c01/c01links/www.science.mcmaster.ca/biology/4s03/thermoregulation.html" target="_blank">hypothalamus</a> is the body's thermostat. You aren't going to get a single answer because different species have different adaptions to surviving in the cold. There isn't a single way to solve this problem, and the hypothalamus will respond in different ways for different species.</p>
<p>When cold sensors in your skin are activated your hypothalamus responds by directly or indirectly causing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Norepinephrine release from sympathetic fibers constricts skin vessels.</li>
<li>Brown fat (found in infants and some animals) oxidation increases causing thermogenesis.</li>
<li>Piloerection, occurs which traps air close to skin.</li>
<li>Epinephrine secretion from adrenal medulla increases thermogenesis. </li>
<li>A Shivering Center in the hypothalamus is also activated which activates the Brainstem Motor Centers to initiate involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles causing shivering, which generates heat. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Animal Examples</strong></p>
<p>Some animals can withstand greater variation in core body temp compared to humans (For example, Camels can survive with a core body temp higher than 41c). Other species will have better behavioural adaptations that kick in when that core body temp drops. (e.g. Humans tend to shiver, other animals will begin to burn brown fat). </p>
<p>Some animals (e.g. chickadee birds) purposely lower their core body temperature at night so as to not waste extra energy trying to keep warm. Their bodies are physiologically adapted to be able to withstand this drop. Humans cannot withstand even small fluctuations of our core temperature.</p>
<p>Still other animals have what is essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze_protein#Fish_AFPs" target="_blank">&quot;anti-freeze&quot;</a> circulating in their blood so as to prevent their tissues from freezing. </p>
<p><strong>Humans &amp; Wearing Animal Skins or Hides</strong></p>
<p>It isn't just enough that we wear the skin of an animal to keep warm. When we wear their skin we don't suddenly also acquire all those other adaptations that they have to the cold. It isn't just their fur or fat, they have many other adaptions that are highly regulated by their hypothalamus. Unfortunately, we are stuck with our hypothalamus and our physiological responses. Wearing the skin of another animal does not make us suddenly have brown fat to burn, or suddenly allow us tolerate lower core temperatures. Moreover, a skin or pelt is a poor substitution for the actual hide when attached to the animal. Skin is a living tissue, with blood and nerve endings which all help regulate heat loss. When we wear the skin of an animal it does have an insulating effect but it does not have those added benefits of being able to sense and regulate the cold in the way that it did while it was alive and attached to that animal. </p>
<p>I hope this information helps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the giant huddles every penguin gets a chance to be in the center. Sometimes a few penguins will die just because of just how warm it gets in these penguin huddles. Sometimes a few penguins die on the outside of these huddles because of how cold it gets outside the huddle. Either way everyone gets a turn and a few penguins dead is better than all of them.</p>
<p>You also need to remember that humans are adapted to African climates. The only reason we survive elsewhere is our ability to create tools and clothing and also our ability to teach others and learn from others so that knowledge will get passed on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to explain it with blood vessels because blood always has to make a return trip to the core. </p>
<p>The goal is for the bird to keep its feet warm enough to not freeze. So it runs hot core-blood in the opposite direction of cold feet-blood in blood vessels very close to each other. This lets heat exchange happen rapidly resulting in warm blood traveling in each direction. Blood warm enough going out to keep the feet thawed, and blood warm enough going in that it can be reheated easily. </p>
<p>Warm climate ungulates (i.e. Gazelles) have a mess of blood vessels in their brain called a carotid rete that does the opposite; it cools the brain. They take cooler nose-blood and run it by hot brain-blood resulting in cool enough blood going in as to not fry their brains, and in the opposite, warm brain-blood going out to their faces to cool further. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The counter-current exchange prevents <a href="http://blogs.britannica.com/2011/01/penguin-feet-avoiding-frostbite-in-the-antarctic/" target="_blank">frostbite from taking hold</a>...or in simpler words prevents the feet from falling off.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the blood vessels running to and from the feet of penguins are organized to facilitate countercurrent heat exchange. Arteries carrying warm blood toward the feet run alongside veins carrying cool blood up from the feet. Some of the heat from the blood in the arteries is transferred to the blood in the veins. Thus, cool blood moving toward the heart is warmed, which is important for maintaining core body temperature. Warm blood moving toward the feet is cooled, which helps penguins keep their feet at temperatures just above freezing. This strategy minimizes the amount of energy needed for keeping their feet warm while also preventing frostbite.&quot; </p>
<p>The same principle applies for <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/article/no-frostbite-dogs" target="_blank">dogs</a> - they also have a counter-current heat exchange in their paws which prevents frostbite. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is indeed incorrect. The counter-current actually makes their feet colder, which is good because as a result they lose less heat through their feet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Such systems do exist, but they're pretty rare outside of larger commercial buildings due to the cost payback.  Most houses are not even required to have fresh air intake.  You rely on operable windows.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/ubkpc3sc0ywpnzoebscm.gif" target="_blank">contercurrent heat exchange</a></p>
<p>I feel the visual is a great aid.</p>
<p>The heat from the warm blood on top goes into the slightly cooler blood on the bottom before losing a tiny fraction to the outside environment (on the right). The cooler blood is always a tiny bit cooler than the warm blood from the heart, so heat always flows to it, rather than just being flushed through the system and having hot blood relatively exposed to cold environments. It's basically the opposite of blushing/flushing.</p>
<p>Fun fact- lots of arctic animals do this, not just birds. All kinds of fast swimming fish in cold environments, like sharks and swordfish.</p>
