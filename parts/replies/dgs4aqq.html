The idea behind the scientific method is to try to not let your bias's affect your ability to learn about the world; To verify what is true about the universe. These things are true regardless of how one feels about them. </p>
<p>When Bill Nye says people don't agree with Climate Change tend to have Cognitive Dissonance. What he is saying is that some people already don't believe in Climate change, and when they are shown evidence which supports climate change they dismiss it and the authority figure who presented it. Instead of examining the evidence and modifying their world view. In science if there is compelling evidence that says a previous scientific view is incorrect. It's thrown out in favor of new ideas, and new tests to verify if those ideas are correct.  Politics shouldn't have anything to do with this. With Science it should be all about the evidence, and scientific method.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd also go further to say that a major skill you pick up in a STEM education is the ability to vet your sources properly. </p>
<p>I have a background in cell biology and worked in metastatic cancer research. There's a plethora of BS sites out there spouting cancer cures. Something I've noticed is that laymen often have trouble figuring out a legitimate source from a sketchy one.</p>
<p>One personal example that comes to mind happened here on Reddit. I forgot the context, but the person was arguing a scientifically implausible point and linked to a paper on the PubMed site (URL <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</a>) claiming that his point is valid because a NIH-funded study backs him up.</p>
<p>The problem is PubMed is a repository for biomed articles. It simply hosts an online copy of the paper. A publication on PubMed isn't anymore endorsed by the NIH than Congress endorses any of the books in the Library of Congress. It's something any third year biology undergrad should know but something not many people outside of biology would know. The paper itself originated from China and had dubious private sector funding. </p>
<p>IMO this is a major issue with science literacy today. Plenty of people read things online and without the proper background, believe questionable sources as fact.</p></div>		</li>
