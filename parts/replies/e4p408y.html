			<div class="markdown"><p>The obvious next question is &quot;what about Neanderthal Y-DNA?&quot; The linked article theorizes that Neanderthal male and Sapiens female couplings might have had fertile daughters but sterile sons, therefore Neanderthal Y-DNA would be wiped out while still allowing the autosomal Neanderthal DNA we observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y chromosomes are passed through meiosis, which mixes up your genes. mtDNA doesn't undergo the same &quot;mixing up‚Äùprocesses during meiosis that nuclear DNA DOES. </p>
<p>Actually, only one is the 4 cells that results from meiosis of a single sex cell in females is actually an egg. The other three donate their organelles, cytoplasm, and other good stuff to the viable egg, and themselves become polar bodies. So the zygote ONLY has organelles from the Mom, which is why the mitochondrial DNA is passed along from mother to daughter to granddaughter, without very much change.</p></div>		</li>
