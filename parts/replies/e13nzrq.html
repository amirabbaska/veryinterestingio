			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm that here in the UK it's pretty uncommon to drink ice cold water - generally you'll see people add ice to their soft drinks in a pub or bar in the summer - especially since it's not the warmest here! Drinking hot tea with a meal, I'd say, is more of a quirk than common, except breakfast and tea/snack time. From personal experience, everyone I know here drinks tap water with their meals: a bit colder than room temperature but not icey. </p></div>		</li>
