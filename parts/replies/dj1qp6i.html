<p>It just seems like an impractical material seeing how difficult it is to keep clean compared to rubber or plastic.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah when I used to clean cars, I <em>hated</em> work vehicles with vinyl (or whatever the material is) floors. Took fucking forever and they never really came out all that nice. Carpet can be shampooed or even dyed in extreme cases. Only benefit I see to vinyl floors is that in work vehicles the carpet might get worn out in spots, whereas the vinyl wouldn't. </p>
<p>I should explain that I was detailing cars for an auto sales lot, so &quot;good enough&quot; isn't good enough. You try to make used vehicles look as unused as possible, so hosing and scrubbing them isn't gonna be enough. You're not trying to make things look clean, you're trying to make things look like they've never been dirty, and that kind of flooring made it really hard to pull off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree.  Having a work truck with vinyl flooring as my daily, I don't ever want to go back. </p>
<p>Easier to clean not only on mud but on a day to day basis, I can take a small broom and clean it up in about 30 seconds every week during the truck wash. </p>
<p>I don't worry about floor mats moving around. I don't worry about liquids. I don't worry about just about anything. It ain't going to stain and it easy to soak up.</p>
<p>There is a reason <a href="http://www.weathertech.com/floorliner-digitalfit/" target="_blank">these</a> are a thing and they basically turn a carpeted vehicle into a vinyl one.</p>
<p>But I don't pretend my vehicle is some trophy possession that should stay in show room quality. There are worn areas, small tears, patches on the seats, well worm handles, etc.  To me, it's like a well used baseball cap. Obviously not new, but comfortable and a statement in its worn state. The truck is a tool and vinyl is a more useful floor for that tool than carpet.</p>
<p>Its honestly a feature I want so much that I won't consider a truck without it.  More important than power windows, an infotainment whatever, or keyless entry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely the answer. More and more, car makers are trying to make their cars feel nicer by putting soft touch materials wherever they can afford to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like he said noise reduction. Carpet and the backing on the carpet absorb the sounds coming from outside the car. People want quiet cars, they don't have to scream at their passengers or crank the radio up to hear over the road noise. </p>
<p>Carpet with padding on the back are a cheap effective sound reducer.</p>
<p>Ride in a car sometime without the carpet in, there is a lot of road noise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate answer (at least the first part). My father was an acoustic engineer for an automotive company. He designed carpet interiors to control the noise and vibration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noise reduction can be had by spraying the underside of the vehicle... carpeting is not necessary to do this. There's also material for the interior -- look up 'dynamat'. It's something often used in trunks for people who want to put huge audio systems into their car so they can play terrible music at very high volumes in it <em>without</em> being giant dickbags to everyone for blocks in every direction. </p></div>		</li>
