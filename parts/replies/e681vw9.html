			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada where I work we are called Power Engineers. There's a class system from 5th class up to 1st class certification. 1st class is the highest. Basically these ratings are for what power levels of plants we can work in and supervise. Each level has a series of exams to pass and have work hours signed off. There are also 2 year diploma programs at tech schools to get your 3rd class ticket and a technologist diploma which a lot of employers want. </p>
<p>If you live in the USA I'm not entirely sure how it works but I think as an engineer you can apply to operator jobs to work in plants. I would put a focus on studying thermodynamics, water treatment chemistry, process systems and  electrical systems as well. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>
