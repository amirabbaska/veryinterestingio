			<div class="markdown"><p>The question to ask is, 12 of those out of how many? One should not be confused by such outliers into thinking that the weapons are not exceedingly deadly. Yes, statistically a few people would be expected to survive at such a distance without long-term effects. But most did not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that most ICBM's are a bunch of smaller bombs for higher level of success.  That means the yield is much lower.  That also means that if it hits Seattle and I Live in Tacoma, I should be alright if I do the right things immediately.</p>
<p>First, if you see a bright flash, close your eyes and get behind a concrete building ASAP.  Then get underground if possible.  After shockwave and fireball, then take your handy iodine tabs in your first aid kit and get as far away from Tacoma as fast as possible and avoid the winds that blow towards Mount Rainer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lower than... what? ICBM warheads are typically in the hundreds of kiloton range. Which is to say, considerably higher than the weapon used on Hiroshima (15 kt). Russian ICBMs are 800 kt. Even North Korea's ICBM is probably 150 kt, which is to say, 100X the Hiroshima bomb (which only translates into being twice as damaging, but still).</p>
<p>I don't know what your imagined scenario is, but <a href="https://imgur.com/gxemWqX" target="_blank">here's what the US thought a possible exchange with Russia would look like in the early 1990s as relevant to Washington State</a>, if they used targeting criteria like we do. Tacoma does... not so well. I only bring this up to point out that our imagination about where a nuclear power might aim a weapon may not correspond with reality.</p>
<p>You should also probably know that all expert advice on this at the moment suggests you <em>don't</em> get into your car, but rather get into your <em>house</em>. Getting stuck on a freeway will leave you more exposed than taking good shelter for a few days. For what it's worth.</p></div>		</li>
