			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! My fist ever AMA answer. I think systems neuroscience is exploding right now because of a lot of new tools. If you have been following the BRAIN initiative news coming out of the White House, the goal has been to develop new ways to study the nervous system, and many of them have enabled us to study neurons as large ensembles, rather than just one at a time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add onto this, if you find the idea of systems level neuroscience interesting, look into techniques such as TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), repetitive TMS, and other methods of probing these systems. If you want to study neuroscience but also have an interest in rehab, movement disorders, or plasticity, it's a great way to go!</p>
