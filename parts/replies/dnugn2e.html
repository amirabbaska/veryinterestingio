			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find beautiful about translation (using another top comment's &quot;chicken&quot; example), is that language seems to be tied more to ideas than literal objects for each instance of a word. So the translation of chicken for them at the time could have meant any flightless, farmable bird that they had available. So it might not necessarily mean &quot;chicken&quot; in the exact sense that we mean. </p>
<p>Language is a very abstract concept, but the more you look into it, it's fascinating the patterns and similarities that come about in fully unrelated languages from cultures that never met across history. Zipf's law is one of my favorites, and I recommend everybody watch the Vsauce video on YouTube about Zipf's law if you're interested in language patterns and some of the tools we use to help understand/relate languages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of present tenses in non-english languages that English does not use.</p>
<p>In Romance languages there is the Subjunctive tense which expresses an element of uncertainty. &quot;I hope you <em>are</em> okay&quot;. In English we use a subjunctive mood, but in romance languages you would conjugate <em>are</em> differently to explicitly mark this.</p>
<p>In Turkic languages they have a special tense for hearsay or second hand knowledge &quot;A friend told me that this <em>is</em> the best restaurant&quot;.</p>
<p>I don't know how the Egyptian second tenses work, though a brief read suggested that it might be to empathise subject object distinctions, or temporal order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, subjunctive is a mood and not a tense. The difference isn’t temporal, it’s related to the speaker’s knowledge about the facts. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think English has some of this as well, but it's an altered past tense instead of present. (e.g., &quot;If it were me&quot; vs. &quot;If it was me&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuff like this happens with contemporary languages as well. For example, common (well-studied) Quechua dialects have evidentials that we were not aware of until recently; linguists thought they were random vowels to aid pronunciation or something.</p></div>		</li>
