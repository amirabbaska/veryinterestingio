<p>Someone should make an app that can tell you how smooth the emitted light from an LED is so you could avoid purchasing the bad ones. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It also affects color perception, and cheap LEDa tend to be low CRI (color rendering index, or how much of the color spectrum they emit), which means they produce above normal amounts of blue light, which can negatively impact sleep patterns if used in evening hours, by tricking the brain that the sun is still up and messing with circadian rhythm.  Blue light also scatters more in the retina, which can in turn cause more eye strain.</p></div>		</li>
