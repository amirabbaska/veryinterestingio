<p>The observable universe is a sphere, because all light comes from all angles equally. From that alone we can determine that the universe is at least a bit larger than the observable universe. Even assuming we could move our sphere of vision towards the edge, we'd first have to figure out how to find said edge, which wouldn't be doable because the universe would seem infinite ... <em>:breathes in:</em> ... because our sphere of vision will always stay a sphere of vision unless there is no wrap-around, which would distort it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If another Earth 2.0 was 1 billion light years away, would their cosmic background extend 1 billion light years farther in that direction? and also would it be less 1 billion beyond Earth? If that's the case wouldn't we hypothetically just not be able to see the stars that are going to repeat because of the hyper torus shape? We could be a spec of visibility inside a much much larger shaped universe, no? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>i don´t understand how they could possibly read it out of the data. it is extremely likely that we are in some part of space where we´d not even get close to noticing.</p>
<p>though i wonder... if it´s toris shaped, what is in the middle of the torus, which is a part outside of the universe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think alot of time with questions like  these, its best to tackle them by saying, &quot;Ok, Could we do/observe/make X if we could account for everything else that would interfere with X besides the effect we're concerned about&quot;. In this case, &quot;Could we observe duplicate images of stars wrapping around a hypertoroidal universe if we had a magical, infinitely powerful telescope to see it and infinite time to wait for it to happen&quot;. These kind of questions are important because, if we didn't ask them, we would never dream of things that require more than one breakthrough to be realized and no one would ever invent anything because after one innovation it would still seem impossible.</p></div>		</li>
