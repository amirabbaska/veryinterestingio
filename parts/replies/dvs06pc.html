			<div class="markdown"><p>And that same effect is what can allow a stun gun, or camera flash, etc to run off 1.5v AA batteries. By letting current flow through a 'wire' (inductor, but same idea), cutting that flow off abruptly, and then redirecting the resulting spike through a 'one-way valve'. You can end up with higher voltage out than in, though it's worth pointing out that we're not talking about free power - the output voltage has less current behind it, unless you store it up over time first.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, what you're describing is a boost converter used to step the voltage up. I believe most of the time incandescent camera flashes step the voltage up with a boost converter or transformer then store the energy in a capacitor. LED flashes probably don't need to do that, but I don't actually know.</p></div>		</li>
