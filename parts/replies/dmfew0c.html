			<div class="markdown"><p>Then, if we wanted to know how much energy we need to burn to return to 310K, we take 100.2 kg <em> 4.184 J/gK (1 cal) </em> .15K = 15.03 kcal, or about 0.2 Oreos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked that out another way and got a different answer which has me confused. 1kCal is the energy required to heat 1 litre of water by 1K, and you're basically trying to heat 0.2L of water by 37K, so shouldn't the energy required be 37*0.2=7.4kCal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>7.4 calories still seems alot per 0.2l. I drink 6 litres a day, so if it was all cold enough that would be 30 * 7.4 = 222 calories, that could be anywhere from 5-15% of someone's daily intake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>.2 oreos. That was the only helpful relatable figure I grabbed on to.  But seriously,   Can you each just .2 of an Oreo?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>15kcal seems like a lot just to normalise body temperature from a glass of ice water. It's the equivalent of running for a couple of minutes isn't it? My body definitely doesn't feel the same amount of fatigue after those 2 activities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's negligibly small because the amount of water in your equation is also negligibly small. If you upped that to 1 liter, which is not hard to imagine, you're getting close to a drop of close to one degree, which for human physiology <em>is</em> a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your numbers err on the wrong side. Drinking a liter is totally doable, and most people weigh a bit less than 100 kg. So let's multiply by another factor of say 7. And now we have about a 1 degree drop. That is a significant amount. For example, you could use that to fake being well even if your temperature is within the zone that indicates a fever.</p></div>		</li>
