			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for this detailed response! This is so much interesting information. I find it interesting how sometimes music can break the cultural barrier with its beat/rhythm. For example one of my favorite songs is a Japanese song from an anime, I don't understand it but at the same time I feel the emotional depth of the song (he's basically talking about how he has become a monster and doesn't recognize himself anymore.) </p>
<p>There's also songs that people find annoying that I love, for example there &quot;The Fox&quot; by Ylvis and &quot;Surfin Bird&quot; by The Trashmen to name a few. Is there a point where our brains suddenly think &quot;Hey this is so bad it's great!&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to it: We <em>are</em> born with a preference for familiar rhythms (like a heart beat), voices and music.
Even babies growing up in cultures that commonly use very complex rhythms in music first start out liking a simple 2:1 beat. </p>
<p>Later on people like music that has a similar tempo to their own heartbeat, and music often mimics not only in tone but also in speed the emotion it wants to bring across. So that catchy tune might actually mostly be a catchy beat.</p>
