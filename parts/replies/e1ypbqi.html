<p>No, what happened was the wake(?) caused the pilot to lose control and the airplane where I guess the equivalent of the Secretary of State (secretario de gobernación) Mouriño was traveling plummeted down in a busy neighborhood in the middle of Mexico City. During rush hour. Luckily no one below was killed.</p>
<p>You'll probably see it on the next season of el chapo, the conspiracy theorists love to claim it was a narco hit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I was about to say the same thing! Lol that’s how gossip starts, my uncle was the chief forensic officer in Mexico City when it happened. I saw the bodies and it was gruesome, one of the persons in the plane his bones left his body rendering him a human flesh suit, the flight attendant feet and hands were reunited because same nail polish on both... the secretary was burnt like totally burnt like only o e third of him remained</p></div>		</li>
