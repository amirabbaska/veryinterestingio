			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is what's called in the copy protection business the &quot;analogue hole&quot;. It refers to the simple fact that at some point you have to turn the thing into something people can watch or hear, and to people using that fact to simply recapture that data and re-encode it.</p>
<p>The obvious example is just sticking a patch cable from your line out port to your line in port to record music off Spotify or something similar. Of course you don't even have to enter the analogue realm for that, you can easily do it digitally. Same with screen recorders and streaming video, though stuff like HDCP makes that harder. But it can never be truly impossible; that's the nature of the analogue hole.</p></div>		</li>
