			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how MRI scanners work! A current is induced in a superconductor which is cooled with liquid helium. This produces a static magnetic field of usually 3 Tesla. This is why the magnet in an MRI scanner is ALWAYS on - Electricity is applied to induce the magnetic field only once when the scanner is first turned on, then it is constantly maintained with cooling. Without cooling, an MRI scanner would require basically as much electricity as a small city to maintain such a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field can only be turned off by quenching. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not yet. That's a holy grail of physics research. Very few materials are superconductive above -250 Celsius or so. It's a major event whenever a new superconducting material is discovered that works above -200 C. The record is -70 C for hydrogen sulfide superconductors, but they only work at that temperature when compressed to astronomically high pressures.</p></div>		</li>
