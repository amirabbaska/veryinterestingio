<p>HBO and Netflix do not have the same models, and that is important to understand. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>HBO has been purchasable as a standalone for long enough now that this claim isn't really relevant anymore. Even before when HBO was completely tied to a cable subscription... HBO is owned by Time Warner. So a cable subscription (with added HBO) was still paying Time Warner for cable and then Time Warner again for HBO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Netflix has direct subscribers who pull data (videos and playlist) directly from their servers. By categorizing all content and tracking viewer time in each content, they can know what kinds of things you like. This is the same as amazon being able to suggest things to you based on how you use the website and what you actually buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing what you like has very little to do with what would make you cancel your Netflix subscription.</p>
<p>Let's say Netflix subscribers like plot elements A B C and D the most. They can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a show with A and B</li>
<li>Buy a show with B and C</li>
<li>Make a show with A and C</li>
<li>Make a show with C and D</li>
</ul>
<p>etc etc etc</p>
<p>The popularity of most shows is based on chance and feeling. When buying the rights to a show, you're getting a safe bet. It has been on TV, you know if it was popular or not, etc. When making a show, you could put in A B C and D, and still have it fail for random reasons.</p>
<p>Not only that, but a lot of people like having Netflix content that is bland. For example, I will often put on That 70s Show as kind of background noise. I've seen it before and don't care about actually watching it, but may want something to pay attention to while I read and post on reddit. A new show from Netflix won't give me that.</p>
<p>If Netflix made none of their original shows... I'd still have Netflix. So, to that end, Netflix has wasted their money by making shows for me, because it did not change my subscription status.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everything can fail from random reasons. The point is to try to find the things that are less likely to fail. Sure knowing that people like A, B, C and D (knowing something like that is huge though) doesnt guarantee you making a super succesful show, but if they're concentrating on A-D they're gonna strike more gold than trying E-Z, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HBO has HBO Go and HBO NOW, the latter of which is direct-to-consumer and competes for your $ against netflix. Their main revenue stream, is, of course, through cable subscriptions, where HBO gets paid even if nobody tunes in. The latter two streaming options give HBO much more data about what users like and want, just like netflix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge selection bias for which customers do or do not use HBO Go / Now, though, so you can only get so much info from that. For instance, if they just use that data, they'd end up skewing their content toward a younger audience than they otherwise should. So, the real issue is combining the more traditional numbers for who's watching on TV with the Internet numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few nits to pick here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HBO makes the bulk of their money by selling content to MSOs, not subscriptions to users -- their subscriber revenue model is only just starting to blossom (and only by virtue of HBO developing their own capacity to deliver content over the top, an entirely new business model for them).</p>
</li>
<li>The MSOs tell HBO what it's most popular content is, by virtue of how they negotiate with HBO. Neilsen and other measures definitely enter into it, but the bulk of the analysis comes by way of the MSOs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider Cox, with 10 million subscribers. They negotiate with HBO the right to vend HBO's content to their 10 million subs -- HBO doesn't actually care how much uptake Cox gets across their 10 million users, as they still get their biggest chunk of cash from the content agreement. For HBO to go to a pure subscriber-only over-the-top model, they'd have to get enough subscriber income to offset what they would lose by alienating the MSOs.</p></div>		</li>
