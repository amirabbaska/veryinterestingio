			<div class="markdown"><p>When the Hillsborough disaster (football stadium crush, 96 dead Liverpool FC fans) happened, the sun had a front page headline &quot;the truth&quot; in which they accused the Liverpool fans of causing the crush and robbing from the dying and pissing on the dead etc. It's been boycotted in this city ever since, with on going and successful campaigns to have it stopped being sold anywhere in Liverpool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a &quot;newspaper&quot; that's saturated with racist bollocks, right wing idiocy and numerous scandals, one of which being the hacking of a dead girls (and plenty of other people's) mobile phones to listen to their private voice mails. </p>
<p>The biggest, and perhaps most disgusting scandal was their coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 lives were lost and 750 individuals were injured. I would love to go into more detail but it makes me so angry. There are plenty of articles online in which you can get information, but the &quot;newspaper&quot; is all but banned in and around the North West of the UK (Merseyside in particular) due to the blatent lies it printed, even some high level police officers fed the lies. </p></div>		</li>
