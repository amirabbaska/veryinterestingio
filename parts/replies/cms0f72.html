			<div class="markdown"><p>As a senior in my universities geology program, I'm curious the steps you took to being a hydrogeologist. I'm assuming of course that you have an MS in hydrogeology, but did you outright transition from a BS to a.graduate program, or were you working in environmental work after undergraduate and eventually undergo the MS? </p>
<p>I ask because I've either decided on o&amp;g or environmental career paths, and they're absolute opposites. Just trying to get as much info as possible from geologists that pop up on reddit

			<div class="markdown"><p>Linear programming is also huge in optimization because in many situations, the optimum lies on a boundary condition.  So you can model extremely complex systems very simply using linear algebra.  Take for example crude oil processing.  Crude oil is comprised of hundreds or thousands of different hydrocarbons, which can be separated and chemically altered to make thousands or hundreds of thousands of different end products, each having a different price on the market.  How do you reconcile how much octane, or jet fuel, or diesel, or blends of different hydrocarbons you should produce and at what purity given a changing market for each product?  Linear algebra can typically give you a reasonable solution.   Petroleum companies will certainly use more complex algorithms, but linear algebra can give you something to check your math with and is much much much computationally simpler. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most likely they don't, actually, they just use complicated linear algebra. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, just about any kind of simulation will boil down to a linear algebra problem. At my job I'm sitting solving equations of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions of unknowns. This would have been completely impossible to do without good iterative methods, proper preconditioners, eigenvalue analysis, etc.</p>
<p>I would be hard pressed to find a field of mathematics that has more relevance than linear algebra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem in an Intro to Linear Algebra course is that they don't teach you about this. All I learned there was how to find a basis for a subspace, RREF your matrices, and maybe solve a 3 equation, 3 unknowns, system of equations. It wasn't until I took graduate linear algebra where we actually programmed iterative methods (Newton-Raphson, etc.) where linear algebra made a lot more sense and useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why we no longer include the Math Department's linear class in the computer science degree.  Students would come out able to do any proof you asked for, but they had no clue about how they were used.  Linear Algebra is of massive importance in Computer Science, so we now teach or own course in it.  Graphics have already been mentioned, but graph operations, operations research, and  simulation and modeling are all really just special applications of Linear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's awesome and I'm jealous.  I took a math department linear algebra when I was getting a masters in experimental psychology.  I kind of understood how I'd use it in statistics or cognitive modelling, but only in the broadest sense.  Wasn't very helpful for me, but nevertheless, a very cool subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most irritating situations in my college education occurred this semester. I'm just about to graduate, but had to take a Biology general education course. There was a girl in there who was the epitome of a pseudo-intellectual hipster. She always had to comment on everything and never would accept the possibility of her being wrong.</p>
<p>Learning FORTRAN in my computational methods courses I also had to learn linear algebra. I had already finished all the comp. courses when I took biology and there was another engineering student in the biology class who was inquiring about the work load. I was trying to explain the linear algebra portion to him and this girl walked by us and after hearing me say linear algebra, in the most pompous, condescending way possible she said &quot;y=mx+b&quot;. It makes me laugh and furious to this day thinking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I went through my university's math program, Linear Algebra was the first 300-level course math majors took. (We split from engineers and other non-majors after multivariable calc. We went to 3xx, they went to calc-4, applied ODE/PDE and other linear stuff. Calc-4 was literally not open to math majors.)</p>
<p>The material we covered was basically what you mentioned. It wasn't a very in-depth course, but it was a pre-req for literally every other 300-level math course. They basically set it up so that you had to take exactly one course that semester, and it had to be linear algebra. Because it was the first class that was all about rigorous proof.</p>
<p>Since then, they added a class that they call &quot;Foundations of higher mathematics&quot; and its focus is elementary set theory and logic, with a focus on proofs.</p>
<p>I really hope they've made linear algebra more interesting if it's not really Intro to Proofs and Also Here Are Some Matrices.</p></div>		</li>
