			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of your immune system, there's little difference. However, the combined vaccines allow you to be vaccinated for multiple things with one needle stick and (potentially) reduces the number of times a patient needs to be seen. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4805.pdf" target="_blank">Here's on old but relevant explanation from the CDC (see pg. 2).</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the issue of scheduling. You would only want to combine vaccines that are supposed to be administered at the same ages and with the same number of doses. You can see <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf" target="_blank">That the overall scheduling is highly complex and there's not many vaccines where all doses are administered at the same times</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a pharmaceutical-technological reason: Not every vaccine needs the same adjuvants, and some may be incompatible with others or the vaccines themselves might be incompatible. This would have to be tested for each component individually or the whole list of ingredients had to be adapted, which is quite an effort (and probably not worth it money-wise, for the company).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunodominance. </p>
<p>For a vaccination to be effective, parts of the pathogen called Antigens must be displayed on the surface on specific cells. These antigens can then trigger the production of a memory response.</p>
<p>Antigens bind with different strengths, and therefore compete with each other. You inject too many antigens and only the highest bindings ones will be displayed at the cost of the others. the MMR vaccine is a small miracle that they've balance it all to work.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of combining vaccines is that it allows you to vaccinate for multiple diseases with a single injection rather than 3, and anybody who has worked with kids knows why this is a good idea.</p>
<p>It would be great if everything could be combined into one supervaccine injection, but most vaccinations consist of a course of 2-3 injections at specific intervals.  The intervals vary depending on the vaccine, so there's really no way to put them all on one schedule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really related to your question, but one of the reasons Wakefield faked his study correlating vaccines to autism is because he wanted to release his own vaccine that was a single measles vax so he could profit from it.  He was also paid by lawyers so they could sue the pharma company that created the MMR vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
