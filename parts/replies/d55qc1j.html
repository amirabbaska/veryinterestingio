			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading an article in I think it was Science magazine. I think the report was from Brookhaven Laboratory. The hypothesis was that the flashes of light that astronauts see up in space are due to cosmic rays. It's cherenkov radiation, like a sonic boom, due to a charged particle going faster than a medium's speed of light. In this case the medium is the vitreous humor inside the astronauts eye balls. </p>
<p>So the top manager of the accelerator there stuck his head into the proton beam. yup, flashes of light! Hypothesis verified!</p>
<p>I read this in about 1979. The article was probably a few years old by then.</p></div>		</li>
