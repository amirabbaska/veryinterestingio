			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you tons! I understand much better now. for the Nielsen box, isn't that a little overestimating? it seems inaccurate for them to assume that since one family is watching a show, another 9,999 are viewing too. obviously they can't have a huge sample size but how can they accurately assess such a number without overstating or overestimating? it seems like a wide gap between 1 and 10,000. also what kind of families are targeted by Nielsen? and why? and also, say for the &quot;Blackwater&quot; episode of Game of Thrones, which they spent 9 million on, who fronts the money? how much is the networks contribution, and what or who comprises the rest?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as the Nielsen questions, yes it's a very shitty system.  It worked better when the average American household had only 1 TV, there were only 3 major networks, and TV stations went &quot;off air&quot; after hours.  These days it's just so thoroughly entrenched that it's hard to get rid of.  The entire financial side of TV is built around them, so it would be like forcing an entire country to change languages instantly over night.  </p>
<p>With shows like Game of Thrones the network can spend a fortune on the show, because it's a big series.  It pulls in subscribers (I personally know multiple people with HBO Go subscriptions purely to watch that show).  It also pulls in Emmy's and ultimately raises the profile of the network.  HBO's next big show will have an instant audience because people think &quot;it's on HBO, it's got to be good&quot; because of their history with shows like The Sopranos and Game of Thrones.  </p>
<p>Ultimately the network is paying for big episodes like that.  HBO can afford to spend the big money, for all of the reasons I listed.  The production company on the other hand is much smaller, and needs the cash.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggback on Nielsen here. It's even worse than explained. </p>
<p>The set/people meters (the boxes referenced) exist in less than half of Nielsen's 210 measured markets. And the majority of those involve guess work for what is called &quot;Viewer Assignment&quot;. That is, not only what is being watched on the television but who is watching it. This is very important because Nielsen stratas their data into demographics (eg. Males 18-49). </p>
<p>The remaining markets are measured the old fashioned way with Diaries. These are literal journals, separated into 15 minute intervals over one week, and given one per person per household. The participants are meant to actively log their viewing habits. However, in practice they are usually filled out after the fact with guess work (for example, a person who usually watches CNN in the evening would most likely log that they were watching CNN every evening when they did not on Wednesday for whatever reason). </p>
<p>To their credit, Nielsen does A LOT of complicated stuff to reduce the standard error of their ratings and are very open about the potential errors. Their methodology is also certified on a yearly basis by an independent entity, the Media Ratings Council. </p>
<p>And really, there is no &quot;good&quot; alternative to produce ratings for television (or radio for that matter). Another company, ComScore, has teamed up with cable providers to anonymously collect viewing habits of their subscribers. This mitigates the human error, but has big flaws. They can only report what was being watched, not by whom, so there is no way to do ratings by demographic. Also, the fact that only cable subscriber data is collected introduces an unavoidable socio-econmic bias to your sample. </p>

<p>Oh damn. That would explain why Netflix is trying so hard to make things different. Whether it succeeds in the next few years will have to be seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not very accurate - but it's more accurate than you might think. Even though the panel is skewed, you know how it's skewed and can correct for that by looking at the demographics of the people who watched the show and scale that up to the total population, and so forth.</p>
<p>Obviously you're never going to be able to say &quot;exactly 7,345,902 people watched this show&quot;, but you can say &quot;about 7 million people watched this, compared to the approximate 3 million, 2 million and 500,000 people who were watching the other main channels at the same time&quot;. (Typical numbers for the UK - in America they're presumably a lot larger.)</p>
<p>Even if the assumed error is really high, the 7 million show clearly beat the 3 million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having know a couple software developers who worked for Nielsen, I'm  inclined to think the data they gather is significantly less accurate due to quality control issues.  As a software developer who integrates analytics packages into software for marketing departments, I'm also keenly aware of the motivations, false assumptions, willingness to mislead, and other abuses marketers will make to skew their data to whatever bias they want.</p>
<p>In other words, the data is shit and people selling it have a vested interest in making it look valuable to the buyers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's all HBO, they have a huge reserve they allocated on new programming. For a business like HBO, the subscriber is not the consumer - they are the product. And the tv shows are the bait to help them harvest the product, which enables them to sell to their key customers - cable providers like Comcast and Verizon. This way if comcast offers HBO in their channel lineup, people will pay comcast to get it, which in turn Comcast pays HBO for the right to broadcast their shows, and HBO takes the money they got from Comcast to make quality programs to pay the production companies to make the shows.</p>
<p>Network television operates on ad sales. Better quality programming means more viewers, which lead to more ad sales, and more exclusive ad spots (like the superbowl). The networks need to front the costs directly to the production companies, and they determine if the profit of potential ad sales outweigh the cost of production. An example is the pilot episode of Lost; the network exec that greenlit Lost lost his job because the pilot was so expensive the board feared they wouldn't be able to recoup the costs with ad sales (which in hindsight was probably a bad move on their end)</p>
<p>So in the end, the viewer is not the customer, but the product. Network tv needs viewers so they can sell ad spots at a premium. Cable tv providers need viewers so they can sell subscriptions at a premium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nielsen measure DVR plays and on demand streams now. You'll hear the terms overnight (day of broadcast until the next day), live+3 (broadcast plus DVR and on demand for 3 days), and live+7. All are used to different degrees to set ad rates as well as for make goods. Their are trying to incorporate OTT streams now too, but aren't great at it. Also, Nielsen supposedly distributes their boxes to statistically represent all of the US according to age, race, income level, etc. That said, Nielsen still isn't very good.</p>
<p>The most interesting rating and ad rate disparity that I know of was for Mad Men. It got good ratings, but other AMC shows did better (Breaking Bad &amp; TWD). Yet Mad Men had huge ad rates. Supposedly they leveraged the fact that their viewing demographic was, on average, well off (north of $100k incomes) to draw in advertisements for luxury goods and set their ad rates very high.</p>
<p>TV advertising is weird and complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite ratings stories was &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.  </p>
<p>It had ratings that arguably could have justified cancellation at times, but it's core demographic was (obviously) gay people, which at the time at least tended to be brand loyal.  Like to the effect of &quot;Your brand of tampons supported gay rights by sponsoring Will &amp; Grace, so a couple of gay dudes will order a crate of them even though we'll never need tampons&quot; loyal.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is right. I had one of those boxes back in high school (~10 years ago) as long as the box could &quot;hear&quot; what you were watching it would count it, even if it was on dvr or the internet. It of course doesn't work if you have headphones and don't put them in through the box so it had severe limitations.</p>
<p>The other limitation is you probably get a lot of kids like I was that are too lazy to carry it around with me even though they offered to pay me to do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ratings:  Ratings indicate how many people are watching a show.  They're typically measured by the Nielsen group, which hands randomly selected family a special box that monitors what they watch.  If 1 in 10,000 families have a Nielsen box, then each Nielsen box represents 10,000 views.  It's honestly a terrible system, because certain types of are more prone to be selected/be willing to be a Nielsen family.  It also doesn't take into account things like DVR, streaming, etc. </p>

<p>When I studied biology, I learned different methods for counting population sizes from very small local samples. Depending on the method used, you could extrapolate very large numbers of individuals from a very small number of observed individuals to an <em>astonishing</em> degree of accuracy. Because math is magic. I'm sure the Nielsen group employs similar methods? </p>
<p>Edit: to put it differently, from what I learned in statistics, observing one in 10.000 families even for one hour every week can give you very, very good estimates of the viewing habits of the entire population, <em>even if</em> the selection of those families isn't completely random.</p></div>		</li>
