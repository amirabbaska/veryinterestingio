			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and that’s why even hot air can cast a shadow.  On a hot summer day, you’ll see iron manhole covers or black asphalt, and nothing really above it other than wavy air from the heat, but then you’ll see that wavy air casts strong shadows (and bright glimmers).</p>
<p>Air is transparent but different temperatures of air have different refractive indexes, and together they behave more like a lens than a transparent object.</p>
<p>A lens can’t darken the overall light since it isn’t absorbing any, so for every spot of shadow there’s also a spot of glimmer (extra bright sunlight).</p>
<p>Other lenses behave the same way, if you hold a magnifying glass to ignite a spot on fire, there’s a super bright center surrounded by a shadow.  The light is just being focused by the lens.</p></div>		</li>
