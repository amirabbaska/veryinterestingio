			<div class="markdown"><p>So could you take a load of plants, bombard them with radiation to cause random and uncontrolled mutations, selectively crossbreed the ones which look like they're doing something useful but with no understanding of what other potentially harmful mutations they might have, and that wouldn't be classed as &quot;genetically modified&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. They would not be considered GMO. (You'd still need to have the plant approved for human consumption, though.)</p>
<p>As a side note: I'm struggling to figure out what harmful (to humans) mutations could you introduce into plants this way. Point mutations/deletions/insertions may mess the plant up a bit, but I think the chances of producing something that would harm you as well are minuscule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>clearly the risks are small, there are a couple of examples where conventional techniques have caused harmful products, but the point is that if atomic gardening is safe (which it generally is), then GMO has to be <em>safer still</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Selective breeding in celery accidentally killed people when it was found (too late, obviously) to have increased levels of phytotoxins or something. They were just selecting for celery that looked nice. Now, if you're just mutating stuff, there's a lot that can go wrong. I really don't see how that shouldn't be more or equally regulated than something where we know what's happening.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And this is why the argument against genetically engineered GMO crops is so insane. Somehow people think knowing what exactly you changed in a plant is worse than randomly changing stuff and keeping what &quot;looks&quot; good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They generally have the misconception that it's just cross-breeding being used to combine traits of two existing plants in the old-fashioned way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due respect I don't think the anti-GMO crowd is upset about &quot;knowing specifically what changed&quot;. It seems their argument rests on two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Those affecting these changes know what is changing, but don't know how that change will ultimatey affect the foodstuff, its ability to be metabolized or it's safety. </p>
</li>
<li>They say there are built in natural mechanisms to prevent wild and crazy genetic changes to everyday food stuffs. As pointed out earlier you won't find an ear of corn with jellyfish genes in nature. Anti-GMO people seem to believe that natural cross breeding won't result in harmful products because of this natural mechinism. When this natural mechanism is abandoned for specific genetic manipulation, they believe there is some increased risk that the resultant product will be adulterated in some way. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually the source of many of our current food breeding lines for the past 70 years. There were even DIY kits you could get for home. Because only a tiny percentage of plants end up with a useful mutation, it becomes a numbers game, and so the more plants it was done to the better. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you place introns (the noncoding part) into the genome during genetic engineering or is it just fit inbetween existing introns?
And a follow-up being, do we know the function of introns well enough to know how we should space them in the genome? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all genetically engineered traits are inserted in a site-specific manner and it is possible that insertion of a genetic element could cause hard-to-predict disruptions. Introns play a role in splicing but can also modulate the accessibility of genes by acting as spacers or changing the 3D shape of DNA. Putative introns could also be non-annotated elements which are transcribed as a frameshifted or backwards read. </p>
<p>But genetic engineers don't just pick a genetic element, jam it wherever it seems to fit and go with that crop. They first consider a wide variety of factors including those listed above and come up with an insertion strategy. Then they introduce the genetic element into a whole bunch of different cultivars to create a library of potential plants expressing the desired trait. Then they test those plants at the genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and systemic level to look for unexpected changes. If everything looks alright then testing moves forward into the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Introns are useful in GE of plants, for example, when using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation,  selectable marker genes (that allow the transformed plant tissue to be separated from non-transformed tissues) usually contain introns, when selection agents such as antibiotics are used, since you don't want the Agrobacteria to survive (after they transformed the plants), only the plants with the added genes (transgenics). </p>
<p>Since only eukaryotes can deal with introns to make functional proteins, and prokaryotes (bacteria) can't, introns prevent 'chronic Agrobacterium infections', especially since some strong promoters (gene 'on'-switches) can actually work in bacteria as well as plants, but the bacteria won't make a functional gene product, due to introns.</p>
<p>Some introns greatly enhance gene expression, so they may be added to the transgene construct to enhance expression in the plant.</p>
<p>Also some GE is done for basic science (not just to make 'better' plants). You can study intron function by transforming plants (like Arabidopsis thaliana - the guinea pig of plants) with intron-containing genes and with the same gene without the intron, and compare the results. Introns have a lot to do with regulation of genes, gene switches, and variable protein expression. A lot of these types of basic studies (knock-out, knock-down, up-regulated, etc.) allow you to learn about gene function, regulation, and such, beyond just knowing the sequence.</p></div>		</li>
