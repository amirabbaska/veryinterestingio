			<div class="markdown"><p>I lol'd too. Then looked it up. Aside from describing OP, <a href="http://www.airseacontainers.com/blog/what-is-a-gaylord-box/" target="_blank">a gaylord is a type of box</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply put, a Gaylord box is basically a bulk-size corrugated box. Traditionally, Gaylord boxes are large or bulk size and allow for the shipment of products in a large, single container or on a pallet.</p>
<p>The name “Gaylord box” has evolved into a generic term for any pallet-sized box for bulk shipping of storage. The term Gaylord is a trade name for this type of box since the first bulk bins that were manufactured in North American were by the Gaylord Container Company; thus, the name. Similarly to how we say “Kleenex®” for a tissue and “Band-Aid®” for an adhesive bandage, the name stuck, and corrugated boxes were known as Gaylord boxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in addition to calling OP a bundle of sticks, we can also call OP a large corrugated box. </p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dY6VS8XVWM12" target="_blank">It's also a town in Michigan</a> (probably where OP is from) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It struck me too when my office mentioned it. I'm a marketing agent that uses Costco as our venue to set up a booth for our product. One of them is a pillow case made out of bamboo and the huge cardboard gaylords filled with pillows make me want to sleep in one all night.</p></div>		</li>
