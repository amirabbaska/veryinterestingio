			<div class="markdown"><p>When you split white light through a prism, you actually get ultraviolet and infrared (though probably not x-rays or gamma rays as the beam of light wouldn't have enough energy) on either side of the rainbow pattern that's produced, it's just we can't see it. So combining all the wavelengths would still just create white light again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a reason visible light is called &quot;visible light&quot;, and the rest of electromagnetic radiation isn't shoved into that label. You would only see the aforementioned &quot;white&quot; light, and not any of the other wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not necessarily true, though, right? Like, if you combine red and blue light you get purple light because of destructive interference. The interference of all wavelengths should have unique properties. Not necessarily in the visible range. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More often than not the waves/photons aren't lined up and interacting in any visible way.  The purple is a sensation of the brain blending the blue and red light together. </p>
<p>Another way to put it is what would happened if you mixed a hypothetical ultraviolet paint with yellow.   You'd see yellow paint. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Red+blue=purple has to do with the way the brain maps a spectrum to a perceived color, and is not exactly related to spatial interference. Basically we have three types photoreceptor rod cells, each of which has a distinct spectral response, peaking at red, green, and blue. And the excitation levels of the three determine the color we see. The combination of red and blue lights excite the rod cells in an identical way as the monochromatic violet light, so the brain can't tell them apart, interpreting both as the same color purple</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light does not have a color before our brains give it one. Color is almost like a language which is used to describe light. If we didn't see color in the first place we would never assign arbitrary bands of light frequencies a specific color. Mathematically i have not seen a grouping of light frequencies that coincide with color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes don't respond to those wavelengths.</p>
<p>Colors are generated by your brain's visual processing system anyway. They're not &quot;real&quot; in a sense.</p></div>		</li>
