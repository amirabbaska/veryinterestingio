			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, keep in mind airliners usually fly around 30,000 feet. Which should be well above the influence of the hurricane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Zero-G planes, are the same machines as  commercial airliners, <em>i.e.</em> ESA uses an airbus A330.</p>
<p>This gives you an idea on what can be achieved on a regular plane.  (you can also find a video on youtube where airbus breaks an airframe, they need a huge machine to produce a sufficent force for that) </p>
<p>The main problem is that regular passenger don't like bumpy flights and their scream threshold is way under what a lot of leisure pilot (especially sailplane and freeflight that need active atmosphere to gain altitude) undergo routinely.  I don't even talk about militaries and tests pilot that bring their plane to the edge of the flight enveloppe...</p></div>		</li>
