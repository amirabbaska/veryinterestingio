Their wave amplitudes can add. They do not interact unless the intensity is so incredibly high that crazy relativistic stuff is happening. They are electromagnetic fields, so they can interact with charged particles, pushing them around. Those particles, atoms, molecules, etc. can cause interesting changes and interactions with photons, but that's different. That's not photons interacting with photons.</p></div>		</li>
