			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how cycles work. These studies suggest that the menstrual cycle is a lunar rhythm.</p>
<p>The way rhythms work is that they are <em>similar</em> to an environmental cycle like the moon. When not directly exposed to the environmental cues (which is what happens when you live indoors), the cycle only approximates it. When exposed to the environmental cues like in this study, the cycles follow it much closer.</p>
<p>Rhythms tend to be in cycles that are observable in nature. Days, tides, lunar months, years. This is because it is much easier to mark the passage of time using environmental cues. Some like flowering are exogenous and depend directly on an environmental cue like day length. Others, like our sleep cycle, are endogenous and roughly approximate a cycle, only using the environmental cue to calibrate. </p></div>		</li>
