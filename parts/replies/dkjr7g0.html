			<div class="markdown"><p>A good place to see this 100% reflection is looking up at the surface of a pool while submerged. While looking straight up, you can easily see the sky but past a certain angle all you can see is the reflected bottom of the pool.
Also, fiber optic cables use this principle. The core has a different refractive index than the cladding although both are glass. if light is shot into the core at the right angle, you get total internal reflection. You can actually allow the light to escape from the middle of a fiber optic cable by introducing a sharp bend (not breaking it!). The sharp bend will increase the angle that the light strikes the core/cladding boundary to the point where the reflection drops below 100% and the light will just fly right on outta there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should edit your post to make it clear that TIR can't happen at the air-to-water interface. Only from high to low index. </p>
<p>The glimmering is not caused by TIR. You're mistaken. See the link you posted for low-to-high index reflections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that /u/LuxArdens never mentioned TIR. At a very shallow angle, the reflection does still approach 100%.

			<div class="markdown"><p>In part. The image you see is light that bends/refracts due to the air being at different densities close to the ground (there's basically layers of different temperatures, and you can think of light reflecting off the boundaries between layers). At a low angle (so looking closer to the horizon) more of the light is able to bend than it would at a steeper angle for the sake reasons as mentioned above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but in mirages the light's path is curved upwards by a smooth change in refractive index. In total internal reflection, it's path is changed by a discontinuity in refractive index.</p></div>		</li>
