			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, I believe so. But as the other responder said, steel and aluminum actually have opposite results for high/low cool down rates. At theoretical high rates of cool down, it gets really crazy.</p>
<p>Please direct all further inquiries to the other poster. I've hit the limits of my knowledge on matse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would most likely only cool the outer layer, leaving much hotter metal inside the piece too. But yes, it would most likely be brittle. The heating and cooling cycles for metals are closely held secrets for many companies, and there is an art to it, I believe. Theyâ€™re is obviously a ton of science too. For the most part, shocking materials with extremes of temps is not as constructive as controlled cycles. Things like quenching steel by dunking it in room temp oil or water mostly provide just surface hardness. Simply heating and cooling to lower temps can add hardness to many metals.</p></div>		</li>
