<p>If you don't know a light bulb is a three-way light bulb, it messes with your head. You reach to turn it off, and it just gets <em>brighter</em>! That's the exact opposite of what I wanted you to do! So you turn the switch again, and it gets brighter once more! <em>I will break you, light bulb!</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have 2 lamps with 3-way bulbs. One is basic, and I use it mostly on low and max. The other not only has 3 bulbs which can be turned on as 1, 2, or 3 of them, but an upper bulb which is a 3-way bulb. The former light is really handy, but the latter is just a tiny bit overkill for me.</p>
<p>On the bright side (heh) these types of lights mean you can change the bulb less often if you use each setting one-by-one and only replace it once they've both burned out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One reason being it's a US standard. You don't find 3 way bulbs in europe, and you don't find 4-position switches in the lamps.</p>
<p>I'm in lighting industry, and I know about 3 way bulbs because someone from the USA asked specifically for a compatible luminaire... But I never saw one in my 10 years in the field.</p>
<p>Just for your information, dimmers are way more common in the EU market... you don't need a 3 way bulb if you easily have 5-100% dimming on every luminaire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think 3-way bulbs were invented before dimmer switches, and they are cheaper to manufacture. Dimming is obviously better though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure you can get those lamps in europe too, i own one that has 4 different settings, white, off, color rotate, fixed color depending how often you use the on and off switch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know all about them, because my mother bought them obsessively for some reason and no one could get her to stop. There were two lamps in the entire house that used 3 way bulbs. One of them was barely ever used, it was turned on for maybe 4-5 hours per year, and the light bulb in it was probably close to ten years old. </p>
<p>She just kept buyign 3 way bulbs, insisting if she stopped buying them we'd suddenly run out because we weren't paying attention to how many there were. She had 4 dozen of them and we used 1 every 4-5 months, maybe. She just kept buying more of them, despite me trying to get her to stop.</p>
<p>She was sick and eventually got so bad I had to do her shopping for her. I just stopped buying 3 ways despite them being on her list. As it turns out, this pissed her off massively. I don't know why she was so obsessed with buying them,. It was just 3 way bulbs, it wasn't any other kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad had a bit of a minor problem... when my mom told him she needed something, he'd buy it every shopping trip afterwards until he was told to stop-- and if it was a good deal buy extra :P  So we'd end up with 8 containers of ketchup, too many light bulbs, or whatever.</p></div>		</li>
