			<div class="markdown"><p>Your descriptions made me fondly remember the movie. At the same time it made me remember Jurassic World, and how horribly, horrible it was. Particularly the mention of T-Rex being an animal not a monster. It made me think about the stupid, stupid idea they had in Jurassic world that dinosaurs are not good enough, we need a hybrid invisible dino mutant! So, so, so stupid. They took what made JP truly magical and a treat to watch and used it as a blueprint to do the exact opposite. Anyway, thanks for the memories.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a different type of movie really. Michael Crichton made a career out of writing speculative fiction. Almost all of his novels take a scientific development that people worried about like nano technology, genetic engineering, lab created disease and turned it into a fanciful thriller extrapolating a nightmare scenario where science and nature clash.</p>
<p>The original Jurassic Park is a faithful adaptation of that story (even if it is a bit more condensed than the novel). Regular people lost in a nightmare of science and nature gone mad. The sequels are mostly just action movies with monsters. The recent Jurassic World is closer to a godzilla movie of monsters vs monsters with people in the middle than Crichtons ideas.</p>
<p>I think it would be really hard to make a sequel to Jurassic Park that captures the original. It banked so hard on the sense of wonder and achievement of what had been done before it all turned into a nightmare.</p>
<p>After seeing the movie so many times since I was a kid, I think these days my favourite scene is John Hammond sitting in the ruins of his park, eating melting ice cream from a defunct fridge while telling Ellie about how he wanted to build something real and wondrous. And Ellie just chides him for the sheer arrogance of thinking it could be controlled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course you are right about Crichton. I just wish that instead of making a bastard monster movie that they could have done some actual story telling. They had the blueprint and everything, and they just go with the Michael Bay method. I mean, wtf happened to the movies. Now I just sound like an old crotchety bastard. Anyway, thanks for the trip down memory lane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I believe makes it real. I don't know which movie but imagine a T-Rex pushing against and ripping out telephone lines to pass through. One of these is already real and familiar to us and the other is not, so when they interact it's like they transfer that realness through. Also just caging the T-Rex, helps us see them as animals first before we jump into thinking they are fictional monsters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One scene that sticks out to me as being especially brilliant at combining life-like illusion with simple effects is the scene with the sick triceratops. It's just a puppet, but the context of illness confirms that it's a living, real creature because it's fallen ill like a real creature should, but it also provides built-in excuses for it just laying there statically, it's obviously labored, mechanical breathing, milky, blankly-staring eyes and a mucous-y rubber texture of its mouth and skin. </p>
<p>And it just works so well because illness creates an instant empathy for the creature - we've all felt like just laying there, breathing difficultly, with blank eyes and that awful mucous-y mouth and sinus feeling - so we subconsciously expect, and therfore pay no attention to, all those deep visual flaws in the puppet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ellie enthusiastically pulling on shoulder length rubber gloves to go dig through 4 foot tall piles of shit also did a lot to cement that these aren't heroes but just characters who are enthusiastic about their own niche fields.</p>
<p>Just like how she's dorking out over an extinct fern she picked while the jeep's driving them along.</p></div>		</li>
