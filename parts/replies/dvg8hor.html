			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some cool and simple tests you can do to see if a child has developed theory of mind yet.  There are also multiple levels that develop. I had a class taught by one of the early pioneers in the theory of mind field, it was super cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is at its core. However, unpacking that statement leads to a LOT of sub-ideas.</p>
<p>In OP's example, if someone/thing that doesn't exhibit this trait does something alone in a room, their ability to infer that another being won't know what they did will be absent. Being able to grok the idea that other beings have a different and separate perspective is a fundamental building block to that.</p>
<p>In advanced forms it allows for concepts like empathy where you can intuit the emotional state/impact of certain stimuli on others which is obviously an essential part of functioning in a group. (Or manipulating a group...just sayin)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're not wrong, exactly, but from your tone it seems you didn't notice that it is a very large subject, not something that can really be adequately summarized so tersely.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the &quot;wow&quot;, but I just have background in psychology/neurobiology/child &amp; cognitive development -- nothing like a PhD though. There's lots and lots on these same topics that I don't know but wish I did.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that all the things I mentioned are covered in basic textbooks in these subjects these days, because they are the results of many many clever studies done over the decades.</p>
<p>The huge pioneer on child development and cognitive development was Jean Piaget. He was sort of the Freud of that field, and as with Freud, <em>some</em> of his work has become outdated, so his writings decades ago are no longer 100% trustworthy, but his basic ideas and studies were groundbreaking.</p>
