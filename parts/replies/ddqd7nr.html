			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep!  Asphalt is basically just rocks and glue.  With old asphalt, the glue is all dried out, but the rocks are just fine.  Crush it up, add glue, asphalt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no... obviously each place will have different specs but up in Ontario we tend to have a maximum amount of reclaim in the surface pavement on highways. The rocks aren't always &quot;just fine&quot; more often then not new aggregate  is needed due to degradation of the rock's properties. Ultimately I'm from a cold climate with large temperature swings from seasons.</p>
<p>More often than not a large spoil pile will develop in the corner of the pit and the old asphalt will be piled there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The glue is never really wet, you just have to heat it enough to melt it again. Other than being dirty on the surface it's the same stuff they put down. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I see others already said this, but they are buried really deep under a lot of people who are slightly misinformed. It's not common to reuse on site at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually transported and recycled back in the plant, not on the spot, but yes. Main reason is because itÂ´s cheaper to mill and recycle than to dispose and buy all new aggregate.</p>
<p>By recycling you can also cut back on one of the most expensive variables in road construction, the % of liquid asphalt of the new mixture. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive seen quite a few of those paving trains out there that munch up the asphalt, reprocess, and repave. Saw them do an entire highway once. It's like 6 giant vehicles. They definitely had no dump trucks with gravel either. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Now, build them as open roofs over top of a desert highway enabling everyone to drive in artificial shade the whole way, and you get a double whammy of power and also savings in how much fuel everyone burns...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even that only makes sense <em>after</em> you've already covered all the perfectly-good preexisting building roofs with panels. Otherwise you're just wasting the material for all the columns and beams used to hold the damn things up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you stop thinking of them as solar roads and start thinking of them as Smart roads it starts making more sense, the solar was just to offset the cost of powering them. Heaters melting snow and lighted roadways, and channels built in for utility lines are a really nice feature(also autonomous car connections to keep them on the road or inform them of incidents ahead), but solar can't really power that at all, but heating ALL the roadways is going to be ridiculously expensive, so... I'd take smart roadways over solar roadways any day. </p></div>		</li>
