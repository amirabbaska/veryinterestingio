			<div class="markdown"><p>The details of physiologic salt and fluid balance are quite complicated. There are situations where you would put salt into fresh water for rehydration (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#Preparation" target="_blank">oral rehydration fluid</a>). This helps when a person is deficient in total body salt, as happens quite frequently in severe diarrhea. A profoundly dehydrated person who has no access to food (or salt) will have low free water in their blood, causing a very high <em>concentration</em> of salt in their blood, but because salt is also lost in sweat/urine/feces, they will also have a low <em>total</em> amount of salt in their body. These people need some salt for rehydration.</p>
<p>It also turns out that sugar and salt are required for water absorption. Most people have enough salt and sugar in their body to facilitate this without the need for adding it to their water, but profoundly dehydrated people can absorb water more efficiently if it has some sugar and salt in it.</p>
<p>Finally, I should add that while salt deficiency is common in (especially juvenile) diarrheal illnesses, it doesn't occur very quickly in &quot;stranded&quot; people, and in any case is masked until they're rehydrated. Stranded people who don't have enough fresh water to stay hydrated will have a high concentration of salt in their blood, and adding extra salt to their water will compound the problem. They would only need to ingest salt if they're able to find enough water to hydrate themselves and reveal their salt deficit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to your comment about using Ringer's Lactate in the US.</p>
<p>In the UK our anaesthetists and surgeons use Hartmann's Solution (Compound Sodium Lactate). It's similar but not quite the same as Ringer's. This is from the British Consensus Guidelines on Intravenous Fluid Therapy for Adult Surgical Patients (GIFTASUP).</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Ringer was a British physician while Hartmann was an American paediatrician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I didn't realize that D5 1/2 normal saline was closer to plasma. I was a paramedic for about 10 years and preferred NS over LR in trauma because of issues with running whole blood through LR. I seen to remember there was a pH difference that could also effect IV meds in LR that wasn't there with NS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IV meds can be pushed through LR without issues in most cases.  You just have to be careful when pushing LR because too much of it can put the patient into V-fib, whereas NS doesn't have that problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This will probably get buried, but I want to add that Sports drinks are rehydrating in part BECAUSE they have salt in them and not in spite of it (although not at proper concentration). They best way to increase intestinal reabsorption is to drink hypotonic fluid with equal concentrations of both Glucose and salt.  This activates SGLT in the ileum (Sodium glucose lumenal transporter), pulling salt and sugar into the intestinal epithelium causing water to diffuse in with it.  This is the basis for the World Health Oral Rehydration Solution (fights water loss due to diarrhea in cholera patients).</p>
