			<div class="markdown"><p>The bigger point is that this is HOW we're constraining that number. Kepler is only looking at a small patch of sky, but much of what Kepler was designed to figure out is the frequencies of various planets, particularly earth-sized planets in earth-like orbits.</p>
<p>So these results will be what are used to figure out what our expected values are for planets in the galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Added that it can only see planets within about 2% of the possible orbital planes, since the planet has to pass in front of the star.  </p>
<p>Means that their could be 50 times this many planets just on different orbital planes!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, though that frequency is relatively easy to calculate out, and depends on the star, and the distance the planet is from the star. The chance of a Hot Jupiter transiting (a Jupiter-sized planet in a period of a few days) is about 10%. The chance of an earth transiting a sun-like star in a 1 AU orbit is around .5%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a planet must pass in front of the star during the time we were observing it at least once to be seen, and twice or more to be properly measured and confirmed. Anything with an orbital period greater than the ~4 years of observations may not have transited at all from our POV even if it was on the right plane. Half the planets in our solar system have orbital periods longer than that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's looking down the arm of the galaxy that we're in.  If that's the case, it should give us views of the planets cloest to us in a high density area.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Selecting the Kepler Star Field
The star field for the Kepler Mission was
selected based on a number of constraints:
The field must be continuously viewable
throughout the four-year lifetime of
the mission.
The field needs to be rich in stars like our
Sun. Kepler needs to observe 100,000 stars
all at once.</p>
<p>One needs to look close to the plane of our
galaxy, the Milky Way to have a rich star field.
But the size of the optics and the space available
for the sunshade require the center of the star
field to be more than 55° above or below the
path of the Sun as the spacecraft orbits the
Sun each year trailing behind the Earth. This
left two portions of the sky to view, one each
in the northern and southern sky. The CygnusLyra
region in the northern sky was chosen,
as it is richer in stars than the southern field.
Also, all of the ground-based telescopes to
support the Kepler team’s follow-up observation
work are located at northern latitudes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They won't be too close to us. Kepler only is observing fainter stars, and primarily solar-like stars, so the planets are generally going to be fairly far away. The closest planets are going to, generally, be around brighter stars that are solar-like, or around nearby red dwarfs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can read about it <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/Science/about/targetFieldOfView/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>The basic goals were that it had to be somewhere the spacecraft could observe year-round, there had to be a sufficiently large number of stars, and they avoided the galactic plane because they needed individual stars to be separated out enough that you'd not have the light from multiple stars overlapping as that would make it a lot harder to figure out which star your signal is coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planetary scientist here: I don't think it's unreasonable for planets to be extremely common around all stars. Star formation isn't 100% efficient in terms of using all of the gas available while it collapses. This remaining gas will condense into solids and form planets. Now, how likely terrestrial planets are on the other hand, we're much less sure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although there was a paper (or at least a preprint) by Kraus et al. a couple of weeks ago, with observational evidence suggesting close binaries (within 50au) severely inhibit planet formation. That would rule out perhaps 1/5 of solar-type stars.</p>
<p>I also eagerly await good statistics for M dwarf host stars - although I don't have any real doubts that they still host a good number of planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd hazard a guess at somewhere between 2 and 6 rocky planets is the average.let's just call it a hunch.</p>
<p>(And there's probably a branch of mathematics/statistics that is capable of extrapolating broad estimates out of a single dataset, as long as the dataset has some internal patterns. Like, rocky planets probably are not super rare because we have 4 of them. It's unlikely we would have 4 if an average system has 0 or 1).</p></div>		</li>
