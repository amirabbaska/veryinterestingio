			<div class="markdown"><p>This is blowing my mind. So if many of the vowels are arbitrarily added, how would it be possible for us to know the original pronunciation? I see that archaeologists used an educated guess with the &quot;Tut-Ankh-Mun&quot; translation using words that we already know, but that seems imperfect too because we don't know the pronunciation of those words either. </p>
<p>Do we know any language that the ancient Egyptian language might have derived from in some form that would give us a bit more insight into how it could have sounded? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Tutenkhamen&quot; was actually just to make pronunciation easier. The best educated guess of what it sounded like is more along the lines of &quot;Tawat 'ankhu qaman&quot;</p></div>		</li>
