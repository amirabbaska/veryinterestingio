			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add a bit more to the above - many plants do this, not just grass. In many tree species especially, it can cause the trees to begin producing various chemicals that help fight infestations of bugs or make the trees more unpalatable to certain species that prey on them.</p>
<p>So in fact it really can be a warning call that triggers actions on the part of the plant. The stimulus and purpose can vary widely, but plants aren't just 100% passive all the time - they do react to things and can transmit signals to others around them that trigger those responses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an episode of radiolab about this! Apparently in healthy forests there's an underground network of fungi connecting the trees to one another. The fungi feed off of the starches stored in the tree roots and in exchange allow the trees to communicate with one another and transfer nutrients from one part of the forest to another. Shit is wild!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also possible that other plants detect another plant in distress and preemptively start generating a defense.</p>
<p>I believe that acacia trees do this when a giraffe eats the leaves.  The giraffes will actually approach trees from downwind to prevent one acacia tree from triggering the others.  It's a bittering agent iirc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know who downvoted you. You're correct. Acacia signals to other acacia trees that it is being eaten, and both it and the acacia trees downwind pump alkaline chemicals into the leaves. </p>
<p>Giraffes learned first to eat a bit of one tree and then move on, and then later to approach a stand of acacia trees from downwind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some acacia trees produce a special pod for ants to feed on. In the doc I saw, the (large) ants had cut down every single plant around the tree. Then a cow came to eat some leaves. The ants swarmed that branch and kept stinging the cow on the nose until it buggered off.</p>
<p>Had me wondering if the ants were farming the tree or was the tree farming the ants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an excellent documentary called <em>What Plants Talk About.</em> It's about, well, what plants &quot;talk&quot; about. I'm not sure if it's on Netflix anymore, but it's definitely worth checking out if you have these kinds of questions on your mind.</p>
<p>Edit: Link. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrrSAc-vjG4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrrSAc-vjG4</a>  A couple smart people thought to check YouTube. Also, it seems I have to watch some M. Night Shamalamadingdong movie and listen to some podcasts!</p></div>		</li>
