			<div class="markdown"><p>The health system is based upon incentives. For the assurance that a company turns over a profit, it spikes the premiums of the individual insurers. If my insurance is covering 80% of the costs after the satisfying deductible, I'm only responsible for the remaining balance. However, until that deductible is met, which could be $2000-5000 dollars, you're responsible for the costs prior. </p>
<p>The financial goal is for you to spend thousands of dollars before any type of insurance kicks in. The fine print is usually the deceiving part of the transaction. Insurance companies only cover certain tests and deem others as unnecessary to the well-being of the individual. The written language is written specifically to confuse the client. By this method, a patient who encounters a medical emergency might be subjected to tests and procedures not covered under your plan, which could throw you in massive debt. </p>
<p>The structure of healthcare is horrifically flawed. Insurance companies are in for the profit. The well-being of the established society is viewed as <strong>expendable.</strong> At some point - as you've aged, you're likely to be paying far more in costs due vulnerability of illness, deterioration in physical  condition, etc. The higher the cost to keep you alive, the higher the premiums. It's a never-ending game to cut corners and expand the market for its enterprise. </p>
<p>We need a system structured solely on doctor/patient relationships. The middle man cannot interfere with the transaction, and our tax dollars should be used to fund a healthcare system designed specially so upon a doctor visitation, it costs you nothing. The well-being of individuals should <strong>NEVER</strong> be a business model for people to profit it off. That's abhorrent and completely unethical. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Said very well. It's just simply taking advantage of people because they can. How anyone who is in a position of power can look at the current state of healthcare and approve of it boggles my mind. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And that scares a lot of people out of not going to the hospital when they should.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So who pays the doctors? Doctors make good money - that's why some of the best and brightest go to school for years. If they're not going to be able to pay off their school loans for years, why would anyone want to spend all that time and money becoming a doctor? Not being argumentative at all - the US system is clearly broken, but it's broken in a lot of ways (cost of education, cost of developing new medicines, the insurance racket, etc) - not just one. I honestly don't think there's one panacea for all of the issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly the issue. If medicine wasn't focused on reaping financial reward, the goal of providing quality care would be the incentive. </p>
<p>Of course, it's a job but why the business model approach? The field of medicine is far beyond what money can buy or blind you from, it's about instilling the nature of goodwill and assistance through medical crises. How does the welfare of the individual not take precedence over feeling of greed? If the concern for helping others isn't on one's agenda, perhaps they should reevaluate their ambition before seeking a career in medicine. We're built upon the idea of turning rock into gold but without the intention of creating a longer, sustainable existence for all. This is not to say that aforementioned statements applies to all medical related practices, but it's merely questioning the integrity of it. I, personally, would feel burdened by someone else' suffering due to my carelessness in providing quality care. Do I truly want to ensure care for the benefit of one's life or do I only see the dollar signs near the exit? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One very common thing you hear in America when discussing healthcare, immediately once you bring up the Canadian system,
&quot;Canadians wait FOREVER to see a doctor! Is that what you want??? They would love to come here and use our hospitals!&quot;</p>
<p>I question that, a lot. Care to comment? What's it like trying to set up an appointment? I take it you prefer the Canadian system? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting appointments with your Family Physician is about the same. You might have to wait a couple more mins in the waiting room in Canada than the US....But I was told in both countries that that is due to patients asking &quot;one more thing..&quot; and taking up extra time...</p>
<p>Hospitals and Specialists is where you notice the difference. Good insurance gets you preferential treatment at hospitals and faster bookings at specialists/follow-up appointments. In the US, you'll get that appointment soon, if not the same day! In Canada, depending on severity, it could be a week or months..</p>
<p>I've also noticed a lack of equipment in Canada as a possible reason for &quot;slowdowns&quot;. So again, population may be the reason.
For example, you're in a Canadian hospital and need a MRI...you might need to wait a few hours for it. Not only because others are more severe, but because there's only one MRI machine in that whole hospital. American hospitals have many machines, more lab techs, more doctors..</p></div>		</li>
