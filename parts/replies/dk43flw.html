			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not how drafting works.</p>
<p>The two main effects are that those in the front guide the air around themselves, leaving the ones behind in a ‘gap’ in the air, the slipstream. That gap isn’t perfect, but it helps.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ones in the front actually get a little help from the ones behind them. In guiding the air, some vortexes are formed behind the object, and these slow the rider down—but the rider behind will break up some of those, thus reducing the drag on the rider in front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure why you are disagreeing with me in the first paragraph and then agreeing with me in the second. When you slipstream you reduce the air resistance on the second racer without affecting the first racer negatively. So the air resistance on the entire system is lower. The reason I constantly say &quot;racer&quot; and not car or driver and the reason I mentioned bike racing is because this is where it is most notable. In most motor races you only increase the speed of the drafting car and there is no way to go faster since the first car is the one holding up the pack and he does not get any advantages. However in some motor sports it is allowed to bump the car in front which can give him extra speed. And in some sports fuel conservation is part of the sport so the car that is drafting can save his fuel for later. Bike races are in the later category. So for example if the race leader is far in front of the pack the cars might bunch up tight and help each other. Together they will have much less drag and therefore get more speed so they can close the gap to the leader.</p>
<p>Building a bigger car is a similar concept to drafting. Instead of having two cars draft each other you can wield them together to get a bigger car and get less air resistance. Now you can just change the configuration a bit to get even less air resistance. This is for example the concept behind the Mercedes F1 cars in the 30s which had up to four V16 engines in a single huge car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There doesnt have to be an increase in volume though. What if the heavier car was just a denser material but the exact same size? What effect would this have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case the additional power would still make the car go faster. The mass does not have much to say on the top speed as the momentum would just ensure the car keeps the same speed. You just need the power of the engine to be more then the air resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both cars would not continue to accelerate towards the speed of light. A wheeled vehicle makes a direct mechanical connection to the ground and its top speed is ultimately limited by the maximum RPM of the engine combined with the gear ratio of the transmission and diameter of the tires. A car on flat and level ground inside of a vacuum has a maximum speed... And that's essentially what a dynamometer simulates.</p></div>		</li>
