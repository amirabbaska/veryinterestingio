<p>The Great Wall of China is a fair deal different than people imagine it. </p>

<p>I would add that a great deal of the length of the Great Wall was rammed earth built with steeply sloped sides along the top of ridge lines.  It would make it very easy for defenders to keep an army from crossing, but wouldn't have stopped animals that lived in that landscape already, steep hills are their jam.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that really puts into terms how far and wide the Great Wall was.</p>
<p>That seems near the Gobi desert, that's at the farthest flungs of what was once the empire.</p>
<p>Probably a post for the unluckiest soldiers no doubt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right most people assume it's just one big wall but in places you can just walk around it. I guess people assume the point of the wall is to keep everyone out, but really it's more to do with inhibiting a large group (like an army) from moving freely.</p></div>		</li>
