			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an UPU regulation for that. You need to write the destination country in capital letters in English or French and the address in the local language. If you do that, everything works out, even if you send mail to China with an address in Chinese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you allowed to use a different language if both the destination and the original country use that language (e.g. Spanish if you send a letter from Spain to South America)? Or is there a chance that a transit country's office doesn't understand Spanish?</p>
<p>If I write postcards I even almost always use the language of the country where I post them. I never had any problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could see it that it might cause a problem if the English or French name is different from the source language, (i.e. Spain vs Espa√±a), but more often than not, it's more of a blip than a showstopper. </p>
<p>More likely than not, it's probably bundled together with other mail going to the same country, so it's not handled in between the origin and destination counties. If it does need to be handled at an intermediate location, due to low mail volume or logistic requirements (think New Zealand via Australia), it may be flagged for being in the wrong language, but then a person would probably look at it and figure it out.</p></div>		</li>
