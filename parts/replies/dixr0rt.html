			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves are part of General Relativity, which superseded Newtonian Gravity. In General Relativity, the &quot;field&quot; of gravity is essentially spacetime itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically gravity isn't instantaneous so waves are the changes in the gravitational field propagating.</p>
<p>E.G. If the sun were to suddenly disappear, under newton's theory the earth would immediately fly off into space but under relativity, we wouldn't know the sun had disappeared until about 7 minutes later, when the last of its light reaches us, and when the resulting gravitational wave reaches us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, gravitational waves are part of the post-Newtonian understanding of gravity, in which attraction of masses is due to some inherent distortion of space and time that is caused by concentrations of mass and energy.</p></div>		</li>
