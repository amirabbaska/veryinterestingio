			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but can't they do it in a nice way? The perfect example is some tech sites is frequent. They only have normal ads, focused mainly on computer hardware and similar. No pop-ups or annoying auto play videos. I unblock that site from ublock because they are non intrusive and actually relevant for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's like a mafia don asking a store owner who will protect him if he is gone. </p>
<p>The internet as we know it might die without advertisement revenue?!? Promise!?!</p>
<p>Seriously. I'm okay with a web that has advertisement as revenue imploding. We have actually already had this happen in TV industry. TV used to be dominated by ad revenue to pay for it. Then we tried other models, and guess what? It turns out that advertisement makes everything completely suck and we are better off finding other ways to pay for stuff.</p>
<p>I happily ad block everything and defeat any filters I come across trying to stop me. If I bring about the end of the web as we know it, good. Telling me that the advertisement based web might go away if I don't have 40 video advertisements dancing in front of the text on trying to read isn't a threat, it's the promise of a reward. <strong><em>I want that.</em></strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Page owner decides what types of advertisement appear on his site. The biggest and most profitable CDNs don't serve malware, inappropriate content etc. If they did they would lose their best clients.</p>
<p>If you see penis enlargement add, viagra add, fake download add etc. then you can be sure that the page owner sells advertising space for almost nothing.</p>
<p>Your anger is misplaced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>tell that to google, who cant manage it, and still serve ads, scams and malware (just look at any youtube ad)</p>
<p>to yahoo , who if there isnt malware ads around your webmail its a miracle.</p>
<p>i hate being blunt .. but you're plain wrong, they simply dont care as long as the checks are coming.</p>
<p>you have to hit them in the checkbook if you want them to realiz they're doing a disservice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, except for the monetary value. You know, that thing that actually encourages people to create content? It'd be great if everybody posted content for free and web hosting was free but it's not realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse me sir. They owe that content to me. How dare you suggest they be compensated for their work. </p>
<p>I’m going to block these ads just because I can and claim it’s for privacy and malware. Even though I have a public Facebook, LinkedIn, twitter and Instagram. and I don’t have any anti-virus or any security software installed at all. </p></div>		</li>
