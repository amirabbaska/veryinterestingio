			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who works in phone repair there's a few possible reasons.</p>
<p>From most to least likely (note it can be more than one)</p>
<p>Cable damage from improper use.
Damaged/worn/dirty charging port.
Bad power block (the thing between the wall and the cord).
Bad battery.
Bad Charging IC chip (depending on iPhone model, this can be more or less likely).</p>
<p>Those are the most common scenarios I see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cable gets damaged (breaks in the wire for example) over time.  Same thing will happen to any cable over time, apple or amazon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was because it got slightly damaged, so that the phone doesn’t recognize it anymore, but that’s just my idea </p></div>		</li>
