			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only do they do that (it's called chip binning) but they produce the same chip for enterprise and consumers and then enable/disable certain features on the chips based on the market. The Xeon E3-1230v3 is the same die as I7 4770 but the 4770 has graphic and the Xeon support ECC memory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer OPs second question; if the same amount of platters are on the 500GB and 1TB drive, they very well may cost the same to produce, but the investment costs are still different. Where the technology for the 500GB one is already paid off, the 1TB is not, in a nutshell.</p></div>		</li>
