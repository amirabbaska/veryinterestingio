			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your second point, arc flash and arc blast is a concern in the industrial electrical world. At your home, the available fault current is not typically high enough to cause significant damage, but in the industrial world, you could see figures in the 100kA range or higher at 480VAC. If a short circuit were to happen while working on a circuit of this magnitude, there is potential for the copper bus to nearly instantaneously vaporize at around 67,000 times the volume at intense heat up to about 35,000 F. This would cause certain death if no protection is used and severe injuries with proper PPE depending on many factors. The math is somewhat complex, so I will not go into that here...
Lookup 'arc flash' on YouTube. Pretty crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>

They made a quite spectacular light show, and quite a god-awful smell</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no, depending on ac or dc, in ac you are almost a dead short, while in DC you're a rather high, 20k-800kish ohms hand to hand, resistance, and with ac it gets &quot;less&quot; dangerous the higher the frequency due to the skin effect.</p></div>		</li>
