			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you explain a bit more about colored noise? Why are certain sounds 'nice' while others can torment you (like buzzing bees)?</p>
<p>It does make sense that people dislike something they are afraid of however :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I use the term colored noise, I am referring to the actual classification of noises, which use colors:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise</a></p>
<p>(I'm using this term a bit colloquially, because I think these terms refer to actual signal noises, instead of something we consider noise, like background murmurs, rain, or thunder)</p>
<p>How pleasant a noise is has to do with the contrast between lower and higher tones. If something switches from low to high quickly and back again, it's often perceived as annoying. Especially when you have several of these patterns all mixed together in one noise.</p>
<p>i read somewhere that also a baby's cry has a highly varying frequency like that. I can imagine that the same goes for a colony of buzzing bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that is super interesting. I knew about white noise but now I've checked out the others. Pink and violett noise are kind of like rain, brown noise like a river/waterfall, (super deep?) blue noise like a mix between space engine background and plane flight sounds, green noise like rain, but heard from directly under a roof or shelter, and so on.</p>
<p>Cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>
