			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, banking marijuana dispensaries is extremely complicated. It's still illegal under federal law so technically processing transactions using proceeds from the sale of marijuana is considered money laundering. It wasn't until 2014 that FinCEN issued guidance on how banks could provide financial services to dispensaries, which essentially boiled down to requiring 24/7 monitoring of the dispensary. The problem is that the guidance didn't make banking dispensaries legal, it just told banks that FinCEN wouldn't prioritize enforcing those laws against banks that comply with the guidance. Complying with the guidance is absurdly expensive and time consuming (not to mention a bit invasive), and failing to comply opens the bank up to both criminal and civil prosecutions so, naturally, almost every Financial Institution in the US refuses to bank dispensaries.</p>
<p>It's a pretty ridiculous situation, but banks don't really have much of a choice in the matter. The issue is 100% because marijuana is a schedule I drug. If it were schedule II, it wouldn't be a federal crime to sell medical marijuana, so banking them wouldn't be considered money laundering. Of all the things that rescheduling marijuana would do, allowing banks to safely bank marijuana dispensaries is probably the most significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would someone have to do to start a Marijuana Credit Union of sorts? Like, entirely in-state, investing in exclusively in-state companies, bonds, ect, but still providing the same banking services, like checking accounts, IRAs, 401ks, direct deposits, mutual funds, CDs, lines of credit, and other financial products. Would there be a legal way to do this using an over-the-counter insurance product to supplant FDIC and other Federal Reserve backing? Whoever could do that would make bank. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appease the feds, which isn't at all easy. Even the Obama DOJ was shutting them down, and when you're talking jail time, nobody is going to do that.</p>
<p>Further, they couldn't be insured in any way; FDIC, or the credit union insurance group. If everybody wanted their money back they'd be SOL. </p></div>		</li>
