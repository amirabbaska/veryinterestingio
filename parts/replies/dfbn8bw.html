<p>I expect this to be received poorly but I'll say it again anyway: regular toothpaste leaves a mouth feeling <em>gross</em>, but it's an easy sort of gross to get used to feeling.  After brushing with 3% hydrogen peroxide instead of toothpaste for long enough to get over the foaming of the peroxide, using toothpaste again will feel gross.  The whole mouth feels (because it is) coated with a layer of slimey residue when you're done brushing with toothpaste.</p></div>		</li>
