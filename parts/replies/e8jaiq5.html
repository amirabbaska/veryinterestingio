			<div class="markdown"><p>Your former therapist could very well be right. However, you have said that you have a history of childhood abuse and trauma and experience severe episodes of dissociation. </p>
<p>I would really strongly recommend that you get a second opinion from a therapist who is trained in trauma and dissociation. Dissociative Identity Disorder and OSDD are very commonly misdiagnosed as schizophrenia by less knowledgeable practitioners. I am definitely not saying this is the case for you or advocating any kind of self-diagnosis. There is a lot of overlap or symptoms of DID that can be misinterpreted as symptoms of schizophrenia, especially things like memory issues, lack of emotions, shifts in perception of reality, and the feeling of thoughts not being your own. </p></div>		</li>
