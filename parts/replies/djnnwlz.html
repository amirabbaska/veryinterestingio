			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the signal be a change in voltage? Isn't that longitudinal? Been a long time since my smattering of EE classes, but I would think it would only be transverse if the signal itself were magnetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electric and magnetic field from a beam of light are both transverse to the direction of propagation (in free space). You can create a longitudinal light wave in a waveguide or plasma. </p>
<p><em>Old school</em> hard drives work on Faraday's law: a magnetic field induces an electric field (voltage) in a coil. This happens because the magnetic field in the platter pushes electrons in the coil around (very roughly). </p>
<p>Edit: see below for how modern hard drives work</p></div>		</li>
