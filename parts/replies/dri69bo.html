			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a really interesting story about the discovery of lead dating, which goes much further back then carbon. Lead dating is used to find the age of the Earth.</p>
<p>The short story is that the guy who figured it out first had to deal with the fact that basically everything in the world since like 2000 years ago is contaminated with lead. Once he learned how to clean all the lead out of his laboratory he was able to measure the age of the Earth very precisely.</p>
<p>Then he spent a few decades trying to convince everyone that they are being poisoned by lead. </p>
<p>The reason you put lead free gasoline in your car is because this guy wanted to know how old the Earth is.</p>
<p>His name is Clair Patterson

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interesting that lead is naturally radioactive. Archaeological lead has lost almost all of this such that 2,000 year old Roman lead ingots were used in the CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) neutrino detector in Italy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a layman, but that statements seems a little bit at odds with the fact that there are 4 stable isotopes of lead, and those account for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_lead" target="_blank">&gt;98% of the lead we find in nature</a>. Is Carbon also considered &quot;naturally radioactive&quot; since it has an unstable isotope? I'm genuinely curious where the line is drawn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how dates can end up looking 'too young' or 'too old' because of various things like contamination. </p>

<p>Just curious, what kind of margin of error do people think this could introduce?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define &quot;Huge&quot;.</p>
<p>If something is carbon dated to 1 million years,... does the error make it 1.1 million? Or as huge of an error as it being only 1000 years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of this is the case study of Rapa Nui (Easter Island). </p>
<p>It was initially thought that the island was colonized around 500 AD or so, as the radiocarbon dates of charcoal bits found on the island gave dates in that range. Archeologists typically rely on charcoal as a proxy of ancient human activity, as charcoal is the product of fire. However, the act of dating charcoal has its issues. Due to the nature of how trees grow, the inner rings are much older than the outside bark. This can result in the same piece of wood differing in several centuries when dated. Archaeologists have dubbed this issue &quot;old wood&quot; problem. </p>
<p>To work around this, contemporary archaeologists only select samples that don't have this in-built age issue, such as short-lived trees or seeds. Studies on these samples have reported radiocarbon dates around 1200 AD, which is now generally accepted as the colonization date of the island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember, there will be almost none left after several half-lives, so youâ€™re measuring very few existing isotopes...If you have contamination it can skew the result heavily on older items.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice answer. A follow up is &quot;how did they determine C-14's half life?&quot; I imagine that is similar to how Ernest Rutherford discovered the principle in general: <a href="http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Rutherford-half-life.html" target="_blank">by exposing gas to radiation emitters and measuring the ionization of the gas over time.</a></p></div>		</li>
