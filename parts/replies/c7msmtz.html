			<div class="markdown"><p>Priming just names the phenomenom. I think he is asking why priming occurs. Is it related to how we build memories or how we retrieve them? Why is it that priming even occcur rather than retrieving the memory without a stimulus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking &quot;Why&quot; priming occurs is the basis for an entire branch of research called Computational Cognitive Modeling, where I work. The long answer is very interesting, but requires additional contextual knowledge that I really can't teach in a single post. If you are interested, please read <a href="http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publications/pubinfo.php?id=680" target="_blank">How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe?</a> by Anderson. It describes a complete algorithmic model for talking about memory.</p>
<p>The short answer, however, is that they are connected to how we retrieve memories, as well as how we link them together. When a memory is being retrieved, there is a probability that we will recall it, rather than forget, which follows a power-law distribution based on several factors like recency of use, spreading-activation, and previous activation levels. This sounds complex, but it all boils down to a couple chunky equations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to think about it is this: Your brain is made out of neurons. All neurons essentially collect activity from other neurons, sum them up, and fire themselves if the sum of their inputs is high enough.</p>
<p>This means that for a given neuron to fire, it must have a trigger. That trigger must either come from other neurons inside the brain, or (if the neuron is connected directly to a sense organ) from a sensory stimulus. Speaking extremely loosely, the same is true of cognitive processes -- one triggers another, triggers another, etc., ad infinitum, with the triggers coming from a combination of outside (exogenous) sensory sources and inside (endogenous) sources, e.g. your memory.</p>
<p>So let's say a specific memory -- &quot;I own Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is present in your brain. But the neurons representing that memory aren't firing right now, so that concept is not active at the moment. If someone just SAYS the title of the book to you, it is fairly direct for the concept that the other person has (essentially) activated for you to trigger the activation of that memory. Hence priming.</p>
<p>However, if you are simply asked to list the books you own (which is an exogenous cue, but not a very specific one), you are essentially left with the job of coming up with job of coming up with endogenous cues to trigger the activation of memories of all the books you own. Clearly the cue of &quot;a book I own,&quot; though it may prime the memories of all the books you own to a small degree, is not a strong/specific enough trigger to activate all those memories to the level of consciousness (and for a good reason, because if they were all activated at once, that would vastly exceed your working memory capacity).</p>
<p>So you have to come up with other ways of cuing things. Think about what you'd do in that situation. You might just start randomly naming books -- in which case you might come up with a few, probably ones that are very important to you, as &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is to me (which is why when I was fishing around for a random example, it came up) -- because those are more readily available in general; the memory traces are stronger. But then you'd probably resort to strategies looking for more specific triggers, like going through the alphabet and trying to think of author names starting with A, B, C, etc. Because those cues are more specific, they provide a stronger input to activate Asimov, Baudelaire, Chomsky, etc. But alphabet letters are still not VERY specific cues for author names, so the technique is imperfect.</p>
<p>Hopefully that makes some sense. Best TL;DR I can do is: Neurons and concepts are better activated by strong, direct inputs than weak inputs. A sensory input naming a certain thing (plus the instruction &quot;remember if you own this thing&quot;) is a very strong input to trigger the memory of whether or not you own the thing. If you don't get that, you must resort to strategies for producing your own cues, but those cues (e.g. &quot;alphabet letter&quot; + &quot;abstract concept of author&quot;) are going to be much more general and thus more weakly connected to the specific memory, so they will be less successful at conjuring it up.</p>

Many responses, and not tons of time to answer all in-depth... if you REALLY care about getting an answer to something, please PM me and I will be a little more detailed/thoughtful in my response to those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it work something like a hash table in a programming language? In these, it's easy to lookup if a given key is in the table, but it takes longer to list out the whole table.</p>
<p>As a programmer, hash tables seem like a good metaphor for what's going on with Priming, but I'm wondering if there's a degree of literal truth to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to agree with both of you.  Priming only names the phenomenon - It doesn't explain the cause or the nature of memory.  I think the other (larger) part of the comment would explain it, but I don't have the book referenced.  The commenter clearly has reason to believe that human memory is &quot;associative&quot;, and that this fact underscores all the phenomena we might recognize in memory retrieval.  To laypeople, we will have to take it as the important assumption that this is true, and that the very structure of memory is composed of various &quot;links&quot; between stimulus and information.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, I often feel like I only 'remember' the majority of plot points or dialogue from books, TV or film when I experience them again. Which leads me to wonder, if I only remember them while experiencing them, have I really experienced them at all? To what extent do the themes and ideas communicated exist in my subconscious without that direct association?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why this post about priming has the most votes, because it is inaccurate. Priming is a different phenomenon than the one the OP asked about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, I was a little confused as to why priming was brought up at all... </p>
<p>Think of it like the 50 states, which is an exaggerated example. Maybe if asked to write all 50 state names (without having learned a mneumonic), you'd get 40-48. However, if somebody said the names of those final unreported states, you'd be familiar with them. Recognition is much easier, and requires a much shallower presence of a LTM connection than recall - the same reason why multiple choice is easier than fill in the blank. Incidentally, fill in the blank tends to be facilitated by priming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to disagree with your definition here. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_%28psychology%29" target="_blank">Priming</a> is a wholly different phenomenon than the question is asking about. Very briefly (and with a twist [actually more like a particular emphasis] on the definition), priming is when something (typically) perceptual at time point A influences a response at time point B (which always happens after time point A).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_tests_of_memory" target="_blank">Indirect tests of memory</a> are typically used in priming experiments. Word stem completion being a common one used in normal populations and other populations such as dementia or amnesia.</p>
<p>The OPs question references two ideas and paradigms in human memory research. The first (&quot;Why can't I list every book I know?&quot;) is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_%28memory%29" target="_blank">recall memory</a>, and specifically in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_recall" target="_blank">free recall</a> paradigm. </p>
<p>The second part (&quot;but I can tell you if I own it?&quot;) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_memory" target="_blank">recognition memory</a>. Or, depending on how we were to ask the OP (i.e., changing our paradigm a bit), it could be argued that it's cued recall (so long as we don't give them a list of all their books and other books and simply ask them to check off which is theirs). We could make a cued recall by listing, say, authors' names, passages in the book or even a character's name.</p></div>		</li>
