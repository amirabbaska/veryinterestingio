			<div class="markdown"><p>This is experiencial data from a former drug user's perspective. I'd love to hear what the scientifically informed have to say about this:</p>
<p>When I used to get sloppy with my shots and leave air bubbles in the syringe, I'd always wake up with severe joint pain. The idea in the junkie world is that the air settles near your joints (wrists mostly) and causes severe inflammation. Is that total BS, or real life?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Joint pain is typically due to arthritis, nerve inflammation, dehydration, or a viral infection. Any of these could effect a drug user.... especially the dehydration. A mere 1-2% dehydration can have major effects. (Ref. Army guide to hydration in the field).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we may be talking about 2 different things. As a drug user, did you inject into a blood vessel? So the gas went right into the blood vessel and traveled throughout the body quite quicklky. But many injections are given into the muscle or fat, which may have a different effect than if injected into the blood stream.</p>
<p>I have a different perspective--that of a SCUBA diver. I was always told when studying diving science that if you ascend too quickly, you get bubbles in your blood--&quot;the bends&quot;. One of the things that happens with the bends (among many other potential problems) is that the bubbles in the blood travel to the joints and cause joint pain. There are many other effects, but that's one of them that sounds reminiscent of what you were saying about what happened when you left bubbles in the syringe. But with a SCUBA diver with the bends, we'd be talking about a lot more gas than one little bit of gas in a syringe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I never made the connection to the decompression syndrome. You're right though that we're probably talking about different volumes of air in the blood stream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. An air embolism is possible, and it can kill you pretty quickly, by blocking blood like anything else. However, they're <em>very</em> unlikely, and it would be difficult to get one into your brain -- most places you inject things would have to go through the lungs first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A large enough bubble going from left to right side of the heart and thence to your brain, bypassing the lungs, might cause a stroke. Which might kill you. But probably not.</p></div>		</li>
