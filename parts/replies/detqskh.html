<p>One of the big names against the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is Noam Chomsky. If OP interested in Chomsky's arguments against the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, I'd suggest checking out the first chapter in his new book, What Kind of Creatures Are We?. It's a really short book and less dense than most of Chomsky's linguistic works. Basically, he says we have an internal language (i-language) inside our head, which is different for everybody, and we have an external language (e-language), which is language as most people think of it (like, for example English, Spanish, or Mandarin). He even suggests that it is possible that the evolutionary advantage of i-language could have more to do with helping people think than helping people communicate. If the whole i-language/e-language thing is true, than which e-language you speak wouldn't have the ability to change your basic perceptions because your i-language is your primary mode of thinking.</p>
<p>I, personally, haven't noticed my thinking changing from speaking a second and third language, but there's some ideas that are easier for me to communicate in one language than other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I double this.</p>
<p>I know Russian (my native) and English, currently learning Spanish. I can think the same things in any of the languages, but it doesn't change the way I think. Unless it's a language that completely lacks some concepts (like Newspeak in 1984), then it can still express the same things, just differently. </p>
<p>Continuing your Russian &quot;blue&quot; example. In Russian there is a word &quot;goluboy&quot;(голубой), which if you translate would be &quot;blue&quot;. But &quot;blue&quot; is actually &quot;siniy&quot;(синий). Why? Because &quot;goluboy&quot; is better translated as &quot;light blue&quot;. Russian has more words for it, but it doesn't mean the same things can't be expressed in English.</p>
<p>As a bilingual it is fascinating to observe both languages and how they work. But it doesn't change the fundamental ways in which I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People always freak out about how Russian has two words for what Anglophones call &quot;blue&quot; even though in English we have the same phenomenon with &quot;red&quot;. Pink is just light red, yet to us Anglophones they are separate equally vital terms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have many words for blue too. There's cyan, indigo and navy blue for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sort of thing is what I thought when I saw the blue example.  If you put two shades of blue in front of me, I would say &quot;this one is greener than the other one.&quot;  Just because I don't have separate words for them doesn't mean I can't tell the difference between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. There is an ambiguous term that refers to a certain shade of green as blue, though it's reserved for certain objects like leaves. However, this isn't technically novel. All cultures have gone through the same phases of colour development in vocabulary with certain colours appearing late. One of the more important stages is the blue green distinction. </p>
<p>The hypotheses is that we gain words for colours we see often and produce easily first. Black white etc. Blue appears last because it's hard to make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, true. But as you've pointed out, cyan is not mentioned often. I'd say in Russian the distinction is a lot more defined, so blue and cyan are treated as completely different colors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's the biggest issue per se, I think it's actually the fun of it. I mean, trying to figure out different cultures relations with diverse language groups? That's my idea of a good time.</p>
<p>Acquiring funding for such scientific research, now that's an issue. Shame we live in a society that loathes and defunds science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language is a product of culture, absolutely. But I think the relationship between language and perception is incredibly nuanced, and there's a lot more work to be done before we can even begin to figure out what's really going on.</p></div>		</li>
