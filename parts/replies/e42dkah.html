			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BoojumG" target="_blank">BoojumG</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar! In the case of meat though, it's fine surface structures causing the diffraction, rather than a thin film. In a more general sense they're both cases of microscopic features of the surface reflecting light differently at different wavelengths.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Diffraction gratings are manufactured to reflect particular wavelengths at specific angles. The gasoline performs the same role in random directions and orientations. Local thicknesses being somewhat constant cause patches of apparent constant color from the perspective of a stationary observer, like a grating would</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's mostly interference rather than diffraction and interference (even though there isn't a clear difference between both phenomena).</p>
<p>There is no spreading out of light due to diffraction. This is also the smae mechanism that makes anti-reflex glasses work but those glasses concentrate on a single wavelength when looking straigth at them (green).</p></div>		</li>
