			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two systems that control sleep. The sleep-wake homeostasis and the ciricidian rhythm. The first system is pretty simple the longer you have been awake the more sleepy you get the longer you have been asleep the less sleepy you get. The ciricidian rhythm works to keep us awake or asleep even though we have been awake or asleep long enough to satisfy the sleep-wake homeostasis. It doesn't need to be that the ciricidian rhythm is not working, but that it is working. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Got a citation for that claim?  I've seen at least three studies I can' remember here on reddit that proved it didn't, and one that said it was inconclusive.</p></div>		</li>
