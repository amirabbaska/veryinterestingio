			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Let's say someone were on a long fast or a hunger strike. Would these gas/air pockets eventually get expelled and the noises stop?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question, and made me think of a follow-up question. As I understand it, methane gas in the intestine is produced by the bacterial flora in the gut. Can these bacteria starve to death, or would they hibernate or something? And if the former, would you then have less gas production for a while, until the bacteria recover?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, grats on the fast.  I am on the O.M.A.D. (one meal a day) frequency of intermittent fasting, and I have gone for four days, once, with not much difficulty.  When you go as long as 8 days (and why 8 days?  What made you choose that number?) Did you run into any issues?  Or did you just keep the water intake nice and high, and otherwise you were fine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. So I have a clarification questions. In the first part I seems like you are saying the gas movement that causes the stomachs rumbles is always there but less noticeable. But later it seems like you are saying the muscle activity that increases later in the absence or food is what causes it. </p>
<p>So to be clear my question is this, is the cause of the gasses moving (the rumbling) a result of the muscle activity in the absence  or food? It is the same movement rumbling always there but the food itself dampens the vibrations? Is there more gas when your stomach is empty or is it the same amount as when you see full?</p>
<p>I would think that even if the activity is the same having empty Areas with gas instead of food would cause more resonances. As cavities do. Which would cause more noise. Which makes sense. I guess I am just trying to nail it down a bit more. I work in acoustics and it is interesting to consider this. The resonance of an empty cavity in the absence of food but the cavity doesn’t have solid walls so it wouldn’t quite act like a helmoltz resonator obviously. But I assume the different parts would act more like letting the air or of a balloon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the person you replied to, but it sounds like what they were saying is that, any time your stomach intestinal muscles are moving, the gas bubbles are moving.  When there is food in your stomach, the gas makes less sound due to it being dampened by the food.  And to explain why your intestinal muscles are moving when you don’t have food in you, they mentioned that your stomach sends that final signal to clear away any remaining remnants, which in turn, makes the gasses move and make sound.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A couple hours after you eat, your stomach sends signals to your brain to get your digestive system muscles working again.  </p>
<p>This process cleans up any food that was missed earlier. The stomach muscle contractions also help to make you hungry, so you eat more food that your body needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, as someone who is trying to put on weight (been skinny all my life, and have tried so hard to put on weight), would it then be advisable to eat something every 2 hours, so I can train my stomach to expand and help me gain weight?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I do eat pasta at least once a week, but eat rice, almost every day. Would that be the same thing, or are they different type of carbs?</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I am actually putting on some weight, and I think that is due to my metabolism slowing as I age. I have also started eating 2 lunches, and that seems to help, but that sometimes interferes with my dinner, as I am not as hungry.</p></div>		</li>
