			<div class="markdown"><p>Placebo does not matter if you know or do not know it is a placebo, as everyone knows that they work. The definition is just a psychological benefit gained from taking a dummy pill.</p>
<p>You have the nocebo definition very wrong, it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a detrimental effect on health produced by psychological or psychosomatic factors such as negative expectations of treatment or prognosis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So placebo is thinking treatment will work, so you feel better. Nocebo is thinking treatment <em>won't</em> work, and so you feel worse.</p></div>		</li>
