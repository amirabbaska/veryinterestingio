<p>I love the squeezed bag. I'm not like the crazy, suck-on-the-bag type or anything, but I like a nice gentle squeeze to strengthen it up.</p>
<p>I, too, drink an absurd amount of tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. TANNINS! </p>
<p>Folks who taste tea/wine/coffee for a living are all about balanced tannins. The people who are responsible for what a tea in a bag tastes like want to make sure that folks who are not regular tea drinkers don't get too many tannins in their tea, lest they think that the tea that they bought was of poor quality.  </p>
<p>Source: I once helped a high-end coffee shop chain revamp their tea program and sourced and sampled for the tasters 5 varieties of most major types of tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm pretty sure someone has something mixed up here, tannin is generally considered bitter (same as in wine), but that is unrelated to whether or not it is an acid (it could be a mild acid and therefore not noticeable)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, technically an acid only has to increase the amount of hydrogen protons* in a solution and taste is irrelevant.</p>
<p>For example, amino acids such as glutamaic acid (basically the main component msg) is an acid but doesn't taste sour. </p>
<p>Or hydrogen chloride, which tastes slightly sweet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with all of the other shit that's in your stomach.  Pure hydrochloric acid (you might know it as muriatic) definitely smells sour, and it's used as a baseline for sourness <a href="https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bitter_vs_Sour" target="_blank">https://www.diffen.com/difference/Bitter_vs_Sour</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who get acid reflux have a response where your salivary glands try to flush the acid back down.  This basic solution is called waterbrash.  If you have the acid for a short time, the waterbrash can build up a little at the back of your throat, so that if you do have reflux, the first bit of it can taste bitter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My chemistry book said that too, but it's just wrong.<br />
Think of ammonia. That's a base, and whatever else you can say about the flavour and taste (aaargh, for example) you wouldn't call it bitter.</p>
<p>Sodium and potassium hydroxide is not generally something you'd want to taste, but someone, at some point, did, and they wrote down what the experience was like, and nowhere does it say bitter.</p>
<p>Some common acids <em>are</em> sour. Citric acid, carbonic acid comes to mind, but it's pure coincidence. Butyric acid is nothing like sour, for example, as it's the common element from old gym socks, strong cheeses, vomit, etc. It's foul, but not in any way bitter.</p>
<p>Which textbook did you have? Prisma</p></div>		</li>

<p>You say not sour and not bitter. So you are saying it's neither or did you mean to say sour the second time? Also Aminophenylbutyric acid, aka Phenibut is quite sour indeed, but that might be different than on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>All acids are sour.</strong> That's because your tongue has ion channels specific to Protons.. You taste the exact thing that defines their property. Ammoniumchloride while tasting like liquorice also tastes sour btw.</p>
<p>Butyric acid does also tastes sour. But the concentrations necessary to taste that sourness are far higher than those are necessary to cause a vomit inducing smell.</p>
<p>The bitter part about bases comes from most bodily fluids that have a basic pH tasting bitter. But not all bases taste bitter as anyone can clearly try by making a pH 8 sodium hydroxide solution and tasting that.</p></div>		</li>
