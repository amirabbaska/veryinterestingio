			<div class="markdown"><p>When a building goes up, the steel is never perfect.  As a glazier, when we run the panels of glass and aluminum up, we plumb them using a laser floor to floor, which is aligned parallel to gravity at that point.  But that means each wall of the building will be different from the opposite wall.  So all buildings flare a little at the top vs the bottom?  Also once you hit about 20-30 stories, your laser level is no longer still, it moves back and forth with the building so you shoot for average middle.</p>
<p>Assuming the accuracy of the level, we were never out by a single mm from bottom to top.  Thing is with glass, you can see when it is out as you move past the building as the mirrors will reflect different things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wind makes the buildings sway way more than this, so that expressed difference is between the average position (the centre of the sway). </p>
<p>Practically, to measure the difference you'd have to monitor the distance constantly over a period of an hour (say) and average</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But of course the sway at the top of tall buildings can be way larger.  I worked on the 52nd floor in southern Manhattan.  One windy day I was leaning against a filing cabinet on one foot and the sway caused me to lose my balance.  We had a ping pong ball suspended on a string from the ceiling.  On windy days it would travel an inch or more back and forth.</p></div>		</li>
