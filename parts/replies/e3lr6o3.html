			<div class="markdown"><p>Often the sudden breakthrough that dramatically increases capacity doesn't dramatically drop the price</p>
<p>Rather than skipping from a 1TB drive for $200 to a 4TB drive for $700 that almost no one will buy, they focus efforts on a 1TB drive for $175 and offer a 2TB for $400 for those who really want the extra storage</p>
<p>You could spend a few million and make a 1 PB SSD these days, but no one will buy it so it's not worth the engineering expenses and no one offers it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have hit a few walls, but the post-wall increases weren't huge jumps (I'll let others explain that why), and the barriers weren't largely reported about outside of tech circles. </p>
<p>First wall I recall hearing about was the unreliability of data as the magnetic bits got tinier and tinier. Bits could spontaneously flip at random if you had a bunch of 1's in a row. They solved that one by using some special encoding on data as it's written, which eliminated long strings of 0's or 1's. The encoding actually added extra bits to the data (4 bits input was encoded to 5 bits on disk).</p>
<p>The second, more recent wall, is that the magnetic bits were starting to interact with each other and you couldn't push them any tighter because they were repelling each other. This they solved by rotating the bits to a vertical orientation (north/south pole of the magnetic field was now up/down rather than clockwise/counterclockwise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That rarely makes sense as an argument. What's stopping one manufacturer from launching a device with the newest tech? They'd snag a huge chunk of the market overnight. It's the same argument that used to happen with lightbulbs - &quot;they could make one that lasts forever but no one wants to lose out on ongoing sales&quot; until they actually figured how to make them last forever, and everyone got in on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the near future, SSD technology will completely replace platter drives. There's a higher theoretical capacity, performance and reliable are an order of magnitude better, and they even use less electricity.

<p>HDD's would have an advantage in archival situations over SSD's. Flash NAND is ultimately still Flash NAND, if it loses power you lose the data. Eventually the capacitors on the SSD will deplete if you leave it long enough, while a magnetic HDD is going to stay magnetic.</p>
<p>Although if we want to talk about archival use cases, optical discs or magnetic tape are better solutions than HDD's are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>SSDs have a maximum number of total write life cycles, but they're long enough that most people will never run into them.  There's also the fact that SSDs are solid state, meaning it's all chips and circuits and no moving part.  A traditional HDD has spinning platters, and read/write heads that are on a mechanical arm that moves across the platter.  Consequently with more moving parts they are actually more likely to fail during their typical lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SSD is expected to do 400 TB written before it dies. That would let me write 100 GB a day, every day, for about 10 years. The manufacturer lists mean time before failure as 1.75 million hours, or a little under 200 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's.. complicated..</p>
<p>So ssds have something called write fatigue. A section of the drive can only be overwritten a finite number of times. This limitation does not exist with platter drives than can theoretically be overwritten an infinite number of times..</p>
<p>Then we enter the real world. Modern ssds have hardware that spreads out the access load, and they typically can last up to a decade or more under very heavy use. </p>
<p>Meanwhile platter drives have moving parts that frequently break down. Overall, the SSD will likely Outlast the platter drive.</p></div>		</li>
