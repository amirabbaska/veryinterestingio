			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that something the size of a supergiant star, with a radius likely tens or hundreds of times the sun, can collapse and explode on the timescale of <em>seconds</em> is truly awesome. Something which exists for far, far longer than the reign of humans, &quot;dies&quot; in less time than it takes to sip your coffee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back of the envelope calculation says it takes about four and a half seconds for light (in a vacuum) to cross the width of the sun. So either it's actually a few minutes for something supernova sized, or else the explosion itself involves only a small part of the star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So much energy that a Hiroshima-sized hydrogen bomb, detonated at a distance of zero (straddling it), would expose you to <em>a billion times less</em> radiation than a supernova at the distance of the Sun.</p>
<p>Edit: I meant hydrogen bomb, not Hiroshima-sized (not the same). Give or take a few orders of magnitude on either end (supernovae vary too).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The smallest hydrogen bomb ever detonated had a yield of around 30 kilotons of TNT. The bomb detonated over Hiroshima had a yield of 15 kilotons of TNT. Hydrogen bombs are usually in the megaton range. (&gt;1000 kilotons)</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US stockpile we've opted for smaller more practical bombs.  All megaton bombs are H-bombs, but not all H-bombs are in the megaton range.  For example, the W78, W87, W76, and W88 (capable of delivery via ICBM or SLBM) are all H-bombs below 1MT.</p></div>		</li>
