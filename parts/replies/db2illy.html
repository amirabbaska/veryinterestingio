			<div class="markdown"><p>You can know the amount of current you have as long as you know the two other values, Voltage and Resistance.</p>
<p>To use the analogy of marbles in a pipe, if you know how forcefully you are pushing the marbles  (Voltage) and how difficult it is for the marbles to move through the pipe (Resistance) you can use this information to figure out how many marbles would move out the end of the pipe in one second.</p>
<p>This is your Current which is measured in Amperes or Amps for short.</p>
<p>So say I have a pushing force on the marbles of 10 Volts and the stickiness of the pipe is 5 Ohms.
We use this rearranged Ohms law formula to find Current:</p>
<p>Current = Voltage divided by Resistance.</p>
<p>Then we plug in our values...</p>
<p>Current = 10 Volts / 5 Ohms = 2 Amps</p>
<p>So, if we have a pushing force of 10 Volts being applied to our 5 Ohms of sticky pipe, we now know that 2 marbles will exit the pipe every second!</p>
<p>It's actually a very neat little formula for DC electricity which is nice and simple to rearrange to find an unknown thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current is a product of voltage and resistance. To find current, you need to know what the voltage across the circuit is, and what Tue total resistance of the circuit is. At a given voltage and resistance (barring other effects like inductance that don't matter in simple circuits) there is only one possible value for current, because current is directly proportional to resistance, and voltage drives current.</p>
<p>Say you have a 1 ohm resistor at one volt, it has to have one amp across it (if a power supply can't supply the current, the voltage drops). If you raise the voltage to 2 volts, it must have 2 amps. If you have 1V at 2 ohms, you get half an amp. The relation is proportional and linear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, and helps me visualize it much better than with the water-pressure/pipe-diameter analogy. It's similar to this YouTube playlist which I also found helpful: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkyBCj4JhHt8DFH9QysGWm4h_DOxT93fb" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkyBCj4JhHt8DFH9QysGWm4h_DOxT93fb</a></p>
<p>Semi-related question: In your marble analogy, how would you explain a light bulb?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a stickier pipe, you push the marbles through, and they rub on the walls, generating heat.</p>
<p>I think the analogy breaks down at magnetism, marbles don't have a marbelic field...</p></div>		</li>
