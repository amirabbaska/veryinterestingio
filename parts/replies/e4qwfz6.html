			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious actually, how do French people in general know their cheese and wine so well? I know it's stereotypical, but every French person I know (~8 of them, including some teenagers) had in depth knowledge of cheese and wine. </p>
<p>Is this something taught at school, or it's more like taught by your parents/families rigorously? Like you'd have lessons every dinner etc? Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parents and families mostly. We don't have lessons every dinner, but wine and cheese is a tradition in France, so we're exposed to a lot of discussions on which wine is better with which kind of meal or cheese, etc, so it kinda grows on us I'd say</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a much greater part of the culture, there's exponentially more cheeses available to the average family than in other countries so average people have much more exposure. Where some kind of culinary knowledge might sound elitist in the US, in France it's just a regular subject people are talking to each other.</p></div>		</li>

You can get very good cheese for about 10-15€   /kg, and good wines go for about 5€ a bottle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Agatha Christie’s fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who was very fond of the phrase.  It's a softer way of blaspheming used by much older generations, equivalent to americans saying &quot;dag nabbit&quot; instead of &quot;god dammit&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
