			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to add more details because I think this is pretty cool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>humans stand upright because it allows more efficient cooling by the wind (more vertical surface area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this also means less heat from the sun, which comes from above (and is blocked by head hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>losing body hair means less heat retention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evolving the ability to sweat from most of the body, which is an extremely efficient cooling mechanism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>human femurs are tilted inward, putting the knees closer together, making running more efficient (consider how apes lumber from side to side)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans lost foot dexterity in exchange for long feet that help with running even more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans' use of tools (eg spears) is essential to the pursuit thing, humans wouldn't do well against large creatures in a fist fight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>humans have very good eyesight, with the eyes placed medially for better depth perception (most predators have this)</p>
</li>
<li>other physiological adaptations, like having more slow twitch muscle fibres vs fast twitch.  Humans aren't nearly as strong as other primates because that isn't conducive to running for hours at a time</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, humans are the real life equivalent to slenderman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the use of tools/intelligence to carry a gourd of water along. This combined with sweating gives a real advantage over animals who rely on panting to dissipate body heat on a hot day on the savanna. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like &quot;ranged weapons&quot; are an important subset of the &quot;tool use&quot; point. We're really good at throwing pointy rocks or pointy sticks just by hand, and spear-throwers, slings, and bows all use our (possibly later-developed) tool-making ability to push that even further (plus flint-knapping for pointier rocks). </p>
<p>Standing upright also frees up our hands for toolmaking and throwing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The free hands is a big one too.  Many animals are able to walk upright, but humans are the only (?) ones known to do this for an extended period of time.  Having extra hands means it's possible to carry offspring long distances, which benefits in </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>offspring can be protected while they take longer to develop their larger brains</p>
</li>
<li>a group of humans is no longer limited to staying in an area to raise offspring, allowing for migration across large distances and eventually covering much of the planet</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't quote me on this, but I believe humans' (as in early homo species') shoulder mobility developed to favour throwing spears and such</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The standing upright also enables humans to sustain higher volume breathing, whereas 4 legged fast moving predators bodies extend and compress when they run preventing adequate sustained breathing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right I forgot about this, it helps to separate breathing rate from pace, which leads to bigger lungs and more efficient respiration </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wolves hunt like this, too, don't they? But it really looks like this is what we are made for: Eating lots of different things, whatever is around, and running long distances to hunt. Controlled by pretty good eyesight rather than smell or hearing. And maximum adaptability because brains big.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, and there are some theories on that being one of the many reasons that wolves/dogs and humans get on together so well. We are better again than canines at persistence hunting, but they are one of the only animals on earth that can come close to matching our endurance. </p></div>		</li>
