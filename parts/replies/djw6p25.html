<p>That isn't to say they can account for something like solar where you'd have to save a whole night's worth of power.  Just that they could help with the smoothing part of demand fluctuation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A flywheel is as its name suggests a heavy wheel that is spinning. This means it have a lot of stored energy. If you try to slow it down or speed it up it will resist the change. One of the most common places to find flywheels is in car engines. The engine is only outputting energy on the power stroke. And on the compression stroke the engine actually requires power. So to make the engine run smoothly there is a flywheel attached to the engine. On the power stroke the engine outputs a lot of force but the flywheel is resisting the force and only increases its speed marginally as it takes a lot of energy to make the flywheel spin much faster. Then on the compression stroke the engine outputs a force slowing down the flywheel. However due to the energy stored up in the flywheel the engine only slows down a tiny amount.</p>
<p>The power grid is similar. A three phase engine or generator (they are the same device) is magnetically coupled with the frequency of the grid. So if the frequency on the grid increases the engine speeds up and if the engine slows down it will slow down the frequency of the grid. In a power station you have a huge turbine connected to such a three phase engine. The turbine works as a flywheel in addition to a turbine due to its size and weight. When you turn on a light switch the lower resistance acts as a break on the turbine. But since it have so much stored up energy and resists changes in speed it will only slow down by a tiny fraction. This gives the grid controllers time to react to the changes in the frequency of the grid and change the output of the power stations to get the frequency up to where it should be. So instead of immediately having to produce power to power your light they have a few minutes while the turbines slows down to react. Of course a few extra lights does not matter that much but there are various other events which can change the power draw a lot. The most famous of these are the &quot;TV pickups&quot; which is when lots of people watch the same TV program and then during the break or at the end of the show they all start using their home appliances at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for this in-depth explanation! I'd always assumed that power was just stored in massive batteries, the reality (power being stored as rotational energy) is much more fascinating and sounds almost sci-fi.</p></div>		</li>

The copper colored disk on the toy is a flywheel. It is hard to see on the video, but it is spinning very fast. </p>
<p>In the video, energy (kinetic not electric energy) is produced by the man's hand and stored in that spinning metal flywheel. The toy is able to use that energy through the entire video with no further input from the man.
In other words, as the man pushes the toy, energy is fed into the flywheel making it spin faster and faster. Once he releases the toy, the flywheel releases that energy, causing the flywheel to begin slowing down and the toy to move.</p>
<p>In reality, the energy company takes the place of the man. Spinning objects connected to the grid, and other objects, take the place of the flywheel. When you turn on a light the electricity you use in that moment does not come from the power company's generators. It comes from everything else connected to the grid.</p></div>		</li>
