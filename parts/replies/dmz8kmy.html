			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there may be more to OP's question - it's not just that we have deduced that we're in a spiral galaxy...it's that we know the actual structure of the Milky Way and we know exactly where we are: about half way down the Orion arm, on the inner rim.</p>
<p>I assume the answer would be because we've mapped the distances to a whole bunch of stars using red shift, parallax, etc, and we've plotted them out, we can see the structure...but I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your assumption is correct.</p>
<p>But, the density of stars in the arms is not much higher than between them. What's different is the density of star <em>formation</em>. The brightest stars are much brighter than the others, and they do not last long, so star formation regions are much brighter than the others. So, we don't need to see every dippy little star to identify the shape of the galaxy - we need to just see and locate the brightest stars, and the nebulas.</p>
<p>Our star has alternately been in arms and between arms several times since it was formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can ask you a follow up question to that, how does our sun keep going in and out of arms?  Or to ask another way why doesn't everything rotate together at the same rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if you were in a house, stuck in one room.  Now, you want to know what you're house looks like.  How might you do that?</p>
<p>You can look out the window and see other houses.  They're all different, but can be categorized.  Brick, Cape Cod, Ranch.  It's a good bet that your house looks like one of these houses.</p>
<p>You can look around the room.  Plaster walls.  All the ranch houses on your block have drywall, so your house probably isn't a ranch.</p>
<p>Then one day somebody hands you some infrared goggles.  Suddenly you can see all through the house.  The other side of the house is a little fuzzy to make out, but you can see all sorts of things.  3 floors, radiator heating system, enclosed porch.  There's even a brick chimney running up the center of the house.</p>
<p>Aha.  You live in a brick house.  It probably looks like that other brick house down the street, except you know yours has a chimney running up the middle.  You can show everyone else in the room a picture of the brick house down the street, and ours looks just like this except we have a chimney running up the middle.</p></div>		</li>
