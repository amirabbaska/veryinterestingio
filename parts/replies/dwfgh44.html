			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many people who know just enough to get their job done, without knowing all the neat tricks. I noticed the other day that one of my coworkers would completely quit vim whenever they made a change to a script and wanted to test it. I showed them how to do <code>ctrl+Z</code> to suspend the task, and then <code>fg</code> to resume it later. I also taught someone else about <code>ctrl+S</code> freezing the screen and <code>ctrl+Q</code> unfreezing it.</p>
<p>It's called &quot;satisficing&quot;, and it's an important concept in software usability testing. When a user finds a way to get something done, they stick with it. They almost never go back and try to find a more efficient method.</p></div>		</li>
