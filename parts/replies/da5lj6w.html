			<div class="markdown"><p>From Jerry: Thank you! Me and the team had a great time making Brain Games and it was a LOT of work to make the episodes come together.  I was a mediocre science student but a HUGE science hobbyist growing up, and when I created Brain Games I kept asking myself, what can I do to make a complicated and typically inaccessible subject like neuroscience exciting to a general audience?  Once the three original one hour specials became some of the highest-rated shows ever on National Geographic Channel, they asked me to turn the show into a 1/2 hour series. Our first insight was that we'd have to go narrow and deep for the series, rather than shallow and wide like we did for the specials.   Once we had a topic approved, we'd find every journal article, study, and experiment we could get our hands on, then myself, my producing partner Adam Davis, and our writing team would think about where this particular topic/concept came into play in our daily lives. From there, we'd reverse engineer many academic experiments into games or real-world experiments, see which ones worked best, and then reach out to the scientists or researchers who did the lab experiment to get their help on crafting our &quot;gamified&quot; version.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like an incredibly intense and arduous process. That said, I think lots of people are really grateful to you for going through it, and condensing it into really approachable material. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alan -   The Google philosophy of tackling ambitious problems definitely had a role.   The key to any undertaking, at Google or anywhere else, is to find the right people, and charter them with something really exciting, on the edge of what's possible.   My engineering experience was really useful, since I could understand and contribute to the solutions.     I also think my experience as a pilot and as a skydiver contributed to the success of the project.  AE</p></div>		</li>
