<p>I wasn't aware of that, looked it up, and learned some stuff so thanks!</p>
<p>Armed with just enough knowledge to misunderstand it, I have a question.  Earth ocean pressures, from the ocean surface to the bottom of the Marianas Trench,  range from about 10^5 Pascals to 10^8 Pascals, respectively.  I think <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2007GL029297/full#grl22919-fig-0002" target="_blank">this figure</a> shows that some depths of the oceans of both Europa and Enceladus can also be in that range.  How are their immense ocean pressures any different from our immense ocean pressures, where life already has purchase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to mention is that most things about the sub surface oceans on these planets are assumed, and the depth of them is also an estimate. We barely know what's under the surface of our own planet, so you can imagine how inaccurate we could be about a body we haven't even landed on. We really need to go there.</p>
<p>The pressures you've looked at are minimum estimates, but thickness estimates vary from 200m to 60km of ice on top, so there a huge range of possible pressures, most are far above our ocean floor. But to my mind the important quantity is the depth of the sea bed. On Europa the ocean is estimated to be 50-100km thick, and Ganymede is estimated so thick the water freezes into a dense ice VI phase. Water near ice VI pressures has weaker hydrogen bonding and the sorts of chemistry possible on the ocean floor on Ganymede could be wildly different to our expectations.</p>
<p>Europa can get to -220C on the surface so depth is important for heat too. Personally I can't understand the 'thin ice' model for Europa as it suggests an ocean very close to the surface will be liquid. More likely to me would be a sea of ice with liquid around hydrothermal vents on the sea be. Here is where there will be the chemically active places where life would be more likely to form, on any system.</p></div>		</li>
