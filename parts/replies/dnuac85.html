			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of related: does doing reps of push-ups in succession- say 25 push-ups then 1 min break for 3 reps produce more muscle growth than 25 push-ups done separately throughout the day- for instance 25 push-ups in the am, 25 on lunch break, 25 at bedtime?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! You have equal volume of work done, but your intensity is far greater in the former. That would confer better adaptations (muscle fibre synthesis) provided sufficient rest between sets to replenish ATP pools. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former is better.</p>
<p>Growth is in response to stress with rest. You can stress more in a shorter time. </p>
<p>If total work was the most important factor then every heavy labourer would be the most muscle bound group of people. They are not massive muscle bound because even though few do more work than them, they don't ever do enough to induce stress. Its just routine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question that's already been give the right response. For clarity sake, 25 push ups would be your reps. The 3 (whether times a day or after 1 min rest) would be called sets. It is still clear what you're asking as the person who answered correctly didn't even mention it. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It takes the same amount of energy to move an object of given mass and volume a known distance through a constant medium</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrong.  It depends on the force exerted to move the object.  The energy expended = force*distance.  More force means more energy expended to cover the same distance.   For a fast moving vehicle like a car or plane, it's pretty clear that moving faster requires more energy, because the force of air resistance increases as speed^2 for high speeds.  Try measuring your gas mileage at 60mph vs 70mph.</p>
<p>Same is true for bicycling.  Going faster requires more energy per distance.</p>
<p>For walking/running it's less obvious, because air resistance is not the main force to overcome to move forward.  Most of the energy is lost in internal body mechanics instead, and so the biomechanics has a much greater role in determining the energy expended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With all the work going into walking robots, I wonder if they track battery usage with different types of motion. Might to track exactly with humans with our changes in metabolic rate but would be interesting none the less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A walking robot will probably have a greater mechanical efficiency. The next, well ongoing, big thing is exoskeletons. They do reduce the metabolic cost for movement in humans substantially. Their biggest advantage right now will be military settings since you can have a soldier carry extra payload, but not need to carry more energy. Wicked stuff on the horizon.</p></div>		</li>
