			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a science wizard, but I can come up with a couple of theories.</p>
<p>One is that the light draws attention. Let's say you're looking at your screen and you turn to look at the tv, but in between your screen and tv there's a blinking light. The blinking light draws attention and creates a millisecond halt in the journey your vision is taking.</p>
<p>The other theory I have is that this concept of saccadic masking or chronostasis isn't exclusive to the brain's ability to map the sequence of events between your screen and the tv. Your brain may be prioritizing the information from the end-point, while still logging information picked up along the way in the background. Again, the blinking light draws attention, and so the brain says &quot;here's the tv, I'm overlaying the last few milliseconds with what I think the tv was doing, but hey, there's this thing you might want to be aware of.&quot;</p>
<p>Both of these makes sense to me on an evolutionary standpoint, regardless of how much our brain wants our perception to be less confusing, we still need to be able to perceive threats.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so what the brain does in response is actually backwardsly fill in the period of time that you &quot;missed&quot; with what your eyes refocus on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can it do that if the time already passed? How can he backwardsly fill the gap if he didn't know what You would have looked at next?</p></div>		</li>
