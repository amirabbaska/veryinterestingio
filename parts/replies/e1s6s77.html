			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually two types of “symmetries”. One is a global symmetry, which says that two distinguishable states are equivalent in some sense. For example, spacetime translation and rotation symmetry tell us that the results of every experiment (say, scattering of electrons or production of the Higgs boson) in our universe should be the same regardless of where/when we do it or in which direction we are facing when we do it. Boost symmetry tells us that it also shouldn’t matter if we do the experiment on fixed ground or on a moving train (of constant velocity). These symmetries combine into the so-called Lorentz symmetry. Global symmetries are properties of the underlying spacetime and the shape of your system.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are gauge symmetries (or local symmetries), which are merely a result of the way we use mathematics to describe our system. For example, the electromagnetic field in quantum field theory can be seen as a collection of 4 numbers at every single point in space and time. (These correspond to the electric potential and magnetic vector potential in classical electromagnetism.) If you specify 4 numbers everywhere, then you have completely described the EM field and can calculate its possible future changes. However, not all specifications of 4 numbers everywhere are distinct. There are many ways to write 4 numbers everywhere to describe <em>the exact same electromagnetic field</em>. These equivalent field descriptions are completely indistinguishable from each other through any experiment. These gauge symmetries are therefore simply redundancies in our mathematical structure, not a fundamental feature of spacetime.</p>
<p>In summary, gauge symmetries are mathematical redundancies in describing the same state, while global symmetries are true symmetries of the system relating distinguishable states.</p>
<p>In the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the global symmetry is Lorentz symmetry, and the gauge symmetry is SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) which are matrices that related equivalent field values at every point. </p>
<p>Bonus: If gauge symmetries are a result of our choice of mathematical description, then how can it possibly be a fundamental property of elementary particle interactions? Why can’t we just choose a less redundant description? The answer lies in the subtle mathematical interplay between global and gauge symmetries. It turns out that by choosing a less redundant description, a process called gauge fixing, the equations must be written in a way which apparently spoils the global symmetry. This is often unhelpful in the search for new globally symmetric theories. Conversely, imposing a global symmetry in the mathematical formulas restricts the ways in which we can write down a field. For the EM field this requires it to be a collection of 4 numbers, not 3 or something else.</p>
<p>Bonus 2: I must point out a misconception in the question. Noether’s Theorem gives us a conservation law for every continuous symmetry (continuous like spatial translation, as opposed to discrete like mirror symmetry), not the other way around. The theorem itself cannot distinguish between global and gauge symmetry, so it gives a conservation law for each of the them. Spatial symmetry gives conservation of momentum, time translation symmetry gives conservation of energy, and the U(1) symmetry of electromagnetism gives conservation of electric charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be pointed out that the gauge is actually important in the case of spontaneous broken symmetry and when the laws describing the time evolution of the system are time dependent( see Berry phase). In those cases the gauge becomes fixed or distinguishable in a specific way. There is a deeper meaning to the mathematical description, capturing some sort of additional dimension of the system. This is still open for interpretation in physics. A useful way to think about it is that there is some sort of history to the system captured by the gauge and its properties relating to the topology of the phase space (the gauge encodes the history in its geometry). Even relations to the holographic principle can be found here but it is conceptually hard to understand. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Are these symmetries a property of the math used, or do they suggest a physical underlying symmetry in the structure/geometry of space itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of them have obvious physical interpretation, like spatial/time translation symmetries, and rotational symmetry.</p>
<p>U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) are a little harder to wrap your head around physically.</p></div>		</li>
