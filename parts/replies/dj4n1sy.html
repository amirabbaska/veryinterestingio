			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually is a nutritional advantage to eating insects. On a per kilogram basis insects consist of much more protein than a pork roast or steak or even chicken breast. And also in the less developed world as well as most of Asia it is very common to farm and eat insects as a staple in their diet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's your problem.  On a per animal basis, a cow will feed a village for a week.  A pig will feed a family for a week.  A chicken will feed a person for two days.  A grasshopper will feed a person for five minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another very good reason why our ancestors didn't  domesticate insects as food.  The purpose of a food animal is to convert indigestible vegetable matter into hamburgers and steaks, especially in the winter.  Insects are very seasonal. There aren't a lot of grasshoppers kicking around in the winter, which means they make a lousy food source.  </p></div>		</li>
