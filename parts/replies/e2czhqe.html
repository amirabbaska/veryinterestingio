			<div class="markdown"><p>About five years ago a couple of buddies and I were crossing the border. A tire came loose from somebody's trailer, heading in the opposite direction of us. It all happened so fast we barely had time to react. With a skip, hop and a bounce the tire came straight at us, bounced one final time only a few feet away from our car and luckily we passed underneath it instead of it smashing through the windshield. Nobody would survive a hit from a tire at that speed.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, realized everybody was okay then broke out into roaring laughter.</p>
<p>I hope I'll never need that kind of luck again ever in my life.</p></div>		</li>
