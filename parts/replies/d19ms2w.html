			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? So the reason Israel wants it's land is purely military strategy? I've never heard that reasoning so I'm really intrigued as to why they would forgo peace to maintain something like that. This is very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not purely military strategy no, but it's part of it.  What makes you think there would be peace?  The people would still be neighbors and would still hate each other.  If anything, giving in to demands would embolden people to try more attacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with these strategic reasons it is also about who gets what. Jerusalem is the holy city for Judaism and Islam. Israel would never part with that territory and that is a territory Muslims covet. As well as if Israel gives up land what guarantees peace? The terrorists live among the civilians in the Palestinian territories so giving them more land doesn't get rid of the problem (the terrorists) on the Palestinian side. On the Israel side the current government is not a true representation of the people because the current Prime Minister is not open to negotiations at all, even though the young generation of Israelis want to start peace negotiations. Without talking progress is never going to happen. </p>
<p>Full Disclosure: I am an American Jew who tries to educate myself on both sides of the situation. That is why I say the small percentage of the people, who are terrorists, living among the peaceful civilians is the problem. Most Palestinians want peace so they can end the oppressive lifestyle they have come to live. Just like any religion there are extremists on both sides and until those people and their families are re-educated there will be no peace, regardless of two-state proposals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Israel is microscopic.   If it's main city were destroyed,  the country would more or less be gone. </p>
<p>Intercepting the few airplane bombers it would take to wreak untold havoc on literally the entire county,  takes about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Israel is surrounded by a bunch of countries historically bent on its extermination, who are a 15 minute plane ride away from doing just that.  They need all the land they can get simply to have enough warning for the intercept. </p></div>		</li>

About half of Israel is green. Israelis have irrigated large parts of the desert for agricultural use. </p></div>		</li>
