As you sit there in the absence of normal signals it starts to look for even the smallest signal it thinks it’s getting. Then it tries to make logical sense of that tiny signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been a cave tour guide. Caves are one of the few places that can be pitch black once you go deep enough. If you wave your hand in front of your face while in absolute darkness, your brain will let you &quot;see&quot; your hand. You literally can't see it (no light), but your brain knows it's there.  You'll imagine that you can see a &quot;shadow hand&quot; where your hand should be.</p>
<p>You can test this by unexpectedly poking someone in the face. Even if they can &quot;see&quot; their hand, they won't be able to see yours. </p>
<p>Proprioception is weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really going to bake your noodle is that your eyes lie to you all day every day.  Each eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve enters, you can't see through it.  It's a hole in your vision.  It's on opposite sides for each eye, so there's enough data for your brain to fill it in.  But if you close one eye, do you detect a hole?  It's there.  Your brain is filling it in with whatever it thinks is there.  I'd lay in bed at night and line up the red light on my smoke detector just right... and make it disappear.  Scared the shit outa me.  <a href="https://visionaryeyecare.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/eye-test-find-your-blind-spot-in-each-eye/" target="_blank">Give it a try!</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be light receptor cells in our eyes misfiring. These are certain conditions that might cause an light sensing neuron to misfire. For instance if you rub your eyes hard you can see specs of light as the pressure from rubbing can cause the neurons to misfire. Some also happens if you get up fast, as blood pressure changes rapidly. Brain simply try to process the info coming from the eyes.</p>
<p>This can also be happening at “brain level”. Same way why when there is no one to talk, our brain starts to run imaginary dialogues in our head. Or when people are put into a completely silent room, they start hearing voices (there are some reports of people begging to go out as it turned scary very fast.
Hard to say why it happens. Maybe it happens all the time but external stimuli are simply to strong for us to realize these. In a environment devoid of external stimulus, our brain might have a chance to focus on these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that if you don't have the ability to see by certain age, you never will - as the brain undergoes critical development of visual systems in that time and without that they literally can't make sense of anything they see. People who lose their sight later in life; however, do experience some very interesting hallucinations. Check out Oliver Sack's TED talk on the subject

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently this also happens to people who get hearing aids later in life when they've never heard anything before. They can suddenly hear all this noise but it's a jumbled mess of voices, the TV, the cars outside, the wind. Their brain never developed the 'skill' of separating and making sense of all those noises so the person has no clue what they all are at first.</p></div>		</li>
