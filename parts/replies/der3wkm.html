Basically &quot;ELI5 what exactly makes an index of refraction?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The index of refraction is a number that tells you how much slower light moves in a material compared to vacuum.  Air has an index pretty close to 1, so light travels at close to the speed of light in vacuum.  Water has an index of 1.33, so light travels at c/1.33 or 25% slower in water.</p>
<p>When light moves through a material the oscillating electric fields (ignoring magnetic materials for now since most things aren't magnetic), can jiggle electrons back and forth.  The light energy gets converted into the energy of the electrons moving, but then the jiggling electrons gets converted back into light (moving electric charges create electromagnetic waves).  There's a tiny time delay each time this happens.  The more electrons the light encounters, the more this happens.  So materials that have a lot of electrons that respond to light slow light down and have larger indexes of refraction.</p>
<p>In an idealized picture, all the light that gets absorbed gets re-emitted without losing energy and there's no net &quot;absorption&quot; by the material.  However, if the electrons can lose energy by other processes (like bumping into nucleii) then some of the light energy can be absorbed and converted into heat, or other things.</p>
<p>In reality it's not nearly this simple.  For instance, metals are super reflective for visible light and absorb what light enters into them pretty strongly.  But if you go to the ultraviolet or x-rays, they barely reflect light at all, but absorb very strongly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if I got this right: So one could say it tells you how &quot;hard&quot; it is for the light to get through. The harder it is to travel through, the more will be reflected (depending on the angle). But what makes the difference between light that tries to go through and gets absorbed (no reflection, no see-through) an light that actually goes through (no reflection, see-through)? I'm not completely sure how the angle of the light, smoothness of the surface and &quot;hardness&quot; of the material all come together.</p></div>		</li>
