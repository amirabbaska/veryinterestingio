			<div class="markdown"><p>Addiction is defined as a compulsive desire for the 'thing' -drugs, gambling whatever. </p>
<p>Not a very good definition if you are trying to study it! If you are doing a study on rats how do you know when they have a compulsive desire for something? What we do then is we take something measurable and use that instead. We might do something like, the amount of cocaine they take in a day time. </p></div>		</li>
