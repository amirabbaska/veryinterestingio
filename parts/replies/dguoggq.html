			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not kidding about your aside.  I think this is a big reason why smoking rates are so high among labor workers -- it effectively gets you an extra 15-20 min of break time each day.</p>
<p>On a job where you might have 30 minutes break all day, smoking can be a big release for dealing with occupational stress because of the ability to remove yourself from the situation and cool down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in restaurants and hotels before, and it isn't so much the extra breaks - they never bothered me for some reason, maybe I just had reasonable coworkers who didn't abuse the system, or at least were skilled at ducking out. For me it was more about not being able to just hang outside and contemplate without looking like a loiterer. You know, like when you're at a party and you don't have a drink in your hand, kind of the odd-man out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was gonna say, in restaraunts, generally smokers are the only ones who actually get a break. If you asked for 5 min to go eat, or just sit down and do nothing, you'll get looked at crooked. But say hey I need a smoke, they say I'm next! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skilled at ducking out most likely. Well, kinda both.
I've worked in restaurants before, and as a smoker, learned some of the rules.</p>
<p>Basically if you leave during a rush you're an asshole. You're essentially telling the team fuck off they're all taking the work load for the next 5 minutes. However, if your team also smokes, then you guys just decide amongst yourselves to do some sort of rotation. </p>
<p>That all being said, usually boss-man doesn't like people dipping out during a rush, cause that's irresponsible. </p>
<p>I used to duck out into the back alley, have 1/3 of a smoke and leave it burning (stuck it to a pin in the wall) while rushing around. I might've been missing for all of 30 seconds so people don't really realize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a very high stress retail job. Every single person there smoked, even the super religious indian guy. That was the kind of job where a 15 minute break was as good as sex for relaxation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a non-smoker I used to walk out with the smokers every hour (on the hour) for 5-10mins. A) it was more social and B) it's only fair</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're just standing on a city street outside a building, and your hands aren't occupied (they're just in your pockets or they're just hanging there at your sides), you automatically feel and look like the most awkward fuck in the world.</p>
<p>But if you're smoking a cigarette - hey, suddenly nothing is awkward anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I have found that earbuds have offered something of an alternative. They offer others a reason why you are outside away from the noise, they're visually minimalistic, they permit you to be laid-back without seeming aloof because you can use just one to maintain openness to socialization. Put on some lo-fi hip-hop and you have something like an auditory equivalent of a cigarette.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As an aside, I am sometimes  jealous of smokers from time to time, because if a smoker goes outside and just feels the night air for a bit, takes a few minutes to themselves, then no one questions them. If I do the same, then people are looking out the window, asking you what you're doing out there, why are you outside, etc.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say this all the time!! People are like, just do it anyway. But they clearly haven't tried it. If you see someone standing 25' away from a building with their hands in their pockets people passing by are like, wtf is that dude doing. No one questions or even notices a smoker. They have a clear purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. While I understand this point, I'd also point out that SOME people always notice smokers and may make them self conscious as well. I always watch out for kids downwind, joggers, white women crinkling their nose (jk...) </p></div>		</li>
