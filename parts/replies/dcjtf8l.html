			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. A bit more background, the letter &quot;q&quot; probably comes via Etruscan as a sign for a sound always joined by the /w/ sound. This narrow usage was maintained in distinction to the &quot;c&quot; and &quot;k&quot; letters which were used indiscriminately for the voiceless velar plosive. (Early Latins apparently didn't have a &quot;g&quot; sound, so missed what was going on with Greek gamma. &quot;G&quot; shows up in like the third century before the common era.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only thing that I associate with this is &quot;wikipedia&quot;.</p>
<p>The correct correct answer is the Roman (and Etruscan. And Greek) alphabet is descended from the Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>And Phoenician was a Semitic language in which, as in modern Arabic and modern Hebrew, you have two different k sounds and two different letters to represent them:</p>
<p>כ</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ק</p>
<p>The latter one is spoken closer to your throat. Now, Roman was no Semitic language and had only one K sound. But when you say &quot;Ku&quot; the K sounds somewhatish like the Semite ק. So this became their only use for that letter.</p>
<p>As for Etruscan - it's not deciphered yet and there's no chance to tell what it sounded like because there are no related languages left in existance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an ancient philologist, so just reporting from a class. My notes don't indicate bibliographic sources.</p>
<p>The professor argued that the current consensus is that Etruscan phonology is reasonably reconstructed (though of course the &quot;language&quot; isn't), and they seem to have lost the distinction between voiced/unvoiced velars plosives. (My Semitic work is limited to rudimentary Arabic, so I apologize that my linguist speak just sticks to the simple terms common in Romance languages.) Etruscan inscriptions attest that their equivalents to k/q were used before different vowels. So it's an orthographic rather than a sound distinction. (And I was wrong there--so thanks for pushing me to revisit my notes.) But the q letter comes from Etruscan, not the Chalcidic Greek alphabet that early Latin borrowed so much from.</p></div>		</li>
