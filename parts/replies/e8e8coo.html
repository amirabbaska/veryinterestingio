			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it comes down to the size of the organ donated, but you have to die in order to donate lungs and certain sizes don't come around as often. Shorter people tend to have a longer wait time because their are fewer lungs that fit their rib cage so there are less options available. They basically just have to sit and wait for someone with the not only the proper lung size by also the proper blood type and antibodies to die in their organ donation region. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just mean smaller people, they just tend to be women. It's also not just height, it's ribcage size and lung volume. You can be short with a large ribcage and lungs with an abnormally large lung volume and vice versa. But typically our longest waitlists are short women around 5' or under just because lungs that size don't come around often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living donor liver transplant is possible, and relatively common in South Korea and Japan. And yes, smaller recipients might be better candidates for living donor transplants. </p>
<p>In the US, however, the vast majority of liver transplants are from deceased donors. It is not trivial to become a liver donor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't really answer my question. If they can transplant small pieces of liver from a live donor why can't they do the same from a deceased donor?</p></div>		</li>
