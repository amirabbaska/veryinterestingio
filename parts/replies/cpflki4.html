			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, for teaching me something new, and for reminding me that I'm not half as smart as I would sometimes like to believe. I imagine that if I hung around more folks like yourself (while also lowering the number of those I hung around who would tend to fall into the category of my current friend circle), I probably wouldn't have that issue (thinking I'm smarter than I am). But since that isnt a very likely scenario, I can at least be thankful that I have the internets to assist me in remembering this fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I like to think of myself as smart, I pale before the people who actually did the research I'm talking about, so credit where credit is due. Thanks though :)</p>
<p>One thing I've learned however, is that most people have fairly similar inherent abilities to be &quot;smart&quot;, it's just how they channel their mental energy, and what societies define as &quot;smart fields&quot;. For example, I simply spend a lot of time reading about neurology. Like a crazy amount, it's almost like a second reddit for me when I'm bored or eating lunch at work. Yet in other fields I consistently struggle because I find it much harder to spend the time practicing them. I want to learn programming, yet I've learned at a glacial pace (and still am pretty much only an intermediate programmer after years of doing it) compared to my peers. Same thing with math (in fact, I'm absolutely terrible at it, but once again I find that when I put the effort in I begin to surprise myself).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Generally intelligence just governs how fast you can learn things (learning being memorization and integration; both recalling and understanding sufficiently to implement a concept). Unless you're on the extremely low-end of the IQ scale (i.e borderline intellectually disabled), you probably have roughly similar capabilities to someone on the upper end of the scale. You and me may not have won the genetic raffle like Einstein, but we could still learn advanced mathematics if we really set our minds to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People that suddenly wake up from a coma after several years and with a relatively intact mental state are pretty much medical marvels, and it's usually because of very light and precise brain damage.</p>

<p>TIL Big Boss is retarded.</p>
<p>Seriously though, very interesting! So all the stories of &quot;I was in a coma for 15 years and woke up just wanting a Whopper&quot; are product of the media?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but they are very very rare. Most people that awaken from comas smoothly without any (or very little) issue were only them in for at most a month.</p>
<p>Not only is a long-term coma indicative of severe brain damage; there are consequences to the brain being kept in the &quot;off state&quot; for so long. Normal maintenance procedures that maintain memory and other functions do not proceed, so there is a gradual deterioration if the brain is comatose for a very long time.</p></div>		</li>
