<p>Vacuum affects the efficiency with which a rocket engine works, but doesn't stop it from working altogether</p>

<p>What? If by &quot;affects the efficiency&quot; you mean makes it more efficient then yes otherwise no you are completely wrong.</p>
<p>Rocket engines are more efficient in a vaccum than in an atmosphere as no energy needs to be wasted on overcoming the atmospheric back pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope that’s not what I’m saying. Rocket efficiency is measured by specific impulse. In a vacuum this is higher irrespective of the rocket.</p>
<p>Conceptually if the atmosphere was at the same pressure as the rocket chamber pressure you would have zero thrust. In a vacuum you get the maximum thrust for your energy expenditure. It’s got nothing to do with the motion of the rocket. This applies even if the rocket is fixed in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer the OP is probably looking for. To simplify it even further, draw a simple picture of a rocket, with the bottom being open (seriously, so it. It will make it so easy to understand). Inside the rocket draw arrows, one that points up, one down, one left, and one right. Those arrows represent force built up in the engine by the burning fuel. The arrows that point left and right are equal but opposite so they cancel each other out. The rocket does not move left or right. The arrow pointing up is not canceled by the arrow pointing down, because the downward force is able to escape. Since you have more upward force than you have downward force, the rocket moves up! </p></div>		</li>
