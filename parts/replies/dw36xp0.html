<p>It happens between objects that aren't gravitationally bound in any significant way. For instance, Andromeda is approaching the Milky Way, and all the galaxies in the local group will eventually merge. The scale at which you can see this happening is between galaxy clusters and larger. Also the further away something is, the faster it is expanding away from us.</p>
<p>So gravity overcomes expansion on the galactic cluster scale and smaller.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe were expanding even faster, would gravity stop being the deciding factor? To go straight to the extreme, is there a rate of expansion that could pull apart all the atoms on earth? Or even more extreme, that could rip the atoms themselves apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe is expanding at the speed of 74.2 km/s/Mpc where Mpc is megaparsec which is aproximately 3.26 million lightyears. This means that 2 objects that are 3.26Mpc apart are moving away from eachother at 74.2km/s. </p>
<p>This doesn't affect objects that are in the same galaxy. Our galaxy is only 100,000 lightyears across and gravity is strong enough to hold objects together despite the expanding space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, plain old Newtonian motion is also responsible for a lot of the expansion of space, especially in the beginning.</p>
<p>Metric expansion is supposed to have been very important during the first incredibly small fraction of a second of the Big Bang, or the inflationary period, but after that, plain old inertia would have completely dominated the expansion of space until we started seeing distances large enough for the cosmological constant to matter.</p>
<p>The effect of this is that the expansion of the universe was slowing down for the majority of the universe's lifetime, and only began accelerating ~5 billion years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the balloon has a down (in toward the interior of the balloon) and a up (out and away from the surface of the balloon). As best we can tell no such equivalent orthogonal directions exist for our universe.</p>
<p>The surface of the balloon is an approximately 2D surface. The reason it has and up and down is that a balloon as we know it is a continuous, spherical surface embedded in the 3D space we are familiar with. For the universe to have equivalent orhtogonal 'up' and 'downs' as the balloon has would imply that our universe is embedded in a space with (at least) 4 spatial dimensions. Again, as best as we can tell there is no such 4D space so the balloon analogy doesn't hold.</p>
<p>The balloon analogy gives people the wrong intuition about the universe because it reinforces the notion that the expansion can't happen without an interior getting larger and some exterior space getting that much smaller. </p></div>		</li>
