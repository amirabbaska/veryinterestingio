<p>That's fundamentally how every computer works. We need a metaphor for a whole bunch of mathematical booleans... Which we accomplish by having a swarm of analog electrical potentials that either interfere or reinforce one another as they travel through different kinds of paths. </p>
<p>We approximate our abstract digital model by making sure that almost everything is either clearly-above or clearly-below a certain voltage.</p>
<p>Pretty much all computation is about finding a way to map your problem on to universal laws so that the answer comes from how a thing simply has to <em>be.</em> Whether with gears, chemicals, electrical circuits, or newer quantum effects.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just find the use of analog calculation as a remarkably pure application of using physics to be the model of the abstraction. </p>
<p>With digital modelling, there is quite a significant conceptual translation going on. Analog calculus can be this funny exercise of: &quot;if I melt some metal to join this tiny stick of fused graphite to this big coil of wire and stick this funny little battery in parallel to the whole deal, I can measure the voltage with respect to time and simulate how wind resistance might affect the fall of this conical paper cup.&quot;</p>
<p>All the doodads are quite literal translations to what they do for the abstraction and they're made of stuff that is conceptually understandable like woodworking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers are typically digital. The voltage levels equate to either a 1 (there is voltage) or 0 (there is no voltage.)</p>
<p>Analog systems are more of a &quot;between 0 and x&quot; voltage. The problem with analog systems is the voltage ranges are wildly different between systems.</p>
<p>These days ADC/DAC (Analog to digital converter, and vise versa) are used between digital computers (microcontrollers anf microprocessors) and analog equipment. They will send 1s and 0s in a pattern that indicates the analog value input.  This is called a PWM or Pulse width managed signal.  How it works is very simple if you see an example.  Example: Low analog signal: 00000100000, high analog signa:l 1110011100111.</p>
<p>LED s are actually a good analog vs digital example.  To dim an old light, we used a variable resistor and reduced the voltage to the light.  LED s have a nominal input voltage, so if you use a resistive dimmer, you will have a very short lived LED.  In contrast, an &quot;LED dimmer&quot; uses PWM and basically flickers the light on and off faster than you can see (but you can often catch it with a high frame rate camera.)</p>

<p>Analog computing acts directly on the signal. Put in signal, get out integral of signal. Never digitize.</p></div>		</li>
