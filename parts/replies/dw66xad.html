			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting take on it and I think you're right. Sometimes the feeling of accomplishment comes from solving the problem, then implementing the solution is just tedious.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly how I feel, too. I seem to loose interest in the obstacle I had to overcome because the hard and therefore interesting part is over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what it is for me too. I attribute it to my sense of achievement in overcoming the intellectual challenge of the problem, and take no great joy in the final realization. This fits with my Meyers Briggs profile, actually. I’m hard core INTP and that’s how we experience the world. I need special motivation to push a project through to completion. Causes trouble at work, I’m viewed by my bosses as brilliant but not productive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, not sure about this. It depends on the type of task and what you're measuring by the %s</p>
<p>For example - - I have an exam tomorrow (yes, on a Saturday, I'll be accepting pity now /jk). My study process is compiling all the material into an organized study guide and then finding a way to comprehend the connections between the disjointed material that I've detailed (ie a mental mapping). In terms of time, the study guide took forever. This last part will take the rest of today, whereas I've been working nonstop since Monday on the guide. When measuring time, the Pareto principle doesn't work. However, if you qualify it with knowledge, then the study guide is essentially useless aside from memorization. The mental mapping is how I will retain information. In that way, perhaps it is 80% of the work.</p>
<p>But either way, I still don't want to fucking do it. </p></div>		</li>
