			<div class="markdown"><p>The overall efficiency would depend on a large number of variables, and will be different for different reactor/turbine setups.</p>
<p>There is however a fundamental upper limit to the efficiency called the Carnot effeciency, which depends on the temperature of the reactor and the temperature of the coolant (whether it's water or mercury or air).</p>
<p>If your reactor is running at 1000C and you use 20C water, the absolute most energy you can get out is around %77.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is quite heavy and fairly viscous and so will take much work to move around. It also is highly toxic.</p>
<p>An ideal coolant has low viscosity and high heat capacity without being toxic or corrosive. Water is a good coolant for all of these reasons, but molten salt and lighter metals are also used because they have a wide temperature range in which they are liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's tons of more energy losses in the system than you described. Anyway, the typical efficiency of a nuclear power plant is around 30-35%. That may seem low to you, it is low in comparison to some methods. But there are several reasons why this low efficiency doesn't really matter much. Mainly the cost of nuclear fuel.</p></div>		</li>
