			<div class="markdown"><p>Like most things in biology it's complicated- there are heritable cases but they are the minority. Families can also pass down versions of genes that increase the risk of Autism. But it's not like other diseases where there are just one or two genes that are THE risk factors. There are potentially thousands of genes which need to be broken in various combinations of 3 or 5.. etc to produce autism. </p>
<p>So that's the part that's being studied: what in brain development is being changed by these combinations and not others?</p></div>		</li>
