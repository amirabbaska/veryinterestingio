			<div class="markdown"><p>when the Big Bang happened, since everything was at a relatively close distance, condensed into an infinitesimally small point (I think), how did it expand large enough fast enough to allow for millions of light years to exist between different points in our universe without breaking the laws of physics? Since light is the fastest thing in the universe, how did matter distance itself enough to where all light hasn't been allowed to reach us? </p></div>		</li>

Does the spacetime bulk not obey the speed of light? </p>
<p>I'd like to know more and also how did we discover this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you arrived at the next big puzzle piece of the 20th century, inflation. Yes, the universe expanded at a rate faster than the speed of light but empty space is not a particle, merely the space in which particles sit, and therefore expanding faster than light does not invalidate the 'speed limit'. The Universe here is not even moving, the space between two points are being stretched. Nothing is moving, only new space is being created.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\(cosmology\)" target="_blank">Inflation</a> theory is accepted by most scientists, as a number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation. </p>
<p>Many physicists also believe that inflation explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos, why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the Universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the universe as a Cartesian coordinate plane. Light is the fastest moving thing on the plane. Now think of the plane being stretched, and that’s like the expansion of the universe. Nothing within the plane is actually moving, yet the distances between everything grows. Since nothing is moving within the plane, but the plane is stretching, there is theoretically no limitation to the speed of expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several particles move at “the speed of light”. Light is just easier to visualise in the mind.</p>
<p>What is more correct is that light (and some other particles) move according to some other unknown Atomic (ie. indivisible) field which may not even be consistent throughout the Universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite. Because space is expanding at constantly increasing rate stars will continue to get away from us faster and faster and gradually less of their light will reach us. Eventually all of the sky will go dark</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if the speed of the expansion of the universe remains faster than the speed of the light coming at us, right? (is it even the case?)</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the expansion of the universe is now and has always been slowing down from whatever its initial speed was where as the speed of light is a constant in space...</p>
<p>I am not as much saying you aren't correct, as much as I am saying I am more confused. :/</p>
<p>EDIT: never mind, I just saw that you stated the speed of expansion is increasing. That would explain it but I either forgot or didn't follow learning that was the case...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity holds our galaxy together, this works much faster than any expansion of space effect.  Eventually there will be no other visible <em>galaxies</em> , the sky won't go dark other than by ours getting old and dying of its own accord</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. That's where the expansion of the Universe comes into play. As the Universe ages it will also expand, causing the radiated light from distant stars to be infinitely red shifted and never reach us. In the far future our observable universe will only consist of that which is sufficiently gravitationally bound to us which is not more than some 50 galaxies that belong to the Local Group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are also wrong. </p>
<p>The expansion of the Universe is key, since we are already bathed in the cosmic radio wave background. </p>
<p>Although granted, that light is not from stars, it still lights up the Earth from any direction. </p>
<p>That light has already reached us, from the edge of the observable universe, and it was redshifted. </p>
<p>What you fail to mention is that the world also isn't infinitely large, at least not the part that is observable. </p>
<p>The particle horizon isn't even infinitely large. </p>
<p>And the expansion of the universe makes sure that even if it was, the light would still never reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you say, the CMB is not star light which is what OPs question was about. For the CMBs red shift the expansion <em>is</em> key, <del>but not the current day expansion. The CMB red shift occured mostly due to inflation</del>. EDIT: Scratch that, I realized just as I hit send that the CMB originates from the Recombination era which occured after the Inflation era. I'm rusty, I apologize for that mistake.</p>
<p>The fact that &quot;the observable world&quot; (I guess you mean our observable universe?) isn't infinitely large is due to the age of the Universe being finite.</p></div>		</li>
