<p>This is definitively the correct answer. Seafloor rocks preserve the magnetic orientation of the earth's field at the time they formed and this can be measured qualitatively, usually by a sensor dragged by a boat. The distance between reversals can be used to determine the rates of spreading or subduction at various point on the geological timescale.</p></div>		</li>
