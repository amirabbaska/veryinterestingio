			<div class="markdown"><p>If that's the case, how are there still rings around Saturn? Especially rings with persistent density patterns and gaps between them. </p>
<p>We would only need the probe to be in a stable orbit for one millionth of the timeframe that those rings have existed (to give us 4500 years). Surely, if we had the delta-v to reach such an orbit, it would have been stable enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the rings are not stable. Most of the rings will dissipear into Saturn eventually and many areas of the rings are constantly depositing their contents on to moons surfaces (several of the moons that orbit in the rings have a deposited ridge along the middle of them from all the material accreting on to it). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be difficult to keep it into a stable orbit due to all of Saturn's moons. And you wouldn't want to risk it crashing into one of those moons and possible contaminate anything on those moons. If Cassini still has Earth microbes on it and it accidentally crashes on a moon like Enceladus, it would put doubt into any real microbes found in future missions to the moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(And a side thought: I loved the Huygens mission, but isn't that a little contrary to the &quot;no contamination&quot; goal?)</p></div>		</li>
