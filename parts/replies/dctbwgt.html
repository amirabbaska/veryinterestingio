			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I heard it, it was a Francophobe thing way back when. Lieutenant is a French word meaning someone who holds a position when the higher up is away. It was briefly replaced by Steadholder (basically just a literal translation) when we were at war with them, because who'd want to take orders from a Frenchman? Afterwards it reverted, but was still pronounced oddly to make it more 'English-y'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lieu- Tenant comes from a French term meant to be left in tenancy or command of a unit, usually a Platoon.</p>
<p>When used in English it became left tenant. That's how it was explained to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes from the French &quot;lieu&quot; which means place, and &quot;tenant&quot; which means holder; so place-holder.  Lieu is pronounced roughly as &quot;lyeeuh&quot;, which would smooth out to &quot;loo&quot; over time.</p></div>		</li>
