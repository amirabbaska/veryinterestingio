			<div class="markdown"><p>I upvoted you.  But I'd like to add the general weather and draw of Cali in the early 1900's drew such a wide variety of people that the culture of the state become a big draw.  Most of us just revel in the quality of sushi, Mexican , Indian foods we have.  Etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I always wondered why tech became big in Cali vs elsewhere. The Boston/Cambridge area has amazing scientific and engineering talent with Harvard &amp; MIT. However they're more focused on trying to save the world through technology and research (e.g. clean water initiatives, solar energy in Africa, MIT's Media Lab, etc). Opportunity/entrepreneurship, which is rooted in the DNA of tech companies in Silicon Valley, doesn't seem to be as vibrant in Boston. The only thing I could surmise is that the Gold Rush, coupled with Manifest Destiny and westward expansion, rooted the entrepreneurial ethos that's now commonplace.</p>
<p>And of course the weather also plays a part I'm sure.</p></div>		</li>
