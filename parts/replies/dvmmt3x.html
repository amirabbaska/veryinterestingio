Dumb bitch, I knew I wasn't crazy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was 14 back in '87 and I had read an article about greenhouse gases and their effects on the environment (time magazine if I'm not mistaken), a few days later, in science class the teacher was talking about pollution, and I mentioned greenhouse gases, he shut me up saying that we are not talking about agriculture, not allowing me to finish my sentence and proceeded to make fun of me... </p>
<p>Since then I have a serious aversion to teachers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 5th grade my teacher called me a baby for using glue to create a 3D effect to drawings I did once it dried clear. I was told this is an actual technique (or similar to one) and that teacher was an idiot.</p>
<p>Teachers are great and underpaid, but a lot of people are idiots pushing their idiocy onto more kids who blindly trust them. The one thing we should be teaching kids is that while you listen to the teacher, it doesn't mean the teacher knows everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! It forms in your eye, not on the wall. Even if you don't or can't focus on it, the pattern will still be sharp. It's easiest to see this if you normally need glasses and remove them.</p>
<p>Also the direction it moves when you move your head tells you whether you are focused too close or too far.</p></div>		</li>

Sometimes it's as simple as dirty, scratched, or poorly made lense.  <a href="https://youtu.be/8xGK1bNAyR4?t=17s" target="_blank">Tutorial</a> - <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8xGK1bNAyR4/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">before/after</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually I started just seeing random colors and patterns to the point I couldn't distinguish anything at all. If I had known how bad it was going to be I would have never done it.  </p>
<p>They had to stop mine midway because I was trembling too much. I had to wait until my nerves calmed to try again.  No idea why they didn't offer me drugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this shouldn't be true either, because if you see the laser like that due to reflective interference, then seeing the laser directly in a surgery like this would mean there's no interference. </p></div>		</li>
