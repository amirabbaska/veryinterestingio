			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, I would say that pizza delivers well. What I mean by this is that a delivered pizza tastes basically the same as a fresh one. Most other places that would deliver (basically fast food) tend have a large number of fried items on the menu. Fried items really don't travel well; they get cold and soggy very quickly. Another type of place that delivers and is well known for it is Jimmy Jon's, and just like most pizza places they have no fried items on the menu.</p></div>		</li>
