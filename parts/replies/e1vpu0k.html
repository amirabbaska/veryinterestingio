			<div class="markdown"><p>Women were considered property because property cannot be assigned guilt or causation under law. Women were and still are, in many conservative cultures, treated more like a respectable animal that the husband (from German house-bund i.e. the chief of house) owns. Also why historically a cheating wife is a shame for husband and a bad reflection on the character of the man she is cheating with. In fact, bad behavior of wife was seen as failure to train her by the husband - which is why you will see some cultures tolerating wife-beating, and which is husband beating is still considered a funny joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he meant our modern day perception of this came from European succession. Other cultures may have had similar ideas but Western cultureâ€™s perception came from Europe. Which makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
