			<div class="markdown"><p>I know OP was not asking how to deal with this issue but for me, the best method to actually get to sleep when I run into this problem is to essentially meditate. I lay flat on my back and use mind-clearing techniques like imagining that I am slowly erasing a giant chalkboard or watching a giant aquarium fill up with inky blackness (anything to just not think of anything in particular from the real world).</p>
<p>I also will systematically relax each part of my body one by one. Starting with my head, jaw, shoulders, arms, torso, legs, toes, repeat. About 5\~10 minutes of all that and I'm ready to just roll over and conk out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope your advice helps some people, as sleeping issues really really suck. Personally, I find any kind of meditation/mindfullness/&quot;forced relaxation&quot; just extremely frustrating; it makes my mind go wild and at best I just get really bored, at worst (and more common) I get a lot of anxiety.</p>
<p>What has helped for me is finding kind of a specific sleeping environment. It's commonly said &quot;only lie in your bed when you're gonna sleep&quot;, and I think that can be great advice! For my aspie mind, my sleeping environment is the bathtub. Completely dark, the semi-rythmic, semi-random whooshing of the pipes, and the weightlessness of the water.</p>
<p>So, to add to your post, for those where meditation et cetera doesn't work, you might want to try getting a specific sleeping environment and condition yourself only to go there to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being bored and/or anxious is a big deal for me while meditating.</p>
<p>All i have to say about that is to focus, then you won't think of being bored. Can't do nothin' about the anxiety, though. Just meditate in a better place i guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of inky blackness, I pretend I am being covered in the Venom suit/goo, except instead of it making me violent/etc it has a regenerative effect, like its supposed to put me to sleep and heal me/make me stronger/protect me etc. </p>
<p>I then tend to just imagine what other things the suit can do for me, and that usually takes my mind off reality for a while, hopefully influencing my dreams (its better to have superpowers in dreams, no?).</p>
<p>Anyways just my 2 cents.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First, your body is all, &quot;Ugh, I'm tired. I wanna go to sleep. I'm so sleepy.&quot; But you say, &quot;Too bad, body, we're not going to sleep now.&quot; Then, eventually, your body is like, &quot;Dang, we're staying up all day/night, there must be a good reason for it! Like some kind of threat! We better be super alert!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why don't these two parts of the brain 'speak' to each other? if <em>I</em> know I'm not up for any good reason, surely my <em>brain</em> knows it too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of evolution. The complexity of the human brain didn't just appear out of thin air. It was a gradual process, starting with the brain of the primitive species that were our evolutionary ancestors, and then slowly introducing &quot;features&quot; to the brain as species became more and more complex over time. So we're left with the human part of the brain built on top of the lizard part of the brain, while still retaining the features of the lizard brain, like the fight or flight response</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'lizard brain' part does sometimes seem to be controlled by (or at least responsive to) the more recent human part, though, as I replied to somebody else:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought this, though since we can have adrenaline reactions to other modern threats which appear require conscious understanding (like a criminal receiving a sentence, or something), it does seem that conscious understanding can affect the pituitary gland. How come it 'listens' in that case but not when we're just staying up gaming too late?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment you replied to reminds me of something - the brain being aware of its own faults, and yet not fixing them despite such knowledge.</p>
<p>Why is that a thing? For example, i dunno - fallacies. If someone knows all types of logical fallacies, they can try to not commit them, but why? If you know about them, it means your brain also does, so why doesn't it just fix itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;you&quot; that knows you're up is the outer mantle of your brain, the cortex. The part that regulates the release of adrenaline is the pituary gland, which is just a dumb hormone machine and can't distinguish between being up playing video games all night (which is VERY recent, evolutionarily) and being up because of an earthquake or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as your brain is concerned, video games are a good enough reason to stay awake. Your conscious brain is in charge of whether you decide to stare at bright lights for hours at a time or go to bed when you first start feeling tired. When you ignore feeling tired and refuse to go to bed, that is one part of your brain &quot;speaking&quot; to another, saying &quot;Alright bud let's do this. Release the turbo drugs!&quot;.   </p>
<p>If <em>you</em> know you're up too late but don't care, your <em>brain</em> knows you're up too late but <em>doesn't care</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, I never quite thought of it as being adrenaline, though I do find myself a bit more excitable in such a state sometimes.</p>
<p>Stupid question because I'm (ironically) tired and half busy at work:</p>
<p>Part of the issue when I'm in those states is that I don't even <em>want</em> to sleep from a mental standpoint. It's like drinking or something and your inhibitions weaken and what little discipline I would have had to go to bed on time evaporates and I usually ride out the wakefulness until I feel pretty tired, which means I'm often getting like 5.5 hours of sleep. It's a shitty cycle.</p></div>		</li>
