			<div class="markdown"><p>He should have said something more like most life on earth or all eukaryotes.</p>
<p>Eukarya are organisms with nuceli and membrane bound organelles basically.  (animals, plants, fungi, and protists).  We all have mitochondria where we produce ATP.  The citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle is basically how we break the carbons down that we got from the sugar and then get things that we feed into the electron transport chain.  </p>
<p>Plants still do this to make energy.  They have mitochondria just like you.  They just also have the apparatus to do photosynthesis first in order to make the sugar that they feed into the citric acid cycle.</p>
<p>More fundamentally when thinking of organisms, the two questions are where do they get the energy to function and where do they get their carbons.</p>
<p>Plants get their energy from sunlight and can fix atmospheric carbon.  They are photoautotrophs.  It is possible to use light for energy and not be able to use atmospheric carbon and thus be a photoheterotroph.  There are bacteria that are photoheterotrophs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! All eukaryotes, and many types of prokaryotes. IIRC, most if not all prokaryotes can carry out glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, but these occur entirely in the cytoplasm, whereas these processes are partitioned between the cytoplasm and mitochondria in eukaryotes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally mean all living cells. Photosynthetic plants do have an obvious difference in anabolic processes (building of molecules) in their harnessing of the energy of light to build sugars, but the catabolic processes (breakdown of organic molecules to release energy) in plant cells are very similar to those in animal cells.</p></div>		</li>
