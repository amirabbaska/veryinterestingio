			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also packaging materials (films) that are selectively permeable to allow certain gases out and other gases in so the atmosphere is controlled.  This is essential for produce that respires a lot, like lettuce.</p>
<p>This is only so effective though, so if you want lettuce that lasts longer try to find it in the most complete form. Roots still attached is ideal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, the modified atmosphere for red meat (where I live, Denmark) is 70-80 % oxygen to keep the meat red and enticing and 20-30 % carbondioxide to slow microbial growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc the science of the bags used for lettuce and ready made salads is a closely guarded industry secret and which bag they use varies on the type of vegetable.  Has to do with the plastics permeability to moisture and oxygen.</p>
