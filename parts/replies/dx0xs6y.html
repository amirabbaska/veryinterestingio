<p>Really? If the water is being boiled into steam inside the food anyway, it seems to me that it should still be applying a positive pressure. I would think that the issue is that an overcrowded fryer drops the temperature of the oil enough that it doesn't boil the water inside the food fast enough to prevent the oil from entering -- a temperature issue rather than a &quot;room for steam&quot; issue. Is this incorrect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, you've got it right.  </p>
<p>I've worked in kitchens/restaurants for years and you don't overload the fryer because it reduces the temp too much and then you just have the food <em>soaking</em> in warm oil rather than <em>frying</em> in hot oil.  </p>
<p>They kind of had the right idea since the consequence of oil that isn't hot enough is that it won't steam the moisture out of whatever you're trying to fry but indeed it has nothing to do with the space being too crowded for the steam to escape (which would only be possible with a high pressure environment like a pressure cooker or maybe if you packed the fryer with a pneumatic press).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't places like Kentucky Fried Chicken uses pressure fryers precisely to prevent the steam from escaping? Ideally, you want a layer of steam between the food and the oil, but you don't want the steam to escape because then it'll dry out your food.</p></div>		</li>
