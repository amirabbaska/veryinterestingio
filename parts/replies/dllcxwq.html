			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so interesting because I've read that taking at least 30 min is good. So maybe I'll try the 15 min thing. And I'm starting to get addicted to coffee... So we'll see how that goes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Try to base your nap time around not hitting the deep(er) sleep area(s) and you'll feel great waking up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends: people have different sleep patterns and needs.</p>
<p>If I don't take a nap after lunch (1200-1230 pm), I will feel drowsy around 2-3 pm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How old are you if I may ask? I had the same attitude   up until somewhere around 23-24 and after that some days the mid-day nap became essentially mandatory if I wanted to feel alive after work. Not every day but deffinitely once or twice a week. I still have no clue why this happens though as I get about 8 hours of sleep most nights (physically am not able to sleep more than 9 hours at once).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who sleeps for 15 minutes? It takes me an hour just to FALL asleep when I lay in bed. In fact, just knowing that I'll only be able to sleep 15 minutes will make me too anxious to fall asleep. rThe exception is when I fall asleep on the ride back from work on the train. I fall into a deep syrupy REM sleep instantly and then wake up 40 minutes later like a disoriented, weak, zombie.</p></div>		</li>
