<p>The nice thing about the unit system of &quot;radians per second&quot; is that velocity is just the product of that number and the radius. So an atom at a radius of 1m spinning at a rate of 350 radians per second would have a tangential velocity (relative to the center) of 350 m/s.</p>

<p>About 5%. <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/HighSchool/Sound/speedinmaterials.htm" target="_blank">The speed of sound in aluminum is over 6300 m/s</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, 350 m/s is about the speed of sound in air, so with some minor improvements in material quality, you could build a disk that spins so fast that the edge breaks the speed of sound in air. I have no idea what kind of sound it would make, though. Sonic booms are always shown as being generated tangentially to an object, so I don't know if a sonic boom would be generated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll take your calculations for it, but I think I remember an episode of Infinite Monkey Cage where they said that the theoretical maximum rpm that you could spin an object was when it’s tip speed approached the speed of sound for that material. </p>
<p>In their discussion the concept being considered was a bar of very long length spinning about its center so it’s possible that the calculations would be different. </p>
<p>By the way, where is the highest concentration of stress in a spinning disk?  Does it matter if the disk has a center hole?</p></div>		</li>
