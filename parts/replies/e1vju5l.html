			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how the film <em>Midnight Cowboy</em> originally received an &quot;X&quot; rating when it was released in 1969 (the only X-rated film ever to win best picture at the Academy Awards.)</p>
<p>Watching it today, it hardly even seems worthy of an &quot;R&quot; rating (which is what it currently has.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Watching it today, it still deserves an X-Rating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the Motion Picture Association of America didn't like that the pornography industry co-opted the (un-copyrighted) X rating. The MPAA then copyrighted &quot;NC-17&quot; to use in lieu of &quot;X.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the switch to NC-17 was due to the fact that when audiences saw a film was X Rated they then assumed it would be pornography. By using NC-17, mainstream studios could release films or edits of films like director's cuts that were more violent, etc. that were not pornographic, and actually have a viewing audience. The adult film industry kept using the X Rating, even though by that point, their films rarely got official ratings from the ratings board.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly equivalent.</p>
<p>In the USA, the rating system is done by the MPAA, a private organization. While most theaters use it there's no legal standing requiring that theaters must enforce the rating.</p>
<p>In most other countries, ratings are enforced by the government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A private puritan organization. Everyone should watch &quot;This Film is Not Yet Rated&quot;. The MPAA has no standards or guidelines, just a bunch of old, usually white, usually Christian, usually conservative people deciding on a whim what to rate a movie. All manor of gratuitous violence? 13A. Some non consentual hetero sexual action, showing very explicit details? Let's give it an R. A woman going down on another (in a more romantic framing, and not terribly explicit)? NC17! Can't have kids corrupted by the portrayal of two women loving each other! </p></div>		</li>
