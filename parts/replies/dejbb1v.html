			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, it could be that I'm not seeing the point because I'm an adult, and I would consider barging in on a conversation between F and G to be rude, while maybe a younger person would think nothing of it? Is that possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that's it. I never barge in on conversations like this, but my step-daughters do, and I know people the generation younger than me who have met boyfriends/girlfriends like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there any way to stop these conversations that I'm never going to participate in from being displayed in my feed? I've Googled but can't find anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've barged in before, but usually because I don't notice that it is on G's page rather than F's, and I always feel pretty bad about it. I know some people barge in like it's nothing, though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What really annoys me is when I see these conversations but the person who started the post has the settings such that even if I wanted to, I couldn't comment without adding the people. It's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, I had assumed that only public posts were shown. Do &quot;friends-only&quot; posts of G get shown to all the friends of F, if F comments? That seems like a really bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do too. I've dropped family members from my friends list because they bring shit to my conversations with other people. </p></div>		</li>
