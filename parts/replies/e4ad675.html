			<div class="markdown"><p>They claim there is a prototype, but in crowdfunding there's a gap between prototypes and mass production that most companies don't cross. Amabrush is another one. We're not very confident in these 2 so far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it probably would have to be custom made.  I remember when I got braces back in high school, the orthodontist took a mold of my teeth before and after using this plaster like substance.  You could invert that mold and use a 3D printer to draw the custom device.</p></div>		</li>
