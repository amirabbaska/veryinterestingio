			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 I'm Amazon's dream customer now. I literally search Amazon first and will often buy something that isn't quite what I wanted just on the basis of getting it from Amazon on Prime. Its become very rare I shop online anywhere else now, unless it's something specialist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, Plus Walmart Just changed their Price Match Policy to allow managers to decide what to match, well our walmart will not match amazon AT ALL.  I talked to the manager, and told him that gives me absolutely no reason to come to walmart now, because we have dedicated grocery stores here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if what I want somewhere else is less but cost of shipping two day raises the final cost within a buck or two of the Amazon cost, then I'm ordering from Amazon with Prime shipping.</p>
<p>Contrary, if I can source something I what I want immediately, locally vs. Amazon+Prime, I'll but it locally even if it costs more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure.  Even if it's a few dollars more I'll buy from Amazon to save on the shipping.  I've bought stuff from sellers on Amazon that was cheaper than their own website.  </p>
<p>It's amazingly convenient and arrives in 2 days.  I order mundane shit through there just because I don't want to have to go to a store.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Before Prime I'd always weigh waiting for an item as an additional drawback.</p>
<p>Also, just the fact that shipping isn't tacked on to the price makes me more likely to buy (even if I'm paying in other ways...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to that. I started out on a free trial of Prime a year ago then forgot to cancel it before the automatic fee for a year subscription. Instead of disputing the charge I thought fuck it and gave it a go. Spent the whole year buying a bunch of shit. Way more than the cost of the membership a few times over. I'm a victim of the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But is this really irrational?</p>
<p>Prime makes a lot of shopping much much easier. So once the typical customer takes their first delivery two days post-order at no extra charge -- wouldn't this customer perceive higher utility from Amazon, thereby rationally leading them to use the service again and again?</p>
<p>Also, I'd be interested to know how much of a customer's &quot;Amazon spend&quot; growth is siphoned from other services, and how much is entirely new spending.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be that it's all purely rational. I'd suspect that there's more to it than that, but you're absolutely right that my speculation isn't relevant so I've removed it from my original comment.  </p></div>		</li>
