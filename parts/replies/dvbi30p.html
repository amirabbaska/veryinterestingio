			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on, the reason for burning magnesium is that it burns at such a high temperature (~2500K) that the radiance is very strong and seen as extremely bright light by humans. The relation between radiance and temperature is explained by Stefan-Boltzmanns law (assuming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body radiation</a>) as T^4 , meaning the radiance greatly increases with temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>doing the maths using <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wien.html" target="_blank">Wien's Displacement Law</a>, you would need to heat a black body to 20 million Kelvin for the peak emission to roughly match the main gamma peak of decaying uranium.</p>
<p>Sorry, 200 million Kelvin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's possible but the amount of energy needed is many orders of magnitude greater than a chemical reaction like this can provide. Gamma radiation is defined as radiation caused by the decay of an atomic nucleus. They usually have energy over 100 keV where visible light is around 2 to 3 eV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One place where you do find <strong>thermal</strong> keV-radiation are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk" target="_blank">accretion disks</a>. Here the process with the highest energy release known to exist, the release of gravitational potential energy during the accretion on a compact object such as a black hole or a neutron star, heats the material to many millions of Kelvin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also increase the power, assuming the oxygen balance was not to bad. The higher temperatures produced by magnesium combustion accelerate the rest of the combustion and provides heat to the combustion products. Though this effect is not limitless, as magnesium combustion by itself produces a lower volume of gaseous products than the combustion of a carbonaceous fuel. This is why high-performance solid rocket motors use a few percent magnesium or aluminum in their formulations.</p>
<p>Also, minor correction, you mean empty N2O canisters. I don't know of anyone who would have NO2 canisters outside of specialized laboratories.</p></div>		</li>
