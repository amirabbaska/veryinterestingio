<p>Basically, in order to not have any leaf shade the one below it, it makes sense to use an irrational ratio. Phi works out so that the next leaf always ends up in the biggest gap. It's obviously not the only successful strategy (see plants with alternate or opposite leaves), but its emergence is far from unexplainable.</p>
<p>Edit: people were looking for a more rigorous source than a Vi Hart video (understandable), so here are some of her sources:
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematical-lives-plants" target="_blank">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mathematical-lives-plants</a> - an article of the pop science genre, discussing the reasons that the golden angle shows up (discussed below by /u/travisdoesmath)
<a href="http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/math.html" target="_blank">http://www.math.smith.edu/phyllo/About/math.html</a> - similar to above</p>

<p>To me, these things has mostly brought a feeling that it's cool how it turns up so often. I don't think it's weird or magical or anything like that, I just think it's cool that something that common in nature can be explained with a mathematical function. It's a feeling of awe, but that feeling can be had even if you know the explanation to why nature acts this way.</p></div>		</li>
