			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, my pops passed from ARDS in 1992. He was 46. Initially he had a shitty cold that kept him in bed for like 4 days. He said his chest sounded like”Rice Krispies” and decided to go to the dr. Dr’s. decided to keep him over night to give him fluids and rest cuz he had a little pneumonia in right lung. Next morning mom comes into my room bawling and says your dad has a 50/50 chance of living. Whole right lung filled with fluid and half left. He went into a coma and we pulled the plug 8 days later. Real effing ugly to watch as a 15 yr old,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article in the paper about a local woman who got a strep throat. Otherwise healthy. She went to the doctor, got antibiotics, but a week later it got worse and turned into a sepsis. It ended with her having to have both arms, both legs and parts of her face amputated. It seemed like she's living a pretty happy life with her family despite it, but jfc, a simple throat infection ending up costing you your limbs and potentially your life is scary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my Army buddies got sick on Friday, but still went to work. After he got out he tried to go to sick call and see a doctor but they had just closed for the day so he just went home for bed rest over the weekend. When he didn't show up to work on Monday they went to his room and found him dead. I think he was 23 at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is crazy to think about how common events like that were in the pre antibiotic era- tuberculosis, diphtheria, salmonella, pertussis (whooping cough) were all extremely lethal diseases. We have lived without them so long people forget about how lethal those diseases were and that is how we get the anti vaccination movement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My dad died a month ago from either a cold or the flu triggering acute myocarditis. Basically his heart became inflamed from the infection and he went into acute heart failure. The most common warning sign is feeling very cold (it's a sign the heart isn't pumping well).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flu can also lead to sepsis, which in turn can lead to multi-organ failure and death.  This is not isolated to the elderly or frail either.  That 21 year old fitness guy in Pennsylvania or something died from this around the holidays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s what happened to me in 2012. I started having symptoms of flu Saturday afternoon, went to the ER Saturday night, discharged Sunday morning, went into respiratory arrest about 90 minutes after getting home, ambulance
back to the hospital and intubation for 10 days. I spent 23 total days hospitalized and could barely walk or sit up when I was discharged. I wasn’t fully mobile until about 4 months later and My voice didn’t fully recover for about a year. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sure reddit has turned me into a hypochondriac.</p>
<p>whenever I jump in these threads I start getting scared as hell because all of the anecdotal evidence of redditors knowing people who've died and no one saying anything about statistically what the chances are of actually catching the flu or being diagnosed with <blank> disease are. now i just want to sit inside my house forever trying to avoid all human contact.</p></div>		</li>
