			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, ash is not really an element, it's what we call the left over minerals and other chemicals that combustion doesn't consume. It's also really useful stuff. If you dump your ash in a bucket and mix it with water, you get a caustic water you can use to make many different chemicals, or even soap if you allow it to saponificate fats and oils. </p>
<p>When living things grow they absorb some of the minerals and metals from the soil but the plant has no use for most of it, so it locks it away in it's body and when you burn it, you leave these minerals and metals behind. Ash is high in metal content, arsenic, lead, and other substances found in soil. Even uranium sometimes! </p>
<p>I like to learn about how we got to where we are, and how we used to do things. I think it would be really cool if somebody wrote a book that told someone how to bootstrap technology in a desert island situation. Like using just knowledge, being able to rebuild higher technologies from simple beginnings and what you have on hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher starting heat. You don't need to soak it in starter fluid though and some of the best coal out there is quite hard to get burning, but it has a ton of kcals once you do. When you light wood on fire, the wood gas acts like a kind of starter fuel. Carbon doesn't have one so you should usually get it going with some scrunched up newspaper stuffed into the center and stacked for good airflow. Airflow is key for a good burn anyway. </p>
<p>Not so much in a BBQ unless you want to turn your meat into carbon as well, but using charcoal or coal coke in mfg processes they blast air into it and it will melt steel. </p></div>		</li>
