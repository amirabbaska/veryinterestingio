			<div class="markdown"><p>That max $650 kills it.  Our flights out to Hawaii for our honeymoon are almost $1000  each from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I did mean round trip.  So I guess in the occurrence of getting bumped it would be one way worth $500.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like a number that hasn't been updated for a while. I'm sure there are plenty of flights that cost more than $325.</p>
<p>It almost doesn't make sense. If the aim is to punish airlines for being dodgy and overselling flights, why put an arbitrary cap on how much they have to reimburse your for your time and money?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because the airline industry had a hand in making the rule and the punishment.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your destination <strong>between one and two hours</strong> after your original arrival time (between one and four hours on international flights), <strong>the airline must pay you an amount equal to 200% of your <em>one-way fare</em> to your final destination that day, with a $650 maximum.</strong></p>
<p>If the substitute transportation is scheduled to get you to your destination <strong>more than two hours later (four hours internationally), or if the airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements for you, the compensation doubles (400% of your <em>one-way</em> fare, $1300 maximum).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, if you paid $1,000 each way for each ticket in economy, you probably overpaid. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want free stuff, volunteer a few times, I'm pretty sure they keep a list of people that are willing to be bumped.  I used to fly all the time for work and I was always willing to be bumped for free tickets since I like to travel.  Eventually they would actually call me to to the desk to ask if I would get bumped for a free ticket, of course, I actually didn't know you could get money. </p>
<p>Protips: If you want tickets, be sure and ask for an unrestricted ticket, I dont remember an airline that was unwilling to give me an unrestricted ticket to anywhere they flew.  Also you can get them to give you a food voucher, generally $20 - $50, but I got a couple $100's.  Usually they're no good for alcohol so you'll have to do some horse trading at the bar with a couple steak dinners.  Play your cards right and you'll get free booze + friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tbh, I just want to get where I am going on time, which is why I switched to driving, but I still fly more than most people.  It's just that if I had known I would probably at least have gotten some sort of compensation, and maybe even established a reputation, although I don't know if that's a good or bad thing as far as getting there on time is concerned.</p></div>		</li>
