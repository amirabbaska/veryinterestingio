<p>One add on to this - inflation theoretically incentivizes people to spend money now, rather than wait. </p>
<p>Example: Suppose you wanted to buy a pack of baseball cards. If you could buy a pack of baseball cards today for $3 or you could buy it in two weeks when the price has risen to $3.50, when would you buy the baseball cards? Now, right?</p>
<p>The baseball cards haven't changed or become more valuable. The value of the money has changed, and become less valuable. But if you have the 3 dollars initially, it actually drops in value if you wait those 2 weeks relative to the value of the baseball cards. So, it makes more sense to spend the money before its value drops relative to goods and services.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to that: Inflation above trivial amounts becomes a means of coercing investment of savings.</p>
<p>Let us assume you have enough money saved to build a four bedroom house on the outskirts of a city (and let's call that $150k).</p>
<p>If inflation is 2%, after 5 years of leaving your money idle you would now have about 90% of the money required to build a four bedroom house. If it is 5%, you would have closer to 75%.</p>
<p>Maybe you lack the knowledge, time or inclination to carry out that project. In that scenario, you can loan the money to another who will then invest it. Or you can loan it to a bank (via a savings account or term deposit) and they will then loan it to an investor for a cut of the profits.</p>
<p>Contrast this to if you had 0 inflation. There is no imperative to invest and so in the absence of government intervention, that house probably would not get built.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think wages are stagnating too much, but this isn't a fair comparison. </p>
<p>Your stated 8x increase is from a high paying job at the time ($5 a day) to a minimum wage job now ($58 a day, or 10x). </p>
<p>A factory job these days pays more like 30-40k on the low end ($14 an hour, or $115 a day). This is a 23x increase. </p></div>		</li>
