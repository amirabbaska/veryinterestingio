			<div class="markdown"><p>0/0 is indeterminate, not undefined.</p>
<p>n/0 where n is not equal to zero, however, is undefined under most number lines because approaching the function n/x from the left gives you a result of -infinity at x=0 and approaching the function from the right gives you +infinity also at x=0. As such, at the point x=0 there are two possible values to choose from which makes the function undefined.</p>
<p>It should be noted this is a problem that is fixed using the Projectively Extended Real Line which posits that both negative and positive infinity are one and the same. This can be thought of as a circle with zero at the bottom. Going along either side of the circle (either positive or negative for right and left side of the circle, respectively) will lead you to the same point at the top, which is infinity. Under this extension of the number line, the n/0 is defined to be infinity as the function n/x being approached from both the right AND the left as x approaches 0 will give infinity, which leads to n/0 being defined as infinity under this extension of the number line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're taking a limit, 0/0 is an indeterminant form. Otherwise, it is undefined.</p>
<p>You can completely throw out calculus and limits, and you still get that division by zero is undefined thanks to algebra. In my opinion anyway, this is the better approach to why division by zero must (should perhaps?) be undefined. Whether you can do calculus or not, you can't simultaneously have a number system with operations that behave like addition and multiplication, <em>and</em> make sense of division by zero. You must lose something to make sense of division by zero. In algebra world, you're stuck in the zero ring. If you insist on going to the Projectively Extended Reals, you lose an ordering. Sure, you can make sense of division by zero, but not without losing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow it must be because it's early but I just realized I basically wrote exactly what you did. I guess when I saw 0/0 is undefined my mind went kaplutz and judged your post unfairly, so I apologize sincerely for that and for the combatative or &quot;I know more than you know&quot; tone if there was one, it wasn't my intention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has anyone made a case that 1/0 equals infinity?  1/0.0000000000001 makes a big giant number, and extrapolating onward it seems infinity works.  I'm sure mathematics has been over that though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, and if you try to work out a system where 1/0 = ∞, then you'll end up with something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line" target="_blank">projectively extended real number line</a>, where that statement holds true. The problem now is that 0*∞ isn't defined, so you no longer have that division is the opposite of multiplication.</p></div>		</li>
