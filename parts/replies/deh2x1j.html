			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't talking about the &quot;food,&quot; just the calories. If someone on a diet wanted to eat a greasy hamburger, are they doing themselves just as much of a disservice whether they sit down and eat it in one go or if they cut it up and eat it over a week?</p></div>		</li>

<p>To lose weight, you just have to burn more calories than you consume.  But to do a mcdonalds diet, you have to make sure you're getting enough of your other nutrients like iron, potassium, vitamin b, etc.  </p>
<p>Focusing too heavily on one thing can make you nutrient deficient even if you're getting enough calories.  That's why you see rich vegans whose children are suffering malnutrition.  Insulin/glucose is another thing that can get thrown vastly out of whack by an unbalanced diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the better way to ask what OP asked in that comment would be if it was an extra 1000 calories in the diet. Does our body handle it differently if it is all at once vs spread out over the day or longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are wrong. Your body will shit less if it has less nutrition. For the same reason that corn niblets will remain recognizable in your stool for longer than cornbread, if your body is given more time to absorb the nutrients in your food it will allow it unless something better comes along. This is why you should chew more - your stomach takes over where you mouth leaves off.</p>
<p>This is a tedious series of sentences and regrettable.</p></div>		</li>
