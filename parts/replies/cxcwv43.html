<p>Any society using energy obtained from a source not directly part of their natural energy cycle will eventually run into this problem. Yes, even oil and coal burning societies, assuming there is enough fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is so far fetched and is like saying &quot;In 1000 years we'll run out of X&quot; but who knows what society will be like in 1000 years or even the population there could be wars or famines that signficantly reduce the population in the meantime. Or maybe we'll just all get stuck in VR and drop our energy output as no one makes anything anymore.</p></div>		</li>
