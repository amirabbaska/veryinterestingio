			<div class="markdown"><p>Light is slowed by the refractive index of the material used. </p>
<p>Only way to avoid it, is to use empty space. </p>
<p>But in empty space, the light isn't guided, so doesn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OPs comment was a little misleading. It isn't the speed differential itself that makes sending data across the medium possible, but rather the speed differential is a side effect of the medium used to guide it to it's destination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the word of signal propogation is fast enough to be on the same scale as light for speed... Yeah I know you're probably just cracking a joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, OP did say speed of <em>light</em> in a copper cable. It's not really a joke - copper conducts heat/electricity, but is pretty much entirely opaque to light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of energy transfer by electrons or other charged particles in a conductor is not the &quot;speed of light&quot;. It doesn't even happen at anywhere near the speed of light. Only special cases of electromagnetic field propagation can be considered &quot;light&quot;. A standard copper wire is not a waveguide. Come on, precision is important!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to distinguish between the speed of light and the phase velocity of light. Light always travels at a constant speed, it's just that when it travels through a medium it bounces between atoms or gets absorbed and retransmitted through an atom, which increases the time it takes to move through the medium.</p></div>		</li>
