			<div class="markdown"><p>No urban myth. One of the symptoms of the plague, was a rash that encircled the neck, and was called a 'ring of roses.' Another thing that came from the plague, was the act of saying 'bless you' when someone sneezes. Because, a preliminary symptom was to be seen to have a cold. So if you sneezed, it was assumed you had the plague, and were going to shortly die.</p></div>		</li>
