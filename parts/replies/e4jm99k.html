			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's the only correct answer.</p>
<p>I can say a few things about rising bubbles: small bubbles rise in a straight line. They rise with a terminal velocity that depends on their size; the larger the bubble, the faster it rises. </p>
<p>However, when the bubble gets too large, it doesn't rise in a straight way anymore. Instead, the path becomes skewed. Larger bubbles change the rise direction, even larger ones go on a spiral path. Then, vortex shedding sets in, then the shape of the bubble itself starts oscillating. Very large bubbles break up into smaller pieces. </p>
<p>All these later rising behaviors are associated with a smaller terminal velocity. So, you can say, the largest bubble that is still rising in a straight way is the fastest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that it's unintuitive - but a lot of assumptions are used to arrive at these theoretical results. If those assumptions are satisfied in a real system, then it's likely that the theory will give us a fairly accurate fit to experimental data.</p>
<p>If you check out eqn. 2 in the source and follow the references, you can see what some of those assumptions are! </p></div>		</li>
