			<div class="markdown"><p>No but I've experienced the same thing, all the dark black space in my closed eye flashes bright white and then it's gone. So quickly that I almost forget it even happened. No clue what it is thought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I experienced that once, it was like an explosion right in my face while I was falling asleep. Heard a loud bang and it was scary and really confusing. Never happened again though. I also have that visual snow thing but I never knew that it was something we don't all have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exploding head syndrome makes sense. I was diagnosed with a narcolepsy and my REM onset is ~2-3 minutes after I fall asleep. I experience sleep paralysis about twice a month as well.. Thanks for the input. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me too, though when I talk to anyone about it they have no idea what I'm talking about. I've always just assumed it's some minor form of synaesthesia brought on by the lack of stimulus to the eyes. As a predominantly sight based entity I assume my body just gives that perceived flash as an extra warning.  I have no proof of this but to be fair it's not detrimental so I've never really looked into it too far</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good answers here but no one mentioned exploding head syndrome. It's basically what you described but it's a mentally produced loud bang and not an actual bang others could hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was just about to mention this. When I get these noises, they're usually accompanied by visuals too.</p></div>		</li>
