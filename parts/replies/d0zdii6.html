			<div class="markdown"><p>My linear algebra professor actually talked about this today. He said that there's another one (103993/33102) that approximates pi to 9 digits of accuracy using only a denominator between 10^4 and 10^5 (which in a simple case would produce only 4 digits of accuracy (i.e. 31415/10000)). He said they're found somehow using continued fractions. I'm not sure how, but it all sounded really cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continued fractions can be generated by repeatedly taking off the integer part and then taking the reciprocal of what's left. If we do this with pi, the integer parts we take off are 3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, etc.</p>
<p>Now if we write that as a fraction which regenerates the original number, we end up with 3 + 1/(7 + 1/(15 + 1/(1 +  1/(292 +... etc, and then a sufficient number of close parentheses.</p>
<p>Note that we have some places which are effectively 1/(x + 1/Y) where Y is a relatively large number, like 15 or 292. 1/Y is therefore pretty close to 0 and this means we can cheat a bit, actually write 1/Y as 0 and thus cut off the continued fraction there.</p>
<p>If we write 1/15 as 0 in the above, we find pi ~= 3+1/7 = 22/7.</p>
<p>Leaving 1/15 as is and writing 1/292 as 0, we find the approximation 3+16/113 = 355/113</p>
<p>Now, there's another trick at play here. We can also write 1/(x + 1/y) where y is 1 as 1/(x + 1) and cut off right there instead.</p>
<p>Doing this at 292 turns 292 into 293 and we generate the 103993/33102 approximation.</p>
<p>This is also technically what happened at prior to 292, because the 1 rolls into the 15 and makes it 16. Both tricks happened to coincide there because a 1 fell before a large number.</p>
<p>With that all said, the best approximation with a denominator under 10^5 is 312689/99532 (which comes from taking the first 1/2 to be 0)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>103993/33102?  So I have to memorize 11 digits in order to get nine digits of accuracy?  No thanks.  I'll just memorize pi directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't recall saying you had to memorize this number nor that it's practical to. The purpose of my comment was how it's cool that a denominator that small can produce that many digits of accuracy. It's not even practical to memorize the 6 digits (355/113) as stated by the original poster that I replied to. You're memorizing 6 digits for 6 digits of accuracy. You may as well just memorize pi directly that way too considering with those 6 digits you'd need a calculator as well. </p></div>		</li>
