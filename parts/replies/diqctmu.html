<p>Sucking air isn't negative pressure? Can someone eli5?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't get too caught up in the semantics of it. All they are saying is that the act of sucking is done with the mouth while breathing comes from the muscles in the chest. Think of sucking on a straw to drink. There is no expansion or compression of the ribcage, because you're not using that part of your body to breathe while drinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sucking in air is the result of the negative pressure you created. The poster was just being more technical. Think of the air as a spring, because it can be compressed or expanded. Creating a POSITIVE pressure would be like compressing both ends of a spring, when you release it would push outward. Creating a NEGATIVE pressure is the reverse, pulling on both ends of a spring, it wants to pull inwards. To suck in air, your lungs create an &quot;expanded spring&quot; that causes air to enter your lungs to allow this &quot;spring&quot; to contract to normal. Not a perfect analogy but hopefully gives a visual</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sucking air in is negative pressure - there's no physical force that can <em>pull</em> air in, but it helps people understand that we actually breathe by just letting air rush in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The victim then ends up drawing fluid from their tissues into their lungs instead, resulting in pulmonary oedema, or fluid filled lungs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is far more interesting than the question OP asked. It makes sense, but I didn't even consider that it would be possible to draw liquid from your internal tissues like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's two different phenomenon. Water hits the vocal cords, vocal cords spasm, victim suffocates. This happens very quickly. </p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>Water is inhaled past vocal cords into lungs (aspiration), however victim does not drown. Water/contaminants cause irritation and inflammation leading to fluid buildup, or pulmonary oedema - &quot;drowning from the inside&quot;. This is the slower process, taking hours/days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's the latter that has been referred to in the news the past few weeks as &quot;dry drowning&quot; then, as it's been kids dying a few days after swimming.</p></div>		</li>
