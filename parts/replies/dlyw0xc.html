			<div class="markdown"><p>Often cameras take reflected images, but not always.  It has nothing to do with how a camera works.  E.g. All these pics of the sun lately.  Light going from sun to camera, nothing reflected.</p>
<p>And X-ray cameras often take pictures of phosphors excited by X-rays.  Your &quot;lack of X-rays&quot; idea is just wrong.</p></div>		</li>
