<p>Without reaching this ultra low carbon level, the steel wouldn't be soft enough to stamp the shapes they use in auto design these days.</p>

<p>That seems like the sort of thing you would do in a casting process, thus presenting no need for &quot;softer&quot; steel. Did I read all of that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't cast steel into it's final shape and reach the desired properties.  It would also be a nightmare to achieve on the scale that they make car parts. The current process involves casting it into a big slab (6-10&quot; thick or so) and then heating those slabs until they're bright red hot in order to roll them down to around 1/4&quot; thick.  After that, they need to get cold rolled which reduces their thickness to under 1mm for some parts, but this step makes the steel too brittle, so the final step is to anneal the strip by heating it up again so it can recover some of it's grain structure, and also coat it in zinc for rust protection.</p></div>		</li>
