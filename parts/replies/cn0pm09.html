			<p>Ummm, well there was that whole great depression thingy. Some people refer to countries like the US as having &quot;war based&quot; economies. One time a president warned against a &quot;military industrial (congressional) complex&quot;. I think it's safe to say the post-WWII era US was its most prosperous era, and that had a lot to do with industries that profited from the biggest war in the history of human civilization by a large margin.</p>		</li>
