			<div class="markdown"><p>The funnel analogy for a black hole is an analogy for how something like a black hole might work in a 2D universe.  If you have an infinite 2D sheet that represents all of 2D space, and you poke a funnel in it, the direction 'down the funnel' is perpendicular to the directions you could normally move through space.  From the perspective of a 2D creature living in this universe, it would appear that there was just some sort of phenomenon bounded by a circle where the geometry started to get really funky.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 3D space the phenomenon of a black hole is something that appears to be bounded by a sphere, but the space inside of it is being curved in a direction perpendicular to those we naturally perceive.</p>
<p>To really blow your mind, the direction 'down the funnel' is actually a direction like 'forward in time' instead of being a direction like 'left, up, or forward in space'.  Also, the fabric that's being curved isn't just 3D space, it's 4D space+time.  As you go down the funnel, it's your 'forward in time' direction that is really rotating to point down into the singularity.  Once you get too far into the funnel and your direction into the future points too far away from the future of the rest of the universe and down the singularity funnel instead, there is no escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that explanation. I don't have the math to know if it's formally true, but it really makes things clear to realize that once you're past the event horizon, the direction to the center is &quot;future&quot; and the outside universe is as far away as yesterday.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately no, there aren't enough dimensions to do that. However, here's an (exaggerated) depiction of how a massive body like Earth warps space in 3 spacial dimensions. So try to imagine that getting warped far enough that it points 90 degrees to all three dimensions simultaneously. You can't really visualize this, but you can kind of get an idea what it's talking about.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good video explaining how gravity warps spacetime, and how that affects the motion of objects: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTVIMOix3I</a></p>
<p>I'm not 100% on this, and it's probably not 100% accurate but I think the general idea is correct. In the video, the time axis bends slightly due to gravity, from 3'o clock to 2:30'o clock. But a black hole warps spacetime so much that the time axis would bend past 1:30'o clock (45 degrees), to, say, 1'o clock. </p>
<p>As an object, you're basically allowed to go straight to the right (not moving), or at a 45-degree angle up/down (speed of light up or down). Since the time axis is bent past 45-degrees up, you can never escape - even going at the speed of light, you can't keep up with the time axis; you're always headed towards the center. You need to somehow go backwards in time (time travel), or at a steeper-than-45-degrees angle (FTL). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you simplify the three dimensions of your physical reality into simply &quot;distance from your current location,&quot; you can create a two dimensional graph of time and space called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram" target="_blank">Penrose Diagram</a>. Light always travels at +45 degrees (to the upper right) from the two axes, so you can draw event horizons which show that black holes lock all of your future paths inside, and other fun stuff. (I'll add more later if you're interested, I need to leave right now).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really not sure if I'm visualizing it all correctly but I have a question. Is the reason light can't escape a black hole due to it sucking in &quot;portions/areas&quot; of space/time faster than any light can travel in any &quot;area&quot; of space/time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you want to think of this, as far as I am concerned. The simple answer would be that there is just too much of a gravitational attraction. But, if you would describe the gravitational attraction as an actual bending of the spacetime, then you could say that the spacetime itself is so curved that there is nowhere else for light to go but towards the black hole. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and star system formation. A sphere of orbiting material is not stable, because orbits will interfere with each other. A disk in which all material is orbiting in the same direction is relatively stable. Whatever configuration the material starts in, it will tend towards a disk over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it is thought that there may be a singularity within the event horizon.  The effects of a black hole are similarly spherical as a stars would be. Things get weird when you get too close though. For example, a black hole can have the same mass as a large star and they would both exhibit the same gravity fields at certain distances. The difference being that when you get too close to a black hole,  spacetime itself becomes so distorted that all paths lead to the center of the black hole. We don't know for sure what exactly is going on at the center and how it can be so massive and dense. Look at neutron stars for example, super dense objects which can barely support their own weight. Black holes are the remnants of collapsed stars; stars which exhausted their nuclear fuel and could no longer generate the heat and pressure to support the rest of the star.</p></div>		</li>
