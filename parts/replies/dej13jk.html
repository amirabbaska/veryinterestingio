			<div class="markdown"><p>That's likely but I don't know. You'd also decrease the mean free path and you'd get a lot less metal on the thing you were trying to deposit it onto.   FWIW: Incandescent lightbulbs are filled with argon for this reason.  It slows the rate at which metal evaporates off the filament and ends up on the inside of the bulb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangential question. The black-gray film on the insides of old bulbs that have burned out is metal deposition from the burning filament?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmosphere would tend to carry away a lot of heat so you'd probably need much more power to get the metal to the same temperature, and your chamber would have to be designed to accommodate it. Transport of the vapor would also no longer be ballistic and instead be determined by diffusion or convective motion of the gas. In practice, you would place the metal in close proximity to what is being coated so that the diffusion is more rapid (some materials are actually deposited this way; it's called close space sublimation)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is thin film vapor deposition correct? I believe it's the same process for vapor deposition of Diamond Like Carbon(DLC).</p></div>		</li>
