<p>Pre industrial era we burnt much less fuel and most of it was renewable (wood). The result was that human CO2 release was negligible in the noise of the world doing it's thing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was. Obama ratified it on Sept 3 of 2016.  Here's the reuters article:</p>

<p>When it comes to some international treaties/agreements, the president has the power to join without needing Congress. The flip side is also true, the president has the power to leave it unless Congress passes a law otherwise.</p>
<p>The agreement also doesn't have any binding teeth, so we can't (directly, anyway) be punished for leaving. (sucks, but it was required to get some nations on board)</p></div>		</li>
