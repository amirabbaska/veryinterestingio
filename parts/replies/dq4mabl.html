			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really double taxed when being repatriated? I thought the US only taxes as much as the the other country didn't tax. So if the other country taxed 15%, then the US would tax 20% to bring it up to 35%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you’re right, and that it’s not a case of double taxation.</p>
<p>But that 20% tax is still more than no tax at all. If I remember correctly, Ireland has 0% tax for some of those foreign entities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's double taxation, because you are taxed twice, even if the US rate is reduced as in your example. Consider that of the G-7, the US is the only country that works this way. All other countries consider money earned in another territory to be distinct.</p>
<p>And amongst the 35 OCDE countries, the US has the highest corporate tax rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Tax payable vs interest due arbitrage. They pay 0~% tax on profits using the “Irish double Dutch sandwich” and other various structures on international income. Then fund things like dividends, share buybacks and local OpEx using US/domestic revenue + US sourced debt most likely, at low rates.</p>
<p>Trump has been talking about a one time low repatriation tax rate, to try incentivize the companies (not all tech but a lot is) to bring the cash back onshore. Time will tell where things end up there.</p>
<p>An interesting thing would be if big tech companies ever consider re-domiciling their parent companies for tax purposes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first answer that goes into the cash these companies have lying around, thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not you agree, the corporation was taxed at the country rate it was earned in,  and companies don't want to be double taxed if they dont have to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, &quot;taxed&quot;, if that's what you can call it in Luxembourg, Ireland or the Cayman's. But in essence correct, corporations don't want their money taxed at all.</p></div>		</li>
