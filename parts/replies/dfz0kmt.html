<p>Fun fact, the reason why ice is more slippery the warmer it is is purely because the pressure of you walking on it melts the ice a little bit. If it is colder out, you don't melt as much ice by stepping on it.</p>
<p>It's also how ice skates work. That blade is pressing down on the ice, melting it ever so slightly and making it slippery. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true. It's an old explanation that has since been rejected. For example, a 150lb person on ice skates decreases the melting point of ice by about 0.03 degrees F. The two prevailing theories are the intrinsic water layer of ice near the melting point (due to vibration, probably) and friction between feet/skates and the ice generating enough heat to melt it. Either way, pressure is not a significant factor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pressure lowers the freezing point of liquids</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#Types" target="_blank">This is only true for water and I think antimony</a> (maybe some other complex fluids, or something else that I don't know about, but in general). Most substances are more dense in their solid phase than their liquid phase so it is just &quot;easier&quot; for the molecules to be in their solid phase as the pressure increases. Water, as we all know, is less dense in its solid phase, hence it has an anomalous S-L slope in that it is negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure.</p>
<p>But logically, &quot;pop&quot; makes the most sense. Follow me here.</p>
<p>The term was originally &quot;Soda Pop&quot;. It was carbonated water (known as &quot;Soda water&quot;) and flavored syrup. Before Soda Pop was a thing, the word &quot;Soda&quot; was(and still is) used instead of the full term &quot;Soda water&quot; when referring to carbonated water.</p>
<p>Since &quot;pop&quot; is the part of the term that differentiates between plain soda water and flavored soda water, using &quot;pop&quot; to refer to it eliminates the confusion that is possible when asking for &quot;soda&quot; in a place where the term is not commonly used to refer to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Pop&quot; is also simpler to say, literally half the syllables. </p>
<p>There is simply no reason to use &quot;soda&quot; instead of &quot;Pop&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
