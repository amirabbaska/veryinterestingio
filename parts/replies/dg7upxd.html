			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;having a backup plan if the planet Earth is not habitable anymore&quot; - so rather than look internally and fix what we can (most of which man has created) we instead look for another plant? Is it just me or does that statement show just how we need to change our way of thinking? Space exploration is an amazing endeavour - but understanding our oceans, the life in them and how to not completely f**k it ip is surely more important?</p></div>		</li>
