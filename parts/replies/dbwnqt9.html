			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating. I might have a dig at the book in future, but for the time being can you TLDR on the implications of Church-Turing being true (essentially what you were getting into in your 3rd paragraph)? What does it mean for human development?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While very interesting, I don't think Church-Turing would have any kind of measurable effect on human development. Its more of a profound realization on how things have always been for humans and how they always will be. It provides some insight in the inner workings of human thought, and how we think about, represent, and manipulate discrete numerical quantities. Whats elegant about this realization is that we have found an exact, mathematical way of describing it. A robust, formal means of description is extremely important for theoretical computer science, but likely won't impact anybody's day to day lives. </p>
<p>Its kind of like Newton discovering gravity. It was a huge deal for our powers of description and greatly increased the depth of information that we can abstract through maths. It gave us new insight and new intuitions, but gravity was always there even before we formulated a way to describe it. Humans had adapted to the conditions of gravity long before we even knew what it was exactly. </p>
<p>In much the same way, we have adapted to formalizing algorithms in terms of assignment and iteration long before Turing related such algorithms to the Turing machine. This has always been the case. You might even call it human nature to describe algorithms in such a way. Just think about how you might tell someone how to do any action or carry out a procedure. You need to assign symbols with words to give instructions and then you expect some kind of iterative sequential execution of those instructions by the human you're describing it to. This is not exactly a paradigm-shifting realization.</p>
<p>Likely, the implications on machine development are bigger than on human development. In specific, quantum computation comes to mind. Since quantum computers operate on continuous wavefunctions instead of discrete bits like normal computers, quantum algorithms are excluded from the Church-Turing thesis. This implies that algorithms like these could never be executed by a Turing machine and indeed they're inner workings could never be described exactly to any human or machine. With quantum computation, there's a point at which that all-important property of a Turing machine, assignment, just gets thrown out the window. Church-Turing highlights the fact that quantum algorithms are fundamentally uncertain on some level. As such, computer scientists have formulated these algorithms for execution on a fundamentally uncertain machine, namely physical matter, the qubits of a quantum computer. It would be very interesting if there was a Church-Turing like relation between humans, quantum algorithms, and the quantum Turing machine, however the uncertainty of nature ensures that an exact, mathematical description of any such interaction would not be possible. The best we could do would be some kind of probabilistic description.</p>
<p>edit: also its really important to keep in mind that Church-Turing only deals specifically with algorithms that operate on the counting numbers (0,1,2,3 ...). We will never find an algorithm on this set of numbers that cannot be programmed into a computer.</p></div>		</li>
