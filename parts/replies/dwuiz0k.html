			<div class="markdown"><p>my research shows lithium can be obtained from brines at about 1/2 the cost of spodumene which also has pollution externalities.</p>
<p>is it the salton sea i'm thinking of? california has a lake well suited for brine mining of lithium. the area where chile bolivia and argentina come together is a lithium hotbed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've seen some debate recently about how abundant beryllium is in the Earth's crust and I'm wondering if we just adjust our estimates when we prospect for more or if we have a good idea from the outset and just have to find where the deposits live.</p></div>		</li>

<p>“The previously unknown deposits — including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium — are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You go from broad to narrow.</p>
<p>I have a friend who was a geologist prospecting in Nevada for lithium for a while, working for a small-time company.  You do your background research on the kind of ore you are looking for and where it's likely to occur; in this case they were looking for lithium-rich deposits in salt flats.  I believe they also bought survey information from a few different places that had done very rough, large-scale prospecting work.  They did a lot of field work and ground-pounding to try to figure out which areas were most promising, then bought high-resolution aerial gravity survey maps over those areas; lithium salts are less dense than other types of salts, so large lithium concentrations would in principle show up as lower-gravity areas.  More field work and a lot of head-scratching, then they chose a few places and drilled some bore-holes to see what was actually down there.</p>
<p>I don't think it panned out for them, but if it had they would have then done more drilling make better guesses at how much lithium was down there, then sold the mining claim to a company interested in doing the actual mining and moved on to the next project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We sent a USGS team there in 2003 or 04 and they put together some interesting reports on the mineralogy. It’s little wonder we and Russia have always had such an interest in the area. Literally trillions in untapped potential. The north has lots of lode and placer gold that’s never really been mined and the emerald deposits and geology has never been properly studied, so there is likely some amazing deposits yet to be found. </p>
<p>Definitely one of the most interesting and understudied countries on the earth from a geological standpoint. Shame you can’t easily do any exploration there or that their own people aren’t able to make use of the deposits due to the instability of the country. </p>
<p>It’s interesting the UN never officially classifies countries as failed states anymore, I have a feeling Afghanistan is one reason why, as other countries would just invade the border areas for mining and no one wants to deal with how much crazier it might get if it was just declared a failed state, even though it meets all the rational definitions.</p></div>		</li>
