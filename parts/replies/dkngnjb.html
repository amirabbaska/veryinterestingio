			<div class="markdown"><p>I just looked at myself in my phone camera while doing this.  For being an analog lump of meat prone to defects, that's pretty amazing that auto-track is automatically engaged.</p>
<p>But I thought under normal circumstances our eyes jump from point to point.  What are the specific criteria to engage auto tracking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes will track objects when moving around all 3 axes.<br />
1) Lifting the head up/down<br />
2) turning left/right<br />
3) tilting your head sideways by twisting the eyes clockwise/counterclockwise to about ~30 degrees of turn (called; cyclotorsion). </p>
<p>After maxing out this flexibility, the brain has to process the image to make sense of the rotation (eg: when you lay on your side, up and down are still intuitive directions and you can watch tv or read). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a problem for VR headsets to simulate the stable movement of objects on screen when the head is moving. To do it right, they need to track eye movements and adjust the screens when the eyeball is flicking from one point to another, otherwise the images don't quite line up naturally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add'l:</p>
<p>Prey birds like chickens and pigeons have wide-set eyes, to the sides of the head, that give them about a 300Â° field of view for spotting predators. </p>
<p>As a consequence of this they have relatively little overlap of their fields of view, just directly forward, resulting in a difficulty in judging distances to objects that can only be seen by one eye. What little binocular vision they do have is excellent for pecking at seeds and bugs, not so much for spotting danger.</p>
<p>When the head is not moving, however, they do have a very, very keen sense of movements in their fields of view. They can also see further into the ultraviolet than we do, giving objects greater contrast.</p>
<p>To offset the limitations of wide-set eyes, yet retain the advantages, prey birds have evolved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbzCHU32a0w" target="_blank">&quot;head bobbing&quot;.</a></p>
<p>As the bird walks, it thrusts its head out forward and in doing so scans the environment from different angles as the head moves. This lets the bird brain create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">parallax,</a> with which it judges the distances to objects by viewing them from different positions. This is how a chicken can tell, for example, that two trees are not side-by-side but one is further away than the other. As it moves its head it can discern one tree is moving in its field of view at a different rate than the other tree, so one is further away and the other is closer. This is something we (and raptors, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9HD5tK0.gifv" target="_blank">notably owls</a>) enjoy full-time because we have forward-facing eyes and each eye always has an offset view of the same object. </p>
<p>A downside to head thrusting, however, is a lessened ability to spot <em>movement</em> while its head is in motion.To compensate for that, the bird momentarily <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dPlkFPowCc" target="_blank">freezes it's head relative to its surrounding environment</a> and scans for objects moving relative to other objects. Like that tree and that cat, for example.</p>
<p>By repeating these two functions the bird builds up a concise view of the world around it with keen motion sensing and good depth of field. </p>
<p>Just not at the same time. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. The explanations on headbobbing I've read prior to this were very lacking, so I never really understood it beyond basically that it helps them see better for unspecified pigeon reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, yeah.  &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;</p>
<p>A dinosaur like the Anchiornis Huxleyi in the late Jurassic grew up to just 40cm, which is about the size of a large pigeon. Avisaurus Archibaldi in the late Cretaceous was something like 45cm. </p>
<p>Then you have large therapods, or you have sauropods, hadrosaurids, ceratopsia, ankylosauria, etc.</p>
<p>So yeah, dinosaurs.  I doubt a Triceratops walked like a pigeon.  A T. Rex isn't going to walk like a pigeon.  Avisaurus? Maybe. I don't know.</p>
<p>But I do know you can't just generalize &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; into large therapods.  I don't expect that anyone thinks Ankylosaurus walked like a pigeon, though it would be funny to see an animation of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed -- &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; is a pretty broad word for creatures who were the dominant form of life on Earth for over 1,000 times the length of time that anatomically modern humans have existed (~250 mya vs. ~0.2).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even worse than that. All modern birds fall within the clade Dinosauria, meaning that when someone says &quot;dinosaur&quot; they could technically be referring to a bird.</p></div>		</li>
