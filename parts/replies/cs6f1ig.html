			<div class="markdown"><p>I too would like answers.  My iPhone 5s worked fine on my wifi but my Note Edge will connect but pretty much won't do anything. I'm relatively sure it has to do with my router settings as when away from home it seems to behave better but I can't for the life of me find which setting it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your WiFi speed may be fast (and &quot;fast&quot; is relative. I would say 18Mbps down is the MINIMuM you would want to have to be considered fast. 30Mbps and greater is fast) but anyway, there are other factors like your bandwidth. Is your WiFi password protected? How many devices are using your WiFi? What kind of activities are they doing, streaming or downloading HD video, playing online games etc takes up a lot of bandwidth and if you're using your allowance at any given time your wifi &quot;speeds&quot; will suffer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have 70MBits down which slows to roughly between 35-50 when using straight wifi. My phone my girlfriends phone and her laptop are connected through wifi and with the laptop it's not very bandwidth intensive mainly just Facebook. I also have an android box that's hardwired. </p>
<p>Edit <a href="http://m.imgur.com/1PHe5fb" target="_blank">this</a> is my current connection with everything running yet it still seems faster on 4G</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple things could be at play here. Your browser could be automatically caching on 4G but not on wifi, causing it to appear slower since it has to re-download the little reddit icon every page load.</p>
<p>Your phone could have a slower wireless controller as well, specd lower than your 3/4g chip.</p>
<p>You could have some nodal interference or wifi black spots that only happen on your wifi and not on your 4g making wifi appear slower. </p></div>		</li>
