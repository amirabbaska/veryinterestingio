			<div class="markdown"><p>An under-appreciated factor here is that the educated, dual-income family that can't afford to have more kids and still raise them well is effectively paying for the single-income breeding ground group to have kids instead.</p>
<p>It's hard to argue in favor of taking away the social welfare benefits, because the kids haven't done anything wrong, but from a practical perspective, it'd be far better if the responsible parents could spend their tax on another child of their own instead of someone else's fourth or fifth child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, spending that tax on a child of their own, in addition to being morally right, almost certainly produces better citizens/people. You're right, though, that we have to avoid punishing children for the choices of their parents, hence the predicament. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the first part about people not having a child until they're past the 30 mark. I'm in my mid 20s and girlfriend is 30, I always worry that it's being left too late, but really we just want to make sure we are in good stable jobs and would rather not have a kid if we're not economically stable. It wouldn't be fair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I are 38yo, married 5years, no kids, want 1 or 2. She's old enough now to need $ for medical help to get pregnant - which is another reason older parents value finances aka careers aka education. I have a master's and she has a doctorate - we understand it will be expensive to replicate that in our kids, but it's our plan for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I just want to warn you, as a 31 year old finally pregnant by IVF, that you guys should really, really consider starting now and before she is forty+.  There's a steep drop off in success rates, although this is all dependant on the woman's eggs, at forty and beyond.  There is a point where money will not help, and without some testing you cannot know if that ship has sailed or if you may still have success.  I'm talking about single digit success rates post 40, by the way, for $20k in a cycle.<br />
Heck, in my late twenties the rate of success was as good as possible and still only 30%.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>she continues to pop out children every 2-3 years the state won't bother her about a job. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost non-existent. We are looking at correlation, not causation. The real reason they &quot;pop out children&quot; is explained well in the top post. It is economic and cultural thing more than &quot;welfare&quot; queens, which as a concept has been debunked to be &quot;very rare&quot;. I'm not claiming none of that exists but that it is way, way rarer than people think. In society, this has almost no effect. The mere fact that raising a kid, even badly is fulltime job. You won't have it easier by having more kids. They are not that kind of stupid. But they are the kind of stupid that fucks without protection or the kind where &quot;god loves me more the more kids i have&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you don't have kids yourself. It is god damn hard work. I chose to have none, one factor really is that it is not just having a kid, it is a lifelong job if even doing half-assed job raising the damn kids. But i've been a stepdad and worked with handicapped kids also living with them so i have some inclination how much work it really is to raise a kid. The poor are not popping out babies because of benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Spain, where the cost of social security (meaning our health system) is practically universal specially for children and covers almost every expense you have related to health care. For poor families there's also very good programs to help them afford (sometimes at no cost) food and shelter.</p>
<p>I love the idea and wouldn't change the system, because I wouldn't want to watch people dying from untreated cancer or whatsoever ('muricans), but my mother works as a dentist at a poor neighborhood and she tells me the most frustrating stories.</p>
<p>An immigrant father came with his eight-year-old son with his mouth full of caries. My mother would insist on him to take care of his children's oral hygiene so that he wouldn't lose his teeth at a young age, but of course the father wouldn't care at all. He was talking about his other children. The boy was his oldest from four. My mother is quite nosey and asked why would they have so many children if they can't afford to take care of one, because they wouldn't pay a tooth filling which the state doesn't cover. He replied that spanish families would have instead a dog or a cat, but that he preferred to have a child instead.</p>
<p>My mom tells me about this encounters daily, and she has only grown skeptic of a great part of immigration (others are very hard-working people she truly admires).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She is in a place where she sees the worst of it. And no one is denying that there are problems. but, the good news is that within one generation, we see huge change in births and it falls to the general population figures. 1st gen is the generation that makes lots of kids, those who lives most of their lives in the host country, will have worldviews much closer to that country.. They meet friends, integrate a bit better (not well enough) and the conditions in the host country remove a lot of the links needed that lead to big family sizes. Less poverty, better education and less religious is the trend.</p>
<p>But, there is the portion that will always stay outside the society.. But.. I am native in my country, as Finns one can be and i am bit outside society too, have different rules, habits and views. It is just easier to see it happening when the people doing it look different.. Sad fact but that is how our minds work, we pay attention to it. For your mom, it is almost impossible as she is so close to the issue, i can't blame her at all. But, i'm quite sure we are seeing exclusion bias; she literally makes mental note for every immigrant while natives pass as unmemorable events.</p>
<p>And i agree fully that in the 1st generation, kids are thinked about differently.. We have to also remember that the father in your example can come from war torn or poverty ridden areas in his origin country and that living to 40s is 50/50 chance... It doesn't mean they love their kids any less but realities of life means &quot;hedging your bets&quot; and death is literally prepared for since the moment the kid is born.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an elementary school teacher in a pretty rough, urban area, I would hope you are not implying people that have kids are <em>all</em> working hard to raise them.</p>
<p>Sadly, many really just dump them on extended family/friends. Too many show up to Pre-K or K not even knowing the alphabet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no, i'm not implying that at all. The sad fact is that in poor neighborhoods, also lack of care and love exist in alarming rates. What i'm trying to say that being poor does not mean you are automatically a bad parent and that war, crime does trigger something in us that makes us produce more kids to beat the odds.</p></div>		</li>
