			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You can rewrite x^y as exp(y*log(x)) and then use the Taylor series for exp(x) and log(1-x) to evaluate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only way x^(y) is actually defined. We simply declare x^(y) to be continuous in each variable separately, and the function is perfectly well-defined in terms of multiplication for rational arguments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the only way to define it, and imo, is not the best. I don't think it's the best because you should be able to establish exponentiation before defining continuous functions.</p>
<p>Let b^x = sup { b^t | t &lt;= x, t in Q}. See Baby Rudin, chapter 1, problem 6. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the more precise way of describing what I have written. But you are essentially just declaring the function to be continuous. </p>
<p>As I said, you only need the least upper bound property. Defining x^(y) can be done right after defining the real numbers in chapter 1 of any good analysis text. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly what they're saying. Well-defined for rationals and approximated to be continuous for irrationals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>x^y is also defined as e^(y Ã— ln(x)). This is particularly useful because both the exponential and the natural log are defined for complex numbers. However, it's a little weird because the natural log is a multi valued function. There are multiple answers to i^i.</p>
