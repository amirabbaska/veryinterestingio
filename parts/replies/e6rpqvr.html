			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked up the 100T multishot and found a document giving the maximum power dissipated by the magnet when operating as 1500 MW over very short peak times. So, basically, you'd need a typical power plant to operate it continuously. Then, you'd have to figure out how to keep everything from melting with that much power flowing through such a compact object.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are superconducting magnets.</p>
<p>Superconductors fail when they reach critical temperature OR critical current OR critical magnetic field. And as a general rule of thumb with superconductors: You can pick one property only to be good at.</p>
<p>So you need a superconducting magnet that can have a truly staggering field (which we can't do), being generated by carrying a staggering current (which we also can't do) at the same time (which we <em>definitely</em> can't do), and keeping it around 4K while dissipating 1500MW (which we really, really can't do) ^while ^also ^carrying ^a ^huge ^current ^<em>and</em> ^a ^huge ^field</p>
<p>There are so many reasons we can't do this yet.</p>
<p>It's not impossible, but it's way beyond our current tech levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that water was really good at this? Wouldn't it be far easier to just have a &quot;water shield&quot; in the ships casing? I know that it's not really feasible currently because water is so heavy, but it seems like a much easier solution than creating some insane magnetic field. Maybe, once in space, a ship could leech off of an asteroid or one of the moons that shoots water into space? Would you have to dump the water and get more along the trip?</p>
<p>Note: I am a complete layman, but it sounds like this makes sense. Please go easy on me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're going to need water for the journey anyways, if you have crew aboard. With good design you can use the same water for shielding and for drinking. The types of radiation that the water will stop won't appreciably change the water. In fact, it will help to keep the water sterilized and safe to drink.</p>
<p>Here's someone who has already crunched the numbers for us:</p>
<p><a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1336/what-thickness-depth-of-water-would-be-required-to-provide-radiation-shielding-i" target="_blank">https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/1336/what-thickness-depth-of-water-would-be-required-to-provide-radiation-shielding-i</a></p>
<p>Now, we don't want to lift that water up from the Earth's surface because of the amount of energy it would take to get it out of the gravity well. However, we could possibly capture and herd water-bearing asteroids or comets in close to orbit the Earth. Then we either hollow them out and nest a spacecraft inside or we break them up and pack the water around/inside the spacecraft. This way we could possibly save energy that would be wasted bringing water into space.</p>
<p>Once we have the technology we can use solar sails to ferry the water into place and not need any fuel at all to move it. Of course, a lot of engineering needs to be done before any of this becomes reality.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The ship would first need to match its velocity to the asteroid or moon, and then continue its journey - the differences in velocity are very large so it would require massive amounts of fuel.<br />
Much of the limitations of spaceflight are dictated by the fact that it is very costly to launch stuff into space, including fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading a paper where the authors have claimed that much weaker fields are necessary, because the magnetic field will create a separation of charge, and thus createf electric field will improve the shielding. It was also shown that small magnetic fields on the moon create local shields.</p></div>		</li>
