<p>That's an oversimplification. There were wast differences between Europeans living in different parts of the continent: some washed themselves in a sauna once a week, while others bathed very rarely. I imagine that there must have been differences between Americans too.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>They would also bath twice a day using steam houses by pouring water over hot rocks and washing with soap made from the roots of plants, and upper class houses would be constructed using sweet smelling woods inside the walls. Cortes also remarked that their doctors and medicine were far superior to what was in spain and that Charles V should not bother sending any over.</p>
<p>In general, the Aztecs were some of the most accomplished agriculturists and hydro-engineers on the planet at the time, which extended to stuff like plumbing (in fact, Teotihaucan and many Maya cities, hunderds and thousands of years older, had toliets, plumbing, and pressuized fountains) and hygenics: I mentioned artificial islands and canals earlier, and much of the city was constructed this way: The initial island was expanded with <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4ZkVYsUBPKM/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">grid like islands with canals between then for farmland and residential land, with the canals being used as waterways for transporation by boat: essentially a new world Venice</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AIO6Oso.jpg" target="_blank">with stone causeways, aquaducts, and dams cutting across the lake it was built on connecting to other settlements on other islands and shorelines</a>.</p>
<p>When the Spanish successful sieged the city (thanks a massive army of 200,00 Tlaxcallans and Tontac who wanted to overthrow Aztec domaiance in the region, smallpox and famine ravaging the city itself, and other Aztec cities erupting into a civil war of if they should support the captial or side with the spanish, mind you) they destroyed much of this native hydro-engineering infrastructure, which they were unable to rebuild, which led to constant flooding in New Spain/Mexico city, which was built over the ruins. So the Lakes themselves got drained in the 1700's, which only led to issues with soil liquefaction, drought, and yes, still flooding occasionally that continue in mexico city today.</p>
<p>Also, the extinction of Axolotl salamanders in the wild, since the lakes were their only natural habitat and basically only a large, heavily polluted pond remains of one of the lakes today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little more complicated since he generalized a huge area with lots of different cultures but generally, the native Americans basically dumbed lucked themselves into better hygiene. No one really knows why i think exactly but the native Americans liked to take regular baths. It could be because animals could smell you if you smelled real rank making their hunting harder. Europeans had domesticated animals so you didn't need that. Neither side knew that it kept you healthy. Both sides thought some sort of evil spirit is why you get sick. But the main reason why the Europeans didn't get an &quot;America pox&quot; was because long, close exposer woth animals, like the domesticated ones that Europe had, is what causes diseases. America had alpacas and that's about it when it came to domesticated animals. Buffalo are too strong and wild for wooden fences. Deer were too scrawny and could jump out of most fences. All in all, the reason native Americans weren't as &quot;advanced&quot; as Europeans was because they didn't have easily domesticated animals like Europe, but it also saved them from a ton of horrible diseases developing there including black death type diseases.</p></div>		</li>
