On top of that, we use mice because of how fast they breed, experimenting with several generations of humans would take decades instead of month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epigenetics and molecular genetics are become a better method though. The fact that you can grow human cells (or human like cells) and induce a particular disease/ mutation is amazing. Kinda gives you a better idea on what is really going on and what elements you can use to cure something.  </p>
