			<div class="markdown"><p>Running an accelerator just to measure foil thicknesses would be a waste, but knowing your target thickness is important for any nuclear physics experiment involving a target. It's a small, necessary part of the experiment, certainly not the whole thing. And for sufficiently thick targets, there's no need to do this, you can just mechanically measure them. </p>
<p>As for measuring foil thicknesses outside of experiments, you can buy a machine which will produce monoenergetic alpha particles, collimate them, and measure their energy downstream from the foil.</p>
<p>It's not a cheap machine, but it's certainly something one can afford to have if they run a lab which produces such thin targets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't you just buy an Alpha source and an Alpha detector? I remember doing such experiments at the university with tabletop detectors, no need for accelerators or anything. I'd guess that you can just buy the Whole setup for less than a grand</p></div>		</li>
