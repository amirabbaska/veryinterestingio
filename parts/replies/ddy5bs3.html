<p>The transmission will lock the TC when it determines that doing so wouldn't lug the engine. It's better to slip the TC than to put extra stress on the engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if serious or not so I will provide a serious answer. You use overdrive when you're mainly on the highway with engine experiencing low load conditions. It is a &lt;1:1 engine to drive axle ratio which will allow you to cruise at a high speed while keeping engine speed down, saving gas, etc. If you have overdrive engaged while pulling weight (loading the engine), heat builds up very quickly in the transmission. The transmission provides much less torque when in overdrive and so if it is struggling to pull that extra weight, it will in turn generate much more heat which is an automatic transmission's nemesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't it be serious? I have a Swedish driver's license and I have never heard the term &quot;overdrive&quot; except (in a modified sense) in Star Trek :) </p>
<p>Edit: I understand now it has something to do with automatic gearboxes. These are very uncommon in Sweden and probably most of Europe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll simplify what Renfah said.</p>
<p>Its a lot like making the gears a little lower. When your car is empty and on a flat highway, you want to keep the RPMs low to save gas. When climbing a steep mountain with lots of load on the engine, you want to have the RPMs higher to get all the torque you can get or else the engine will strain way too much.</p>
<p>So to get that gear lower you turn off overdrive. or turn on tow mode. depends on how the manufacturer calls it, same thing.</p></div>		</li>
