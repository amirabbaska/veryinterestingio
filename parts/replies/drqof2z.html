			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that on dual voltage transformers, there isn't an issue? Most of the small transformers I see are rated for 50/60hz. Is it that they just over build the coils, or are they solid state or something along those lines?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both.  But far more often they use switching power supplies now, which are much lighter and cheaper and easily handle more power compared to transformer based power supplies.  The switching power supplies turn the incoming AC into DC, and usually double the voltage with a simple diode+capacitor voltage doubling circuit.  So it doesn't matter what frequency or voltage you feed them, they just make some very high voltage DC to work with.  Then they chop that DC back into AC by switching it at very high frequencies, usually well over 20KHz, and run that through a very small and cheap transformer that is very efficient at the high frequency, unlike 50/60Hz transformers that weigh a ton because the saturation problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This might very well be true, due to the high cost of copper and the low cost of cheap electronics from China. But that most definitely hasn't always been the case. I remember throughout my childhood, switching power supplies were these mythical devices that nobody could afford. I was blown away the first time I saw a consumer electronics product with a universal input voltage/frequency power supply</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many of those are switching transformers, and have no magnetic cores.  Internal frequency often in the khz range, and does not care about input frequency as much.  Cheaper for small, household loads, but more expensive for tens and hundreds of kilovolts and/or hundreds of amps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a 50/60Hz xfmr, an actual wound transformer, it's going to be built for 50Hz. Running that at 60Hz is no problem.</p>
<p>Running a transformer designed for 60Hz at 50Hz would saturate the core and you end up with large current spikes. Overheating, possible fire, etc. </p></div>		</li>
