<ul>
<li>Overdoses caused by lack of knowledge on how to use drugs safely</li>
<li>Overdoses and other illnesses caused by drug impurities</li>
<li>Violence from resolving disputes over drugs</li>
<li>Violence from people on drugs which promote violent behavior and bad decision-making</li>
</ul>
<p>The first can helped with education and making drugs legal with mandatory dosage and safety information.</p>
<p>The second can be reduced by regulating drug purity and allowing the legal system to prosecute people for providing drugs that cause harm.</p>
<p>The third can be reduced by providing access to the courts to resolve disputes. Now, the only option available is violence. </p>
<p>The fourth can be helped by education on the effects at improper dosages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point.  A lot of people are currently not making a &quot;choice&quot; to be addicts in the sense that whatever it is that causes someone to say yes for the first time and try coke, or heroin, or whatever isn't happening with people who are prescribed a pill and take it as directed until they need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was me for a year, had a nasty opiate addiction that was completely legal. In fact, when I got out of detox and was clean for the first time, the staff actually had to give me back my bottle of Vicodin I came in with since it was legally prescribed to me. I threw them away right then and there, but it was so surreal. We need better treatment options for pain and better ways to get people off of narcotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up rat park in relation to drug addiction. Basically if we gave people drugs for free they wouldn't be making drugs their life focus and spending all of their money that direction. This would free them to focus on more important things in their life and not be consumed by the constant need for a fix.</p></div>		</li>
