			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand, bigger black holes are considered colder because the temperature is measured as the amount of radiation gives it gives off. The amount of hawking radiation a black hole emits is inversely proportional to the mass, so the bigger the black hole, the less radiation and thus less temperature. (Please correct me if I am wrong)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, the wavelength of the radiation.  All objects emit black body radiation depending on their temperature.  Iron glows red when hot because it's temperature increases to a point where the black body radiation is in the visible spectrum.  Humans produce infrared black body radiation (which is why infrared cameras can see humans glowing in the dark).</p>
<p>You can describe the &quot;temperature&quot; of a black hole using black body radiation.</p>
<p>Note that it can be difficult to define the temperature of a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If theoretically you were walking through space and stepped on a micrometer-wide black hole....would you get sucked in?  I understand I have no clue how to ask this question and it's probably super dumb, but do you know what I mean?  What would the impact of something that tiny but still very powerful be on an object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this answer is regarding the hawking radiation and not the temp. of the singularity itself, perhaps OP's question is more about what is left behind the event horizon. Perhaps there is a similar remnant in the creation of a stellar mass blackhole like when a neutron star is created. Would anyone be able to hypothesize on this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't directly measure anything about a black hole except its mass, charge, and angular momentum. So directly measuring the temperature inside of a black hole is not an option. There's probably a way to use statistical mechanics to calculate the entropy of a black hole and convert it to a temperature, but I know very little about the subject, so I can't do the calculations or even tell you for sure if it's possible.</p></div>		</li>
