			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually its even more than that.  Here in St. Louis we have 170 and 270 that branch off of I-70.  The 1 (and every odd number) is considered a spur and goes in a straight line somewhere.  The 2 (and every even number) is a city bypass (go around the city to help alleviate traffic).</p></div>		</li>
