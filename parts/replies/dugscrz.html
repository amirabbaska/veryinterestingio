			<div class="markdown"><p>Farmer (sort of) here, In our fields in mountain regions of Nepal we have 3 crops yeild per year, two paddy(rice) and one with wheat or maize. Give or take approx 4 months each out of which total growth time for each crops approx. 3 months. I was actively involved for irrigation in our fields. Paddy requires on my experience 4-5 times more water than wheat, maize requires least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! In fact, the ability to multi-crop rice is largely why China was able to support hundreds of millions in population centuries before Europe.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Some have asked for more info on population.</p>
<p>In the 1600s, Ming China had an estimated population of <a href="https://www.popline.org/node/331311" target="_blank">~200 million</a>, give or take a few tens of millions. The combined population of Europe peaked at <a href="https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-was-population-europe-1600s-what-significant-468026" target="_blank">~80 million</a> before the Thirty  Years War swiftly brought that number down.</p>
<p>By 1800 Europe's combined population reached ~<a href="http://www.thuto.org/ubh/ub/h202/wpop1.htm" target="_blank">150 million</a>, while In China reached ~<a href="http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/timelines/china_modern_timeline.htm" target="_blank">300 million.</a></p>
<p>TL; DR Rice is fucking <strong><em>awesome</em></strong>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Louisiana rice and crawfish are often co-farmed together. When the fields are flooded, they're living the crawfish life and growing. The fields are drained and they retreat into the soil. <a href="http://www.andalusiastarnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/0322-Chimneys.jpg" target="_blank">You'll often see the &quot;chimneys&quot; near ditches out and about.</a> The rice is harvested, and they stay safe. The crawfish are then harvested Feb-May (though it can be stretched out Nov-July in some places.) Rice is harvested July/Aug in Louisiana with the &quot;ratoon&quot; (2nd crop) harvested in Oct/Nov.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does your mother raise ducks in the rice paddies as well? I remember watching an interesting documentary on youtube about a Japanese rice farmer who raised ducks among his rice because it was mentioned in old texts or an old saying etc. The ducks would eat any pest insects and fertilize the rice, also adding nutrients and oxygen to the water that allowed small fish to thrive, which ate more bugs and fertilized even more etc.</p>
<p>Pretty neat stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I feel like I just read this whole conversation in /r/pics this afternoon. I know the whole “Steve Buchemi was a firefighter” thing always gets referenced as a thing that always gets referenced, but I never see anyone actually reference it seriously. The “rice doesn’t need to be grown in water” fact and the semantic satiation link (always prefaced with <em>there’s a name for that!</em>) and probably Dunning-Kreuger are the ones that I legit see get posted over and over again not as a joke.</p>
<p>But, people seem to enjoy them every time, so I’m probably just a dick who spends too much time on Reddit.</p></div>		</li>
