			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to shine into the wasted electricity part. Not entirely true since at high framerate your monitor has more frames to pick from and the input latency is much lower. This is only true or good for fast paced games like CSGO. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your argument that FPS higher than the monitor's refresh rate is not useful is negated by the initial part of your comment. We can percieve latency very well, and if the game produces more frames, the display can show the latest rendered frame closest to the input given. This can translate to quite noticeable differences in latency that can give a significant competitive advantages in games like CS:GO. <a href="https://youtu.be/hjWSRTYV8e0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/hjWSRTYV8e0</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The REAL answer has nothing to do with motion blur. It is that human beings are very sensitive to latency: the delay between an action and the result of the action.</p>

<p>Latency has something to do with it, but it's not the only thing, 24 fps game footage feels terrible, even if you are not playing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further note: If you game using an LCD monitor/TV and brag that your game achieves hundreds of FPS on high graphics settings, all you are doing is bragging about wasting electricity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true, for the exact reason you pointed out: latency. if you run a game at 120 fps on a 60 fps screens, frames that are displayed will be 8ms &quot;younger&quot; on average than if you ran a game at 60 fps on the same screen, so you get a lower latency.</p></div>		</li>
