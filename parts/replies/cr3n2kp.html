<p>This is pretty much why there are no experiments with super deep holes. I <em>think</em> the Russians were sort of hoping to find abiotic hydrocarbons. They didn't and as far as I know there really isn't any reason to think they would other than quite tenuous hypotheses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I have heard a bunch of reason why they drilled it.</p>
<p>Along with the hydrocarbon theory, I have also heard to show off the Soviet technological prowess in being able to drill so deep- Cold War stuff, plus it is an area with very thick ultra mafic sequences and the Soviets wanted to study them in greater detail theorising it was a mantle upwelling and there are several other theories that are probably more here say, so not relevant in this discussion.</p>
<p>As an aside, that area of Murmansk has a huge number of Nickel, Apatite and Platinum deposits. I spent several days a number of years ago flying around a bunch of stuff in a Mi8 helo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a mile down is the minimum most oil wells these days go.  In the baken most wells are one mile down one mile over.  Cost about one million to drill.  But resently they drill 2 miles down 2 over.  I was on one well sight that the bottom perfection was 24000 feet about 4.5 miles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, horizontal drilling. The true vertical depth can be two miles down, and the total hole length(measured depth) will be around 4 miles. This means that the total lateral distance from the original hole will be just under 2 miles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compared to the older Soviet stuff there has been. Pretty much all down hole tooling in the former Soviet Union has been replaced with Western stuff, both in Mining and oil and gas. The Soviets had metallurgical issues with some of their steel in certain industries.</p>
<p>In the Kola wiki article I linked elsewhere in this thread they mention a few more recent oil and gas holes that have managed the length, just not the depth.</p>
<p>I know that diamond drilling has changed quite a bit over the past 20 odd years I've been in the industry. The oil and gas side I don't know a huge amount about.</p></div>		</li>
