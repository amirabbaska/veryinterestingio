			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer the question &quot;Is it possible to create or put artifical dopamine into the brain and cause me to like more things?&quot; The answer is stimulants. Particularly amphetamine. </p>
<p>Amphetamine works primarily by increasing the activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain and more specifically, in the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and locus coeruleus regions. The massive dopamine release from amphetamine will give you a strong willpower to want to do many other things, almost enjoyably. </p>
<p>To answer the question &quot;If I snort amphetamine and then get kicked in the balls, am I going to like it?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, if thats your thing, yes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>good observation.  Here is a horrible example:
<a href="http://www.madsciencemuseum.com/msm/pl/initiation_of_heterosexual_behavior" target="_blank">http://www.madsciencemuseum.com/msm/pl/initiation_of_heterosexual_behavior</a>
it doesn't use DA, but electrical stimulation of the Nucleus Accumbens (which should happen if DA is applied) in an attempt to cure a man of his homosexuality.  It didn't work, and is regarded by many (myself included) as a horrible example of pseudoscience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, going off the answer I gave at the top, what would happen is that while you wouldn't necessarily <em>like</em> getting kicked in the balls, if there was no other way for you to get the hit, after a while you might start kinda feeling this need to do it anyway. But the behavior would likely stop after unpairing the dopamine.</p>
<p><em>Maybe</em>, for some people, and under some circumstances. Not everyone is susceptible to dopamine-addiction. </p>
<p>It's not an entirely hypothetical situation - many people do actually get addicted to hurting themselves in the real world, in part because of the natural dopamine and endorphin release immediately after injury.</p></div>		</li>
