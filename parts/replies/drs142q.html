			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of these GRBs that get detected (hit us) are from outside of our galaxy. Our galaxy is relatively young with only 1 GRB per millennia, Thus, its not possible for us to observe the effects on it on other solar system with our current technology. It can only detect these GRBs that from so far away because it is one of the brightest objects in the universe.</p>
<p>GRB is basically gamma ray, which is highly energetic photon so yes, they do travel at the speed of light. In other words, there is no possible way to detect in-coming GRB that's heading at us.</p>
<p>Gravity affects almost everything. However, it doesn't suck the burst in, it bends the space in, sort of like bending the track train travels on, inwards. But most solar systems don't have that mass to bend the burst all the way into the singularity except blackhole, rather it just curve it away from its usual straight line path.</p></div>		</li>
