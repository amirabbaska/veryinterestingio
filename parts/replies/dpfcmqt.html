			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but probably not more than a few seconds per year or decade.  The time dilation curve is very, very bland until you start reaching extreme gravity.  </p>
<p>For instance, a neutron star dilates time, but even that sort of extreme object only slows time in relation to an Earth-like object by around 20%.  This is noticeable, but not as extreme as that planet around the black hole in Interstellar.  And you would need to be on the surface of the neutron star to notice that.  Which you would never be able to observe because you'd be long dead and crushed into neutron degenerate matter by the time you hit the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically, yes. But in order for it to be at all relevant in a practical sense, it'd have to be a planet orbiting fairly close to a black hole. Which raises many bigger questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a large star, but a planet orbiting a massive black hole or neutron star might be close enough to experience massive gravitational warping that would cause time to move slower relative to distances further out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>depends on its distance. my understanding is that as you approach the event horizon of any black hole, your experience of time gets infinitely slowed relative to an outside observer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's directly dependent on the relative gravity you feel. It's so far away you don't feel the gravity, so the time dilation is infinitesimal. You're more affected by pluto than the one at our center.</p></div>		</li>
