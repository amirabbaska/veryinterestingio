			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, its truly incredible. Its a real go-to for me in discussions with &quot;pyramidiots&quot; online who say that its literally impossible to move heavy things without engines or alien technology. Some of them say that modern cranes cant lift the kind of stones that were used in the pyramids.</p>
<p>Those people never reply when called out. Makes me wonder why they bother posting in the first place...</p></div>		</li>
