			<div class="markdown"><p>There we go, they rarely spin at the same exact speed. When on a site that has 200 turbines (like many I work at- specifically central TX) you will have 10 sq miles of turbines hauling ass in 14-15m winds, and the other half of the park curtailed or low winds. They each run on their own, with the ability to shut them all down together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to have a solid understanding. I work at a gas-fired power plant and when the unit is first tripped off it'll motor for a moment while it's verified the stop and intercept valves close. Can or do windmills motor in the same fashion? Like to pull load back, lower vhars kind of thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During a &quot;serious&quot; alarm, which requires the turbine to stop, the first process is slow the rotor speed by pitching the blades to its least optimal angel or denergized state. </p>
<p>Once the rotor speed is low thus not making energy in the generator, the gen  breaker opens and will remain in stop faulted mode until technicians or operators clear the event. </p>
<p>Var control is handled mainly at the substation, so each individual turbine need not control its impedance during a power down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, thanks. Wind power is very fascinating to me. I figure our company will be adding that to our capabilities some day. I'll turn a wrench wherever they pay me. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the fact that the generators all have to be at 60/50 Hz - how is that accounted for?  Is there some kind of continuously variable transmission that adjusts the generator shaft speed?  Or do they use solid state electronics to change the frequency somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Output is cleaned through the converter system. AC power is converted into D.C. Because it is easier to clean, then converted back to AC at the acceptable frequency. Substation then further cleans the feeder lines before it goes to the grid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks - so that's all solid state power electronics it sounds like. Do you know what kind of losses that typically introduced?</p></div>		</li>
