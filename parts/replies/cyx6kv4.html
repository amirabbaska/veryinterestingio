			<div class="markdown"><p>This paints a misunderstanding, actually. You should stick to the comment you replied to and maybe research what you're saying a bit more. </p>
<p>i.e. you can have cancer of the immune system (leukemia, lymphoma) and it's not because you &quot;can't clean it up&quot;. It's because the notion of assigning an attack on a malformed cell isn't possible without additional instruction, our body does not attack cancer cells and cannot attack malformed &quot;white&quot; cells or lymph node tumors, they must be blasted with radiation and drugs/inkers. </p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/treatment/immunotherapy-using-immune-system" target="_blank">http://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/treatment/immunotherapy-using-immune-system</a>, first paragraph. I've done a ton of cancer research since my SO was diagnosed</p>
<p>It mentions immunotherapy but also suggests it's an emerging field because of what I said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! It's a few things that have to go wrong. Interesting side story: having low number of cancer cells in your blood over a lifetime can actually help prevent cancer for longer as your immune system stays active versus having no cancer cells. Or at least that is the theory with a study of cancer in worms I read in college. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if they don't terminate themselves, the majority of mutations have no effect on the organism (suppose you mutate a protein in a section that isn't really required for enzymatic activity). </p>
<p>An ELI5 example of this: pretend your car is a protein. It's normal function is to take a person from point A to point B. Let's say we mutate the car with a baseball bat with the words &quot;radiation&quot; on the side (classy). If we hit the wheel, the car might still work but it might constantly turn in one direction, making the journey from A to B difficult.</p>
<p>Now let's hit the car with our radiation on the hood of the car. This will most likely have no noticeable effect on the journey to Charlie's chocolate factory, but it might have a larger effect on the car if the hood gets hit multiple times in the future, eventually reaching an important part of the car.</p></div>		</li>
