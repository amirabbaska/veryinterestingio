			<div class="markdown"><p>I once bought some that tasted like an &quot;orange-peach&quot; combo and it was wonderful. I'm assuming it was a mistake (maybe like them getting seeds) and I'll never have that flavor again, but I hope that when I pick up a new bag it has the same flavor thing going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a specific cultivar and not the result of cross-pollination. The reason clementines don't have seeds is simply that by themselves they are infertile, but that doesn't affect the flavor. The flavor changes when a new cultivar is grown (like if you were to take these seeds and grow them).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additional fun fact: Eating clementine is a christmas tradition in Norway. And I'd be interested in knowing if this is the case in other countries as well(?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes no sense. The fruit is controlled purely by the plant they are grown on, no matter what fertilizes the flower. The plant that grows from the seed is a hybrid but not the fruit itself.</p>
<p>For this reason most fruit trees aren't grown from seeds but are grown from cuttings.</p></div>		</li>
