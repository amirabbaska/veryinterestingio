			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, looking at that absorption chart, would heavy water be slightly red? Or is the absorption difference minimal enough that you don't really notice without having an absurd amount of pure heavy water in one place? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, note that it's a logarithmic chart, so the the heavy water absorption in the visible range is much much flatter than that of ordinary water, and even for ordinary water the blue tint is so faint you have to look through a few meters or so of pure water to see it well. Anyway so heavy water has a slight tint but I don't think it's enough to be seen by the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Noob question about absorption chart: imagine 2 horizontal lines on different heights. Would the substances only differ in transparency then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, more absorption will mean it's darker, but as long as the absorption is the same (or roughly the same) across the visible spectrum, it'll just be different shades of grey. </p></div>		</li>
