			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuzzy on exactly how long killer t-cells are stored in your body for, I think it' close to a decade, but it's been a few years since I've even thought about that so I could be wrong. </p>
<p>As far as the second part goes, I believe the answer has to do with gene mutation, the thing about killer t-cells is that they are designed to kill specific strains of antigens, (bacteria, viruses, etc...) but they can't adapt to different strains of the same antigen. </p>
<p>Take the flu for example.</p>
<p>Every year a new vaccine for the flu comes out, that's because every year the flu virus mutates and is different from before. The flu is a great example for this because of how good at and often it mutates. Every year scientists spitball at what they think the virus will do and then spit out a vaccine for it. Hopefully it works, but it might not. </p>
<p>Every year your body encounters the flu, fights it, builds an &quot;immunity&quot; to it, and moves on. Theoretically after this point you are immune to the flu meaning it won't kill you or make you sick anymore, but you can still be a carrier for it with contact.</p>
<p>Thus, every year you might come down with a bad case of the flu, but it is because it is a different strain of the same virus, not because you are just weak to it compared to something else. </p>
<p>TL;DR killer t-cells are stored for a really long time before they are destroyed, and your body can succumb to the same antigen multiple times if it's a different strain, e.g. the flu. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The relative risk of developing the disease for vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people shows how effective the vaccine could be given ideal conditions and 100% vaccine persuasion; vaccine effectiveness measures how well a vaccine persuades when it is used in routine circumstances in the community. </p>
<p>If the criteria changed, such as if it was based on a larger population that wasn’t as restricted and in a more natural environment, that would be the vaccines effectiveness. Because testing that is based on people who are taking the vaccination and people who aren’t, there is a risk for disease, and optimal treatment is needed for those who become too infected; too much persuasion. In other words being over-fooled by a vaccination exists, but sample size required is driven up to achieve clinically useful statistical power.</p></div>		</li>
