			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of wrong guesses in this thread, this one's right, but I think could be ELI5 better. How about: </p>
<p>Have you noticed that the bathroom feels warmer after you've had a shower? Have you ever been inside a sauna where you can add water to the heater? Have you noticed that 100 degrees (F) feels OK when it's dry but becomes crazy hot when you add water? Have you heard people say &quot;yes it's hot, but it's OK because it's a dry heat&quot;? That's all because the way you feel &quot;hot&quot; isn't only due to the temperature, it's also due to how much water is in the air - humidity. </p>
<p>When water dries off of something (evaporates) it takes away heat. If you put a wet washcloth on your skin, notice how you'll feel colder. That's why when you get too hot your body sweats to try and cool you down. but if there's a lot of water in the air it's harder for water to evaporate. If there's a enough water in the air, it's tried to get out by jumping on to colder surfaces (condensation) which carries heat when it does and makes those things warmer. </p>
<p>The air can hold more water when it's warmer. On a warm summer day the air can hold lots and lots of water. But when it's a child day when there's a lot of water in the air it rains out. Cold clear days have very little water in the air. </p>
<p>So if you're inside and set the heater to 60 degrees when it's cold outside, it can still feel cold because there's little humidity and any small amount of water on your skin jumps into the air taking away heat. It's also why your lips get chapped. </p>
<p>If you're inside on a warm day and set the AC to 60 degrees, it still feels warmer because there still might be a lot of humidity - maybe even enough to push heat into your skin! </p>
<p>The next time you're cold in the winter inside, try putting on a pot of water to boil (with your parents help) and see how that changes the temperature that you feel. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't this make it feel warmer because you have the stove on and are filling your house with 212 degree water vapor? Cold weather with a damp climate, to me, feels significantly colder than in a dry one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition our bodies acclimate to seasonal weather.  In spring we go out in shorts at 60Â°f temperature after a cold winter and bundle up in that temperature after a hot summer.</p>

<p>The ELI5 summary is our bodies change our metabolism to generate more heat by burning brown fat, and our fat changes shape a bit to trap more heat among other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The field is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometrics" target="_blank">psychrometrics</a> for anyone interested.  At atmospheric pressure, there's two variables that define a single state.  Temperature (the one everyone is familiar with is called &quot;dry bulb temperature&quot;) is only one property.  The other is humidity (relative [how much water the air holds in comparison to how much it can hold &quot;at max&quot; (this is actually an approximate definition but good enough for ELI5)] or absolute [the actual &quot;water density&quot; within the air]) or a humid-temperature proxy called &quot;wet bulb temperature.&quot;</p>
<p>Wet bulb temperature is the temperature of a surface that is afforded the ability to evaporatively cool (thus it will always be less than or equal to the dry bulb temperature).  How much it can evaporatively cool is dependent upon how much water is able to evaporate into the air.  If the air is lower in humidity (meaning it can hold more water than it currently is holding), then there is a more dramatic cooling impact.  At a higher humidity, that's the opposite.  At 100% humidity, the wet bulb temperature and dry bulb temperature are the same because there is no opportunity for water to evaporate into the air because the air is &quot;at capacity.&quot;  This is why higher humidity sucks.</p></div>		</li>
