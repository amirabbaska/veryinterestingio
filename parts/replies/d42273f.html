			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, but if you want to extend the life of your battery it's best to not allow it to drop below a certain threshold depending on the battery's voltage output, the most common of which 3.6 volts. That's the output...the low voltage threshold is mostly accepted as 3.4 volts. Whereas my damn galaxy s7 reaches 3.4 volts at like 30% battery life. That's when the chip starts making up for insufficient voltage by pulling amperage and reducing my long term battery lifespan.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, in every other way I frigging love this phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an S4 which I tinkered around with by touching the wires of an open usb cable onto the wireless charging contacts in the back. The result of that is something shorted out because the phone shut itself off. End result is the charging indicator would remain even with no cable plugged in and battery life seemed shortened. </p>
<p>It was already due for an upgrade so I traded the phone in and received more than I paid for it while applying that value towards an S7. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting and also extremely concerning. Modern phone batteries are LiPos. LiPos, when run entirely flat, cease to be a battery. Most phones will actually kill themselves at about 10% actual capacity to keep the battery safe. </p>
<p>The concerning bit is that certain lipos have an alarming tendency to go swell up with and leak explosive gasses when they're not in good health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually most of your devices will shut down significantly before that. While older style batteries lasted longer if they were occasionally completely depleted, lithium-ion batteries lose capability every time they are completely or nearly completely emptied.</p>
<p>In order to combat this phones and laptops are designed to shut down due to an &quot;empty battery&quot; early, the battery may even have as much as 15% of its actual charge left, but getting that 15% out would come at the expense of severely degrading the battery life time.</p>
<p><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries" target="_blank">Here's a good article on this effect</a>. For example, if you completely discharge a Li-ion battery before recharging it you can only do that around 400 times before the battery has lost 25% of its potency. If you instead only ever let it get half empty your battery will last more than 3x that number of cycles.</p></div>		</li>
