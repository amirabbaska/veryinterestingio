			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was due to the frets (being fixed temperament) cannot possibly cover all perfect ratios and so some notes (eg C# on the A string) will ever so slightly be sharp or flat. The way around this is the microtonal guitar which looks like a nightmare but mathematically the frets are in the right place for each individual string</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think about the fulcrum alone; where the string passes over the bridge and fret; that relationship changes a lot with string thickness. Then there’s wound vs plain, flat wound vs roundwound, nickel alloys, bronze, stainless, jumbo frets, fender frets, bridge saddle design, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why Jake E. Lee is one of my favorite guitarists, he would make a point to play a lot of solos with as many notes on the same string as he possibly could to keep tonality the same between notes, he would even go so far as to fret notes with his thumb and pinky to get the maximum reach he could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am self taught (well, more like ganja taught) and I definitely, organically prefer to stay on the same string. Sometimes it doesn’t work out when you’re shredding but with the smoother riffs and solos I love to stay on one string. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I was gonna make the same instrument comparison. Even in more similar instruments you can notice the tonal difference. An electric bass can play notes that reach up into the low end of an electric guitar's range, but you can still tell its's a high bass note and not a low guitar note. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who took trigonometry or physics but not music class, it's the shape of the waveform. There's a slow, big oscillation for the base note, and maybe faster ones laid on top, at different offsets, plus maybe sharper rises or falls on various frequencies, or square waves, or triangle waves, etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The fundamental is the lowest frequency in the mix. The overtones are the rest.</p></div>		</li>
