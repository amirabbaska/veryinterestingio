			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!</p>
<p><strong>How do plants breathe?</strong></p>
<p>Plants respirate ( or &quot;breathe&quot;) just like animals, but instead of lungs or gills, oxygen diffuses through via little holes called <strong>stomata</strong>.</p>
<p>On a molecular level, this equation is what's happening when animals and plants respirate:</p>
<p><strong>C^(6)H^(12)O^(6) + 6O^(2) --&gt; 6CO^(2) + 6H^(2)O + ATP</strong>  ^(*(I used superscript instead of subscript because I can't figure out how/if you can do subscript with Reddit))</p>
<p>Broken down that just means:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">C^(6)H^(12)O^(6)</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">6O^(2)</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">--&gt;</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">6CO^(2)</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">6H^(2)O</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">ATP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">1 Glucose molecule</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">6 Oxygen molecules (so 12 oxygen atoms total)</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Usually pronounced &quot;yields&quot;</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">6 Carbon Dioxide molecules</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">6 Water molecules</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Energy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some glucose (sugar) plus some oxygen (inhaling) turns into carbon dioxide (which you exhale), water, and <strong>energy</strong> (the whole point of why your body does respiration).</p>
<p>So <strong>respiration exists to convert sugar to energy</strong>, the process requires oxygen to work, and the <em>byproducts</em> are water and carbon dioxide. Because plants and animals both need energy, they both respirate the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Photosynthesis</strong></p>
<p>How do these organisms obtain sugar in the first place?</p>
<p>Animals eat, which gives them the glucose they need to respirate and create energy. Plants can't eat the same way, so they <em>photosynthesize</em>. The equation for photosynthesis is the following:</p>
<p><strong>6CO^(2) + 6H^(2)O + ATP --&gt; C^(6)H^(12)O^(6) + 6O^(2)</strong></p>
<p>Look familiar?</p>
<p>It's respiration, but backwards. Plants take energy from sunlight (as well as carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the soil) in order to produce glucose molecules (and oxygen as a byproduct). Obviously the catch is plants can only photosynthesize in the sunlight, so they create as much sugar as they can while the sun is out. They don't die when the sun goes down, because they can store the sugar, therefore they can continue cellular respiration 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>Instead of lungs or gills, plants have holes called &quot;Stomata.&quot; All living things are doing cellular respiration, but it requires sugar. Plants create sugar with sun energy through a process called photosynthesis. Animals obtain sugar by eating plants, or other animals.</p>
<p>If you trace it up, our energy comes from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do plants ever make too much and store it and get &quot;fat&quot;? Or is it never the case because they just use it to grow bigger and bigger, or put the energy into seed production or something?</p></div>		</li>
