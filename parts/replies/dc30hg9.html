<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease</a></p>
<p>It wasn't until the late 19th century that we started to accept that disease transmission wasn't caused by smell, but rather by contagious germs.  People were commonly dying in hospital because of puerperal fever because doctors would commonly work on cadavers the deliver babies without washing their hands, or that sewage in the water could spread cholera.</p>
<p>That's really not that long ago.  The oldest person currently alive was born at the end of the 19th century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that we have living people who have lived through multiple  centuries is just incredible to me. I sincerely hope that they have been able to document their life and experiences. What valuable resources they are to our understanding of the world - especially the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DGAC commented &quot;cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern&quot; in 2015, so they have <em>already</em> reversed their stance on cholesterol.  </p>
<p>The general trend of meat and green vegetables being the base human diet has been happening for decades, with some veer-offs for marketing and lobbying.  Physicians have been advocating eating raw, green, leafy vegetables for as long as I've been alive, over 40 years.  </p>
<p>The area of grains is an Economic and Social interest to feed the population efficiently and keep farmers at work.  Now that <em>sufficient</em> nutrition is less of a Social concern, the emphasis is shifting to <em>proper</em> nutrition.  Obesity is the problem of the poor, not malnutrition.  </p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, <em>all</em> carbohydrates are identical except to people with health problems (diabetes).  I remember my mom measuring out her Weight Watchers calories in the 1970s.  Effectively, the diet was the same as what is recommended today:  Eat enough protein and vegetables, balance with carbs.  </p>
<p>Cholesterol and Fats are the conspicuous 'mistake' of the diet/health industry, and this was fostered by a great deal of ambiguous results, not to mention <em>some</em> pushing by the now-infamous Sugar Lobby.  Really, though, that science was tough to figure out even though the base-level diet was one composed of fats and proteins.  There were a lot of indications that an 'honest' Physician or Scientist could get distracted with.  Those distractions have rapidly disappeared in the last 15 years.  </p>
<p>That's my ELI5 as that's how understand it, LI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what ends up causing cognitive dissonance or unease is that when a layman disagrees with, questions, or points out the possibility that the current scientific consensus might be wrong, they are often treated with derision. </p>
<p>Then, when the &quot;clear deliverances of modern science&quot; turn out to be mistaken, everyone says &quot;well yeah, that's the whole point of the scientific method, <em>of course</em> it isn't always correct!&quot; </p>
<p>I don't really have a point, just sharing an observation. It generally is a best practice to accept the scientific consensus. I just think people (not you specifically, but people in general) ought to be a bit more humble about the possibility that current theories will need to be abandoned or significantly revised. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, biases shape our scientific conclusions way more than they should (they shouldn't at all, off course) .  When Ancel Keys did his &quot;Seven Countries&quot; study on diet, he clearly threw out data that did not support his pre-existing theories. That seems to be where most of our flawed thinking on fat/cholesterol and heart disease came from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem is that applying science to nutrition and health is <em>hard</em>.  Requiring humans to use will power in scientific studies leads to problems.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to find out if some kind of change in diet has a positive or negative effect on a person, you need to find participants that are willing to participate in a long term study, eating a particular diet (which many people struggle with even when it's not a scientific study), and you need to filter out the huge number of variables that may have an effect on the results (genetics, sleep, exercise, etc).  </p>
<p>As a result, there are many conflicting results of studies about exercise and nutrition and a lot of generally accepted practices get reversed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they have this - it's called other countries that don't eat our horrible western diet and do physical work for a living. Check out the Netflix doc &quot;forks over knives&quot; where they show entire cultures with cancer risks 1/100th of what they are in the US. It's our horrible diets extra heavy in animal protein, dairy  and processed foods ( I'm not a vegan, although I'm pretty close at this point). Plant based and Whole Foods diet is the way to go. Agreed it doesn't help that on your way to the grocery store you might drive by 15 fast food restaurants. Fight the good fight. Live a long healthy life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the science is young, but there are a lot of things we actually knew 30 or 40 years ago - e. g. that sugar, not fat, is bad, but excessive lobbying from the sugar industry managed to actually make (saturated) fat the bad guy. It was all over the news a few months ago, I don't have the link to the study right now, but maybe you can google it. Here is a quick search result: <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/sugar-industry-paid-scientists-60s-blame-fat-heart-disease.html#14837422416921&action=collapse_widget&id=0&data" target="_blank">http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/sugar-industry-paid-scientists-60s-blame-fat-heart-disease.html#14837422416921&action=collapse_widget&id=0&data</a>=</p>
<p>Also, there was a lot of criticism regarding the &quot;cholesterol is bad&quot; hypothesis from the point it first came into discussion. If you read up on the first studies, you see how bad they were and how scientists still used these very shaky results to completely overhaul the guidelines quickly and without waiting for further results/studies. Some studies haven't been published until 10 or so years later, because the results &quot;didn't fit&quot;. (That's shown somewhere in this (very interesting) video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhzV-J1h0do" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhzV-J1h0do</a> )</p>
<p>Yes, it's a relatively young field - but we don't have to understand every little detail in our body to obtain knowledge about what to eat and what not. There was always criticism and influence from the industry, and somehow we managed to fuck things up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  No qualms with that.  The political thing isn't as relevant in my post because I was speaking more generally, and not just about the United States.  I can't speak to the politics and lobby's of other countries that I know next to nothing about, and like I had stated the other commentor had already hit it on the head.</p></div>		</li>
