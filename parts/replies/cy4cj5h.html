			<p>The Alcubierre Drive doesn't really break the light barrier. The drive uses the bending of space to make space push you. The ship itself is actually not &quot;moving&quot; in space, but space itself is pushing the ship. There is no known limit on the expansion of space moving faster than c, only things within space. IIRC, precisely because of this, a ship using an Alcubierre Drive wouldn't even experience the special relativistic effects (at least not normally) you would see at the extreme end of the spectrum.<br><br>Wormholes also wouldn't break the light barrier as you are just doing the equivalent of passing through a tunnel cut into a mountain instead of going all the way around.</p>		</li>
