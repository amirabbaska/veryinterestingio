			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect on many levels. Only the preburner for the turbopump is oxidizer rich, not the engine as a whole. Running oxidizer rich as a whole would significantly reduce the ISP, since ISP favors lighter exhaust gasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The oxygen-rich exhaust from the preburner then goes to the main combustion chambers where the remaining oxygen is consumed.  </p>
<p>If the preburner ran stoichiometrically, the exhaust would be inert, and the plumbing would coke up. Leaving excess oxygen in it keeps the exhaust gaseous and aids the combined cycle efficiency. Staged combustion rockets are pretty amazing.  </p>
<p>When you consider the overall cycle including the main chambers, the engine is pretty much stoich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stoichiometric wouldn't cause coking. It would just be too hot and melt the turbine. You get coking when running way too fuel rich, or when you just have very hot fuel and no oxygen at all (in cooling channels, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kerosene decomposes during the reaction and produces extremely light products like H2, CH2 (yes I mean CH2, the timescales here allow for radicals like this to be treated as exhaust products), and sometimes even atomic hydrogen. Fuel rich exhaust will have a lower molecular weight than oxidizer rich. You can download PROPEP and play around with it to see for yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The higher the temperature, the easier it is for the corrosion reaction to occur. Now imagine what would happen with a 1000K jet of gaseous molecular oxygen. The more electronegative an element is, the more reactant it is. Fluorine has also been tried as a rocket oxidiser but it literally destroyed everything it touched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nice and tame when it's at room temperature, diluted to 21&#37; at ambient pressure.</p>
<p>It's pretty aggressive when it's liquid and concentrated. It's insanely corrosive when it's a few hundred degrees hot and concentrated.</p>
<p>So corrosive that the US engineers thought that the Russian numbers for their engines were fake, until they actually tested the engines. Only very few alloys can withstand it long enough to be useful in an engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even that tame. Cut an apple and wait 10 minutes or powder up some iron and wait a couple of hours. You'll see the aggressive nature of oxygen pretty soon. Of course, it's much faster at higher concentrations and temperatures but that's true of most reactions.</p></div>		</li>
