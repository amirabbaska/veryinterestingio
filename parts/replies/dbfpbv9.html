<p>And before this there was just nothing to move?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>time is relative to each individual object's perspective. there's also a relation between the speed something is moving and the amount of time that it experiences.</p>
<p>as the speed of an object approaches c (the speed of light), the amount of time that object experiences approaches 0 (from the object's perspective, 0 amount of time experienced means it will have instantaneously arrived at its 100 lightyear destination, even though someone standing on earth would have to wait 100 years to see it reach its destination).</p>
<p>gravity also affects the amount of time an object experiences, because it bends the path light takes. instead of going straight from point a to point c, imagine that a gravitational field causes a beam of photons to go from point a, then curve to point <em>b</em>, then to point c.</p>
<p>as a result of the earth's gravitational field, your feet are younger than your head. however, this amount of time dilation is pretty negligible, and the actual amount of time dilation would be an extremely small percentage.</p>
<p>because time is capable of being manipulated by the velocity of an object and a gravitational field, we know time to be the &quot;4th dimension&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if one thinks about the North Pole as the &quot;past pole of the universe,&quot; (the point at which it all began)that you speak of, can one assume that the South Pole as a &quot;future pole (the point at which it all ends)? Is the end of the universe already happening somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We observed that the universe is expanding. From that we conclude that there was a big bang. </p>
<p>Now logically either that expansion goes on and on forever, or it will stop and gravity will pull everything back together in a &quot;big crunch&quot;.</p>
<p>We measured and found out that the expansion is actually accelerating, so there won't be a big crunch. The universe will just keep on expanding.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: am no physicist, explanation lacks nuance and might be wrong or outdated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the metaphor of North and South Pole though...</p>
<p>Just because you are accelerating away from the North Pole doesn't mean you aren't also accelerating toward the South Pole.  If the universe were somehow a giant sphere the Big Crunch could be on the other side when it all runs into itself.</p>
<p>But then again, what if the universe were banana-shaped...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would only make sense if the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch" target="_blank">Big Crunch</a> ends up happening. But given our current understanding of the effects of dark energy it would seem that instead of a globe with two poles, our universe will behave more like a bell, with a single pole eventually expanding out toward an undefined rim until the remaining low-energy radio waves, the ultimate decay product of all matter and energy, become infinitely remote from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then my next question would be where did the big bang come from? Either there was something or there wasn't . If there was something then what was it and if there wasn't then how can something come of nothing? And can it come from nothing again?</p></div>		</li>
