			<div class="markdown"><p>Love this about old hip hop. Not that I listen to much new stuff so it could still be that way. Eminem always kept up with this tradition on his albums. Ice Cubes War &amp; Peace had a lot of these small convo's and stuff (HEY CHOP, some haters tried to blow me up man!) I miss those days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They were doing this in the mid-90s too. But it wasn't always comedy because, you know, can't have gangster rap without breaking glass, shot gun blasts or burning rubber. </p>
<p>edit: Just double checked and that song is from '98 yo.</p></div>		</li>
