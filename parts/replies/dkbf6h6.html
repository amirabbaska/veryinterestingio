			<div class="markdown"><p>You're safe 9 times out of 10. But, companies like Pyrex actually suggest taking a fork and scratching the bottom surface of glassware before using it in the microwave. If you want to be sure you're not the 1 in 10, you could scratch the bottom of your glass before you put it in the microwave.</p>
<p>Edit: I would not recommend repeating my mistakes, by buying a bunch of Pyrex and trying to make this happen for a middle school science experiment. That was hilariously dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or if you don't want to damage anything, even deliberately, take a clean toothpick and put it in the water to float before you heat it in the microwave.</p>
<p>The pointed ends of the toothpick should provide enough of a nucleation site for bubbles and thus reduce the chances of an accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wash your glassware at least once before microwaving, the threat is basically negligible. Dried tap water will leave mineral deposits which will provide nucleation. A scratch will make you 100% ok.</p></div>		</li>
