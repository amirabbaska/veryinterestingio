			<div class="markdown"><p>Escape velocity is the instantaneous speed <em>sideways</em> you need to reach at a certain height above a planet. A big assumption we generally take is that acceleration happens instantly, so it takes no time to get from one speed to another.</p>
<p>Consider a rocket in a circular orbit above Earth at ~150km above the surface. It's orbital speed is about 7.8km/s parallel to the ground. </p>
<p>To escape means to escape the gravity well of the body you're orbiting. As gravity doesn't have a range, this is technically impossible, but we can describe it mathematically. We set escape velocity to mean that <em>without any other acceleration</em> our ship will eventually reach an infinite distance from its starting point, and when it does it will have zero velocity, it'll be at a dead stop.</p>
<p>As OP's equation shows, escape velocity is dependent on how far from the planet you are. In the example from before, escape velocity is 11km/s, and in the same direction that we're already travelling, so our ship needs to add 3.2km/s to its current speed to reach escape velocity.</p>
<p>In practical terms, a ship that reaches escape velocity will be on a trajectory out of its current gravity well. For a ship around the Earth that means it will end up in the same orbit around the Sun as the Earth, but a little bit ahead or behind depending on which way we were pointing. This is probably the hardest part conceptually. Just orbitting the Sun at 1AU isn't particularly interesting so rockets leaving Earth for other planets will reach a higher velocity than the 11km/s requirement which will put them on different trajectories around the solar system depending on the speed reached and the point in the orbit the rocket fired.</p>
<p>As for starting below the Earth, I hope you can see now that that's a nonsense question because we have to move sideways to reach escape velocity. Unless you had built a tunnel that would allow the rocket to fly out perfectly.</p>
<p>Again, whilst the question might be physically impossible, maths doesn't care about that. We have to assume that the density of Earth is constant and that it's a perfect sphere for simplicity here, but the way gravity works is that all mass in a shell above your current radial height cancels out, and all mass below acts as though from a single point at the centre. So whilst escape velocity increases the lower your orbit is, once you get below the surface it starts to get much more complicated; the gravity you have to overcome initially is lower, but it increases steadily until you reach the surface, which changes your trajectory from the nice simple parabola normally associated with escape. Again, that's assuming an instant acceleration. If your rocket is firing whilst its in the tunnel the maths gets very complex!</p>
<p>In your final paragraph you're exactly right. More speed means more fuel which means more mass which means more fuel etc. This is called the tyranny of the rocket equation as you need to know your final total weight before you can know how much fuel to take with you! The equation used to calculate fuel requirements is called Tsiolkovsky's Rocket Equation if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not true.  An object's gravity well is radially symmetric, so actually, it doesn't matter which direction you apply the velocity (as long as it's not back towards the object).   As long as your velocity is greater than the escape velocity, you will escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fair point, but I find it easier for people to conceptualise when you stress the sideways part, plus you have the advantage of simpler geometry and more efficiency given orbital speed is greatest at periapsis</p></div>		</li>
