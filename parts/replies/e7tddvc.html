			<div class="markdown"><p>The only point I would make in this, is that I think it partially depends on why they don’t have a limb, which could effect how the nerves form. That being said, I would guess there is a good chance the nerves would get pruned if they don’t have one at all, or even if born with a limb, but lose it very quickly </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original answer is not correct. Modern prosthesis don't connect the nerves which are lost to the robotic mechanism. What is typically used is targeted muscle re-innervation which remaps a different area or nerve to control the robot. For instance, it can remap squeeze a muscle on your back to close fist. Most of the research I've read into that seems fairly easy to learn as long as you have any motor function in the area that you're remapping to. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would also add that modern  prosthesis  only recapitulate motor function. There's not really much out there that offers sensory feedback. We might think of things like touch and temperature sensitivity as luxury addons, but actually if we consider that the location of our body-parts in relation to one another is itself a sense (proprioception), trying to bring this back is actually super-important for helping people regain 'normal' use of a limb. Certainly when we talk about bionics, that is the ideal dream we are working towards. </p>
<p>Interesting question from OP but doing a PhD making little neuromusucular constructs, I'd say this stuff is really too uncertain to give an answer. You could <em>control</em> a prosthetic with the 'wrong' muscle, but would you be able to reconnect some kind of sensory input and have that 'feel' as though it were the prosthetic? I haven't a clue. There doesn't seem to be any reason why not though. Certainly we have had a lot of success restoring hearing to those born with congenital deafness through such neural prosthesis, which gives me hope.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can easily reverse the point and ask if a baby given a extra prosthetic from birth would adapt to use it as naturally as a normal limb. From my understanding this would be the case. Nerves are simply pathways. Through evolution we have retrained the ones we need. But the idea that our brain uses a wire to control a single function has no basis in reality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it’s not connected to nerves, they would most likely still be pruned off as they aren’t being used. During our toddler years we prune off a huge amount of connections, and if the nerves aren’t being used the connections would most likely be pruned as well. So unless the prosthetic engages all those nerves there would be no reason to keep them </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a very interesting case that I can’t find anymore.  A girl with three fingers lost her hand in some accident.  She got phantom pain in FIVE fingers.  There is some part of the brain that knows what normal is.  There should be a way to interface with that.  That would be decades away though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the important part of that is what was there. If there was no hand to begin with, would the brain prune all of those away in during that phase? </p>
<p>And that makes sense since many nerves have multiple places for sensory data to be input. For instance, I pinched my ulnar nerve and have a whole bunch of numbness in different fingers (pinky and ring) and half my palm. So exact details could matter in those case. Of not, neurons were not my speciality </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I entirely agree with your summary, specifically: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do people born without a arm lack the nerves to control a prosthetic? Biologically yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue it really, really depends on what kind of prosthesis you're trying to use - or at least that this should be a much broader statement, because there are a lot of ways to control a prosthetic. Neuroprosthetic research is divided in a couple of ways at the moment, which for this situation could be simplified to study of motor vs sensory effects, and study of different methods of recording someone's intent and controlling a limb. A couple of the levels at which you could intervene: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can implant an electrode directly into the brain, in the area where people normally have sensation or motor control of, say, their hand. I would expect the hand area of someone born without a hand to be much smaller but probably not entirely gone - some people who are born without limbs have phantom limb pain even though they never had the limb, which is evidence that they at least have a sensory area in their brains that corresponds to that area. This might get complicated if someone has a brain implant and starts using it to control a prosthesis, because as they get better at using it their brain will probably start to remap the area, and if that remapping is drastic enough you may end up with less control over the area. This might also differ between people who have and don't have phantom limb pain. </li>
<li>You can implant electrodes in the spinal cord to stimulate for sensory inputs, or record signals coming from someone's brain to their hand so you can control a prosthesis. This will take some training, but all the structures should be in place for them to learn, even if it requires a little rewiring. Interestingly, amputees who have stimulation (at this level or elsewhere) for sensation often experience a phenomenon called &quot;telescoping.&quot; That is, at the beginning of stimulation they feel that their hand is about at the end of their existing limb, but by the end of the stimulation session (or after several sessions) feel that their hand would be at the end of a full arm. I don't know if studies like this have been done on people with congenital limb deficiencies, but they'd be very interesting. </li>
<li>You could stimulate or record on the nerves or muscles that would have connected to the hand. (Peripheral nerve stimulation and myoelectric prostheses are in this category.) This is the area where they'd be lacking the structures to control the prosthesis, but no more so than any amputee would. Therefore, we've come up with ways to work around this, as /u/zipykido said - recording from muscles in a different spot (say, the chest/shoulder) and letting the person learn to use those to control a prosthesis. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this is certainly speculation, so I welcome any comments with other ideas!</p>
<p>Summary: There are a lot of different ways to connect humans to robots and some of them might work better than others - but they would probably all work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easier to standardize it into some kind of brain-USB. Plug in an arm, learn to use it as an arm. Plug in a tentacle, learn to move it around. Plug in a tiny arm that is actually inside a tiny jewelry bench. Plug in a huge arm for industrial mining. Plug in a remote drone with 10min autonomous capability and explore the Moon. And so forth.</p>
<p>The real future of prosthetics isn't replacing lost parts, it's adding new parts that do not necessarily need to be connected to the body.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're talking about targeted reinnervation - not quite as far as I know. In amputees, normally they would perform surgery and move the nerves that used to supply the amputated limb to the pec for example. The nerves will then start growing into this new muscle.</p>
<p>This was basically to amplify the electrical signal coming from those nerves, so the patient is still imagining opening/closing their hand, but now the pec will flex in response and they just read the EMGs from it. Looks real weird too since the pec flexes in weird ways as a result of all the extra nerves.</p>
<p>Now for someone with a congenital defect, I'm not sure if they would even have the peripheral nerves left? At any rate you're right about the brain map, they'd probably have a very small representation left which may get overwritten by other parts due to neuroplasticity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah definitely! It was a bit misleading for me to reference a comment there about targeted reinnervation - there's a lot of great work there on amputees (ie Cindy Chestek with &quot;muscle burritos&quot; which is one of my favorite names for something.) But I agree, that particular approach wouldn't work as well with someone who has congenital limb deficiency so you'd have to do it another way. One of those ways would be to use the muscles and nerves that are there, but it would be somewhat different from how targeted reinnervation is typically done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why babies have trouble with fine movements is that their brain still needs to learn to interpret feedback impulses from your muscles.</p>
<p>There are several different nerve fibres that go from your muscles either directly to the brain or connect directly, at the spinal cord to fibres coming from the brain to your muscle. These fibres give your brain information about how hard your muscles contract and where relative to your body the extremities are. That information is processed in your brain and allows for finer movement. On top of that your brain remembers movement patterns and refines them before sending any order to move your muscles. </p>
<p>This is how you learn to ride your bicycle, your brain not only makes your feet push the pedals of your bike but also shifts your center of gravity automatically. </p></div>		</li>
