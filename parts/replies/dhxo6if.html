			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly. The epithelial cells lining the sinuses and ostia produce mucus and swell in response to infection, to trap viruses/bacteria and allow white blood cells to reach them. This can block sinus drainage, and result in otitis media (ear infections) and sinusitis. So it's the body's response to infection rather than the infecting organism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, is a sinus an actual purpose-made &quot;tube&quot;, or is it just a gap between other mushy stuff?<br />
Edit: badly-phrased. I don't mean to suggest any &quot;intelligent design&quot; type stuff. I mean- is it a tube type structure which (however it evolved or was selected for) serves the purpose of carrying air to the eardrum and keeping snot, or is it a gap which just happens to be there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sinuses themselves are an open space within the <strong>bone</strong> that is lined with respiratory epithelium (cells that are found within the respiratory tract). They serve many functions, including lowering the weight of the head; protection of organs in the skull (think &quot;crumple zones&quot;); and the cells within them produce mucus that can trap pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So when we dehorn cattle we are opening the other end of the sinus cavity to the outside world? What ramifications can this have outside of infection, does it affect the beast by causing more pain than the cutting of the horn alone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fantastic question. What vets usually do is called &quot;debudding&quot;, and it's the removal of the tissue that will turn into the horn before it connects to the sinus. This happens when the calf is still pretty young. </p>
<p>If you dehorn later, it is possible to leave an opening from the world outside into the sinuses. </p>
<p>Debudding removes the tissue when it is still soft and not bone, so it is much less painful (although all of these procedures should be performed with appropriate analgesia). The process also involves cautery which is nice since it stops bleeding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the answer. With the case of dehorning later in the beasts life, we tend to cut a few inches up from the base of the horn, I imagine to try and avoid the sinus however we were always just told that going to close to the skull could result in the animal dying after you bushed it. Does this still put the sinus cavity at risk via infection down through the horn wound?</p></div>		</li>
