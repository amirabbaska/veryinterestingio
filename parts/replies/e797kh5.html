			<div class="markdown"><p>another TAG caver chiming in. the Alabama Cave Survey defines a cave as having 50 feet of dark (aka fifty feet of passage). </p>
<p>anything less than that is defined by my former state survey as a karst feature.</p>
<p>by the way, lava tubes are rapidly formed caves. i currently live in Hawaii and plan to check out some newly formed caves with the Hawaii Grotto in January.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, wondering about stuff like this, is it dangerous in any way?
I mean, it's a newly formed lava path, so could you encounter lava if there was a small earthquake, and if so, how fast could it get to you?
Could it collapse?</p></div>		</li>

<p>How newly formed? IS this from the eruption earlier this year? Is that safe to go so soon after?</p></div>		</li>
