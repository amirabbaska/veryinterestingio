<p>So every sufficiently complex electronic device has something called state. This includes all types of memory like RAM and a hard drive, but it can also be in the form of tiny bits of memory embedded inside microcontrollers, transistors on circuit boards that act as memory, and also things like the current charge of a capacitor or even physical state like the temperature of the CPU or the position of a printer head.</p>
<p>When a device misbehaves, it just means that it has entered a state where it no longer functions properly and from which it can't recover anymore. While in most cases this is some kind of software error, it's actually quite common for your computer to freeze due to simpler things like an overheated CPU. Since a lot of that state is reset when the power is turned off, hitting the power button is just an attempt to switch back the device into a functioning state.</p>
<p>Note that apart from erasing state, another part of turning the power off and on is that it triggers the device to enter the power up sequence. This is usually a bit of code (called the &quot;bootstrapping&quot; code) where a device attempts to bring everything into a default initial state: computers will load the operating system into memory, printers will try to move the head back to the starting position, cash registers will feed and tighten the roller, CNC machines will recalibrate their position, etc.</p></div>		</li>
