			<p>&gt; how will one ever improve if not for others correcting them?<br><br>That's pretty much the only reason I correct people; not to seem better than them, but to help them to improve themselves.  <br>Some people don't like it, though. They say it is arrogant to presume that people like it when you correct them, but it's not about that.</p>		</li>
