<p>Our most recent common ancestor is so distant—more than twice as ancient as the first dinosaurs—that they represent an entirely independent experiment in the evolution of large brains and complex behavior... They are probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's an awesome way of putting it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) has about 500 million neurons in its body. That is a lot by almost any standard. Human beings have many more—something nearing 100 billion—but the octopus is in the same range as various mammals, close to the range of dogs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>0.5% as many as humans, though their bodies are much smaller overall. This is discussed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you work with fish, they have no idea they are in a tank, somewhere unnatural. With octopuses it is totally different. They know that they are inside this special place, and you are outside it. All their behaviors are affected by their awareness of captivity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Def sounds like consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An octopus's arm can taste, touch and move without oversight from the brain. To test if the brain also has centralized, top-down control over the limbs, scientists designed a transparent maze. To reach a treat in the upper left compartment (a and b), the animals had to send an arm out of the water (c), losing guidance from their [arm's] chemical sensors. They then had to rely on their eyes to direct the arm (d). Most succeeded (e).</p>
<p>It took a long while for the octopuses to learn to do this, but in the end, nearly all the animals tested succeeded. The eyes can guide the arms. At the same time, the paper also noted that when octopuses are doing well with this task, the arm that is finding the food appears to do its own local exploration as it goes, crawling and feeling around. So it seems that two forms of control are operating in tandem: there is central control of the arm's overall path, via the eyes, combined with a fine-tuning of the search by the arm itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's really fascinating. Doesn't sound like the octopus literally has multiple minds sharing a single body, but def something very interesting going on. The arms' relationship with the brain is maybe more like conscious-subconscious, but with reflexes/muscle memory/sensory processing.</p>
<p>Really cool. Makes you wonder what they'll look like evolutionarily down the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw a special called The Future is Wild that suggested octopuses would eventually evolve to inhabit land and might becomethe Earth's next intelligent life. At the end it showed a troop of monkey-like, tree dwelling octopi that were preyed upon by a species of giant, carnivorous octopi. It was amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH, the octopus system sounds an awful lot like a corporation. The main brain guides, issues broad commands, and theoretically can exert significant control over any one body part if it needs to, but mostly it co-ordinates, ponders strategy, and thinks about incoming data. The sub-brains are like workers, or even lower management, handling their own sections in detail and sometimes independently solving simpler issues without needing to kick the problem upstairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the difference is the degree of independence. In our case, if the connection between peripheral and central nerves are severed, peripheral function is diminished or entirely lost. It seems that in the case of octopi, there are &quot;autopilot&quot; functions in the arms themselves that persist even after separation from the &quot;executive&quot; brain.</p>
<p>A human analogy for octopus neurology might be a person who has had the connection between their arm and their CNS severed, but still grasps items placed in the palm of their hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading a book now that touches on some recent brain studies. It posits basically that we don’t consciously decide to do much of what we think were in control of. </p>
<p>Supposedly most of our actions occur purely out of our prior conditioning (evolutionary, societal, whatever, etc) and we then overlay a sense of control, or an illusion that makes us think we consciously made them happen. It is thought this is due to the benefits “having your shit under control” would have brought you in early hunter-gatherer society. I mean, who wants to go on a hunt with Bill, who isn’t really sure why he does the things he does?</p>
<p>If interested the book is called “Why Buddhism is True” by Robert Wright. Probably not the best source for information on this specific topic, but pointed to a few studies that have tried to delve a little deeper into the workings of the brain and consciousness. The comments above were mostly supported by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain#History" target="_blank">study</a> in which scientists examined the behavior of brains that had separated hemispheres. Super interesting stuff.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should really read <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mind-of-an-octopus/" target="_blank">the article I linked</a>; it goes into those questions.  In brief, the answers seem to be (a) the brains appear to be complementary, but (b) no one really knows for sure.  I don't find it horrifying; I think it's fascinating to see the different ways intelligence and sentience can manifest.  Having this distributed processing makes me wonder if being an octopus is more like being a 'me' or an 'us'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's as much of a 'me' as you are. Do you play a musical instrument? If so, do you really know how you make all those little motions at the same time? Brains work in a kind of hierarchical way, and what 'you' are is just the top executive function of your brain, but you don't really know how all the stuff under you (or over you) operates either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that we evolved independently is really cool, it's crazy to think about how many iterations it took to evolve into what it is. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2011 researchers Tamar Gutnick and Ruth Byrne, along with Hochner and Kuba, conducted a very clever experiment to test whether an octopus could learn to guide a single arm along a mazelike path to a specific place to obtain food. The task was set up so that the arm's own chemical sensors would not suffice to guide it to the food; the arm would have to leave the water at one point to reach the target location. But the maze walls were transparent, so the target location could be seen. The octopus would have to guide an arm through the maze with its eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's really cool, so it's sort of like a master slave relationship then, or hell maybe the arms are actually able to see the eye, it's actually really fascinating.</p></div>		</li>
