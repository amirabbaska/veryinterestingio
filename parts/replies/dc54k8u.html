<p>Thats the reason why coca cola is making ads. They are already the world leading brand, but its important to stay in the top 5 brands that you instantly recognize</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ferrari have their own F1 team and race broadcast on TV is huge ad to them.</p>
<p>They don't run commercials but probably make deals with automotive TV shows and movies to feature their cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ferrari and Lamborghini are not just luxury brands, they are status brands. They are the sort of brands that you buy to signal to other people how high your status / wealth is.</p>
<p>Those kinds of brands actually do not benefit that much from television ads. They already reach their target market through other adverts / word of mouth (like featuring their cars in movies, but also through car shows and advertising in certain magazines). A television advertising campaign will either pump a lot of money into something that won't reach their intended target market (instead only reaching people that can't afford them anyway) which is wasted money. Or, in order to appeal to the TV watching crowd, they would have to release a model that is affordable to them, which would actually be even worse because that would be a quick trip to losing their place as a status brand. When everybody can buy a ferrari or lamborghini, they lose that signalling power of showing how wealthy you are, and so the real cash making target group will ditch them for other cars that can still signal that. Having more customers is not necessarily a plus if those customers have much lower profit margins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made a habit of paying attention to when I buy something simply because I know the brand, and being aware of when I buy something because it was directly advertised to me (via facebook, amazon etc).</p>
<p>Advertising fucking <em>works</em>. I like it, too. Everyone is so cynical about it, but I just wish targeted advertising was even more effective, and that the invisible evil algorithms were even better at showing me what I might want to buy.</p>
<p>Spending money is fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay now take that advertising one step further. It works as you say, which is great right? Then in comes a company who wants you to consume <em>their</em> product despite it being inferior in every way to the product next to it. But hey advertising right? That's not a big deal. </p>
<p>Low fat yogurt people it's <em>low fat!</em>. It's much worse for you than the regular stuff because we loaded it with a bucket of sugar, but you've been so effectively brainwashed that fat is bad (also through advertising) that you're good to go!</p>
<p>Now think of some things that were promoted when it shouldn't have been (high sugar everything, low fat, donald trump, head on, etc.) and you start to see a problem. It gets even more sketchy when there's information that <em>needs</em> to be out there but is obfuscated (sugar is fine for you, as are cigarettes, alcohol is much better than marijuana, etc.).</p>
<p>It's simply too much control. People are sheep and easily manipulated. I think this part of history will be looked back on as a sort of an odd brainwashed consumerist slave era. We're 'happy' as long as we have lots of gizmos &amp; gadgets the rich elites sell us (and now use to spy on us I guess). The very things most psychologists agree fail to make us happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  I sometimes wonder how much money is wasted in advertising cars to me.  I've seen probably tens out thousands of impressions in my life on cars, but I will never buy a brand new car.  That's just not who I am.</p>
<p>If I have to see ads, targeted ones are way more useful to me.  When I was a cloth diapering mom seeing &quot;check out this new style of cover that you didn't know was a thing but is gonna save you 10 minutes a day&quot; was pretty useful.</p></div>		</li>
