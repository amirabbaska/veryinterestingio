			<div class="markdown"><p>Insects carry oxygen directly to every cell in the body through a complex network of tubes open to the outside called [trachea/tracheoles]( <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/1/225307/slides/slide_11.jpg" target="_blank">http://images.slideplayer.com/1/225307/slides/slide_11.jpg</a>).</p>
<p>Insects dry out easily, so they close their trachea off to the outside world with valve like spiracles. Only opening them when they need fresh air. </p>
<p>If you drop a grass Hopper in water it'll struggle for a while. When it opens its spiracles again after using up all the usable oxygen. It's tracheal system floods and they drown. They'll actually sink the the bottom when they flood with water. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely that the trachea flood: the spiracles are small, and water's surface tension would keep it from flowing through them. </p>
<p>But they might all collapse when the animal gets just slightly under the water. Our group published a paper showing that the trachea collapse/compress under a small increase in pressure. I don't know enough to guess whether the change in volume would be enough to sink the animal. </p>
<p>The way they figured this out was to use a giant particle accelerator to shoot an X-ray laser at some insects to video their insides, and simultaneously bury a pressure sensor inside their bodies. The pressure increases when the animals squeeze their abdomens, and when that happens, the trachea collapse in the X-ray videos. Because what else are you supposed to do with particle accelerators? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Death by drowning isn't always caused by a lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>In about 2/3rds of people who are drowning there is a reflex which causes the trachea (the main air tube leading to your lungs) to seal off when water tries to force itself down the trachea.  People who drown this way will suffocate.  For the other 1/3rd of drowning victims, their reflex to seal off the trachea fails and water poors into the lungs.  The lungs are designed to quickly exchange gases and are extremely permeable to alot of things, including water.  Water diffuses via osmotic pressure (water wants to flow toward salt concentrations, in this case into the blood from fresh water) rapidly into the blood stream and within a minute or two the blood becomes too diffuse and electrolyte balance is lost.  Cells begin to swell up and explode all over the body and the heart as well as most muscles stop working.  So it's not always a lack of 02 that kills a drowned man, sometimes it's just too much water (if you drink gallons of water too quickly the same thing can happen, just not quite so rapidly).</p>
<p>With a bug they have spiracles so they would most likely die due to too much water diffusing into their hemolymph (bug blood, hemolymph, is in an open circulatory system, in other words bugs don't have blood vessels).  Most advanced bugs, like insects, have sphincters or other tiny mechanisms to regulate how open the spiracles are to the outside air, these can seal off if the bug is submerged.  The insect would then suffocate, but it'd take a lot longer to suffocate than you.  A bug is cold blooded, it doesn't use nearly as much oxygen as a warm blooded animal.  It's actually pretty insane how much more oxygen we use at rest than cold blooded animals, compared to a lizard we use an order of magnitude more oxygen (if sealed in the same sized room, a lizard your body size would live 10x as long as you).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those with gills have the same problem in reverse - gills are poorly adapted to exchanging gasses without water, so they suffocate out of water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that raised one other question for me: why hasn't nature evolved a lifeform that can breathe perfectly fine both in water and out of the water? what's stopping this from happening (or stopped it from happening millions of years ago)? I mean we've got life living in the most extreme conditions, like bacteria or shrimp at the bottom of the ocean floor, feeding off of thermal energy, never seeing the light of day, and living next to toxic volcanic fumes. We also have the tardigrade which can survive full exposure in the vacuum of space. These are incredible evolutionary achievements, so the ability to breathe without hinderance in any kind of environment seems almost like a no-brainer compared to the aforementioned. Why hasn't this happened?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly because if you have access to air for your oxygen supply you have numerous advantages available to you that are not possible with the limited quantity you find dissolved in water. So those advantages are selected for and by default remove gills as a possibility. One major difference is thermoregulation, which requires a ton of energy and therefore a ton of oxygen. The reason we drown isn't because we can't get oxygen from the water (though it is less effective), the problem is we need way more oxygen than there is available in water in order for all the complex mechanisms in our bodies to function.</p>
<p>Fish are built to use very little oxygen. That's why you don't find any warm-blooded fish. The reason fish suffocate in air is because their gills collapse. Gills are structurally very similar to lungs but with little hair-like bits that increase surface area for oxygen transfer. When those aren't supported by the water, they all clump together and no more oxygen exchange.</p></div>		</li>
