<p>Eloquently put. This is the top answer I was expecting to see.</p>
<p>To expand on it, in some of the poorer societies, the more children you have, the better off you are (as all those kids can carry out labour for the family and bring in income). In the western world and in europe, the more children you have, generally the worse off you are (as each one requires additional financial support).</p></div>		</li>
