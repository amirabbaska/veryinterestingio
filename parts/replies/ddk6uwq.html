			<div class="markdown"><p>The most glaring aspect of it--as eeeezy notes below--is the lack of billboards and advertisements. But it's more than that, once you start to settle in the surroundings. The other trappings of capitalism are also missing: there is no social differentiation between people, so there is very little cause for animus. For example, in Havana, everyone is generally middle class. Now, to our standards they appear poor, because they're clothes aren't new and they drive old cars and their generally the infrastructure needs a lot of work (mostly thanks to US sanctions, btw) but they have access to excellent schools and the best healthcare in the caribbean, and no one is homeless. In fact, oceansides apartments in Havana that would cost tens of millions of dollars in the US or other capitalist countries, are occupied by ordinary people. In general, I found the people to be some of the happiest I've met around the world.  </p>
<p>Now, I don't want to give the impression that I'm unaware of the political problems in Cuba. I will just say that I went there expecting to find people who were timid and afraid the criticize their government. Instead, what I found were generally happy people who criticized and praised their government in the same way that Americans might. In general, I was appalled at how US propaganda about Cuba has worked so well to create an impression of the country that is so completely different from the reality on the ground.  </p></div>		</li>
