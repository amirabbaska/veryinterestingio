			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have more information on this? I'm always confused about calling it evolution when to me it seems like it should be called mutation. Do plants consciously change there structure or is it just some error that is more beneficial to the plant?
Say you have a red flower and the seed from that flower gets damaged and the resulting flower is yellow. All the insects flock to the yellow flower as they find it more attractive. The original red strain dies out as the yellow flowers are cleaning up the insect love. Is that still evolution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural selection is always about mutation and selection. Changes aren't made deliberately, but randomly, and the ones that lead to higher chances of surviving and reproducing are passed down. These genes then mutate randomly and the process continues, leading, over time, to a gradual change toward success. Not because organisms consciously choose to make a change, but because random variation occurs naturally, and random changes that increase the chance of procreation are propogated solely due to the fact that they increase the chance of being passed down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you described is a perfect example of evolution.</p>
<p>Evolution is mutation + selection. The changes are always^1 just random mistakes in producing offspring. The vast majority are harmful or do not benefit the mutated organism.</p>
<p>A very rare few just so happen to do something that makes the organism more likely to reproduce. This means that organism's offspring are more likely to take the place of a competitors' offspring that is unsuccessful. Over generations the mutation will spread and eventually all of the compatible organisms in the area will either die or breed with one that has the mutation.</p>
<p>This is a small chance for even one useful mutation, but when you have millions (or billions) of organisms, and tens of thousands to millions of generations, the mutations build up and the cumulative result is evolution.</p>
<p>It's very important to understand that this process has nothing resembling a plan or goal. The mutation could make the organism worse from our goal-oriented point of view; but as long as it makes its  offspring more likely to reproduce, the mutation will spread. Extreme examples which have little apparent functional use are often called runaway sexual selection.</p>
<hr />
<p>^1 There is also the study of epigenetics, which are heritable changes which can be triggered by circumstances in the parent's life. These are probably better thought of as more similar to changes in an organism as it is alive like muscle growth in response to exercise. You can largely ignore this concept until you get a much better grasp on the basics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only mistake in your example is the part about the seed being damaged. The DNA isn't absolutely trustworthy, so even descendants aren't just the mix of its parents, there are random mutations in each generation that got accumulated over many years. If you were to compare the flowers every year or decade you probably won't notice it, maybe comparing the first with one a century later, but I'm just especulating about the time scale.</p></div>		</li>
