			<div class="markdown"><p>Not directly a union issue, but there are theories that wages have stagnated due to non-compete clauses. </p>
<p>Once upon a time you could have left for a competing firm and gotten a large raise. Now youâ€™d have to do something else for a year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-compete's are usually for professional positions, not hourly wage type positions.  And, in most states Non-compete clauses must be reasonably limited in distance and time.  </p>
<p>There is an argument to be made that California's statutory prohibition on non-competes has contributed to the success of silicon valley. But, the prohibition has not raised wages in the California as a whole, as far as I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-compete clauses are increasingly being used in menial hourly waged jobs in right-to-work (one of the most offensive euphemisms I've ever come across) states. I've had students of mine working at fast food restaurants sign contracts with non-compete clauses. They're not being enforced, but we all know that it's just a matter of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly true about the non-compete.. though they are hard and expensive to enforce.  I've had several lawyers offer their service probono to beat down a non-compete if I ran into trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I work at a place that has an &quot;open door policy&quot; and the few times I've made very reasonable complaints about the conduct of fellow associates, the store owner/head manager makes it seem like I don't &quot;get along&quot; well with other people.</p>
<p>I'm talking about reporting that my coordinator verbally berated and abused me in front of my co-workers- for no reason whatsoever- and triggered an anxiety attack which required my medication to subside.</p>
<p>Or the time that my non-english-speaking co-worker kept getting in my way and hindering my ability to work by being overall sloppy and inefficient (putting things in the wrong areas, throwing trash all over the ground instead of in garbages, being very rude).</p></div>		</li>
