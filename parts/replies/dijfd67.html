			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not in the NBA, but I used to play street-ball (for about 20 years), and with tattered old nets, it would happen a lot.  Like, multiple times a day.  We'd usually just automatically count any basket where this happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>If there is a tear in the net at the NBA level, they replace the net immediately. They also inspect/replace any nets that are frayed anywhere between games. It's extremely unlikely (impossible?) for a net to go from unfrayed to broken through normal play in a single game.</p>
<p>You might argue: Okay, I know it happens never, but what if it did?</p>
<p>If all you cared about was avoiding a net break, a net that survived 4 or 5 games would be more reliable. A battle tested net is unlikely to have the internal flaws that would somehow result in a catastrophic failure. For the same reason the military battle tests its equipment, giving out factory brand-new rifles are more likely to have hidden manufacturer defects than rifles that have been bashed around. The fact that the rifles have been bashed around shortens their ultimate lifespan, but you avoid glaring manufacturing flaws.</p>
<p>Although much less romantic because it has nothing to do with game strategy, I find this answer more satisfying:</p>
<p>They give away pieces of their nets to charity and fans, so they maximize the number of nets used in games.</p></div>		</li>
