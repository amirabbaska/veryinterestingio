			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in computer terminology, regular sleep is like the sleep mode in your computer - it is easy for a scheduled process to run and bring the computer out of sleep mode. Coma is like hibernation - unless you press the power button, nothing else is going to bring that system back up and running on its own. That’s why you explicitly disable hibernation if you need the computer accessible remotely -- if it goes into hibernation on its own you need someone physically present to bring it back up and running. Problem is, humans don’t come with power buttons or the ability to reboot - if we shut down it’s typically for good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erections are controlled by the autonomic nervous system, meaning that men typically don’t have much control over them; much to the chagrin of adolescent boys in classrooms with sexy young female teachers. When we get stimulated (visual or otherwise), it just goes… up. With a mind entirely of its own. Only experience, trauma or distractions can affect this irrepressible little organ.</p>
<p>With that said, I would not be surprised if men in a coma occasionally got boners. It happens to men during sleep, at least once if not several times every night, and appears to be directly related to maintaining the health of the organ.</p>
<p>Although, I should point out that “morning wood” is typically not this. During a long sleep, the bladder can fill, putting pressure on the prostate. Well, the interesting thing about this is that it creates a feeling in the groin that isn’t all that much different from when the penis is already erect and a man is significantly aroused. So as we rise slowly out of our slumber this triggers an erection in a self-fulfilling manner, giving us that glorious response… at least until we go and drain the lizard. Which typically requires some ærobatics under those conditions, as the continued pressure of the bladder on the prostate makes that erection particularly resistant to deflation.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Probably yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, no. Unless a medical coma, the major question is &quot;Why is a person in the coma in the first place?&quot; There was damage to the brain. Was it a traumatic brain injury, was it a stroke, seizure, lack of oxygen, ingesting a drug, etc.?  Applying neurostimulation cannot do too much to fix what's actually wrong. Whatever the cause is, &quot;waking up&quot; doesn't mean reflex behaviors like opening eyes or moving/adjusting their body, you need a meaningful response to stimuli like having a conversation or obeying commands. After very close monitoring, if a person does not recover from a coma, they are diagnosed in a persistent vegetative state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of coma, but there had been successful cases in which, ironically, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9215-sleeping-pill-may-rouse-coma-patients/amp/" target="_blank">sleeping pills can be used to revive coma patients</a>.</p></div>		</li>
