			<div class="markdown"><p>For a bit of background, you can trivially calculate (to a high degree of  accuracy) the mass of anything that has an object orbiting it. That's the main way of calculating the mass of things in space.</p>
<p>That's why the error margins for the masses of asteroids and comets are so much higher than for planets, with planets we nearly directly measure the mass, with those other objects we look at the size, make a huge guess about what it may be made of from how shiny it is and where it is, and then go from there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the other object doesn't matter (this is an extension of the fact that &quot;all objects fall at the same speed&quot;).</p>
<p>In many cases the mass of the orbiting objects are negligible (for any of the gas giants, for example). When the orbiting object is large, it actually gives you <em>more</em> information. You basically add one more step, instead of looking at how far the tiny object orbits from the big object you look at how far each object orbits from the &quot;barycenter&quot; the center of mass of the two different objects. Either orbit gives you the exact total mass of the two objects. You can then look at how far each body is from that barycenter to see how much mass of that total each of them takes. If the big mass is 3 times closer to the barycenter than its 3 times more massive that the smaller object.</p>
<p>There is a bit more uncertainty here, but you can still get pretty accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vis-visa equation is the bread and butter equation for orbital mechanics.</p>
<p>v^2 = GM(2/r - 1/a)</p>
<p>Where <strong>v</strong> is the current velocity, <strong>GM</strong> is the gravitational parameter for the orbited mass (<strong>G</strong> is the universal gravitational constant, <strong>M</strong> is the mass), <strong>r</strong> is the current distance between the two objects at the current point in the orbit, and <strong>a</strong> is the semi-major axis of the orbit, which means the average of the farthest and closest points of the orbit.</p>
<p>That is the common form of the equation, because typically you are looking at the velocity you have now, and the velocity you need to have to be in the new orbit you want, because you're calculating burn times and fuel use and things. You can rearrange those elements to solve for an unknown GM given the known values for an object orbiting it.</p>
<p>I'll simplify that equation even more by assuming that we're looking at a circular orbit (r == a). Now isolating GM and changing from actual velocity, to angular velocity (a much more natural way to think about a rotating object) gives us this equation:</p>
<pre><code>GM = r^3 * w^2, where w is orbital velocity.</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter" target="_blank">Metis</a> has the lowest eccentricity of all of Jupiter's moons, so we'll use that since we've simplified to an equation assuming a circular orbit.</p>
<pre><code>GM = (127690)^3 * (2.467E-4)^2
GM = 1.267E8</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html" target="_blank">The real value is 1.267E8</a>, hurray!</p></div>		</li>
