			<div class="markdown"><p>They are saying there is no point because insect eyes are the product of natural selection, which is not intentional. Having a point can suggest, whether you meant this or not, that there was some idea behind them. So they're just trying to make it clear that the structure of insect eyes is the result of a natural process that works without thought or goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because evolution didn't happen with a <em>goal</em>.  So there's no <em>point</em>.  It wasn't that they went &quot;Hmm, you know, it'll be good if our eyes developed like <em>this</em>...&quot;</p>
<p>So it wasn't that there was a <em>point</em> to having it - it just naturally evolved that way because it's efficient packing and allows them to see better (and thus survive and reproduce) than if they had only a single sensory bit.</p>
<p>It's more that the question wasn't phrased very well, that's all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it depend what you mean by the point. There is two way to view that question.</p>
<p>Are you asking if there is an intend behind it or an end goal and then the answer ''There's no point'' is the appropriate answer.</p>
<p>But if you are asking the ''how'', then the answer is that efficient design occur naturally because they use the least amount of energy so they occur more frequently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: turns out it happens in insect eyes too: <a href="http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/imgoct12/dwIMG_0930a.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/imgoct12/dwIMG_0930a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: I've become more interested in this than I'd thought I would. It's impossible to tile a sphere with hexagons only - imagine a soccer ball. Mathematically it turns out, as long as each corner has 3 hexagons, that you must always have exactly 12 pentagons to fully cover a sphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some more details on <em>why</em> the insect eye hexagons occur based on the above. </p>
<p>Usually things in nature tend to be as close to circular as possible - intuitively, a circle is as &quot;relaxed&quot; as you can get. When a cell gets home from work and sits on the couch it definitely prefers to be shaped like a circle as it watches TV. But if you want to pack things together, circles don't work too well. To see this, put 3 coins on a table and move them close together. You'll always have a gap. But if the coins were made of jelly, you could push them together and some of the sides would be flattened. You'd expect things to come out as squares if you think about it for a bit. A square would offer a perfect tiling with no gaps - just imagine any old walkway made from square tiles. </p>
<p>So far so good: circles leave too many gaps. Squares could work, because they leave no gaps. But maintaining a square shape isn't very relaxing - it requires energy. A hexagon is a better approximation of a circle than a square, so they have a bit of an edge in terms of low energy - if something wants to be a circle, it's easier to force it to be a hexagon than to be a square. So with lots of cells around, this puts a slight edge on hexagons.</p>
<p>But, why not octagons? They're closer to circles than hexagons. The problem is, as soon as you bring in octagons you're forced to have squares: <a href="https://www.historichouseparts.com/pdshop/images/FXLMOWWT.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.historichouseparts.com/pdshop/images/FXLMOWWT.jpg</a> - a standard bathroom tiling pattern. And those squares would prefer to be hexagons, which push out on the octagons edging them towards hexagons themselves.</p>
<p>It's a similar thing with bigger shapes. Try making an eye out of nonagons and you'll end up with smaller undesirable shapes in the gaps. Basically, get too close to a circle and there's too many gaps, costing efficiency. Too close to a square and the cells will &quot;relax&quot; towards being a hexagon. A hexagon requires gaps, but not <em>too many</em> gaps, and those gaps can be pentagons which are relaxed enough, so hexagons (plus a handful of pentagons) provide the sweet spot.</p></div>		</li>
