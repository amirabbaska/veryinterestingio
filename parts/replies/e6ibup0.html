			<div class="markdown"><p>I just recieved a local anaesthetic for glass in my hand that had healed over. The shots were really painful until like the 3rd one it started to go numb and it was just pressure. Then they cut it open (which I didnt feel at all, very cool) to find it was too deep for the nurse in the ER to do it. So they sent me to an ortho. surgeon for surgery next week where they are actually putting me under.. should have probably gone there first because I have bruises all around the wound from those shots and it will probably look even worse after they dig around there some more. But that glass has got to go! And I've never been put under so that will be an interesting experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Modern anesthesia is insanely good. I was put under when they pulled my wisdom teeth - they put a line in the vein in the top of my right hand, and while waiting for the doctor I was suddenly in the recovery room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a general anaesthetic for the first time a couple of weeks ago, it was strange. Like you I went in to the anaesthetic room, was chatting to the doctor and then all of a sudden in the recovery ward with no sensation in or control over my arm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why didn't I get put under for my wisdom teeth? Hell, they have me fentanyl and I was still awake in feeling disturbing sensations of pressure throughout the whole thing. I think it might've been because there was something wrong with the nitrous oxide machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shots hurt? It's such a tiny needle. I had to get stitches after a particularly bad cutting episode and not much of any of it hurt. Seemed he missed a spot where he made a stitch, but even then it was more interesting than painful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its different for each individual and depends on the situation, but for most people, most shots of any kind hurt. I don't recall anyone liking shots, just tolerating them because they are necessary, but plenty of children are vocal about their hate of shots for a reason. Even as an adult I hate shots. Got the flu shot very early this year and it hurt like hell. I could certainly tolerate the pain for a few seconds, and it dulled to nothing after the needle was gone, but the initial piercing was a sharp burst of pain that required plenty of effort to resist flinching too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It must depend on the situation and location of nerves, etc.</p>
<p>Several years ago I got a pretty bad cut on my hand and needed stitches in the big meaty part of my palm, at the base of the thumb.  The pain of the original injury was NOTHING compared to the pain of the numbing shots they gave me before the stitches—to this day it stands out in my mind as possibly the worst pain I’ve ever felt.  It felt like they were digging around inside my palm with fire, I was squirming on the table trying not to pass out.  No one prepared me.  Would not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My second c-section with spinal anesthesia was so pleasant that in the middle of it I told my husband I could do it again, he said “why don’t you wait for them to finish putting your guts back together before we talk about another baby”. The first time around, after 22 hours of labor without an epidural, every touch was perceived by my brain as pain, the epidural they gave me for the c-section was not cutting it and they had to give me general. Second time around I was terrified of the pressure, even in the absence of pain, but it literally only felt like they were gently pushing around on my belly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A spinal anaesthetic /sub arachnoid block, is a very good example of blocking some nerves (pain) but usually not others (fine touch, stretch), as per the OP's original question.</p>
<p>Glad you had such a good experience of it and well done for giving it a shot after your previous epidural experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! The first time with the traditional epidural, it took 2 anesthesiologists 2.5 hours and 8 tries to get it in (turns out because I had subluxed a rib a year earlier my lumbar vertebrae were ever so slightly angled to the left, throwing their ability to get it in the epidural space, I didn’t know that until I got a blood patch after and he could see it on X-ray); after it was in, it failed on one side, I could really see how it works, even with pitocin going at max, I had no pain at all on the right but could feel every excruciating contraction on the left. I could also feel every other uncomfortable thing they did to me. The spinal though, it only took her two tries and 15 minutes and after that, pain and discomfort wise, it was like getting a massage where they hand you a teeny baby afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a similar experience getting a toenail surgically removed. They put in a nerve block to do it (which was weird enough - decently large needle, almost all the way through the toe vertically on either side of the bone).</p>
<p>I didn't feel any pain... but that didn't stop it from being <em>creepy as fuck</em>, yet I couldn't keep from looking away.</p></div>		</li>
