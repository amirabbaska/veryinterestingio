			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Life</em> seems to have showed up on Earth very quickly, but took a very long time for animals and plants to appear.  </p>
<p>Look at the diagram on <a href="http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/3438.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf</a>. The leftmost set of bars is Earthly geological eras, the one just to the right is Martian eras.  Earth had a proper crust by the start of the Archaen, Mars by the start of the Noachian.  That's a 300 million year difference or so.  Contrast this with the three billion years or so where Earth contained only single-celled life.</p>
<p>Earlier cooling just doesn't provide very much time, comparatively. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically yes, because Mars has way few mass than the Earth. But the point with the time still stands. Multi-cellular would have to have developped multiple times faster than on Earth.</p>
<p>And as I stated below there are other problems, which hindered such a rapid evolution.</p>

<p>Excellent point, but I think one should also consider what's the probability of <em>single</em> cell life arising on Mars.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how the first living cell appeared on earth, all we have are conjectures. Scientists more or less agree that liquid water is a must. But what other conditions are necessary? Perhaps the moon was an important factor. The moon creates tidal pools, that concentrate the chemicals present in sea water when they dry.</p>
<p>The fact is that we have so far only one example of a planet where life arose spontaneously, so we don't have enough data to make solid theories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that occurs to me is that we base all our requirements for life on the examples we find on earth. Of course life on earth requires the resources found on Earth. I have a hard time imaging why life is limited to only the types that live on earth or in other words require earth abundant resources for survival. It stands to reason that life on another planet would be specifically tailored to use whatever was abundant there. Is there something fundamentally wrong with this viewpoint?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>think of it like this: theoretically, life could appear literally anywhere, deep inside a space rock, inside of a star, or on an earthlike planet. But, the universe is enormous, so we need to start looking somewhere, and the one place we definitely know that it CAN is in the conditions where it already has, so, we look for those conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have reasons to assume any life will follow a pattern similar to that on earth. Carbon and liquid water form an environment very well suited for the complex molecules that life requires. Carbon is the only element that forms so many different molecules, due to the particular properties that only the carbon atom has.</p>
<p>Imagine, for instance, a life based on silicon. Our bodies extract energy from carbon molecules, by combining carbon with oxygen atoms and expelling the residue through breathing. Carbon dioxide is a gas, silicon dioxide is a solid. An organism using silicon atoms would have trouble breathing.</p>
<p>Many other alternative forms of life chemistry have been imagined by scientists and writers, but each one of them has some snag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your basic point that multicellular organisms like plants and animals occur much later on Earth than the end of the &quot;warm, wet&quot; conditions on Mars that would support them is correct.  If things played out similar to Earth then the equivalent of animals and plants would have been a long way off when Mars &quot;went bad&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the fact that multicellular animal life did not appear on Earth until ~600Ma ago does not preclude finding macroscopic fossils of other things much earlier.  There are plenty of macrofossils in the deep Precambrian on Earth going back billions of years.  You mention &quot;algae sheets&quot; (I assume you mean metaphyte algae like &quot;seaweed&quot;), but even single-celled organisms can produce macrofossils.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolite" target="_blank">Stromatolites</a> and microbial mat structures can be quite large -- tens of cm to even metres scale.  Stromatolites are found on Earth as far back as 3.5Ga, so it is conceivable that similar structures could be found in similar-aged rocks on Mars.  Furthermore, on Earth, that 3.5Ga limit is more a factor of not having older rocks in decent enough shape to tell if such structures were present (e.g., metamorphic rocks that are too deformed and heated to preserve fossils).  There is isotopic evidence that life went back even further, to about 3.8Ga, but at that point the preservation potential for even isotopic signatures drops to almost nothing.  The first half billion years on Earth (the Hadean Eon) could have had life, for example, but if so it would be regularly pummelled by gigantic impacts and few rocks of any type exist from that era on Earth, let alone ones that could preserve fossils even if life happened to be there.  Earth just doesn't have a good fossil record for its first billion years or so.  It's too geologically active.</p>
<p>The current rovers are well equipped to spot structures at the scale of stromatolite or microbial mat fossils if they did occur on Mars.  Unfortunately, they haven't found anything convincing.  There are beautiful sedimentary structures in the right sort of deposits to see signs of life like that (e.g., finely laminated lake deposits in Gale Crater), but they are disappointingly barren looking.  There's one paper claiming to have found microbial mat structures in the Curiosity imagery, but it is not accepted by most other scientists familiar with the subject.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stromatolites were my immediate response, glad someone has posted it.  A macroscopic evidence of microscopic life.  </p>
<p>Many people have mentioned soft bodied organisms, like nematodes and other worms, these rarely leave fossils, but the trace fossils such as worm casts are much more likely to show up if these did develop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point.  I didn't think of metazoan trace fossils also being an option.  Those are also present in the Precambrian, though they only go back about as far as metazoan body fossils do.  They animals have to be a decent size to start affecting sediments enough to see them, and that may be a limitation both in terms of what we can see of the first multicellular animals on Earth and hypothetically on Mars.  Smaller nematodes merely fit between the sediment grains or disturb laminations at such a small scale they would be hard to reliably recognize versus other (non-biological) processes.  Same for any other multicellular but tiny creatures like water bears (tardigrades) and many others.  So, maybe you could have metazoans going back further, but the record of them would still be pretty cryptic until they got bigger.</p>
<p>Stromatolites or microbial mats are still the best bet for something macroscopic because they go back billions of years on Earth and are expected to be present from very early in the history of life.</p></div>		</li>
