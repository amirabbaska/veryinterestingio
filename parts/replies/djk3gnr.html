			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you tell if you have this? This describes my sleeping pattern perfectly, but I always related it to me just liking to stay up late and having bad sleeping patterns. </p>
<p>For example, I just got a new job this week that requires me to get up at around 7:30 while before I could sleep until 11 or 12. While I still go to bed around 2 or 3 so I've been getting around 4 or 5 hours of sleep for almost a week now but I'm only tired while I'm at work. Once I get home around 5 or 6 I wake up and am wide awake until 3 in the morning still. </p>
<p>Even when I force myself to go to sleep earlier and get a full 8 hours or more I feel the same way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really glad you posted this.  I have never done a sleep study, but this describes me to a T.  When left to my own designs, I typically go to bed at 2 or 3 am and sleep until 11 or 12 pm.  It only takes me a few days to get back into this cycle so four day weekends can be a bitch.</p>
<p>I've been like this since I was a kid but my parents always labelled at as me just being lazy.</p>
<p>You may have just changed my life!</p></div>		</li>
