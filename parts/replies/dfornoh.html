			<div class="markdown"><p>Chimps (and indeed other simians, not to mention various apes) may not be physiologically capable of using human spoken language but they can, and do, still learn sign languages.  So can elephants, actually.  So we just need to be a bit more flexible in our communication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language is far more than just the ability to articulate the sound or sign. It's a specialized ability developed over millions of years under significant selective pressure, and derives from an organ whose complexity doesn't exist in other animals.</p>
<p>I would agree we can learn more about understanding animal communication by adjusting our paradigms, but it will not lead to language in animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language acquisition is a fundamental trait in humans.  That's why kids seems to learn their language effortlessly...they just pick it up.  Other animals do not have this trait inherent in them.  In short, they have no desire or drive to acquire language.  What little vocal signals they do use to communicate are basic and seemingly inbuilt (e.g. danger bark).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically it would be possible to obtain, through a veeeeery long and arduous process of selective breeding, a primate &quot;breed&quot; that can both vocalize close(r) to human speech and have a more developed language center, but the duration and especially ethics involved make it impractical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So realistically the most probable chance is in animals that are curious about speech: to help them develop their own elaborate language, and then help translate it... right? </p></div>		</li>
