<p>The funny thing is, I was entirely against no headphone jack. Always had a phone with one. The phone I purchased this year has one, but I havent used it once. I use bluetooth headphones at the gym, bluetooth in the car and if im at home, ill play music on my sound system with hdmi. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How much are your bluetooth headphones? I run a ton and I put my earphones through the ringer. Not to mention very few fit my ears the way I like.</p>
<p>Then at the end of the day there's a 21% chance I accidentally put them in the washing machine.</p>
<p>So yeah, for now I prefer my $7 trash-tier earphones that work via a cable. I'm probably an old man though</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe they removed the microSD card slot for just one generation. That may be what you're thinking of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya know, I always wondered why the original USB didn't use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio\)#TRRS_standards" target="_blank">TRRS style</a> headphone jack.  4 pins, headphones mistakenly plugged in could handle 5v, proven ruggedability.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure I would have call it a charging &quot;standard&quot;, more of a charging free for all</p>
<p>But the point stands, there was no wrong direction for the barrel connectors, though i think we lost more time finding the right charger than we've lost to USB superposition</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely wasn't standard. There were different sizes of round connectors, and Motorola (who made TONS) of phones didn't use a round connector at all, at least on most phones, like the incredibly popular dpc-550 flip phone.</p></div>		</li>
