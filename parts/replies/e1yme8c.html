			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago on a flight from the Bay Area to LA, I was seated next to a woman who didn't have her seatbelt on. As we approached the Tehachapi Mountains, we hit sudden, strong turbulence. She was thrown sharply into the overhead service panel and landed in my lap.</p>
<p>The AC vent had cut her scalp and she quite badly hurt her wrist as she tried to stop her fall. She bled all over my shirt as well as her own.</p>
<p>It was pretty dramatic. Your seat belt is useful on an airplane.</p>
<p>EDIT: We aren't married, we never spoke after the flight, and I have no idea if anyone sued. EMS met the plane and looked her over when we landed. Four or five other people got jostled but she was the only one injured as far as I know.</p>
<p>She was super embarrassed. The cut on her scalp wasn't serious, but of course any cut on your head bleeds like hell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We all spend the next two hours trying to breath through our mouths, pretending the entire plane doesn't know this lady shit all over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the exact feeling you all had...minus the turbulence.  Our plane was on the tarmac next in line to take off...me sitting near the back row...and a woman a few rows in front of me unbuckles and starts heading out of her seat.  She was immediately halted by the flight attendant, yelled at to return to her seat and buckle up or we can't take off. She says she needs to use the bathroom...its an emergency.  It was.  ☹ </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my friends is a very frequent flyer (her job to try hotels and vacation packages all around the world and try all their services - if you believe it’s a dream job to be well paid to do that, it is!... for the first year. Then, you kind of wish to have a stable relationship, a house with a plant you can keep, mow your lawn, keep your friends, you know? Her words!). While most of her flights were enjoyable, one became legendarily bad. Without warning, plane dropped hard, REAL hard. Then, a few seconds later, it stabilized very hard. Think of all the service people flying in the air, all the top trays splashing everywhere, people without seatbelts getting free air time, and then everything crashing at once. No warning. From this point, the seatbelt sign got permanently on, and they subsequently got a few other air pockets like that. Everyone threw up (like everyone, not only a few), broken bones galore, broken electronics, people scared of going to the restroom (yeah - think about that for a second while doing your fave six flags drop tower). Not a pretty sight.</p>
<p>Been years (pre-y2k), I don’t remember details but enough to stay with my seatbelts on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an air traffic controller, half my talking time is dedicated to turbulence. I know how sudden and severe turbulence can be when all I've done all day is say no ride complaints or mostly smooth, then out of nowhere one report of severe turbulence with injuries, and my airspace becomes a ghost town for 3 hours. I wear my seat belt when I fly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like they went through several severe low pressure regions. For those that don't know why that would cause such an extreme condition for the plane, think about how planes achieve lift. The plane's wings push against the air around them to generate lift. If, suddenly, there's a lot less air, as in a low pressure region, there is a lot less lift for the wings. If the pressure gradation is extreme, where the pressure is high, to low, then high again, in only a few hundred or thousand meters of forward flight, then you get a period of normal lift, a period of very low lift, wherein the plane will drop very sharply and suddenly, and then a period of restored lift, where the upward force is restored very suddenly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wearing a seatbelt saved my life. As a 100 mph car crashed into the side of mine and turned it into an accordeon, it was the seatbelt which kept me inside and made me only hit the wheel and not go through the windshield head-first into a wall. I was only in a coma for 3 days. The dude who crashed into me? 50 days.</p>
<p>So yeah, glad you got rid of that douchebag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i was just recently on a small half-full regional plane for a short flight and we were in the part where the seatbelt sign is off, when out of the blue we hit a huge amount of turbulence without warning. Most people still had their belts on just by default but the guy in front of me was probably a little over 6 feet tall and had his off, I watched him come a full 6 inches off his seat and smack the top of his head on the plane. The pilot comes on right after like “sorry folks that came out of nowhere, seatbelt sign is now on please stay in seats” etc etc, the guy was a good sport and i was like holy shit i saw that are you okay?? and he laughed and said he was fine but now i understand why the belts can be so important </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in about third grade, my bus driver was horrible with her speed over speed bumps. She also had the boys in the back of the bus and the girls in the front. No regulation, she just didn’t want boys and girls mixing. </p>
<p>Well because of the speeding over the bumps us in the back of the bus would get flung up in our seatbelt less seats over them. And then the girls would complain to the driver about the boys being rowdy. So she would yell at us to stay in our seats or have detention. </p>
<p>Eventually she gave up and switched to boys in the front girls in the back and decided random screaming was better than the boys having fun with it. </p></div>		</li>
