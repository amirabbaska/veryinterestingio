			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct ! While menthol  increases the threshold for what temperature the protein channel will open (starting a cascade of reactions so that your body interprets something room temperature as being cold) capsaicin lowers this threshold. </p>
<p>Edit: menthol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, different receptors on different neurons are at work here. TRPM8 receptors are sensitive to cold and menthol, and TRPV1 receptors are sensitive to heat and capsaicin. Each of these is part of the bigger TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) family of membrane channels that open up when activated to allow calcium ions to flow in, causing the neuron to depolarize (i.e. the electrical balance changes) and send an action potential (electrical signal) down the line to the next neuron and eventually to the brain to tell you something in that spot is cold or hot. This distinction is important because it means these molecules (menthol and capsaicin) aren't competing for the same signal at the same spot but are actually sending different messages from different neurons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they can both fire at the same time making you think it is both hot and cold. Your response suggests one cancels out the other but that's not the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it was answered &quot;yes&quot;, but it's actually not the TRPM8 receptor that is activated with capsaicin. That would be TRPV1, another cation channel in the same family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar. The protein responsible activates when something's too hot to protect your mouth from being burned.</p>
<p>Capsaicin activates it as well as a discouragement to try stop you eating the seeds as mammalian digestive systems render the seeds unviable.</p>
<p>So your brain is basically getting the message that whatever you're eating is <em>really</em> hot and you should be spitting it out - just a shame we're all culinary masochists when it comes to spice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's going on with orange juice after toothpaste?</p>
<p>It's normally delicious but magically becomes rank if you drink it after brushing your teeth.</p>
<p>(Also yes, I know that it's a bad idea to drink orange juice directly after brushing my teeth but you can't stop me Reddit, you're not my real dad!)</p></div>		</li>
