			<div class="markdown"><p>On genetic part, my family has quite a long history of schizophrenia. My uncle had it, my to siblings has it, and it runs up in my family tree, on every branch. </p>
<p>I have mental problems too. So I was quite scared about schizophrenia. But after my doctor's explained to me that even that I have genetics for it, It rarely starts after age of 25. </p>
<p>I started to do research on my family and every one who has/had it, it always started between 16 and 23. Which supports dopamine hypothesis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Schizophrenia is related to an excessive amount of Dopamine. That's what causes hallucinations, and that's also why a lot of drug users develop psychosis.
Thanks for the explanation of disassociation! I haven't learned about that yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_hypothesis_of_schizophrenia" target="_blank">dopamine hypothesis</a> isn't universally accepted and it's not strictly about excessive amount of dopamine; rather it's about overactivation of dopamine receptors. Overall schizophrenia appears quite complex in its causes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Psychology major here. You're entirely wrong that genetics play a larger role than environmental factors in schizophrenia, or any other psychological disorder for that matter. Interestingly, schizophrenia did not exist before about the 16th century, which is around the time Western hyperindividualism began to emerge. Schizophrenia's symptoms, including alienation and highly idiosyncratic thoughts and behaviors, mirrored this new cultural system. It is one of many psychological disorders that are culturally specific.</p>
<p>Human psychology is not biologically determined. There are no genes that produce specific psychological traits regardless of environment. Instead, genes merely produce dispositions or vulnerabilities to particular traits; whether they manifest, however, depends entirely on environment.</p>
<p>By the way, family studies, which are observational studies, are insufficient to establish causation. The main issue, when it comes to biological determinist suggestions, is that while family members may share similar genes, they also share similar environments. In order to establish causation between genes and behavior, experiments are necessary. No experiments to date have confirmed biological determinism. On the contrary, due to what's known as the <em>missing heritability problem</em>, which is the failure of researchers to pin specific genes to particular behaviors (and not for lack of trying), the available evidence suggests that biology's role in psychology is general and nonspecific. Biology merely serves as a general potentiating substratum for psychology; it does not have a deterministic role in this regard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical engineer specializing in computational image and genome analysis chiming in. While you are mostly correct, I'd have to disagree with certain things.</p>
<p>Genes don't directly cause a specific psychological trait, but they definitely do alter neurogenesis at the cellular level. The resultant of these neural deformities give rise to some psychiatric disorders or behaviors. You are right when you say genes produce dispositions, but simply downplaying biological effects is naive.</p>
<p>Dysregulation of nFGFR1 gene is recently being studied for it effects on schizophrenia. If this gene goes awry, precursor to neural cells migrating form the ventricular zone to the cortical plate migrate further than they are supposed to, and the neurons they form at the cortical plate are misaligned relative to the cortical surface. Controlled studies in lab where epigenomic factors are controlled have shown that the genome plays a crucial role in the development of schizophrenia. With environment taken out of the equation, if this certain gene or other unknown genes affecting neurogenesis become dysregulated, a psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia is imminent. There is no avoiding a psychological disorder if the brain is wired wrong from the very beginning. The extent or time of onset of symptoms could have something to do with the severity of a malformed neurons, but we're not sure.</p>
<p>We have not yet specifically pinned the genes to various psychiatric disorders, but we do know they affect brain development and ultimately control mental disorders.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure that's entirely true. Sure, neural deformities may increase vulnerabilities to particular disorders, but strictly speaking, there are no biomarkers for psychological disorders. Various biological features, such as enlarged brain ventricles sometimes seen in schizophrenia patients, associated with particular disorders are not always present in individuals who suffer from them, and many individuals with such features do not exhibit any disorder at all. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The link between biology and behavior, in humans, isn't as simple as biological feature X causes behavioral trait Y. This is because, as I mentioned, biology's role in human psychology is general and nonspecific. The specific form and content of psychology is not biologically determined. </p>
<p>I'm not downplaying biology's role, only putting it in its place. You seem to be downplaying the brain's plasticity, however. </p>

<p>Human psychology is fundamentally cultural, so it's not really possible to control for all potentially confounding environmental factors, unless perhaps your participants are feral humans who've not undergone any enculturation whatsoever, in which case there wouldn't even be many psychological traits to study. As I mentioned above, schizophrenia is a culturally specific disorder. Its specific form and content, like psychology in general, is not biologically determined. Vulnerability to it, however, does appear to be affected by genes.</p>
<p>Please provide evidence that all individuals afflicted with this particular genetic abnormality succumb to schizophrenia or other disorders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof, flashbacks of being a confident young psych major who thought I had it all figured out. Thanks for the memories, dude. </p>
<p>I mean, first of all, note the sub that we're in. This is ELI5 and mine is a top level comment. I was not going to go into the entire biospsychosocial model on ELI5. This is supposed to be an explanation for laymen. </p>
<p>Secondly, I'm sorry if you interpreted my comment as an indication that I believe in biological determinism? Schizophrenia is definitely one of the disorders that is more heavily influenced by biology but I still avoided saying flat out &quot;schizophrenia is caused by your genes&quot;. I said it plays a role. In schizophrenia, it plays a pretty big role compared to some other disorders in which genetics seem to play a smaller role. </p>
<p>It seems like you hold a different opinion about the role of genetics in psychology than most people in the field. That's an interesting perspective. You should keep in mind that while your perspective is part of your theoretical orientation and important to you, it's not necessarily a universal truth that everyone has to accept as fact. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You said that genes play a bigger role than trauma when it comes to developing schizophrenia. This is untrue. As Wayne Weiten notes in <em>Psychology: Themes and Variations (10th Edition)</em>: &quot;Although the evidence indicates that genetic factors influence the development of schizophrenia, it does not appear that anyone directly inherits the disorder itself. Rather, what people seem to inherit is a certain degree of <em>vulnerability</em> to the disorder. Whether this vulnerability is ever converted into an actual disorder depends on each person's experiences in life&quot; (95). Whether schizophrenia develops depends almost entirely on life experiences, including traumatic ones. All genes appear to do is make individuals more or less resilient in the face of stressful experiences. </p>
<p>Schizophrenia will not develop in genetically vulnerable individuals brought up in secure environments, and it often develops in individuals who are not genetically vulnerable. This applies to all psychological disorders, by the way, not just schizophrenia. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not at all. Biological determinism is not accepted by mainstream psychologists (despite being popular among laypeople). My view is in line with Weiten's. His book is widely used in introductory psychology courses across the US. It represents the standard position in the field. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, would you mind providing a source supporting your claim that genes play a more prominent role in schizophrenia than other disorders? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that even though we don't fully understand human psychology and which triggers what, that doesn't mean that genes doesn't take part of our brain function. </p>
<p>Yes me and my siblings share same environments, like same trauma as when we were little. But that doesn't explain our distant families which I haven't even know about without research. There is lot of correlation with blood lines and mental disorders, without sharing same environments.</p></div>		</li>
