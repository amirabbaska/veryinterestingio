<p>Trophies? Statues?</p>
<p>Genuinely curious what artifacts you get given.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father was a true collector.  So I guess I come by it honestly. Most were personal papers from his time in the lodge, his original study cypher. Various books, several masonic badges he had collected over the years including several that date to the 1800's English lodges. I have those in a case :)</p>
<p>And various parts of his regalia throughout the years.  I incorporate them into my own when I can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being an Englishman myself, I'd be really interested in seeing those badges if you ever post pics of them online.</p>
<p>Freemasonry sounds like something I'd like to get involved in. The tradition, charity work and self-improvement all speak to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing :)</p>
<p>Edit: also by the 'York rites' I'm going to assume you're a fellow Yorkshireman :D</p></div>		</li>
