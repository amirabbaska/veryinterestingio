			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I was waiting for someone to reference some of my visuals. This is exactly why I spent hours making them. I also made some for <a href="http://imgur.com/a/pgoAm" target="_blank">4D conic sections</a>, a while back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, though in order to do that, I have to use GIFV format, which removes the option to make the nice galleries, imgur-style. If Imgur would allow a greater than 5mb upload, I can take more frames per gif for better smoothness. Plus, I'd also be able to show more angle scans in between 0 and 90 deg. Although, I probably could have taken a higher resolution scan of just one 90 deg pass, and repeat it 8 times, which would have achieved the desired outcome. It's a continual learning process. And, you're welcome! The 3D plus 2D scans side by side are the first of its kind that I made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this the most perfect explanation for virtual particles? 45° 4D tori (toruses) passing through our perspective of 3D space-time?</p>
<p>The only question is what is happening when the particles can't re-fuse into nothingness such as in Hawking radiation from black-holes? Is the 4D torus being trapped, stretched or broken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh had exact same thought today morning. Then instead of infinite particle / hole source like in Dirac sea our 3D space would be just a slice of 4D space with 4D objects occasionally passing through this 'slice', causing virtual particles / other weird phenomena. Hawking radiation would be stuck, broken torus then ;) </p>
<p>The issue is torus seems to be weird/unnatural shape, and passing through one angle (0°) would be somehow privileged. Anyway I think QM/QFT has better explanations, but this seems like a fun mental exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also speculated how the particle/antiparticle pair looked quite a bit like a (hyper)torus passing through a lower plane. I imagine trillions upon trillions of Planck-scale donuts permeating a higher dimensional space, while our now-moment slices them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing I've found about physics and math is usually a bunch of explanations can explain the same phenomenon, but it's only after the phenomenon is well understood that we can show that each explanation are different sides of the same coin.  </p>
<p>(An example on a simple level is finding changes in velocity based on using conservation of energy to balance total energy with kinetic + potential energy, or finding the same changes using Newton's laws.)</p>
<p>So who knows what we'll discover as we gain better understandings of quantum physics!</p></div>		</li>
