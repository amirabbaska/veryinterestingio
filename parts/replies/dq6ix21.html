<p>It should depend upon the speed at which it's exposed to the vacuum. On Earth, when marshmallows are exposed to a vacuum slowly, we see them get larger until the air inside of them is also evacuated, at which point they shrivel up. Plenty of videos of this online.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but such a device is pulling the air out of the chamber to create a vacuum. In space (assuming that there is no greater source of gravity in the immediate vicinity) any air pulled out of the mallow would just form a little sphere around it, right? Like a tiny mallow atmosphere.</p>
<p>I wonder how this would change the process.  Might the internal pressure equalize with the atmosphere at some point? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the marshmallow/person has a rather significant form of gravity, I would assume the escape velocity of the air means that the air would move from the high pressure area, to the low pressure area (the rest of space) and continue in that outward path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth has an atmosphere only because it has a strong enough gravitational field to hold the air stuck to it. Thus, the marshmallow being much less massive wouldn't have such an atmosphere. The air around the marshmallow would just disperse because of its high pressure there and low pressure everywhere else.</p>
<p>That's actually what wind is. It's the movement of air from high pressure sites to low pressure sites, in order to balance atmospheric pressure, only that in a vacuum the pressure is almost 0, and the air in the marshmallow would be at atmospheric pressure, so it would rapidly and violently move away from the marshmallow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not that easy to hold on to gas molecules. </p>
<p>Gas molecules get energy from the sun (or meteors), sometimes it uses that energy to go away from the planet. If it has enough energy to escape (escape velocity) that molecule is gone.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Mars (a 10th as much mass as Earth) doesn't have enough mass to keep a thick atmosphere. Mars has a thin atmosphere, nowhere near as much as it once had.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I think you would need to assume no other gravity or energy source anywhere. The universe would consist entirely of your marshmalllow + marshmallow-air atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes energy to move to a higher orbit, so the closer you go to the sun the more energy you need to get back to earth. </p>
<p>Counterintuitively you also need more energy to get to a lower orbit from a higher initial orbit; it's actually harder to throw something into the sun than it is to get anywhere else in the solar system.</p></div>		</li>
