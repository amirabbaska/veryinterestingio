			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a money bag that my work uses. It is a simple canvas bag, certainly it's somewhat thick, but it could easily be cut with a standard pair of office scissors. It also features an obscenely hefty lock built into the zipper because??? Anti-theft?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol yep have the same thing at my job. The zipper doesn't close all the way on one of the bags we have so the lock is useless. But yeah the bag makes it look like something valuable is in there and makes it more prone to theft IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course not, but it's less likely that a postal worker would be noticed pocketing 3 or 4 envelopes in a day than ripping open 3 or 4 thousand so it's an effective deterrent for most of them. I say most because a couple have been caught just taking all the mail home to open it. lol</p></div>		</li>
