			<div class="markdown"><p>When studying in Spain, I was taught that the common depiction of the heart was taken from Islamic Moorish doctors. They showed us photos of really old medical texts from around 700-800 CE that had the exact same shape</p>
<p>Edit: meant to type CE, not BCE</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be. If you look at medieval European art, this shape for the heart seems to show up first in Spain, possible that they'd seen something from the Arabs. Depictions of Christ and his wounds themselves have a history of increasing abstraction, and note our particular association of this style of heart with St Valentine.</p>
<p>Also I forgot to mention that there is a Devotion to the &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; of Jesus, but also a Devotion to the &quot;Immaculate Heart&quot; of Mary; both of these hearts are always portrayed in this stylized fashion, the Sacred Heart being the older of the two</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's an eye-roller to cite wikipedia here, but the article there says the heart shape was only associated with the symbolism we think of today starting in the middle ages. The book they cite has the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NGAsjNXEJjcC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">relevant chapter</a> visible on google books. For instance, on p.84 there is a picture from 1305 of someone handing her heart to Christ, and it has a realistic shape. The author is pretty skeptical about the existence of a nice origin story for the heart shape as we know it today, but it looks like /u/deepsepia's idea was pretty close to what that author was saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those photos would not have been from or at all related to islamic moorish doctors unless those doctors time traveled 1400-1600 years backwards to almost two millenia before their religion existed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shape's origin is highly disputed. Some argue it comes from a concraceptive seed used by people of the Roman Empire that has since gone extinct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The origin may be disputed, but how it becomes popular in the West isn't-- while you might find this symbol in obscure texts, the reason we're all familiar with it is the Christian iconography. . . the Devotions of the Sacred Heart and Immaculate Heart are familiar to tens perhaps hundres of millions of Catholics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very likely pagan (too old to tell but definitely not christian), relating to the buttocks/female genitalia.</p></div>		</li>
