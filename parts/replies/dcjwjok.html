<p>or they could default to the standard WTO deals while the sort out their own but these come with their own problems. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, even that is based on a misconception. There are several <em>huge</em> problems to be surmounted even for that to be possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>first, the UK would have to enter the WTO as an independent entity in the first place. Even that requires a lot of negotiation, and every single WTO member has the power to veto it. (and many countries might be tempted to ask the UK for a little something in return for not vetoing this. You know, maybe you should establish lower tariffs on the types of goods that <em>we</em> export. Otherwise, you know.... we might be forced to veto the whole thing)</li>
<li>then, sure, standard WTO rules would apply, but the rules by themselves are only a small part of the story. All the specific numbers still need to be filled in</li>
<li>tariffs on thousands and thousands of different types of goods would have to be agreed on. Again, each and every WTO member has the power to veto these (and again, many countries will be tempted to use this to pressure the UK for favors). The safest approach here would be to just say &quot;ok, never mind, we'll just copy whatever the EU's tariffs are&quot;. Other WTO members might be less inclined to dispute that, because it's really business as usual, but it also means the tariffs won't be tailored to the UK economy. For example, the EU's current tariffs protect trade on sugar beets, which is a big deal in the rest of the EU, more than sugar cane, which the UK happens to mainly export. But it's better than nothing.</li>
<li>But even that is only the easy part. So great, now the UK is a member of the WTO, and it has tariffs in place on every type of trade good. Now what about all the quotas? How much steel should other countries be allowed to sell to the UK at this nice low tariff rate, before you switch to the next, higher level of tariffs? How many oranges? How many biscuits? Again, there are thousands and thousands of those in place for every WTO member, and the UK can't simply copy <em>these</em> numbers from the EU as they can with the tariff rates. These numbers have to be set uniquely by each country. And of course, every single WTO member can veto this as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most trade experts feel that even just &quot;reverting to WTO rules&quot; is only barely doable within the 2 years that Article 50 gives, and that's if the UK focuses 100% on that. In reality, much of the focus will instead be on negotiations with the EU.</p>
<p>So in short, the UK is going to be <em>hugely</em> reliant on goodwill and leniency from other countries over the next two years. If the EU makes the negotiations difficult, the UK won't have time to find a deal. If any WTO member anywhere in the world wants to hurt the UK, they'll get a perfect opportunity. So the UK is going to need friends, lots of them, even if they give up on the EU and just wishes to &quot;revert to WTO rules&quot;</p></div>		</li>
