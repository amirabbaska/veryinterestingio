			<div class="markdown"><p>england back in the day: &quot;let's just ship all of our undesirables to some remote, hellish island where we'll never have to deal with them, BRILLIANT!! and we'll call it &quot;australia&quot; and we'll never have to worry about them messing up our perfect society because they'll be so miserable as to set an example for our nation as to why not to have fun in our perfect country!!&quot;</p>
<p>(much, much, later)</p>
<p>England:&quot;Well that backfired, turns out all of those people who compose society and are technically the very fuel for society just up and made their own culture based on their own values and desires, they're having a jolly good time, even lost a war with an army of emus somewhere down the road, they're now hardier, more fun and technically superior to the average brit and the world absolutely loves them!! who knew that people were what made society all this time? gosh i never could have seen this coming!!! they've got blokes boxing kangaroos who threaten their dogs, adorable duck-billed mammals that can poison you if you make them mad enough, and their capacity for hard drinking could make most germans blush.</p>
<p>Welp, at least we make for fine james bond supervillains and have better tea than they do.....that's gotta count for something...right&gt;</p>
<p>....right?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Germany if you're registered at an adress for at least 3 months you'll get a &quot;Wahlbenachrichtigung&quot; which tells you the date of the coming election and the location and opening times of your &quot;Wahlbüro&quot; (=place to vote).</p>
<p>It all comes automatically. Only thing you need is a registered adress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when you move home you have to setup council tax which is usually the initial trigger for getting a letter to register to vote, then you get the yearly one.  And when an election local, general or for the time being European is coming up you get your voter card posted. Voter card tells you when the vote is and when the deadlines to apply for proxy or portals votes.  If your voting in person you don't need to do anything, don't even need your voting card, just turn up at the local voting station indicated on card o  the day to vote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same in Spain. You receive a letter with where you have to vote and just need your DNI to vote. I think the major problem the US has on this regard is that they don't have any national ID system like every other country, so it's close to impossible to have a voter database which is also merged with a resident database.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Canada, every year we do our income taxes, Revenue Canada asks if we want them to automatically pass on our voter registration to Elections Canada. It's a simple check of the box, so easy.</p>
<p>The question on our tax forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a Canadian citizen, do you authorize the Canada Revenue Agency to give your name,
address, date of birth, and citizenship to Elections Canada to update the National Register of Electors?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you don't check that box, you can still register pretty easily in other ways, including by showing up at your polling place on voting day and taking an extra couple minutes to register. Plus, we generally have generous advance voting periods, long hours at the polls on the official day of the election, and you can go to your returning office at any point during the election and vote by special ballot.</p>
<p>We make it pretty easy to vote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t the issue.  The US has many ways to register similar to this.  The issue in the US is for people who don’t have ID, don’t necessarily pay taxes, don’t have a permanent address, but are US citizens, thus have a right to vote.  </p></div>		</li>
