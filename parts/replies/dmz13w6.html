<p>It took decades of research and observation to identify the adverse health effects to chronic users of other tobacco products</p>

<p>The false studies and propaganda campaigns of the tobacco industry sure didn't speed the process :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. We have already started doubting the safety of vaping, whether it's been proven or not. Tobacco and cigarettes were not even close to being introduced this way. Doctors recommended smoking, ffs. No credible doctors are going to take &quot;big vape&quot; money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely anecdotal, but here it goes.</p>
<p>I'm an ex smoker, for the most part. I heavily reduced 3 years ago when I started vaping and there have been moments over the past few years where I've quit completely.</p>
<p>I've read the studies. I even did my senior thesis on e-cigs. I know the industry pretty intimately, though I don't work in it anymore.</p>
<p>I dont know what's going to happen in 40 years to those who vape. I dont know how harmful it all is. What I can tell you is that how I feel is enough proof for me. </p>
<p>When you're a heavy smoker, you get used to certain things, like always coughing, always stinking of tobacco, teeth and hands always a little yellow. Your breath is always a little shorter. Bronchitis comes a little easier, and after a party when you smoke a lot, you can feel the damage.</p>
<p>When I started vaping, all that went away. My clothes and car dont stink. My breathing is slowly getting better. My body is starting to recover. It <em>feels</em> different. </p>
<p>For me, that's enough evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to specify when you say increased risk, you mean relative to not smoking anything at all vs increased risk to cigarettes. Maybe I'm just an idiot but it was confusing at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I bounced back and forth with my comparisons. Sorry about that. The first and third paragraphs are comparing the risks of e-cigarettes to cigarettes. To my knowledge there has not been a good study comparing the risks of the two, so these points are really just clinical opinion. The second paragraph is talking about the change in risk due to vaping, as opposed to not vaping. In the case of respiratory symptoms, this is regardless of previous cigarette use. Please let me know if I can provide any more info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dunno if this counts as a study but definitely a good in depth comparison of the two from the Royal College of Physicians.</p>
