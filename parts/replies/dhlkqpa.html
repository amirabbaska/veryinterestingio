			<div class="markdown"><p>So I may be wrong but, covalent bonds are farther apart than ionic bonds is my understanding. Covalent bonds share a set of electrons, while an ionic bond involves one highly electro negative atom (like flourine) pulling suuuuuper hard on another atom's electrons (usually something like calcium or magnesium). It's still shared, but flourine is more like a big bully who knows how to make it look like he's sharing, while calcium knows flourine actually gets the electron (he didn't want it anyway, it was just an extra piece that doesn't match his original set of electrons anyway). As a result of this they are actually held together really really tightly though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're actually pretty similar from what I remember. It's going to vastly depend on what you're looking at, but the bond length is dictated by the same forces regardless of the type of bond and the major force is that of the nucleus. </p>
<p>NaH (the smallest one I saw)  has a bond length of 189pm and C-C is about 154pm, while C-H is 106pm.</p></div>		</li>
