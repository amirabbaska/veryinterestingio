			<div class="markdown"><p>To help combat climate change we can approach it by either (1) changing the energy we are using i.e. renewables and/or (2) reducing the amount of energy we are using.
Your suggestion and common response is to tackle the first approach such as solar panels and electric cars which are indeed good suggestions. Without the finance to implement this you can help by reducing your energy demands (2). Easy ways to do this are to travel more environmentally friendly by either walking more or cycling for example. However I think the easiest way to reduce your carbon footprint which has no impact on your lifestyle is to cut down on the amount of meat we/you eat. Cattle farming contributes to greenhouse gas emissions directly (e.g beef and methane production), approx. ~15% of global emissions is from livestock. Indirectly deforestation and land clearing for cattle farming is adding to the problem. With meat production forecast to increase we could all cut down to reduce this contributor. It doesn't mean we all have to go vegetarian, you could eat more chicken and less beef, or try giving up meat entirely for a day a week, a week a month and a month each year?
We discuss this and more in our course in weeks 7 &amp; 8 <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions" target="_blank">https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions</a>
