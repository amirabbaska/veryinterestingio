			<div class="markdown"><p>A few back of the envelope calculations.  <a href="http://www.ask.com/science/much-grain-sand-weigh-90bad4f39f93ac7b" target="_blank">This</a> gives a range of sand weights, from which I will use 1 ug.  Now I'm going to define &quot;visibly move&quot; as motion over a distance of 1 mm over the course of .1 s.  That gives a speed of .01 m/s, a speed which let's say we attain over the course of .01 s, for an acceleration of 1 m/s^(2).  From Newton's Law, that equates to a force of 10^-9 N.  That's applied over let's say .1 mm, for an amount of work done equal to 10^-13 Joules.  <a href="http://www.mpoweruk.com/nuclear_theory.htm" target="_blank">This</a> gives 3.2 X 10^-11 Joules for a single fissioned U-235 atom.</p>
<p>So yes, it's well within the realm of possibility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fission reaction releases something on the scale of ~MeV (compared to ~eV when burning something like coal). This <em>is</em> a lot when you do it in bulk but by itself it's almost nothing. To give you an idea of how little it is: the rest energy of a proton is ~940 MeV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are being sensational. You will not have health problems. Do some research kids, it will not even feel warm. Not U235 at least. Now Pu-238, that makes some heat, but not from spontaneous fissions.</p></div>		</li>
