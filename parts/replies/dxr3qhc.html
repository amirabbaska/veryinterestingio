<p>Some vitamins are fat-soluble (Vit A, D, E and K) and some are water-soluble (C and B). Water soluble vitamins can be eliminated in urine, so you can't overdose on them.</p>

<p>That's not how that works... Toxicity or overdose has nothing to do with water solubility. &quot;Can be eliminated&quot; is not why they're excreted.</p>
<p>Water soluble vitamins aren't easily stored in the body and so they're generally excreted shortly after intake via urine, not because the body is trying to &quot;eliminate&quot; them but because they weren't absorbed. They're still metabolically active compounds while they're in the body. It's &quot;harder&quot; to overdose on water soluble vitamins because you don't build up a deposit but if you take it in a single dose you can definitely overdose on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does taking a single large dose lead to overdose? Isn't the rate of absorbtion the same? Knowing pretty much nothing about vitamins, why wouldn't the excess of a large dose be excreted just as with a smaller dose?</p></div>		</li>

<p>My information comes from two university audio book lectures on nutrition. It's not from a perspective of toxicology or any such thing. It doesn't talk specifically about what causes your death if you overdose. They do stress that the vitamins are active compounds and they're in your blood and they &quot;do what they do&quot; while there. Your body doesn't ignore the excess.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It will be. But not until that happens (&quot;that&quot; being the extracellular fluid is moved by lymph nodes and filtered by kidneys and excreted). And that doesn't happen for an hour or two. Until then it's still active and might cause damage and with enough of it that damage might cause death.</p>
<p>If you want to know exactly how vitamin <X> leads to death in sufficient dosage you'll have to google it or wait for someone else to respond. :)</p>
<p>My main point is that water soluble vitamins are excreted with urine which basically makes sure you don't &quot;build up&quot; to an overdose over time. It does not mean that excess compound is ignored by the body, or that excess compound doesn't cause damage. With fat soluble vitamins the body stores it for a VERY long time (can be half a year).</p>
