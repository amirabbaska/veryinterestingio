			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth mentioning that for birds with eyes on the sides of their heads, the angle that gives highest resolution and the angle that gives binocular vision (and lets them use their beak) are not the same. They cock their heads and look with one eye to take in more detail.</p></div>		</li>
