			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't help but wonder what the observation protocol looks like to determine something like that. For instance, how would an observer know that the subjects brain is &quot;near&quot; a particular memory and incidentally suppressing it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I studied this phenomenon. It's called Retrieval-Induced Forgetting. The idea is that in retrieving a particular memory, the other related ones are suppressed- you can measure this with timing subsequent retrievals of the same memory item, and related items. Conceptually-related items are slower to recall if they have not been recalled previously.</p>
<p>There's a related concept called Accelerated Relearning- this is the idea that items previously-suppressed are easier to relearn. </p></div>		</li>
