			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to keep in mind is that significant physical changes to the heart itself are Not Good. The article you linked discussed the stretched heart. This would be due to many years of hypertension causing extra pressure on the heart walls to change its shape. This leads to the heart beating less efficiently, which is another way of saying she likely had heart failure. The woman was likely on medications for this and had possibly had surgery. A heart like her's is not what your heart is like when you are simply out of shape, it's the result of long-term cardiovascular issues causing permanent changes to the heart.</p>
<p>e: Oh and she also probably had a-fib.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long term are we talking here? Have I done irreparable damage to myself by having been overweight (not obese) my 20s and only losing that weight in my 30s? I know I'm going to pay a price for that, but how do I find out what that price is and get ahead of it?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm travelling Europe with bad internet, but I will try to reply to each thoughtful comment and express my gratitude. Having random strangers be helpful and supportive about this really means so much, especially because I've had an objectively lousy day. Thank you thank you thank you.</p>
<p>I will note that I've lost 23 lbs in the last 6 months. Lifestyle changes, counseling, and mental health treatment saved me from going down the road of my 40 year old brother with diabetes etc. I never felt as alive as I do now, and I'm excited to see what it's like to be gut-free and do my first pull-up. Sometimes I worry  I'm doing all this too late, but now I have ideas on how to take that on. Again, thank you all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cardiac disease researcher here, this comments spot on. However, it might be worth noting that too much exercise can be bad for your heart. exercise like all things is good in moderation, but when you over do it you increase your risk of heart disease. this isnt something normal people have to worry about, rather pro endurance runners and cyclists. its generally recognised that too  much running can increase your risk of heart disease and now researchers are focusing on cycling. One publication even suggests that cycling more than 125 miles a week can damage your health, however im a tad sceptical of that as the sample size is low and i their evidence didnt properly support the claim. as a limitation, none of these studies has taken into account performance enhancing drugs which have been known to damage the heart. </p>
<p>Im not trying to tell people not to exercise, just that the answer to OPs question isnt clear cut. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cycling 125 miles a week, I'd think, is considered light exercise. If you cycle 7 days a week, say to work and back around 10 miles <del>round trip</del> each way, that would put you over that limit. Yet, you're never really doing more than 30 minutes of exercise at a time. </p>
<p>If you were exercising with 125 mile <em>trips</em> that is very different and keep most people exercising for 5-6 hours (assuming cycling as a hobby/exercise), 8-12 for someone who is more casual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm obese (actually WAS obese a couple months ago, also smoked a ton of weed for the better part of a decade, stopped now). I've lost enough weight to slip down into overweight territory just from dieting and not getting stoned and walking a mile every day. That said, I am terrified of starting to run because i don't want to be that fat guy who gets a heart attack when they start trying to get healthy. Do you know any resources that are safe for overweight former pot smokers who want to start doing cardio? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to jump on the top comment, it is also OK for the heart to work hard during cardio and bad for it to work hard in an obese person, because cardio is temporary stress. You can think of it as the health of driving a car, flooring the gas pedal constantly vs only using that extra power sparingly. One way of driving is clearly healthier for your engine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a quick question for you that I haven't been able to find a satisfactory answer for anywhere, including my doctor and the people at United Blood Services. I was a fat kid who got really into jogging in high school (because it helped me get laid). I'm 31 now and I've been running here and there since 16. I also do some strength training. My resting heart rate used to be around 68. Doctors and nurses would sing the praises of that number.</p>
<p>I joined a gym two years ago to supercharge my lifting and cardio and now my resting heart rate is 48. Now everyone freaks out. &quot;Your heart rate is too low!&quot; &quot;You can't donate blood today because you could die with that heart rate!&quot;</p>
<p>Is this a real problem, or is it just a low heart rate due to my exercise routine? When I run, I'm anywhere between 130 and 120. I also don't have any of those other symptoms associated with bradycardia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually some key aspects are missing here - ie</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Excersise cuts down on atherosclerosic plaques (esentially big lumps growing in your blood vessels - and if you're over 20 you will almost certainly have some). This is because when doing cardio the blood moves faster, and this increases what is called the oscillatory wall shear stress. This causes the endothelial cells (the cells that line all your blood vessels) to respond in a positive way, releasing certian chemicals that cause these plaques reduce, basicly meaning your blood vessels act more like clean efficient pipes rather than having occasional partial blockages. In an obese person the blood does not pump any faster than a person at rest despite the increased work of the heart the blood. This means more plaques form, causing more blockages, causing a required increase in the work the heart is required to do. It's a vicious cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an obese person the heart itself gets fat and the coronaries get clogged up, and struggles to keep pumping just to keep itself going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basic structure in the cardiovascular system is a branching structure and is basicly &gt; Heart &gt; Aorta &gt; Large Arteries &gt; smaller Arteries &gt; smaller Arteries &gt;smaller Arteries &gt; capillary bed (this is where the important stuff happens and the interchange occurs) &gt; Veins &gt; larger Veins  &gt; larger Veins &gt; larger Veins &gt; Vena Cava &gt; and back to the heart &gt; lungs &gt; back to heart. For blood to flow there needs to be a pressure differential. Essentially, pressure upstream needs to be higher than pressure downstream. In a person who does a lot of cardio doesn't has large fatty deposits around the capillary bed, so their capillary bed pressure is lower, and their heart doesn't need to work nearly as hard to generate the pressure gradient to drive the flow than someone who has a lot of fluids and fats pushing on the capillary bed which increases the capillary bed pressure.This means the pressure at the heart has to be much higher all the time just to push blood to the capillary bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, obese people tend to have stiffer, less compliant vessels. The ascending aorta (the tube out of the heart) is sometimes called the 5th chamber of the heart because in a healthy person it, being very elastic, swells with blood during systole (when the heart pumps blood out) and then passively contracts, continuing to push blood forward. Obese people have stiffer vessels, so when the heart pumps the ascending aorta doesn't expand, and the ascending aorta doesn't continually drive blood forward. Basically the blood loses momentum and the heart has to re push all the blood on each beat. It also means that the obese persons pressure pulse (the highest pressure to lowest pressure) will tend to be much higher. Smoking will also cause a persons arteries to stiffen.</p>
</li>
<li>What all this means is the heart is working overtime all the time in an obese person. Imagine what would happen if you ran constantly all day every day. Without any time to recuperate, what kind of damage would that do to your legs? When you do cardio, you rest afterwards. This rest period allows the cardiac muscle to rest and remodel to the changing conditions, allowing the heart to build in strength. The same is true in all your muscles that you use when you exercise. Little worker cells called myoblasts, myocytes, fibroblasts etc all work on repairing the damage done and building new cells during this rest period in a process called remodelling (this is the same thing that happens everywhere in your body due to changing mechanical and chemical loading conditions). What makes cardio healthy isn't the exercise bit, it's the resting afterwards.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>During cardio the heart increases its workload and all the body's other systems adjust to help support that endeavor. The blood vessels dilate, the muscles do their best to help the blood along, hormone levels change, some non-critical processes stop or slow down to redirect blood flow to main channels.</p>
<p>It's all hands on deck to keep the heart cruising powerfully and efficiently. Over time, those support processes will get even better at their job and further decrease the load on the heart.</p>

<p>That was really well summarized. </p>
<p>Thanks a lot man, I mean it.</p></div>		</li>
