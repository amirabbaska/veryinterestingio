			<div class="markdown"><p>So in some way it is actually using &quot;the microphone&quot; but it's speaking in really high pitch code. Are there examples then of headphones with 4 rings that have both a microphone and controls, and the phone then extracts these highpitch commands using FFT?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably aren't using an FFT. There are better algorithms for simply detecting the presence of a specific frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, no.  The chip that plays audio from the phone has a filter that cuts off high frequency audio.  The highest frequency you can probably intentionally create from a video or audio file is 24KHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since these signals are sent using the microphone line probably not. Also in the various steps from getting the video (or sound file) to your ear I assume all the sounds that cannot be heard by a human are discarded or not even in the format that it is saved in. The microphone would not be able to pick up sounds in the range that is used to send these signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems a much better method to me, but it's not how Android actually does it?
How does your system square with the technical spec document linked to by u/cryl (<a href="https://source.android.com/devices/accessories/headset/plug-headset-spec" target="_blank">https://source.android.com/devices/accessories/headset/plug-headset-spec</a>) which definitely shows that the Android signalling uses pulldown resistors, to define an eqiuvalent signalling impedance for each button?</p></div>		</li>
