			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we talk about chrome? I love it in terms of usability and its used to be nice and fast. But I'd say over the past year it's slowed down considerably. Whether I'm on my laptop, my netbook, my desktop or my desktop at work, chrome has really slowed down and takes a long time to start up. If I open up task manager it's generally running a separate process for each tab open and when I add them all together I'm seeing over 400,000!! </p>
<p>I'm running a great extension on a few of my systems called the great suspender or something that suspends tabs if they haven't been viewed in a set amount of time. It's helped out a lot in general performance but I'm surprised I've have to install third party software to make chrome usable. And no one seems to want to talk about this issue. Most discussions that come up when I google the issue conclude that, yup, chrome's a resource hog... Deal with it. It was not like this when I first started on chrome - it used to be blazing fast!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm running three tabs on Firefox right now (Gmail, reddit, reddit) and it adds to 490,000 as well. I also used Chrome at the beginning because it was super fast, but it seems that it got bigger with time.  For my part, I feel it has to do with me using more extensions then before.</p>
<p>Firefox, IMHO, has gotten better in the last versions, so they are quite similar in performance nowadays.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at the Great Suspender. It's helped me out a lot but I don't think we should need extensions to make a program work properly. </p>
<p>I put lots of blame on websites themselves too. Something like Facebook is so bloated these days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the reason is how Firefox handles its processes and threads with its add-ons and tabs vs Chrome's extensions and tabs. Firefox is overall more efficient in its process handling, and if you use lazy-loading for tabs (meaning that it only loads one tab where you continue where you last save your tabs), it means that you only use that one process/thread for that tab. Overall, Firefox is the way to go when you have a large amounts of tabs. I'm merely speculating on this, so please correct me if I'm wrong about how Firefox handles the processes for its tabs and add-ons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chrome is running fine. It has seperate processes becuase it sandboxes each tab instance. Chrome will also use all of the available memory it can for speed, so it's usage is fine. </p>
<p>Remmeber, Memory can clear in a nanosecond, so don't worry about how much is being used. The more you have in memory the better it will run. The OS and Chrome will manage that better than you can. Overall, if you have memory that is free, how much an app is using doesn't matter becuase you have some available for other apps. Again, your OS and chrome will manage that just fine.</p>
<p>It's likely your chrome is slowing down to other issues, possibly plugins that are intrusive on your browsing experience that offer some benefit at the cost of speed.</p>
<p>The problem with it starting up is that your hard drive is either slow, or your chrome is very inflated with edentions. My SSD starts mine up instantly. Consider a defrag on your PC or opting for a faster drive such as an SSD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which task manager are you using? Chrome processes share memory, and Windows task manager isn't going to show that. Use Chrome's internal task manager -- hit shift+escape.</p>
<p>And pay attention to the individual tabs, too.</p>
<p>Chrome is still blazing fast, but it is a bit memory hungry. And yeah, I think the correct answer is &quot;deal with it.&quot; RAM is cheap, and is one of the best bang-for-the-buck upgrades you can get -- for about $100, you could have 16 gigs of RAM. (Your motherboard will be limited in how far it can upgrade, I suppose.) When Chrome has <em>enough</em> RAM, it's blazing fast. When you don't have enough RAM, everything's slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A clogged registry? I agree on everything else, but this has never made any sense to me. The registry should do a fine job of scaling to lots of entries. Even if programs leave behind registry entries, the HD use is small, and it only reads it when it needs to. Lets be clear, default windows installation probably already has a few hundred thousand entries. </p>
<p>I've seen some registry entries that do silly things like delaying a program from shutting down for an additional N milliSeconds. This seems like a dumb setting, but not really 'clogged'.</p>
<p>Can you explain exactly what a clogged registry means?</p>
<p>EDIT Found this, and I'll believe this guy with just about anything windows related. So, I agree, looks like this is  a case where a cleaner could be handy:

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary. It can very well hose the registry completely requiring you to restore it from the backup then doing a system restore. People with pretty much the same technical capacity as my mom have no business running CCleaner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clogged registry is a win XP running on a calculator type problem. As in all the extra registry entries won't make a difference to something running on a core 2 (simplified computer age) or newer.
although I did see a problem at a large business (~3500 PCs running winxp which was most likely the problem) where a hard reset would cause the PC to take up to an hour to boot because the machine was looking for non existing registry entries. However deleting unused keys did nothing to solve this and the computers were far from what you would see outside of a security conscious business deployment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually found Chrome to be more resource intensive than Firefox, especially RAM-wise. Particularly with 10+ tabs open. <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2014/01/02/chrome-34-firefox-29-internet-explorer-11-memory-use-2014/" target="_blank">This</a> benchmark will back me up on that. A few months ago with 4GB of memory I often found that Firefox would quite happily deal with a large number of tabs, whereas Chrome would often give me a blank page for a good 10 seconds or so when switching tabs. If hardware ageing is a problem then Firefox would probably be a better browser to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more intensive RAM-wise. Each tab in Chrome is sandboxed so that they can't affect each other which is safer for your computer in terms of viruses but is worse in terms of RAM usage. FWIW I regularly keep 20+ tabs open in Chrome even while playing games and I'm fine with 8 GBs of RAM, which is a lot but not necessarily an overwhelming amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firefox might be about to get bigger -- it's adopting a multi-process model. RAM is cheap... though yeah, if you want to make aging hardware useful, Chrome is probably not the best browser, especially with multiple tabs.</p></div>		</li>
