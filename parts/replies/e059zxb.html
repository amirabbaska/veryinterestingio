<p>It's actually very <em>low</em> frequency. Visible light is in the range of 430–770 THz, while the CMB peaks at around 160.23 GHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! The phase speed of a wave (c in case of light) is equal to the wavelength (λ) times the frequency (f), i.e. c=λf. This means that frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by your first point. You say that the light from anything that is 14bn ly away (or farther) can't reach us. So that tells me we should only be able to see 14bn ly in any direction. How is the observable universe 46bn ly in radius?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light leaving anything <del>14</del><em>15</em>bn ly away now will never get to us, because we are moving away from that object faster than the light is moving towards us.</p>
<p>But the stuff that is between 14bn and 46bn ly away used to be much closer. The light we're receiving from them right now was emitted billions of years ago - when the objects were much closer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, one more question about this. If the objects in the sky used to be much closer, then that's where they must appear to us in the sky, right?  We're seeing the object's position as it was when the light that is reaching us now left it.</p>
<p>If we can see the object, then it can't appear to be as far away as 46 bn ly, can it?</p>
<p>So when we say that the observable universe has a 46 bn ly radius, we must be extrapolating celestial positions, rather than saying we can actually observe an object to be that far away.</p>
<p>Put another way, I infer that we're saying that today, object X appears to be 10 bn ly away, but that was its position 10bn years ago, so we know from other measurements that it's now actually 33 bn ly away.  Am I interpreting this correctly? Or am I not correctly factoring in how spacetime expansion works?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is all the matter &amp; energy that was in the Big Bang now dispersed over a 46bn ly radius? Is that what makes it the “observable universe”? But the Big Bang was only ~14bn years ago, how is anything further than 14bn ly away?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! The universe is expanding faster than the speed of light but it isn't violating that speed. The expansion works by literally making space expand, not the universe move.</p>
<p>The colloquial explanation we use in astrophysics to help visualize this is bread.</p>
<p>If you put raisins in dough where raisins are galaxies the dough expands but the raisins stay the same size. The space between them simply expands. Its the same dough (space) it just has expanded.</p>
<p>It's a bit confusing to wrap your head around at first, but the space itself is what's expanding not what is in space (galaxies, stars, etc.). In fact, locally, as in to us as humans on a planet revolving around a star space doesn't expand in a perceptible way due to the localized gravity from our star and the collective galaxy, we really only see space expand in the vast nothingness between galaxies. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing on the topic.</p>
<p>But based on your explanation, if space is expanding like that.... It feels like it's structural stability would be getting weaker as well and it would eventually collapse.</p>
<p>Just like if the bread kept expanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about a single plane though? Would each atom in a planet float away from the other atoms in the planet? Or does gravity simply re clump all the planet together like nothing ever happened anyway? Will this mean there is always vibrations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there is something which can travel faster than light, right? Couldn't it be that there's something about space and how its expansion works that we don't understand but yet could lead us to conclude there is some sort of &quot;thing&quot; that composes space which can travel faster than light?</p>
<p>I suppose the world &quot;travel&quot; is a bit tricky to use here, because it implies moving in space, and we're talking about space itself expanding. But to use your analogy, the atoms in dough do move in space when the dough expands. How far can we take that analogy when comparing it with space expansion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, the expansion doesn't have a speed (like m/s) but rather a rate. And if you think about it, since the speed at which two points separates depends on the distance between them, you will find that no matter what rate, there will be some distance at which the points separates at more than the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the universe is infinitely large and is constantly expanding everywhere at a constant rate, that basically must be true.</p>
<p>Imagine evenly spaced dots on a rubber band as you stretch it.  The rubber band is expanding at a constant rate everywhere, so each dot is getting further from its neighbor at some constant speed <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>The dot two dots away is getting further from you at speed <code>2x</code>.  3 dots away is getting further from you at speed <code>3x</code>.  Four dots away is getting further at speed <code>4x</code>.  Etc.</p>
<p>If that rubber band is infinitely long,  then for any natural number <code>y</code>, if you want to observe something moving away from you at a speed of <code>x*y</code> you just need to look <code>y</code> dots down the band.  At some point, <code>x*y</code> is going to be faster than the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But special relativity prevents exactly this from happening. Say two objects are moving at 60% the speed of light in the opposite directions. If we use Newtonian physics to calculate the relative speed between the two objects, it will come out to be 1.2 times the speed of light, which we know is not true. Using special relativity, their relative speed will come out to be approx. 0.97 times the speed of light. The formula used here is </p>
<p>v(relative) = (v1-v2)/(1-(v1*v2/c^(2)))</p>
<p>Using this formula, the relative velocity can never exceed the speed of light. We know SR is true. We also apparently know that universe is expanding faster than light. So how do these two facts not contradict each other? </p></div>		</li>
