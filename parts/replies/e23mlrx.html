			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that in general most tsunamis arrive as a rapidly rising tide, this isn't always the case. It depends, as you correctly said, a lot on the shape and depth of the coast. On wide, gradually sloping coasts the water tends to surge in like a flash flood. </p>
<p>But in narrow, steep bays and inlets the tsunami will nearly always rise and break like a conventional wave, usually several in the space a few minutes. It's kind of a cruel irony that places like this are where most coastal human settlements are built. They're safer from storms, but as a consequence are subject to the most concentrated blows from tsunami waves when they occur. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit : confirmed, Lituya Bay, Alaska. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The run up was 1720 feet (524 meters), largest wave on record.  <a href="https://geology.com/records/biggest-tsunami.shtml" target="_blank">Here's a map and some survivor stories</a>.</p>
<p>One survivor was carried in his boat and surfed over a spit of land some 80 feet (24 meters) <em>above</em> the tree tops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the exceptional size of this tsunami wasn't just due to it being in a bay. It was caused by a large amount of material falling into water (an earthquake-triggered rockslide). Tsunamis created in this way are a whole different animal (and can be far larger) than tsunamis created by the movement of tectonic plates under the ocean, as the 2004 Indian Ocean and the 2011 Japan tsunamis were.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ye the ones caused by landslides are the biggest/tallest crest -  much bigger than earth quakes. The only way we would get a bigger one is an meteorite inpact in the ocean - but its still mass / land hitting water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I was going to point out some of the things you raised here. This is actually why tsunami's almost never affect Australia, they broadly speaking have a long coastal shelf that prevents any tsunami that might threaten from really gathering that energy unlike places like Japan, New Zealand and the US.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They are more like an extremely rapid and big tide. </p>

<p>This is what struck me most about videos of the disasters. It didn't look like a wave, the sea just moved inland. It was flat, it just moved a couple of kilometers.</p></div>		</li>
