			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many factors that affect how these neurotransmitters effect us.</p>
<p>With dopamine, too much will cause paranoia and psychosis.</p>
<p>Adderall boosts dopamine and makes me literally fall asleep for an hour and LESS happy. My friend also falls asleep every morning after he takes his Adderall.</p>
<p>Serotonin can also cause anxiety although it's known to be involved in mood.</p>
<p>It depends on where in the brain and in what concentrations and what receptors.</p>
<p>It's extremely complex.</p>
<p>All the answers in this thread may be somewhat correct but they are no exhaustive. Don't take anything out of this thread as a full fact. In fact, these are very elementary answers and generalizations. I would do further research and perhaps ask on longecity.com.</p>
<p>So you're getting a little info out of this post. There's so much more that hasn't been mentioned and is widely known.</p>
<p>/r/nootropics may have more insight.</p></div>		</li>
