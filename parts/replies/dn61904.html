			<div class="markdown"><p>At the same time his friends also praised him for being the best one out of all of them,  the most reliable,  the most selfless person,  the most caring.   He was the guy that everyone else wished they were like but in his eyes He wanted to be like anyone else.</p>
<p>The character may not have always been nice to each other but at the end of the day they all cared for one another in their own way.  They also each faced their own issues.  Many had unrequited love issues,  Some felt like outsiders,  race, dating, inattentive parents, are all things that peanuts touched on.  </p>
<p>It was successful because for every person there was a character that you could latch onto and claim.  it was written in a relatable way with interesting characters and wasn't afraid to tackle issues that no one else was.  They were able to take hard issues and filter them through the eyes of children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;You're a good man, Charlie Brown. You're the kind of reminder we need
You have humility, nobility and a sense of honor that is very rare indeed...
You're a good man, Charlie Brown! You're a prince and a prince could be king.&quot;</p>
<p>That's what his friends sing to him in the musical anyway. I agree with the above: Charlie Brown may be on the losing side a lot of the time but he's the most fully formed character. Lucy is a know-it-all, the model of a person who gives advice when she should be taking it. Linus is bright but insecure (blanket). Schroeder is obsessed with perfection. Pigpen is hygienically challenged (and Charlie Brown is the only one who accepts him unconditionally.) Sally has some growing up to do. Snoopy is lazy and selfish but is great comic relief.</p>
<p>It's interesting because when I read OP's question, I had to think about Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown and if, as a kid, I thought it made Charlie Brown a loser and the answer was no, it made me think that Lucy was a bitch. And with the coal for Christmas things, since parents are never present, I never connected them with &quot;abuse,&quot; but it's a funny observation.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown is the relatable character. He recovers from every set-back, good-natured and willing to try again. All the other characters are trying to figure out a way to be more like him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely true. Especially in the very early strips, he was more unlucky than anything else. I think that mostly carried over throughout the 50-odd years of the strip.</p>
<p>His friends give him a hard time, but don't most friends so that to each other? Even Lucy cared about him a lot, I think. </p>
<p>Charlie Brown was far more than a punching bag. I always looked up to him.</p>
<p>Good ol' Charlie Brown.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I echo what other people said, i dont really interpret it as bullying. Kids are rough with each other growing up. Your friend does it to you, then you get him back at a later time. There's always an invisible line of what not to cross, like we wouldn't throw rocks at each other or anything that would really hurt, but pulling a treebranch back and having it fly back, or pulling the football away at the last second is just kids fucking around. If anything it toughens you up.</p>
<p>I guess the key point is the invisible line you build up with your friends of what is okay and what's not okay. I honestly think messing with your friends like that, 'roughhousing' is less bulling and almost a form of bonding that shows trust,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, that's what me and all my friends did with each other. </p>
<p>What is is, in my experience, is testing each others temperaments. It's like you are forming a tribe essentially and you have to know who the alpha leaders are going to be right? Alpha leaders have high testosterone but LOW cortisol, so they react well to stressful scenarios but at the same time don't take shit from others. </p>
<p>You DONT want an alpha leader that's a stressball, so that's why kids constantly test each others stress limits. For when SHIT POPS OFF SON we need to bond up and start a tribe. The &quot;teasing&quot; is a way of building resistance to stress, and also revealing who is the most resistant. </p>
<p>People that believe we are living in a nerfed up fluffy world where none of this is applicable, are the ones who don't understand teasing and bullying, and are also the same people who surely aren't going to be our leaders either or understand leadership on this crazy planet.</p>
<p>On a less evolutionary scale, who wants to hang around a insecure, overly sensitive stressball who can't take a joke? This is ape shit. You have to put yourself in the mind of an ape, we are still apes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if this is an age thing.  As a gen-xer I agree with you and this was pretty much the attitude people took when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder if OP is younger.  My cousin's kids are forever getting lessons on how bad bullying is and that anything you say that offends or, &quot;triggers&quot; people is bullying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a child, I took the rocks for Halloween thing literally.</p>
<p>As an adult, I see it as an exaggeration to the point of absurdity, to depict that life isn't fair.  Most of us have gotten a rock instead of candy, whether it be in the form of other kids grabbing all of our preferred color of paper or marker in art class, or when only the pretty girls got invited to a party, or when everyone jumped off the rope swing but only you broke your arm while doing it.</p></div>		</li>

I think they just had a hat on and some face makeup or something.  I'm going to make it a yearly tradition for the laziest kid I see.  It's not just about get free candy handouts, you gotta dress up for Halloween.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, let me ask the obvious flipside of this question.  Why are his modern equivalents so happy?  </p>
<p>The best-known Nickelodeon and Disney shows of the past 15 years are things like iCarly, Hannah Montanah, Waverley Place, all shows about kids achieving their dreams.   So is Harry Potter at heart.  Modern kids films have protagonists that may go through problems, but they're all basically content.</p>
<p>But Charlie Brown was the butt of jokes <em>even among his friends</em>.   I can't even imagine that character being the protagonist today.   Even in shows/books/movies where the leads are unpopular, the lead character him/herself is always the leader in their own group of friends.  (1) </p>
<p>So if the answer is that he's &quot;relatable&quot;, why did he stop being relatable?   </p>
<ol>
<li>The closest might be Calvin. he doesn't actually seem to have any friends.  But he has a tiger which is better, and besides, that's a quarter century ago.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a great provocation. Is it because Charlie is a product of his time and setting, a more innocent time when people could be accepted for their weaknesses and vulnerability, could be the butt of jokes and still be loved? Whereas in today's world, vulnerability, not being accomplished, is unthinkable, and we discourage that in a child hero? </p>
<p>I don't know the modern kids shows you referenced very well: do the audiences of iCarly like iCarly as much as kids of the 60s and 70s liked Charlie Brown? Is that impossible to answer? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy-back a bit on Charlie Brown being &quot;relatable,&quot; consider the differences between DC Comics and Marvel Comics in the Silver Age of comics (1956-1970).  Marvel surged in popularity with comics like Spiderman because they showed a flawed, struggling hero who made bad decisions and suffered consequences.  This was revolutionary in comics at the time since prior to that most superheroes were unambiguously pillars of strength and rarely ever shown struggling for money (or anything).  Basically, there is <em>always</em> an audience for relatable characters if presented in unique, entertaining ways.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown is the same type of &quot;everyman&quot; as Peter Parker.  He's flawed, he struggles, he's often humiliated.  Charles Schultz has to be given credit for creating such a universally relatable and sympathetic character in a genre where Popeye and Barney Google were dominant.</p></div>		</li>
