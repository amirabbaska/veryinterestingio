			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I argue with executives all the time.</p>
<p>The cost of IT upgrades don't go away because you ignore them. They accumulate.</p>
<p>More often than not the cost of upgrading long after the fact will be more than having just done it in the first place.</p>
<p>Eventually you get to the point where the only option is to replace the entire system and start from scratch, and that gets very expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true sometimes.  In cases where you have to interface with CNCs or other specialized devices you might be looking at having to replace multi-ton pieces of expensive hardware and training your entire staff to use them anyway if you upgrade so it's a wash.  This applies to pretty much every industrial piece of machinery - because it's often so rare that it's built by a company that goes under within a decade (to avoid the companies which make machines breaking down needing replacement parts that make Apple chargers look free by comparison.)  No matter how you cut it, if it's not enough to make the company go under it's likely about the same price, many times it is actually cheaper to put it off for a complete replacement because with that replacement comes a single point of retraining (instead of continuously stopping production for a week every couple of months in at least one department) plus you gain the benefit of everything working together at the point in time it is replaced - so you don't have 50 little issues cropping up over time impacting a wide variety of people.  An IT guy is a fixed cost (assuming salary,) so making them work to keep things running isn't nearly as big a deal as replacing everything over time (which impacts the production side of things.)</p>
<p>IT often gets viewed as a utility, and in some cases that's bad because people don't like their utilities charging added fees for seemingly random and unnecessary upgrades, but that doesn't really matter when you get into a situation where everyone is upgrading and those upgrades often break more than they solve (e.g. the entire Windows infrastructure which is designed to be as incompatible as possible with previous versions to get people to upgrade once they upgrade a single component - which is what most businesses run on.)  I don't think I've ever actually encountered a company which wasn't brand new running on less than 3 versions of windows since about a decade ago - with the new versions the upgrades actually tend to do more harm than good (even disregarding the fact all your shit gets involuntarily streamed to the cloud and you get involuntary upgrades.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a guy I used to work with regarding Epic and his thoughts. The hospital would get regular updates from Epic in Wisconsin every year, but they would only go with the minimum system requirements. then the users would complain that Epic was not working fast enough to be usable, so they would have to upgrade three months later anyway. Imagine having a big “go live” event for the hospital every 3-6 months. It’s costs so much to maintain this but the big-wigs just don’t understand that we have to throw more hardware into the mix when we want newer software. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the companies I've been with, it's mostly 2.   If there are 100 critical projects, each using different software, and they rely on the old version of, say, Windows... now you can't upgrade software until the third party upgrades... all 100 of them.   Because you can't break half of your company if the vendors you use aren't upgrading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If an upgraded licence costs $50</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If my license upgrades only cost $50, I could easily get my employer to cover it.  Unfortunately, a lot of commercial software charges a lot more.  The most crucial software for my job costs \~$8,000 to update each year for very minimal performance improvements on features I might not even use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just trying to express scale.  A single $50 upgrade is meaningless, but 5,000 of them is a lot.</p>
<p>The problem only gets worse as the costs of the licences goes up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get a bulk discount with business volume licenses.</p>
<p>It mostly isn't cost of software that's the reason, in fact lots of things business don't update are free updates. Speaking out of experience the main reason why business (even many needed updates) is labour costs. If your IT team is busy upgrading the system they aren't doing other things and in many cases  the business may be understaffed here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  My previous job was running Windows XP up until 2 years ago because our communications infrastructure (email client, IM, telco) didn't support anything beyond that.  It was a multi-million dollar and 2 year effort to just upgrade that infrastructure before we even talked about moving to Windows 7</p></div>		</li>
