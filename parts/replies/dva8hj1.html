			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an outtie, its mostly recessed minus the flesh-sized pea wedged in there.  Now that I'm 29 it doesn't bother me... but when I was younger I absolutely hated it.  Didn't help that the other kids constantly made fun of it if my shirt ever came off at the pool or whatever... but kids are evil to other kids over the smallest, dumbest things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents told me they tie off the umbilical cord when you're born like a balloon, and everything past the knot falls off. It's where they tie the knot that determines if you're an innie or an outie.</p>
<p>I think they told me as a joke, but because of that I was about 19 before I learned that you don't tie a knot in the umbilical cord at birth. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm, thanks for enlightening me. I'm a 37 year old mom and I didn't know this. I always thought that's what they did, it looks just like that's what happened! I suppose I don't have any memories of any knot-tying when I gave birth to my son, but I wasn't really aware of anything they were doing. As soon as he came out the nurses took him to the side of the room and I felt this incredible fear/ loss that I'd never be able to keep him as safe as he had been inside me. Even though he was just across the room, it was our first separation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don’t actually do any “knot tying”. They put a little clip (looks like a chip clip) on the umb cord and it falls off on its own volition.</p>
<p>We were super lucky that both girls’ fell off after 2-3 days. My god that smell is vile. Puke!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They let the fathers cut the umbilical cord (in Canada) which I did for both of my kids. They were talking about their belly buttons one day at the beach and I joking boasted that it was my fine cutting that gave them their perfect belly buttons. You cut pretty far back. I'm sure they don't want a nervous husband holding scissors too close to anything vital.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never got to cut any :( </p>
<p>My oldest managed to get the cord around his neck during delivery (he was 10lbs 11oz) and the nurse said she needed to do it at the first opportunity. My other two were emergency c-sections, so wasn't able to.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about it for more than 7 years until today!!</p></div>		</li>
