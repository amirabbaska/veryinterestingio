<p>Edit: I was thinking minor scale. </p>
<p>In some cases that’s true: but then I think about the Sayo-Nara soundtrack from DDLC or even the Pokémon Tower track from the original games and they fall in the category of unsettling without being just minor deviations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly what happens is the music played contains both high pitched and low pitched sounds. The high pitched sounds trigger a response in our brain that makes us think we're safe. This is because when we are out in the wild the animals that are smaller than us would make higher pitched sounds and therefore wouldn't be a threat to us.
This only makes us unsettled when we add in the lower pitched sounds, this once again relates back to the wild when the animals bigger than us would make deeper sounds,these bigger animals would often be our predators.
When these two pitches are put together our brain gets confused and thinks we're both safe and threatened therefore making us scared because we aren't in control of the situation and are unsure of what is happening</p>
<p>TLDR: Brain gets confused by the two pitches and decides to be scared.</p></div>		</li>
