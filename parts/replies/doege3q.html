</blockquote>
<p>Found this rather satisfying, as I'm currently sitting on site with 2 units running, we have about 16 or so operators here right now including myself. Still 4-6 times more than a gas plant...not sure if I'd classify us as a small army though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newer designs are also built so that if human computer activity isn't detected every X amount of time, the plant goes into safety mode.  This is in case the plant has to suddenly be abandoned (earthquake/tsunami etc) and there's no time to shut it down by hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true.</p>
<p>The reactor shutdown is based on the Reactor Protection System logic. RPS has automatic trips for the reactor. </p>
<p>There is no plant that automatically shuts down because it thinks a person isn't there. In fact, during normal steady state operation, we touch nothing. We only monitor and do some basic maintenance, but we do nothing to maintain full power operation with the reactor or steam system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former operator:</p>
<p>Rotating shift work, with some overlap between the shifts for passdowns/turnovers.</p>
<p>Park your car. Get through security and &quot;testing&quot; (check to see if you have any contamination). Safety is a HUGE deal, you will be wearing appropriate clothing, safety boots, hard hat, safety glasses, hearing protection, and have leather gloves on you.</p>
<p>Turn over with current shift. Do a shift brief to discuss what happened since you last been there and what work is planned. This involves the entire current shift and oncoming shift, AO, PO, RO, SRO's, maintenance and rad controls may be there as well (bit fuzzy on who since it has been quite a number of years).</p>
<p>If immediate work is needed, you will do work. Most likely you'll perform rounds, walking around a building collecting data readings of various plant parameters.</p>
<p>All work involves strict adherence to incredibly detailed procedures. There will always be a pre-maintenance brief. Lockout/Tag-out is not an option, it is mandatory in all cases of relevant work. This is highly controlled by central control. They will issue the tags and locks. They will track what valves and breakers are locked. Each procedure must be verified to be the current revision prior to executing the work. There is no guess work, no assumptions. If you have even the slightest question or hesitation, stop work. Put everything in a safe condition. There will be a meeting discussing the equipment status and the effectiveness of the procedure. Work will not resume until all questions cleared up, or a new procedure has been developed and approved.</p>
<p>You will be working in high humidity, high temperature conditions. If you are working up north, you will be required to walk out in blizzard conditions (I had to once, wind chill took below 0F, and snow brought visibility to maybe 10 feet). Most spaces are deafening. You will have to shout to communicate in those spaces. Security tracks everybody, they will always know where you are at, at any given moment. You will be in high-rad zones. You will have to wear full anti-contamination clothing (anti-c's) when you do this. You may also be in some cramped conditions when your doing this. Depending on your plant, you may be the emergency response. Meaning you will have to be able to dress out in fire fighting gear and go fight a fire. This is due to many reactor plants being so remote, that local fire fighters cannot respond in a timely fashion. That includes wearing a 30 min/45 min SCBA tank on your back and carrying a fire house, and possibly carrying someone out of a space while wearing all that gear.</p>
<p>You will be scrutinized in the interview process, and while you're working. To be hired you have to pass the POSS test, go through normal interviewing processes, be cleared by a licensed psychologist. Everything you do at the plant will be documented. They will dig up something you did 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Many of the nuclear plants in the US are union, take that as you will. </p>
<p>Because of the locations of many US plants, you may be a bit bored outside of work. Seems like most have a good amount of outside activities such as hiking. Small towns with stereotypical small town features. If you want live sports, museums, concerts, find a plant that has those attractions nearby, or be willing to drive. I had to drive 90 minutes to go to a small art gallery and have some BBQ.</p>
<p>I would not go back into nuclear power, given the chance. Actually had a recruiter send me an email about a somewhat local plant. I completely ignored it. If you have a very huge hunger for a good paying job in an otherwise thankless job in an industrial environment, then it is a good fit for you.</p>
<p>I will say that the US is going to be closing plants soon due to age. They will not be able to renew their licenses. 4 plants currently under construction, but 2 are cancelled for the time being. 5 more are planned, but who knows if that will come about (nuclear plant plans have been cancelled in the US before, mainly right after Fukushima). There may be layoffs. The plant that reached out to me recently, they're short handed because people are moving because that plant is closing down in 7 years.</p>
<p>Side note, from my understanding, nuclear plants only do one hiring session for new plant operators a year. It is easier to do the classroom training, and cheaper. A plant may only hire 2-3 new operators a year, not very feasible to split that into two classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I interviewed for an EO job at a plant in Delta, PA.  Very remote, super in the middle of nowhere much like you described.  I took the POSS and another test which was heavily math based.  This qualified me for an in-person interview which was very heavily focused on safety awareness, and behavioral questions; they were not interested in the nuclear theory and engineering principles that I had studied.  They told me they'd call me in a month with their results, but the call never came.  The job was supposed to begin on Jan 3, 2017 so I'm guessing they found someone else lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a Natural Gas power plant but interviewed to work on my companies nuclear side. I know it's a lot more stressful due to regulations and safety. Planning is also more important, like maintenance. In my interview they said training would take 6 months before I was even permitted to go near the reactor. A lot of nuclear physics, thermal and hydro dynamics classes. Stuff like that. The pay is fantastic. The plant was offering $37.50 an hour for training and I think $40 after. I was paid $21.00 per hour at my natural gas plant. 12 hours rotating shift does suck balls though! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The overtime is nice though... I work one nuclear outage a year. 45-60 days long. 6days of 12 hr shifts and 1 day off. With one of the 12 hr shifts being double time. Being at a plant for a night shift for that long and having a hotel room for so long, you really canâ€™t spend money and you get so many damn points... it sucks but itâ€™s also easy work tbh. Not stressful because itâ€™s all planned so thoroughly and slow paced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many different ways to be involved in the nuclear industry besides being an operator. Shift work like that honestly isn't for me. I work in a more traditional salaried position AND I get to work in a field I love. The Nuclear Energy Institute website has some good info on <a href="https://www.nei.org/Careers-Education/Careers-in-the-Nuclear-Industry/What-Are-Employers-Looking-for" target="_blank">different careers</a> and <a href="https://www.nei.org/Careers-Education/Education-Resources" target="_blank">education opportunities</a>. <a href="http://www.ans.org/pi/" target="_blank">The American Nuclear Society</a> also has educational materials that you can browse before your seminars begin.</p>
<p>Reddit tends to have a strong bias towards the STEM disciplines, but lawyers, technical writers, quality control, sourcing, manufacturing, project management, finance, manufacturing, etc are needed in a nuclear organization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a large amount of people died, whats the minimum to maintain it?: Usually an Authorized Operator per reactor (control Room folks) and several operators &quot;in the field&quot; (depending on plant, mine would be about 2 per reactor?) maintaining the plant. That said if a big enough incident happened, they'd shut it down. I can't think of a situation where with a large population missing you'd need a nuclear plant over the dirtier but easier to maintain coal or natural gas. Nuclear's great at maintaining a base load, not good at varying loads at all, so unless there's enough demand they'd turn them off. In that situation you'd be better off just safely shutting her down and keeping the fuel cool as long as you can, it takes a long time to fully cool off, and way longer to stop being radioactive, but not too long (relatively) to be more easily maintained.</p>
<p>Realistically, we're not 100% sure what would fully happen if everyone disappeared, and as people pointed out the recirc pumps and fuel for the backups would last x long before they stopped. That time is not long, about 90 minutes. You can scram a reactor and get her reasonable in that time, but it's a big if if that would keep it from melting too much out of containment and just going chernobyl in regards to giant mass of molten fuel and radiation. Older plants were designed with a lot of fail safes and safeties in place that give you as much time to stop it from going super critical, but realistically its hard to predict 100% the end result. If every reactor at a multi-reactor facility suddenly lost all power from the grid and all went on backup, and nobody was around to keep the backup gens fueled, there'd probably be a problem. Even with a minimum amount of people you can do a lot to avert disaster, and I doubt it would melt down, but with no humans, at all, existing, it would still probably stay in containment. All of the containment is solid concrete which stops radiation real good, as long as it kept its integrity it would stay in there most likely. Cleaning it up after is a whole other question I can't answer, but it would most likely stay contained... just be a hellish radiated nightmare inside.</p></div>		</li>
