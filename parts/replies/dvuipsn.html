<p>Many of us have Continuous Glucose Monitors that will wake us up in the middle of the night if our BG goes low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone I know from university passed away from low blood sugar in the night before he would go on a trip with lots of other students. They would leave early in the morning, but he never came. That's how they found out - they started looking where he was, and they found him in his bed.</p>
<p>It was an eye opener for me. I never knew even sleeping could be deadly when you have Type 1 diabetes. I didn't even know him that well, but I was devastated when I heard it. I only did a few projects with him but from that it was clear he was a really nice guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, yes? Three days without any water at all is enough to kill you or make you extremely sick, so if you really stayed in bed for three days straight drinking nothing at all, you would be in  bad shape. Low blood sugar by itself isn't going to kill anyone but a diabetic, and it would take you months to starve to death, but if you're used to eating carbs a couple of times a day, it's an uncomfortable sensation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hangover is, by and large, dehydration squared. You're out of electrolytes, plus your liver is like, &quot;why did you make me metabolize all this junk? Here, have some breakdown products.&quot; The advice is more or less the same. Drink some plain broth for sodium, get some potassium and magnesium citrate in you, keep sipping water until you've gotten a couple of liters down, and do some gentle stretches or walking.</p>
<p>Also, drink less and have more water in between drinks. Don't go to sleep the night of without having had some water, too. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So much this. Helps a lot. Being drunk but knowing I won't be destroyed the next day is even better than regular drunk. </p></div>		</li>

A kinda related follow-up question, how does alcohol damage the brain?<br />
I know it does because, well, everybody says it and its common sense but smashing your head against a toaster also damages the brain but I don't think it's the same as drinking alcohol.  </p></div>		</li>
