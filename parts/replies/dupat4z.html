			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd go for a 'technically yes'. Like you mention this would need a tremendous amount of energy in water, at these energy scales the surrounding water will immediately vaporize. This could potentially prevent you from actually making a sonic boom while reaching the critical speed, I am not sure.</p>
<p>I believe submarine torpedos go fast enough to achieve this instant vaporization stage. I don't know if they come close to underwater sonic booms though.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian rocket-powered supercavitating torpedo VA-111 Shkval is reportedly capable of speed in excess of 200 knots (370 km/h; 230 mph). German press reports of an underwater anti-torpedo missile named Barracuda that allegedly reaches 800 kilometres per hour (430 kn; 500 mph).</p>

<p>They donâ€™t reach speed of sound of air yet. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wondering...  What is the effect of the cavitation on the torpedo? Is it a good thing that helps it go zoom fast?</p>
<p>Edit: nevermind just read about it a bit,  the answer appears to be &quot;yes&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's cavitation at the propeller. The blades go fast enough that pressure drops in the vicinity, going low enough that the water boils (and instantly recondenses once it moves away).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, pistol shrimp's claws top out at about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpheidae" target="_blank">100 km/h (30 m/s)</a>, nowhere near the speed of sound in either water or air.</p>
<p>It is however fast enough to cause the water to cavitate, creating bubbles that create shock waves as they collapse -- but not sonic booms.</p></div>		</li>
