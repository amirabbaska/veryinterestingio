<p>Ehhh not so much. If I can piggyback on this one...</p>
<p>Think of it more like this. Air, just like water, is a fluid. Pushing through it causes disturbances. </p>
<p>Have you ever been on a jet ski or small boat on a big lake? Even at  full speed you'll notice your wake dissipates pretty quickly, AND you can ride in another small boat/jet ski wake without much issue at all, in fact it's actually fun! But now, imagine a big cruise ship passes in front of you. They are pushing a ton more water out of the way, creating much bigger wakes behind them which, if you decide to hit, can be pretty scary, if not downright dangerous! That's what's happening in the air.</p>
<p>Wake vortices descend at approximately 300 feet per minute, and move with the prevailing wind, so we can get a good idea of where they're going to travel. Using that information we can determine how far behind, and below, we should separate traffic. In the air above 29,000ft, there is a 1000' vertical separation, and aprox 5 miles horizontal. On approach in low visibility conditions we keep that 5 miles all the way to the runway, but if it's nice out and we have visual contact that can be reduced down to about 3. Wake turbulence is no joke; I've had my fair share of it and it's really quite annoying and can hurt people in the back if they're up and walking around during the encounter. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you see the flight attendants buckle up, there's a pretty good chance things are about to get real bumpy (outside of approach, that is).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to piggyback on your piggyback, something similar to wake turbulence happens with large helicopters, like fully loaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook" target="_blank">CH-47</a>s or (God help you) an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_S-64_Skycrane" target="_blank">S-64</a> flying heavy. This is especially true when they are low enough to be in ground effect.</p>
<p>The down blast can easily exceed 100MPH. So, basically your average Category 2-3 hurricane.</p>

<p>We were in a C17 that landed like that in Afghanistan, but this was from altitude; lots of twists and turns, and then they dumped us and our gear and said not to go off the concrete.</p>
<p>&quot;Landmines.&quot;</p>
