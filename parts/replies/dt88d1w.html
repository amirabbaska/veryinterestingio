			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so interesting.... this never occurred to me but it seems so obvious now. Just like other genetic diseases/chronic illnesses pass on bc of modern medicine, birth difficulties must too. I was a breech baby, I shouldn't exist! Are there any studies related to an increase in other birth difficulties as well, that give numbers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breech presentations at full term are quite common - 3-4%. A study called the Term Breech Trial was conducted in the 90s and showed that vaginal birth was much riskier than planned cesarean for breech babies. This trial had a massive impact on how breech births are managed and essentially everybody moved to planned cesarean for every breech baby. Following its publication, the Term Breech Trial was widely criticised but not before section for breech became the norm, thus deskilling doctors and midwives attending breech births and, in reality, making them riskier. The TBT is still cited today as gold standard evidence despite the large flaws in the study.
TL; DR: A large study said that vaginal breech births were too dangerous. They became incredibly rare so no health professionals had experience with them, study was discredited but not before it was too late&amp;vaginal breech births were a thing of the past. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The increased use of c-section will also result in a reduction in the selection for head size. Babies with bigger heads are more likely to survive and pass on their genes.</p>
<p>This means that woman's hips can get smaller, and baby's heads can get bigger. Also causing the use of C-Sections to increase over time. I imagine a day may come when humans are no longer able to give birth &quot;naturally&quot;; assuming that narrow hips and big heads are desirable traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more complicated than that, because at the end of pregnancy the fetus is so large that mom is reaching the limits of being able to provide it enough nutrients through the placenta. They will deliver a baby early if there is sign of placental insufficiency. </p>
<p>Since the brain consumes massive amounts of calories, it stands to reason that if you made a bigger brain, then you’ll have to deliver earlier, canceling out the larger brain. </p>
<p>There’s also lots of infant brain development that, as far as we understand, depends on external stimulation not available in utero. It’s not really possible to prove this without an artificial womb to gestate a fetus longer, and good luck getting that through the IRB. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats evidence C-sections are practiced more commonly by the medical community and a possible genetic explanation why doctors might perform that more, but that’s still pretty tenuous. Do you have evidence that the skulls of infants have grown over that time due to non-nutritional reasons?</p></div>		</li>

Interestingly, evidence shows that ancient Spartans averaged 6’ tall, but they were also a highly selective warrior culture that relied extensively on slave labor. Malnourishment has been widespread for most of human history, and only now are most people getting fed mostly properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ehh on the other hand, we also tend to &quot;overprescribe&quot; C-sections when they aren't actually necessary. Breech babies, for example, are almost uniformly scheduled for C-sections, whereas 60 years ago they actually used to train mid-wives how to birth these babies safely. Now, the procedure has been mostly loss in favor of the C-section. Unless the C-sections in this study were specifically due to a narrow birth canal (what are they doing to measure this, pelvic X-rays?), instead of just general C-sections, I'd be very skeptical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but C-sections in general are much more high risk for the mother than vaginal birth for the mother. It's a major invasive surgery (cutting through fascia and muscle, and they frequently take the uterus and bladder out of your body), with risk of infection and all the other normal surgery risks. So you have to balance C-sections-when-medically-necessary with excessive/unnecessary-C-sections. In the case of breech babies, with correct training many of them can be safely delivered, but in lieu of proper training it is more dangerous for the baby so we now funnel them to C-sections. Because we no longer want to train doctors with this skill we ask mom to take on the additional risk of surgery. That's not to say that breech babies aren't a risk for mom, but we shouldn't pretend that C-sections are no-risk for her, either.</p></div>		</li>
