<p>How does dark energy factor into this? Is that an example of energy being created? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark energy is a mysterious thing that we don't really understand and have very circumstantial evidence for.  In a nutshell:</p>
<p>By looking at the size of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, we are almost certain that the shape of the universe is flat.  The problem is that even taking dark matter into account, there is only about 30% of the required mass-energy in the universe for this to be true.</p>
<p>So the missing 70% is what we call dark energy, and it is theoretically the result of &quot;vacuum energy&quot; or the energy of empty space.  Quantum mechanics basically tells us it results from the constant creation and annihilation of virtual particles, basically mass-energy being constantly created and destroyed.</p>
<p>Problem is our calculations aren't right so we don't really understand what's going on with dark energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, dark energy is in fact energy being created. In physics there's this really important theorem called Noether's Theorem which states that for every symmetry in your system there is an associated conserved quantity. For translational symmetry, it's momentum. Angular symmetry is angular momentum. And time translation symmetry is energy. This means that if it doesn't matter when you do your experiment, energy will be conserved in your system. But the Universe is not static, it has a definite beginning, and it's been evolving since then. This breaks the time translation symmetry and so on a cosmological scale energy is not conserved.</p>
<p>So back to dark energy. The Universe is continually gaining more energy in the form of dark energy, such that the energy density of the Universe stays exactly at the critical density. Because as the Universe expands, the energy density from matter and radiation decrease, but the dark energy density increases to compensate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark energy is still an enigma.</p>
<p>They are theories about entropy energy aka decay that people confuse or switch out with dark energy; this realy only matter pending on the theory. As matter exist it decays and slowly brakes down to smaller particles and energies as forces and energy is expelled; this is normally through radiation. It cools down after while. This energy makes up about 99% of the universe and is the reason why space is expanding; for clarity the space between thing like planet and galaxies in space is exspanding. </p>
<p>This works just like ice cubes in a enclosed pot. The ice boils down to water fillng the gaps in the bottom of the pot and then evaporates. The steam fills the pot but it fills the space all over not just in the bottom. If enough steam builds up it will push the lid from the pot to make more room to spread. Entropy does this to the distance of celestial bodies and pretty much all matter at some point will entropy.</p>
<p>This is a theory and some people don't agree with it.</p>

<p>In general our theories state that the big bang didn't create the mass of the universe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty much every pre-big bang theory is totally insane for just that reason.  For an entire universe worth of energy to simply appear doesn't gibe with any of the known laws of the universe, so all human knowledge breaks down and it becomes wild speculation.</p>
<p>If it was put there by an extrauniversal being (god), that would mean it had to come from wherever god lives, which doesn't explain how it got there.</p>
<p>If it came from another dimension/universe/multiverse/whatever, same as above.</p>
<p>The &quot;there was no before the big bang&quot; and cyclic universe arguments suggest that <em>time itself</em> can spontaneously generate, which is so far beyond any known laws of the universe that it makes no sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is this idea that we are in a zero-energy universe, that's to say &quot; its amount of positive energy in the form of matter is exactly canceled out by its negative energy in the form of gravity.&quot; Such a universe could arise from quantum fluctuations and more or less matches what we observe in this universe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't the big bang just be what happens to every black hole? That eventually they suck up so much matter they can't hold any more and they &quot;explode&quot;. Meaning the universe was always around. And these explosions happen with every black hole. And it could be happening right now. It's just so far away from anything we can possibly observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are fairly certain we already know how black holes die, and at a certain point in their life black holes become very unlikely to consume more matter.  As such it's unlikely for the entire universe to become one black hole and then blow up to create a new one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

<p>That implies some sort of 'meta-time' where time could have not existed &quot;before&quot; and existed &quot;after&quot;; it really seems like asking for 'where times comes from' is just an ill-formed question, since the premise of the question is based on things happening over time in the first place.</p>
<p>That being said our only real understanding of the big bang is classical, and so clearly in need of drastic revision. We don't currently have any solid ideas on what that would look like though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. Our universe could be a part of another, bigger universe. Perhaps our universe is just among an infinite number of universes? The statement doesn't contradict itself, but I <em>think</em> trying to figure out what came before our universe is pointless. This is because the only evidence to figure it out is <em>within</em> the universe itself! To figure out everything that happened after the creation of it, is, on the other hand, very much valid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way yes, which is the point of my comment.  That's what makes it metaphysical.  OP didn't realize it, but he was asking &quot;what existed before the universe&quot;, which is not a question that can be easily understood.</p></div>		</li>
