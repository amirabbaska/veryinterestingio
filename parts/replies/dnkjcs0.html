			<div class="markdown"><p>They are very small directional bombs. I also believe they use a giant push plate covered in something ablative to protect the plate (and, you know, the space ship). Anyway, there's an excellent description of one of these in Neal Stephenson's Anathem if you are interested in space-ship design. Another book of his (Seveneves) describes a system of chain-whips for intra-system travel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTG's) are akin to what you talk about with Nuclear Electric. It's not an actual nuclear reactor, but just uses the constant heat from radioactive decay to generate electricity. It's been used in plenty of things, but mostly small unmanned things for a few reasons. Using plutonium 238, you get about half a watt of electricity per gram, which is reasonable but not great for anything big and manned. The other reason? I'll let Mark Watney explain:</p>
<p>&quot;Why not? It should be pretty damned obvious why not! They didnâ€™t want to put astronauts next to a glowing hot ball of radioactive death!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>An actual propulsion system needs to be way more efficient than what an ETG can provide.</p></div>		</li>
