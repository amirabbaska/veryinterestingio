<p>2mph would be really hard to avoid outside. The rule is 2.0 m/s (+ or -, interestingly) or 4.5mph. Which now that I do the math is also really, really small. I guess at track level in a stadium the wind is less? </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Oh sorry we had to void your world record, the chances were too stacked against you. Try next time when it is easier.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usain hit <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footspeed" target="_blank">27.8</a>. Being that it was an average over 20m, his top speed was guaranteed above that. And we all know he doesn't try his hardest as he doesn't care for records; a past mentor of his complained he never took it seriously and other reports say that when he set the world record he slowed down at the end. </p></div>		</li>
