			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a very vulnerable time during anesthesia.</p>
<p>When you fall asleep during anesthesia, the muscle that keeps your stomach fluids out of your esophagus relaxes at the same time your vocal cords open up to your windpipe. You also no longer have a cough reflex to protect you.</p>
<p>Basically a recipe for disaster. There is a direct passage now from your stomach and the nasty stuff inside it straight to your lungs. That's called aspiration and it's a major cause of death.</p>
<p>Anesthesiologists put a breathing tube with a little balloon to block possible stomach contents from &quot;going down the wrong pipe&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. I've had several surgeries and procedures that required me to be put out (lung surgeries, exploratory CT, colonoscopy) and I really enjoy the feeling of trying to stay awake and fight it and to pay attention while it happens. but now that you've explained a key risk... I'm getting The Fear. More people should know why fasting is necessary, this is tres helpful!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not every procedure requires us/them to drain your stomach. It's still an aspiration risk if your stomach isn't drained, and that's a crap way to have to deal with all sorts of complications that are potentially avoidable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gastroparesis can also be caused by other conditions such as elhers danlos syndrome. Sometimes it takes 36 hours for my stomach to empty and when that happens it comes back up the way it came. It is a horrifying condition. No diabetes here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear that. I have mitochondrial disease and I'm on TPN for most of my nutrition. I also have a G-J tube (a feeding tube with openings in my stomach and small intestine) and do some careful eating and tube feeding, but sometimes I end up draining my snacks out my G tube the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had patients (particularly young people) on long-term TPN at home and I've always been curious as to how it affects them emotionally and socially. Have you gotten used to the TPN and its part in your life? Sorry if that's too invasive a question just tell me to go away if so! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they usually have indigestion and nausea after meals. But they often get diabetes in the first place from poor dietary control, so I suspect they push their gastric limits regardless.</p>
<p>Diet drinks often have protein, which suppresses hunger, but I don't think they cause nausea and bloating.</p></div>		</li>
