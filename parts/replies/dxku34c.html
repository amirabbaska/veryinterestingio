			<div class="markdown"><p>About that. My wife is a teacher. Every year she is buying supplies for the classroom as well as books to keep up to date on the ever changing standards. Teachers also buy book to review so they can then submit it for approval for future classroom use. On top of all of this she spends a lot of money on mandatory professional development. Going to conferences, workshops, and other events are rarely paid for by the school even though they are required by the state.</p>
<p>When all is said and done she is only allowed to claim a few hundred dollars on her taxes. So no they don't get it back in taxes. This is on top of making less than 50k in a job she is required by law to have two Masters for.</p></div>		</li>
