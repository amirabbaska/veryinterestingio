<p>The big savings comes at quality control, if something doesn't work, there's a chance that part of it still works. Selling it at cheaper prices reduces the work and increases the profit comparing to recycling. </p>

<p>I'm not quite following you here. Do you mean that disks that don't 100% pass QC standards might simply be sold as a lower capacity disk or a lower priced unit instead of being trashed (recycled)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>imagine a flash chip like a really large wardrobe with many (billions) small drawers.</p>
<p>during quality control, you might find out that out of one billion drawers, only 900 million are easily useable, the rest has some small problems that only inhibit storage, but don't impact the structural integrity of the wardrobe as a whole. </p>
<p>you can still sell that wardrobe as a wardrobe with 850 million drawers. it might be the same size as the 1 billion drawer wardrobe, but it's significantly cheaper, so customers won't really care. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a process called &quot;Binning&quot;. It doesn't necessarily mean that the drives don't pass QC standards in general, just that they don't pass QC standards for that size of a drive.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, or sold to companies that do OEM equipment with limited guarantees. Same strategy used by companies like Intel, AMD, nVidia and so on. Don't need to be amused of it, companies has been doing it for centuries to be competitive and it works for centuries.  I'll give you an example, in the subject we are talking about, disks have 2 sides and one side is perfect but the other has 95% usable, so my company sells it as a half surface for about 30% of regular price.  Still 3x more than just recicle the aluminum, win/win case from factory to the end user. </p></div>		</li>
