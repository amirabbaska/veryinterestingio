<p>Hollywood has us primed, for example, to think we can see laser beams, but in reality the only way you can see laser beams is to be directly in its beam or if the room is so filled with crap (i.e. dust, chalk, mist, etc.) for the laser light to hit that enough light is being scattered OUT of the beam and some of it scattering out into your eye.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd just like to add that lasers can be visible even in clean pure air with no other particulate in it thanks to rayleigh scattering off of the gas molecules. In a vacuum the beam would be truly invisible.   </p>
<p>Laser-based weapons are generally invisible either way because they're far in the infrared range. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this the case for any electromagnetic beam in the visible range? I.e., is it impossible to see any light ray in vaccuum unless it is directed into our eyes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we see things because photons hit our eyes after bouncing of something. Photons don't bounce of of other photons, so you can't see a beam of light unless some of it makes its way to your eyes directly (either through scattering or because you are in the beams path).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a totally junk/incorrect description of light in a medium that gets kicked around.  However, you are correct that &quot;light&quot; doesn't really survive being in a medium.  Light is a combination of electric and magnetic fields that are mutually reinforcing and oscillate. </p>
<p>Materials are made of atoms, which from a distance an atom is neutral, having equal amounts of positive and negative charge.   However, at a closer resolution, the negative charge is held by electrons, which exist in de-localized &quot;orbitals&quot; around the nucleus and the positive charge lies with the nucleus and thus the positive and negative charges are physically separated.  Because of this physical separation, when an electric (or magnetic) field is applied to a bunch of atoms it pulls the electrons one way and the nucleus the other turning the atoms into an &quot;electric dipole&quot; that produces its own electric field which acts to counter-act the external one.  We say: an external electric field polarizes the material.</p>
<p>This &quot;external electric field + induced counteracting field&quot; make for a combined field that is sometimes called the &quot;displacement field&quot;.  And there is an analogous &quot;external magnetic field + induced material behaviour opposing it&quot; for an applied magnetic field.</p>
<p>So if we define &quot;light&quot; to be an EM wave, in vacuum, with vacuum electric and magnetic fields, when it impinges on the boundary of a material it then INDUCES a wave of polarization that continues the journey.   It is an aspect of the math of EM fields that a lot of quantities must be conserved at an interface, and thus the polarization wave &quot;inherits&quot; many of the properties of the vacuum EM wave (like the direction it's heading, minus refraction), however, it also has many material dependent properties as well.</p>
<p>When we say &quot;light in a medium&quot; we actually mean a propagating polarization wave.</p></div>		</li>
