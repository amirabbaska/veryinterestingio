<p>This subreddit was originally about literal explanations to 5 year olds. Turns out a lot of people really suck at that, so enforcement of that was slowly backed down until it reached a point where literal ELI5's were actively discouraged. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt colonialism as an explanation just begging the question? In order to inflict the massive changes and subjugation colonialism entails, there would already have to be a pretty massive disparity in power/advancement, otherwise colonization simply wouldnt be possible. In the historical case of european colonialism, a chasm already existed in technological sophistication between european societies and civilizations in America and sub saharan africa. It seems to me like giving colonialism as a sole answer just pusher the question further back</p>
<p>Btw, im not necessarily trying to make a pont. this is mostly just an honest question. My closest level of familiarity with most of this stuff is sometimes reading wikipeadia pages while i take a shit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one part of the equation is that the North wasn't always so dominant and that really, it has only been the center of the world for a relatively short while. For long periods, the greatest empires in the world were further South: China, the Mesoamerican empires, the Muslim caliphates, the Romans who mostly expanded East.</p>
<p>To me, it seems that the tipping point was the Mongol invasions, which wrecked a lot of the great empires but barely touched Western Europe. They occurred in the 13th century, right around the moment where Western Europe really started dominating. Add to that the discovery of the Atlantic trade winds and you had a relatively small and backwater continent suddenly get the ability to move around and project power, including in places that had just been destabilized by the Mongols, like the Middle East. If there's a common theme to European colonialism, it's that the Europeans always seemed to show up at the worst moment. There are exceptions and they're usually examples of European influence being kept at bay, like in Japan.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That has very little to nothing to do with the issue here given how the Mongols never touched tropical Africa(or Africa at all), most of South East Asia or Latin America. </p>
<p>Remember; OP is wondering why the tropics are significantly less developed than the non-tropical areas. More importantly he is talking about contemporary nations, not 13th century empires. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China was often ruled from its South, the Cancer tropic literally runs through the Persian Empire and Rome's breadbasket was Egypt, which is right at the tropic latitude.</p>
<p>The higher altitude argument only works with Europe. Every high altitude country is European or a European colony. I'm saying that the Mongol invasions destroyed empire that could have rivaled with Europe, like the Muslims or China when the Portuguese started going around Africa.</p>
<p>And seriously, what happened in the 13th century is very relevant to today, it's not that long ago. A lot of the chains of events that led to the current distribution of power in the world came from that late-Medieval, early Renaissance period where Europe spread its wings and found few competitors.</p></div>		</li>
