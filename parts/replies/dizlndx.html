			<div class="markdown"><p>Whilst it is true that tropical corals need warm shallow water to survive there are several corraline species that can survive cooler temperatures. The most extreme of these being the corals of Røst Reef in the Arctic circle. I believe nutrients and currents play a much larger role on reef formation, temperature controls diversity and ecological composition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, not all coral species require warm water. I went on an expedition to the Gulf of Mexico on a ship with a 4-person submersible and we collected several samples of corals at deep water cold seeps. They were not reef-forming corals, but it was pretty neat seeing the ecosystems they were part of down below 1000'. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I was stationed on a submarine. Going that deep in something so tiny sounds nuts. I would love to do that though. I'm assuming there was windows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coldwater/deepwater coral species exist and do form reef structures (and, indeed, there are deepwater reefs, known as banks, in the northern Gulf), but these are much less massive than the shallow water reefs that form in warm water and don't produce the classic nearshore &quot;reef&quot; structure.  Coldwater species grow much more slowly and can't lay down the skeletal structure at the same rate. </p>
<p>So temperature is pretty important for formation of reefs in the classic sense, with a limit around 20 C, though other factors are of course also important  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are coral reefs off the coast of British Columbia (water about 10 degrees C) but they only grow in the fast moving waters (very large tidal surges between islands). I understand this allows them enough nutrients to grow and keeps the kelp from blocking out their sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I remember learning in school that reefs needed strong, nutrient-rich currents to survive. Could that also be a factor? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the opposite - they need nutrient poor water or they'll get outcompeted for benthic space by algae.</p>
<p>That's why coral reefs are typically found in crystal clear water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not entirely correct, corals survive best  in an oligotrophic environment. This means very little nutrients as corals mainly get their food from photosynthesis and capture of micro organisms. High nutrients are good for algae which tend to out compete corals and cause problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High nutrients, especially phosphates, lead to algae blooms which are not good for much of anything in the ocean or anywhere else.  Big &quot;dead zone&quot; in the gulf from it.  plus some algae release toxins that cause even more problems.  Ie Red tide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tropical reef building corals actually tend to favour low nutrient environments, hence the requirement for shallow clear water; they contain symbiotic photosynthetic algae that generate the corals energy from sunlight. Some of the deeper/colder water reefs do require lots of nutrients though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why we shouldn't have been so surprised in 2016 to have &quot;discovered&quot; a 600 mile reef at the mouth of the Amazon river given the temperatures off the coast of Brazil hover between 60 and 70°F.</p></div>		</li>
