			<div class="markdown"><p>Other guys were pulling shit out their asses, here's an ELI5 of your question.</p>
<p>Time is relative. We do not know the origin of the universe. There is no explanation. The only explanation that even seems possible, but is still very far fetched, is virtual particles.</p>
<p>All we know for sure is, thanks to the Big Bang Theory, the universe was small and merely underwent rapid expansion about 13.7 billion years ago. </p>
<p>That number is relative to us. If your best friend is near a black hole, time is slowed down but it is still the same for you who is safely on Earth. If your best friend escapes before reaching the event horizon and was there for 50 years relative to you, he was still there for 50 years. He underwent only a couple of hours but you underwent 50 years.</p>
<p>So when we say that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, we really mean that 13.7 billion years ago, relative to us on Earth, the universe started to expand.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hey, someone actually mentioned General Relativity in here.</p>
<p>So many comments about time running faster, slower ... slower clocks, etc.</p>
<p>None of those comments understand the basics of General Relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The time we use is that based on a clock that was &quot;born&quot; during the big bang and which does not move with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation.  But you are correct that the clock ran very slowly in a sense when the universe was very dense.  That is, if there were someone outside of the universe watching in some fashion, his clock would run faster. That is because high gravity slows clocks.  In point of fact, a clock on board a satellite runs faster than it did when it was on earth, and engineers have to correct for that.  So it is 14 billion years according to our imaginary clock, but if there was an observer outside of our gravitational field, they would say it took way longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to relativity the speed of light is always the same, no matter what your frame of reference. If your frame of reference (like your speed) changes in a way one would expect could change the speed of light relative to you, then time will instead change to the extent to make the speed of light consistent. If you are not familiar with relativity your mind well rebel against this part of the explanation, but please trust that it is one of the central concepts of relativity that has been proven over and over again, so once you accept it then the next part is easy to understand. </p>
<p>We know that the universe is approximately 14 billion years old, because we see events close to the beginning happening approximately 14 billion light years away. Since light will always travel the same distance in a given amount of time, then time measured by how far light has traveled will always be the same. </p></div>		</li>
