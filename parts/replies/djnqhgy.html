Totally not what actually happens but helps imagining first how the branch is oriented in the trunk, that it goes deeper inside and getting thinner and it has it's own &quot;trunk&quot; where fibers are oriented differently. There needs to be transition between the two, the trunk continues to grow outwards but so does the branch. The end result is very dense knot. It has to hold well in the dynamic loads trees can get so it makes sense that it is very hard. It is the end of the lever, rest of it can bend, the knot really can't.</p>
<p>But really, best way to find out is to take a log  that has some of the branch still left and start digging in with a saw. Circular saw is the best, to make slices and figure out how the thing forms. The take another log and another. They are all a bit different. When it is very old tree, the trunk can twist and that leads to even weirder knots. We took down one birch 150 years old last summer and boy.. A lonely tree on a hill, had had enough sustenance all thru it's life and no other big trees around for a century.. It took 3 men about 3 days to get it to something manageable in size, and i used another 3 days of work just chopping it to firewood. The knots.. It was twisted beyond belief, knots went so deep and no order anymore, it had a lot of wind to endure.. But weirdly fascinating to see the insides, how everything had grew and twisted. A real challenge :) </p></div>		</li>
