<p>The strong nuclear force is really short range - the protons have to &quot;touch&quot; to interact with each other. The radius of a proton is 1.2 fm, if protons are further apart than 2.4 fm they don't interact noticably via the strong interaction. </p>
<p>For example in Coulomb excitation experiments one chooses the energy of the particles such that the distance of closest approach is greater than 1.2 fm (surface to surface) to avoid having strong force contaminations in the interaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good call. I grabbed that from a figure and the wikipedia article (which says 2.5 fm), but then forgot to take into account that it's center-to-center, so my factor of a few is really a factor of one. I've edited my original post, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's just that the strong force is much, much, much stronger when the distance is incredibly short.</p>
<p>It's far from a perfect analogy, but take a paperclip on a desk.  Gravity is keeping it there.  If I pick it up with a magnet, gravity is still acting on the paperclip, but in this case the EM force is just much stronger at the short distance between paperclip and magnet.</p>
<p>The forces are all there, but the distances at which they are effective are different, so when two things are close, one overwhelms the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this make me wonder, so gravity has a very wide ranging effect, magnetism it still &quot;wide&quot; but less so, but is stronger, then the strong force is very narrow but very strong.</p>
<p>so if you make a graph of them with x = distance, y = force, would the area under the curve be the same? would they be the same strength when accounting for strength over distances?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably a really dumb question, but how do we know that protons fused together in a nucleus remain a distinct entity rather than becoming some sort of single megaproton?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that they remain distinct is pretty central to the entire modern framework of nuclear physics, so the answer to this &quot;how do we know&quot; question is going to be really reductionistic. </p>
<p>One the one hand, nuclear energy levels are well described by a thing called the 'nuclear shell model' where protons and neutrons fill successive energy levels in the nucleus, exactly analogous to electrons filling energy states in an atom. So... they're distinct objects in the nucleus. </p>
<p>Another approach is to just look at the 'bag model.' Basically, at low energies, we consider protons and neutrons and other composite nuclear particles to be made of quarks confined to some space. If you're imagining three marbles with a little mesh bag around them, then you're doing it right. So when these 'bags' come together to build nuclei, you can do experiments to see how the quarks are 'arranged' inside. When you do experiments with medium energy beams which probe the substructure of protons and nucleons in a nucleus, you'll still find that the quarks belong to their 'parent' nucleon. </p>
<p>Again, this is all very handwavey. If someone would like to offer a better explanation of DIS experiments, by all means go for it. (cough cough /u/RobusEtCeleritas) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on your definition of &quot;distinct entity&quot;?  A proton could be considered three &quot;distinct entity&quot; quarks, or it could be considered &quot;some sort of single megaquark&quot;.</p>
<p>The same semantics could be used for protons and neutrons in a nucleus.  Without knowing more about what behavior you have in mind to distinguish a collection of touching entities vs a single entity, it's difficult to know how to answer your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it may not be possible to think about in traditional terms, but if I were to use a metaphor for my thoughts it would be like cells in a plant. Do you have two cells touching each other each with distinct cell walls, or do they conglomerate to have a single outside border with a soup of 6 quarks from the two protons floating around inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what /u/VeryLittle said.</p>
<p>A hadronic physicist can probably give you a bunch of reasons why they don't form a &quot;megaproton&quot;. The energy scales of QCD going on <em>inside</em> hadrons and the nuclear physics going on at the level of multiple interacting nucleons are just different.</p>
<p>For fusion in a stellar environment, the protons have a relative energy on average which isn't even large enough to overcome their mutual Coulomb barrier (luckily tunneling helps them, which is the subject of this entire thread). This is way too small of an energy to be probing hadronic structure.</p>
<p>So there's just no reason to believe that they're forming &quot;megaprotons&quot;. It doesn't fit with experiment nor theory.</p></div>		</li>
