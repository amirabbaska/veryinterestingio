<p>Intraspecies conflict is common in the vast majority of intelligent species, including primate troops that go to war against each other and dolphin rape gangs that murder calves and have their way with the adult females.</p>
<p>War is not a human invention.</p>
<p>We just, unfortunately, perfected it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, if you look at the big scale, perfecting war is kind of a good thing. Since most world powers basically have the ability to end life on Earth with nukes, nations can't risk too much in terms of war anymore without the risk of simply incredible damage to the planet and its life.</p>
<p>We've been fighting proxy wars for years, but direct, World War levels of fighting are less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an exaggeration, but humans are vengeful as fuck. I know if a wolf ate my baby, I'd want to absolutely destroy that wolf. And any other wolf I saw.</p>
<p>We can't verify some random hunter got pissed cause his child got eaten, but it's likely enough of a scenario to assume it's happened quite a few times.</p></div>		</li>
