			<div class="markdown"><p>That all seemed very logical until I thought about your feet.  You can't put your feet on the verticals so the horizontals will still deform every time you stand on them.  Yes there are less 'deforming' actions but it doesn't stop it.</p>
<p>When climbing a ladder you should hold the sides too and not the rungs.  I think that is a combination of preventing someone standing on them, if you slip it's easer to re-grab than an rung, and also it feels a more natural position for the wrist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same in fitness/weight lifting, the 'palms inward' grip is a lot easier than palms facing away or palms facing you. Much less strain on the forearms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with your shoulder. If your arms are in front of you, having them externally rotated (right arm turned to the right, palm facing &quot;up&quot;) is a more stable and strong position.</p>
<p>Even if you're doing something like bench pressing, you're still supposed to &quot;bend the bar&quot; AKA externally rotate your hands, up to your shoulders for strength and stability/join safety</p></div>		</li>

<p>That way your hands never actually come <em>off</em> what they're holding. If you hold the rungs, you have to let go of one before you grab the next one. If you hold the riser, you can actually use just one hand, sliding it as necessary, while you carry something in the other.</p>
<p>And, as said elsewhere, your hands don't get stepped on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree on the premise that rope nets form knotted intersections.  This would not work for the same reason you can't grasp a hand rail on a stairs and wrap your fingers around it completely and slide your hand along... Eventually you'll hit a support post tying it to the wall.  Same with the rope net eventually you'll hit a horizontal intersection and have to let go and move your hand up, ESPECIALLY if you're carrying something in the other hand. </p></div>		</li>
