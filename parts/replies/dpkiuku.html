			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, but the answer isn't intuitive. To calculate the magnitude of this choice we relied on the research done by <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/pdfs/OSUCarbonStudy.pdf" target="_blank">Murtaugh and Schlax</a>. In their system, a parent considering the effects of having an additional child is responsible for emissions according to the fraction of their genes that they pass on (i.e. each parent is responsible for 1/2 of their children's emissions, 1/4 of their grandchildren's emissions and 1/8 of their great grandchildren's emissions, and so on for many generations). They used average birth rates and life expectancies to show how many children one new child is likely to have in a certain country (and how many offspring those children would have and so on). All the emissions from these descendants were divided over the life expectancy of each parent (80 for the case of a female in the United States). We think it's appropriate to include multiple generations for a choice that will have multiple generations worth of consequences, but this results in a much larger number than the per capita emissions of an individual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand why you choose to use someone else's research, but that method is exceptionally flawed when used in a comparative study like yours. </p>
<p>You would need to examine the question in an ecological framework. Population growth is limited by resource availability: it's a sigmoidal curve, not an exponential. This paper's model is exponential. </p>
<p>In economic terms, your not having a child decreases demand for the necessary items to raise a child, which means that price will decrease, which will mean someone else can afford a child. So using their number far, far, far overestimates the effect your having a child will have on total carbon.  </p>
<p>Additionally, you would want to deploy a discount rate to future emission. Preventing carbon release now is more valuable than preventing it in the future. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to be misleading way to estimate it. While you’re correct that the decision may have an impact for generations, you’re accounting for all of that now rather than when it will have the impact. Depending how many generations you do the math for, you could make this number as high as you wanted. </p>
<p>It also ignores that the decision point we’re interested in is now, at within the next ten years, and not 75 years from now, at which point we’ll either be already screwed or have figured out a way around this. </p>
<p>I guess on a gut level the number seems way off, and opens you up to criticism of your approach. I just had a kid, and there’s no way we’re consuming that much more CO2. We have a bit more food consumption and consumer spending, but we’ve also stopped traveling. She might consume that much once she leaves the home in 18 years or so, but she’ll be making her own choices in a very different world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If each couple only had one child, and each child is responsible for the same amount of emissions over their life time then the sum of their emissions is 1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+1/32+1/64...~= 2</p>
<p>With infinite generations of one child, your emissions can only double. With two children each generation it will increase by 1 each generation, but it may average out that the people who are less likely to have a kid outweigh the people who have two kids.</p>
<p>EDIT: You do have a good point though. It seems like a questionable way of calculating it. I don't know the science enough to judge it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We calculated the effect of living car free based on the average number of kilometers traveled by a vehicle in a region per year, as well as average vehicle occupancy. We include emissions from car production and maintenance in addition to combustion of fuel (we basically tried to include the full life cycle of the car). You're correct in noting that how you go about living car free will determine the effectiveness of that choice. The number we suggest assumes that you replace average use of a vehicle with a zero emissions alternative (biking or walking). Replacing your car with public transit will not be quite as effective, though you're likely to travel fewer kilometers and even if you don't you can still expect a <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/1/015041/meta" target="_blank">26-76% reduction in emissions</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it would be good to know how much of that is simply the carbon cost of building the car versus use.  If I drive 20 miles a week and fill up every 2 months, that's a bit different than a daily 50 mile commute.  How much does it improve if my next car's electric?  Or is a used non-electric better to save the building cost.</p></div>		</li>
