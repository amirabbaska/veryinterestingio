			<div class="markdown"><p>What was the treaty that forced the Brits to give us all their technology, I know they had to hand over their radar systems cause they were so advanced and some device called a Magnometer or a Catalyic Magnet or some shit that ended up being insanely useful and is in like every modern day electronic device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the US had XAF in 1939, but i think you mean the Tizard mission?  The UK did not give the US anything, it was a trade of state secrets, the US and UK  did very well out of it, the USA visibly much more than the more advanced British.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not just that, there is a distinct advantage to host nations too - decreased likelihood of being attacked, lost of US personnel spending money in the local community on cars and housing and food and luxuries etc etc, and there's an increased tie and good relations with the US as well, which has other advantages.</p></div>		</li>
