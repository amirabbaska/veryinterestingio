<p>Amazing how F1 tech is being used in supermarket isles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK the system varies from shop to shop, including the open top freezers and eye level cabinets. </p>
<p>In the big supermarket near me they have freezers with full sized glass doors. </p>
<p>While I agree people are terrible at driving their shopping trolleys, the supermarket simply put plastic and rubber bumpers all down in front of the freezers. Keeps anyone from impacting on the glass! </p></div>		</li>
