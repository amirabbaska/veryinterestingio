			<div class="markdown"><p>Different plants have different light-level requirements, but most species won't thrive under normal house/office lighting so I doubt moonlight would be sufficient.</p>
<p>(This is, of course, ignoring the specific wavelengths/color temperatures needed for photosynthesis; however, the light we receive from the moon contains very little of the red/far-red/IR light plants need.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The color of moonlight, particularly around full moon, appears bluish to the human eye compared to most artificial light sources due to the Purkinje effect. Moonlight is not actually tinted blue, and although moonlight is often referred to as &quot;silvery&quot;, it has no inherent silvery quality. The Moon's albedo is 0.136,meaning only 13.6% of incident sunlight is reflected from the Moon. </p>
