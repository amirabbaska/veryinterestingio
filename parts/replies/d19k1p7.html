			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, sleep debt accumulates as a deviation from what might be described as a peak level of &quot;restedness&quot;.  As a person goes without sleep, they drop below this level, and when that person then sleeps, they move toward that optimum level again.  </p>
<p>I don't think there is any research suggesting that one can - for lack of better phrasing - go above this 100%-rested level.  I also haven't see anything suggesting that humans can store rest as we would caloric energy via fat.  I could be wrong, and I'd love to be corrected if that's the case. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with that.</p>
<p>There is evidence of people performing better when sleep restricted if they have previously had the opportunity to &quot;bank&quot; extra sleep, but this likely just paying back residual sleep loss they had acquired before the experiment.</p>
