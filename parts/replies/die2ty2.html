<p>I did my PhD dissertation running climate models of Jupiter. Surprisingly, this is <em>not</em> the case.</p>
<p>Earth is actually the planet with the hardest weather to predict. That's because we live on the only planet with atmosphere and oceans and continents and clouds and ice caps and rain and snow and they interact in very non-linear ways. </p>
<p>On Jupiter, there's atmosphere and clouds. If you know where the Great Red Spot was last week and where it was today, you can very accurately predict where it will be 6 months from now. Imagine trying to do that with a hurricane on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Something else makes Earth much harder to model, too. In atmospheric dynamics, we talk about something known as the &quot;deformation radius&quot;, essentially how big a vortex can get before it starts splitting up into separate vortices. On Jupiter, the deformation radius is quite a bit smaller than the planet's circumference, so you can pack quite a few vortices on Jupiter and still have them play nice together. On Earth, though, the deformation radius is actually a lot closer to Earth's circumference; you can only pack about 6 or so around the planet, and they all get in each other's way and make a big messy pile of turbulent interactions.</p>
<p>My old advisor used to say: Picture 6 prima ballerinas on the stage, jumping and pirouetting around...it's beautiful and ordered. That's Jupiter. Now pack these same 6 ballerinas into an elevator and ask them to perform - that's Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing about Jupiter, is that we really don't know if it has a &quot;surface&quot; or what that surface might be made of.</p>
<p>It's very likely that at some point, the atmosphere is crushed, by pressure, into a liquid. Or, possibly a solid. It's possible that it's composed of all light-elements (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, etc), and there's no real metallic matter near that surface.  It could be &quot;dirty ice&quot; similar to what we see on the surface of Jupiter's and Saturn's moons. Except under tremendous pressure and heat.</p>
<p>It's also theorized that there could exist states of matter that exist only at extremely high pressures. Not quite fusion-sustaining. But where the atomic structure breaks down. So-called &quot;degenerate matter&quot;.  Where the electrons are stripped off, and nucleii are compressed closely together. Such degenerate matter could have extremely strange (to us) physical properties, and could be in a constant state of high flux (flipping back and forth between states, at a quantum level), causing huge localized energy releases. These releases could also be driving these storms. </p>
<p>(edit: stuff about degenerate matter... is highly speculative, and probably not in Jupiter, let alone the others; it's thought to exist in white dwarfs and neutron stars, and POSSIBLY in some larger brown-dwarfs, of which, Jupiter is on the lower-boundary, mass-wise). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are persistent weather features on planet earth, like the Icelandic low, where air pressure is consistently lower than the surrounding areas.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That brought up a tangenital question in my mind.</p>
<p>Do we know how fast the storm winds are? Do we know how fast the prevailing winds are? </p>
<p>You can see the disturbances in the bands on the leeward side of the storm, but they seem to be smoothed out by the time the winds come back around from the right (east?) side again. What kind of time are we looking at for that to circumnavigate Jupiter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The highest speeds in the Great Red Spot (GRS) are somewhere in the neighborhood of 175 meters per second, roughly 400 mph - note that hurricanes on Earth usually max out around 200 mph.</p>
<p>The wind speed of the surrounding jet stream varies strongly <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MXbYtys.jpg" target="_blank">depending on the exact latitude</a>. At the north edge of the GRS, it's about 60 m/s in the westward direction, and at the south edge about 50 m/s in the eastward direction. The result is that the GRS <a href="http://imgur.com/a/OOiFK" target="_blank">rolls around</a> a bit like a gear trapped between two oppositely moving plates.</p>

<p>Again, this depends very strongly on the exact latitude of the disturbance, since that what determines the prevailing jet stream speed. It's generally on the order of weeks to months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting to me, I had thought that GRS (or hurricanes) on Jupiter would have much higher speeds than Earth, but they are just twice as much.</p>
<p>Obviously I don't have much sense of scale here. </p>
<p>What are the highest speeds of hurricanes noted in our solar system (or all planets we've observed)?
What is the theoretical possible speed of a hurricane?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can we know it's been around that long? Have telescopes powerful enough to see the spot existed for 200+ years?

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been reports of spots on Jupiter since at least the 1600s. Because they are very irregular (and sometimes in the wrong spot), we aren't sure what to make of these early discoveries. In 1830, it was definitely seen, and it's been studied since 1879. We likewise have seen a regularly occurring (but not constant) storm (&quot;the Great White Spot&quot;) on Saturn since 1876.</p>
<p>Telescopes got pretty good once people had a chance to get funds and practice, even if modern day stuff blows our ancestors' work out of the water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have a reference for this? Last I looked into it, the Great Red Spot was first observed in 1685 by Cassini, then after the late 1600s it seemed to disappear for a century or two, then was only re-observed in 1869 by Joseph Gledhill, at the time referred to as &quot;Gledhill's Ellipse&quot;. Reference from 1898 <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1898MNRAS..58..488D" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's been observed pretty frequently since the early 1800s. A similar spot was seen way back in the 1600s, but due to a lack of observation we don't know if it was actually the same spot.</p></div>		</li>
