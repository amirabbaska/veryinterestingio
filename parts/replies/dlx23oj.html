			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna be using my dslr to take some pictures of the eclipse, it's also my only safe way of looking at it (through the digital screen, not the viewfinder). Will taking a few pics with a 1/100 shutter speed or faster do any damage to the sensor? My mentality is that it shouldn't have time to do any damage as 1/100th of a second </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shooting at a normal shutter speed shouldn't be an issue. The only issue I can see would be doing a long exposure with the camera locked off on a tripod. Stop down the lens as much as possible. Shooting at f22 is physically restricting the light that is hitting the sensor, just like the iris of your eye constricting. As u/kre_x said when using the screen the sensor is exposed the whole time. But really that shouldn't be an issue.</p></div>		</li>
