<p>we have no way to express that we are in danger. Here, crying can be the solution to let others know we need help.  </p>

<p>Crying, no doubt an evolved behavior, is largely a signal of emotional trauma rather than danger. </p>
<p>I'm speculating, but in the presence of danger, flight or fight mode takes over - not an emotional response. </p>
<p>You dont cry during a fight, you cry when the other person has you pinned and you realize you're fucked.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>I hadn't considered infancy, though infant crying is likely the biggest driver for evolution. </p>
<p>That said, we don't evolve things as a means to fix something. Somebody had a trait that happened to fixed something so they ended up breeding a lot. I still think crying, at its crux, as just an emotional reaction.</p></div>		</li>
