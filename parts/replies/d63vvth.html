			<div class="markdown"><p>The sonic boom is a constant noise. You will hear it until they go under the speed of sound. </p>
<p>This is why the Concord commercial planes (which could go supersonic) were never used outside of trans Atlantic flights. Too loud to go over land</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, boom is really a misleading word for it because it implies something like an explosion - when really it's more of a constant roar. It just sounds like a boom from land, because unlike normal sound, which would reach you from the plane constantly as it flies by, the boom is like the wake of a boat, only hitting you once for each pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, the original post about the ripples makes sense because as you approach the speed of sound, you're building up a collection of &quot;ripples&quot; of noise until you hit the point that they converge and you get the boom.</p>
<p>But once you're going faster than sound, you wouldn't have a collection of ripples grouping up anymore since you're not slower than them at that point. Why wouldn't the sound you make when you're faster than the speed of sound be similar to that of when you're slower than it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think part of the reason this isn't well known is because of all the <a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/dk-find-out/image/upload/q_80,w_1440/A-iStock_000017498245Large_pxojdi.jpg" target="_blank">photos of jets breaking the sound barrier</a>. So did this jet reach booming speed and immediately brake? Or is there <em>visually</em> a boom only once?</p></div>		</li>

<p>More accurately, as long as the airplane travels faster than the local speed of sound in air, which varies with air temperature. Around 60000 ft (Concorde cruise altitude) that's about 295 m/s.</p>
<p>You really don't want to be going supersonic at sea level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically like the wake of a boat. If you're in the water as the boat passes by, you will only be hit by the wake once, but the boat is constantly producing a wake as it goes through the water. </p></div>		</li>
