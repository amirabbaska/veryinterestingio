			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the Germanic deity with the same etymology as Zeus and Jupiter, was Tyr (Norse) or Tiw (old English) aka the guy Tuesday is named after.  But unlike Zeus, Tyr is not the chief god.  At some point, Odin stole his job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually pretty fascinating.
Potentially dumb question: When you said &quot;sky daddy&quot; were you just saying it to be a little silly, and it actually means something more akin to &quot;father&quot; or is it actually a diminutive like &quot;daddy?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In French to say &quot;sky father&quot; we say &quot;dieu le p√®re&quot; (it's very commonly used in church) which sounds really really close to &quot;dyeus phter&quot;. It blows my mind that we've been saying more or less the same thing for millenia.</p></div>		</li>
