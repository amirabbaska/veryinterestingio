<p>&quot;distinctive anatomical and functional features have been revealed that justify designation of the mesentery as an organ. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I handled a previous version of this article with my journal.</p>
<p>To be fair, it's a classification proposed by one surgeon, for surgical reasons. Structurally it might be a contiguous 'organ', but it's functional relevance as an organ beyond a surgical appreciation is very much up for debate because there isn't a huge amount of work into it's functional properties.</p>
<p>Some of the surgical reasons for the new classification are discussed <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrgastro/journal/v13/n5/full/nrgastro.2016.40.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So far, nature is still the greatest engineer on the planet, keeps throwing these new structures and connections at us every so often. How do we know it's not a useless organ that stuck with us since it was neither detrimental or beneficial to our survival. In the workings of natural selection, these things tend to stick around if that's the case. If this organ started killing people that had it, it would have been phased into extinction long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more accurate takes as much shit as it can and throws it at the wall and sees what sticks.</p>
<p>Sometimes you get stuff that's both detrimental AND beneficial like sickle-cell anemia.  Nature doesn't exactly design well, it's more of a prolific brainstormer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like what Neil degrasse Tyson said about the design of the human body wondering why put food and drink down the same entry and adjacent plumbing as air thereby  guaranteeing people will ostensibly die from choking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The people who discovered the organ seem to think it's necessary to live, contrary to what has been written in grays anatomy for a hundred years (indicated it was sporadically present). I'm not sure what all the study found, but they suggest looking into whether it's related to GI functioning in some way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has now been shown to have a distinguishing cell type or at least special organization beyond connective tissue.  Apparently this could only be seen under a certain type of light and staining that hadn't been done or at least shown yet.  </p>
<p>It seems the changing of the name to organ has to do with the ability to increase the amount of research and specialists who work on it.</p></div>		</li>
