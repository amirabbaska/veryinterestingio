			<div class="markdown"><p>Debatable doesn't mean useless though. IQ is and remains the single greatest numerical indicator of intelligence that exists.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychometricians generally regard IQ tests as having high statistical reliability.[9][55] A high reliability implies that – although test-takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, and although they may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same age – the scores generally agree with one another and across time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2016/5/24/11723182/iq-test-intelligence" target="_blank">Vox</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>IQ is often dismissed as antiquated, misguided, or less important than personality traits. But according to Stuart Ritchie, an intelligence researcher at the University of Edinburgh, there's a massive amount of data showing that it's one of the best predictors of someone's longevity, health, and prosperity. And psychologists have been able to replicate these findings over and over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that IQ tests are archaic and not meaningful is completely false. IQ correlates to a ridiculous number if things.</p>
<p>It has flaws, and isn't perfect but &quot;IQ is debated&quot; is misleading. The majority of serious criticisms aren't that IQ is wrong and can't measure anything, but rather that there might be more things that aren't being measured (emotional intelligence).</p>
<p>The idea that &quot;IQ tests are racists&quot; holds a lot less ground today as they continually adjust the tests to try to eliminate cultural and gender bias. IIRC if the tests come back with minorities having significantly lower IQ's on average, it is inheritly assumed the test was biased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue in psychology with IQ tests is that they aren't considered by many people in our field analogous with general intelligence. They just test how good you are (if you'll forgive the circularity of this statement) at the kind of tests that IQ tests are. </p>
<p>The usefulness of IQ is HIGHLY debated. So is the usefulness of specific mental disorder categories in the DSM. That doesn't mean both have no value or use, it means there are major potential issues with them. IQ DOES correlate with a lot of things. Yes. But that doesn't necessarily speak to the validity of IQ as a construct that represents what we consider &quot;intelligence&quot; as much as a measure of performance in certain arbitrary traits our society rewards. Certain scores on a psychopathy test ALSO correlate with prosperity, health and longevity (CEO are disproportionately both psychopaths and wealthy) but that wouldn't make Psychopathy a valid measure of intelligence. Especially since it's actually characterized by impairment of certain mental faculties. Being born into a wealth family is also a great predictor of someone's longevity, health, and prosperity. But that DEFINITELY doesn't make it a good measure for general intelligence.</p>
<p>It's not the RELIABILITY of IQ that's in question. It's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity" target="_blank">CONSTRUCT VALIDITY</a> and the potential social implications it creates. IQ tests are certainly useful for many things, but the debate is over whether &quot;measuring how intelligent someone is&quot; is one of those things.</p>

<p>I mean, it can hold a lot less ground and still be holding a fair sized lot. There's a reason they're still continually adjusting. The vocabulary section alone is basically a massive confound and I don't know why it's still there. There is no body of words that are omnipresent in all cultures and regions which you're more likely to know if you're more intelligent. It basically just serves as a &quot;Do you read the kind of books the creators of this test think smart people read&quot; measure and that will ALWAYS be biased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I wonder if it may be the case, that humans have simply killed every primate (or &quot;humanoid&quot;) species that could emulate their speech. Similar to the Neaderthals. I mean, humans are already pretty prone to genocide inside their own species, so it was probably even more common to kill similar life forms which are perceived more alien, like apes that are able to somewhat talk. But this is pure speculation, we will probably never know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did we just kill the Neanderthals? If I remember correctly, Europeans tend to have some amount of Neanderthal DNA, so it seems that we bred with them as well. And I don't know if we actually know why they went extinct while Homo Sapiens survived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK, all non-Africans have some amount of Neanderthal DNA. Another extinct species (or sub-species -- yet to be determined) called Denisovans also interbred with Homo Sapiens and their DNA traces can be foound in South East Asian, Papuan, and Aboriginal Australian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is some more sinisterly possibility. Although pretty far fetched. So there is this one parasite that bites into fishes and lives from their blood. The weird thing is, scientists found a gene in the parasite, which it cannot possibly have evolved itself, so somehow it has incorporated it from its host through feeding. Sooo... Still very very far fetched, but that may have been a possible way how neanderthal genes ended up in our genomes.</p></div>		</li>
