<p>One of the molecules is facing one way, the other is mirrored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also have what's called &quot;left-handed sugar&quot;, or L-glucose.</p>
<p>It has the exact same formula as normal glucose, it's just mirrored. If you were to taste L-glucose, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between it and normal sugar. However, it can't be absorbed by the body because the enzymes that work on glucose only know how to do glucose. </p>
<p>Now you may ask, if it's the exact same taste as sugar and entirely biologically inert, why don't we use it as artificial sweetener?</p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It has a mild laxative effect. You may remember Olestra from a decade or so ago. &quot;Fatless&quot; fat. Provided all the tastiness but couldn't be processed by the human body, so it'd go right through you. Well it <em>literally</em> went right through people, causing the dreaded &quot;anal seepage&quot; in some people.</p>
</li>
<li>It's insanely expensive to manufacture. A gram of L-glucose costs more than a gram of <em>gold</em>. No living thing on this planet creates or uses L-glucose, so it has to be synthesized in a lab. </li>

<p>I remember a professor saying, &quot;The person who invents a way to create <em>cheap</em> L-glucose will become the richest person in the world.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could have also used thalidomide. In lab tests, they only used one version of the molecule to test. End result, no more morning sickness for pregnant women. When they went to manufacturing, they allowed both versions. End result?  Horrific mutations in the womb.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Chemical receptors can be extremely specific. For ones that deal with proteins, you can have the same molecules in the same sequence but a different &quot;fold&quot; that won't trigger the receptor.</p>
<p>And for what it's worth, IIRC both forms of methamphetamine are good decongestants, and the dextro form is actually more effective but illegal in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not easily.</p>
<p>But this is how people use OTC drugs like cold medicine to manufacture crystal meth. They break down the components of a molecule and then create the conditions for that molecule-piece to re-attach with a different molecule.</p>
<p>Some break down easier than others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate here? I was under the impression that Adderall was mixed amphetamine salts without the methyl group, but &quot;trailer park&quot; meth and Desoxyn were essentially the same thing (albeit with tp meth containing a lot more impurities and contaminants)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a little confused. Wasn't OP asking about Dextromethamphetamine? In your first explanation you seem to be referring to it since it is the mirror of Levomethamphetamine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be pointless, the bare chemicals are just carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen and there are much easier ways to synthesise a molecule than breaking down one of its isomers then building it back up</p></div>		</li>
