			<div class="markdown"><p>My first dog genetics project was when I was a postdoc in Carlos Bustamante’s lab and we were working with Elaine Ostrander and Bob Wayne on the “CanMap” project looking at about 800 dogs from over 80 breeds. In that project we found lots of new loci associated with body size and coat types (long vs short, curly vs straight, wiry vs normal). However doing a selection scan across the genome revealed that the strongest signal of positive selection didn’t occur in any of those regions but instead was in a region of chromosome 10 we hadn’t associated with anything. It was clearly fixed for one variant in many breeds and fixed for the alternative one in many others. After five minutes with google image search, it became pretty clear that we were looking at the locus for floppy ears in dogs!</p></div>		</li>
