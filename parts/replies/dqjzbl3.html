			<div class="markdown"><p>Reactors split Uranium into two fission fragments when neutrons hit the uranium. The fragments are usually one big and one small fragment (They can be pretty much anything on the periodic table that's lighter than uranium...although there's a preference to atoms that weigh ~90 and 130ish). One of the common fragments is a certain isotope xenon that likes to eat neutrons. This means that the reactor has to try harder to cause fission because of these neutron absorbers. Another isotope is a certain Iodine that transforms into xenon.<br />
At any steady state operation, the amount of xenon produced (from uranium splitting and from iodine decaying) is a perfect balance. The reactor is eating them up as quickly as they are produced.<br />
When reactor power is increased/decreased , the equilibrium is changed. In the case of lowering reactor power, there is now more xenon being produced (there's a lot of iodine transforming into xenon). To overcome this, you need to be able to supply more neutrons. This is accomplished by either having more logs in the fire (overfuelling) , or by pulling neutron absorbing rods out of the core to allow more neutrons to strike uranium atoms.<br />
When power is increased, the xenon production (from iodine decay) is at a value lower than your new power level. Therefore, you need to gobble up more neutrons manually to simulate the steady state level until things balance out.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should add that &quot;more logs in the fire&quot; could also mean more than enough excess reactivity by having more fuel than needed. This is common in BWR and PWR because they're fueled once a year or so. CANDUs are fueled daily to maintain just enough fuel. We sometimes over-fuel them if our fueling machine is to be made unavailable for a period of time (and for other planned activities that could cause us to need excess reactivity to overcome xenon or normal fuel burnup). </p>
<p>Now that I think of it, enriching the fuel doesn't necessarily mean excess reactivity. When your gas tank is low, it's low regardless if it's low octane or high octane.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is a picture. We were in coastdown near the end of the fuel cycle. We pulled a control rod out causing power to increase. The white line is the “rod line”, a measure of reactivity. At this higher power level, xenon was initially decaying away faster due to the higher power level. This caused the white line to keep going up even after reactor power was increased. Then it finally peaks and starts dropping again due to fuel depletion. </p>
<p>I have a few other images but I need to mark them up first. </p>
<p>After a scram, xenon builds up in the core and prevent a restart. After adjusting power, xenon causes reactivity to move around in the core for some time until everything returns to equilibrium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good and thorough answer.  I had to go look up slagging, as it isn't a term we use anymore.  In my years as a reactor operator we would usually just say  we were fighting xenon.  Slagging would be called a &quot;xenon precluded startup&quot;, or we'd just say she was poisoned out.  I have only operated PWRs, though, and we are a fairly insular group from the boilers and Canadians, so I can't say how they refer to it.</p>
<p>I love learning about the early reactors and their operators.  Those dudes were truly operating reactors in the scientific wilderness, dealing with the unknown constantly.  Inventing words as they needed them to describe things no one had seen or thought of before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone not very knowledgeable about the subject, How come safer designs like molten salt reactors aren't being built? Do they have inherent flaws or does it just boil down to money?  Saw that old tedtalk with the MIT students talking about old better reactor designs not being researched or built.</p>
<p>EDIT: Corrected sodium to salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It used to be easy to build a nuclear power plant, relatively speaking. You could go from proposal to operational in just 5 years or so. Now, you're lucky if you're breaking ground 20 years after proposing a power plant because of the permitting process. You'll also be constantly bombarded with lawsuits and injunctions from every anti nuclear group in existance, which will end up costing billions in legal fees and court mandated environmental studies forced on you by activist judges. </p>
<p>It's nearly all politcial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are flaws, like keeping the sodium away from anything that causes it to explode, but other issues that aren't necessarily flaws like having a coolant source that is easy to handle and obtain like water. Also, as with all nuclear technologies, the ability to use the reactor to produce weaponizable materials has to be taken into account. Breeders, heavy water reactors (CANDU), and even the much vaulted thorium reactors have huge issues when it comes to proliferation resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason is that as Americans we allowed the military to dominat the early industry absolutely, and so the reactor designs we have developed the most are defined by the needs of the military, primarily the Navy.  Thorium was rejected because you can't use it to breed plutonium for weapons, among other reasons.  Molten salt and other coolant systems were rejected because of how difficult they were to use on a submarine.  Essentially,  the rapid early development of the nuclear power reactor was driven by huge amounts of government money.  The commercial power industry is particularly risk averse and generally unwilling to bet on unproven reactor designs, so they continue to make iterative improvements on the designs that the US government initially bankrolled.  There are exceptions to this, but the rule generally holds true.</p>
<p>Had our reactor program been civilian primarily from the beggining, the designs we would be using today would be drastically different, oh this I have no doubt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US Army actually ran a fairly successful reactor program.  Everyone knows about SL-1, but they designed and operated many more before and after SL-1 with a good track record.  Unfortunately, a combination of the high cost of the reactors and their limited uses doomed the program.</p>
<p>In my training in the Navy, I had access to some documents detailing essentially all of the nuclear accidents on record up to about the early 90s.  It included both civilian and military accidents from around the world.  The section on Chernobyl is, to this day, the most thorough write up and dissection of any I have read.  I really wish I could have gotten a copy of the manual to keep, but that wasn't allowed.  Anyways, if there was any program that came accross as ill-concieved and  poorly executed it was the Air Force reactor program.  Thankfully it was shut down early before they racked up too many accidents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should add that a CANDU needs to pull adjuster rods at ~60% within 20 minutes to avoid poisoning out. </p>
<p>At normal full power operation, a CANDU COULD poison out if reactor power drops by as little as 5% (depending on fueling history and power history). Usually any reactor power manoeuver will either need the reactor to be returned to full power or drop the reactor to 55% and start pulling adjuster rods (if equipped). Once the xenon transient is over (~36 hours) the adjusters are re-inserted and reactor power can be raised with the proper administrative approvals.</p></div>		</li>
