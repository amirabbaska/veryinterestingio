			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless your car is garbage like my first car. I got rear-ended and my driver seat completely broke away from its railing and fell backwards. So I was stuck on my back with my legs up in the air. Luckily my dad was in the passenger seat and was able to stop my car before we crashed into a store.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the argument is it's a choice to not wear a seat-belt and similarly it's a choice to ride a motorcycle. If the risks of Motorcycles are so much more extreme than not wearing a seat-belt why are motorcycles even allowed(If the punishment is meant to promote safety)?</p>
<p>I can see while people wouldn't be persuaded by this argument given multiple factors, but I personally like the idea of commonalities between risks/regulation. Personal liberties and all that. Why should &quot;being lazy&quot; or &quot;I don't like wearing it&quot; be a bad excuse when &quot;I like riding motorcycles&quot; is a perfectly good excuse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they were invented today they almost certainly wouldn't be. As it stands, it would be politically very difficult to tell a load of people they have to give up a mode of transport they paid good money for.</p>
<p>In the US motorcycles are seen as toys or a hobby, and for a lot of riders they are, but they are still a <em>vehicle</em> and for some people it's the only vehicle they have. I wouldn't be able to get to work tomorrow if motorcycles were banned. </p>
<p>For better or worse, as self-driving cars take over and manual driving is phased out over the next few decades, there's a good chance motorcycles will be banned. That's a whole separate discussion though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea its pretty simple. Now if the question is changed to why motorcyclists in certain states don't need to wear helmets (Texas here) then yea, good question. If seatbelts are required helmets should be no exception. </p></div>		</li>
