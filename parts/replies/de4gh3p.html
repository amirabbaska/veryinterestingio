<p>The density of water is about 1,000kg/m^3 .</p>

<p>The equation for the height of a column of a particular medium is defined by:
h = P/ρg</p>
<p>h = 5,000,000,000Pa/(1,000kg/m^3 )*(10m/s^2 )</p>
<p>h = 500,000m = 500km </p>
<p>That's deep.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that depth, you might have to take into account the change in g as a function of depth. At the surface, g=9.81 m/s^(2). For a perfect sphere with constant density, g(r)= (4π/3)Gρr. g as a function of depth within Earth's surface is given as g'=g(1-d/R), where g' is our new acceleration and R is Earth's radius and g=9.81. </p>
<p>So, let's assume density in Earth and water remain constant, and we just dig a hole into the ocean floor until we have 500km of water above us. The deepest known part of the ocean (Marianas Trench) reaches 10.994 km, which is a little over 2% of your proposed depth. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to just assume d=500*10^(3) m. So g'=(9.81)(1-500000/6371000)=9.04 m/s^(2). That's about an 8% decrease. Not a huge amount, but if you weighed 200 lbs on the surface, you'd weigh about 184 lbs at that depth (not including the water pressure above you, of course). </p>
<p>So, 500km is probably pretty close to accurate, but I've come this far. Might as well finish the calculation. Let's plug in our expression for g'(d) in for g in our hydrostatic equation, and change h to d: P=ρgd(1-d/R). Now let's solve for d, and plug in our knowns, and we get d=540.7 km. So not too far off. Same order of magnitude. </p>
<p>Of course, the other option could be to keep the same rocky mass of earth (and thus g=9.81) and just add water to the ocean until it reaches proper depth. The average depth of the ocean is 3688 m. So lets go back to our hydrostatic pressure equation, with constant g: h=P/(ρg)=494.8 km. To find out how much depth we need to add: h-(mean depth)=491.15 km. How much water is that? Well, just take the difference in volume of the two spheres: V=(4π/3)((r+R)^(3)-R^(3))=2.703*10^(20) m^(3). That's 2703 billion billion liters, or 71.4 million billion billion gallons of seawater.</p>
<p>One third option (likely cheaper) could be to just build a 1 m^(2) heated tank, 40 km high and fill that with mercury. I wouldn't advise collecting those diamonds, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The type of ice most people are familiar with is Ice I, which forms at typical pressures and is less dense than water. At high pressures, there are other forms of ice that form, all of which are denser than water, and therefore sink rather than float. This <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_phases.html" target="_blank">link</a> has more information, but it's somewhat dense to read. Also,  ice can be formed at any temperature if a high enough pressure is applied.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It looks like people are saying 5 billion pascals and 1200C can make diamonds, and if you look at the phase diagrams people are linking for water there wouldn't be a solid form of water at 1200 degrees until pressure was into hundreds of billions of pascals.</p></div>		</li>
