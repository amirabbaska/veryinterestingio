<p>Is that basically what they need to deorbit and re-enter the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After Columbia, a second shuttle was always ready, except for the final flight. In the event of damage, the damaged shuttle would dock with the ISS and transfer the crew to the station. The orbiter would then be fitted with a cable allowing remote control, and the crew would close it off from inside the station. It would depart and attempt to return under remote control/autopilot.</p>
<p>The rescue shuttle would be reconfigured with extra seats and other gear to handle a crew of eleven instead of seven. (The rescue shuttle would have its own crew of four.) It would go to the station, dock, and transfer the crew and some items from the damaged shuttle useful in the ensuing investigation, and then return.</p>
<p>A modified version of this was planned for the final Hubble servicing mission, but with a direct shuttle-to-shuttle transfer. Atlantis was the servicing orbiter, and Endeavor the rescue shuttle. Because of limits to available time, Endeavor and Atlantis were rolled out to separate pads at the same time, both ready to launch after the external tanks were filled. It proved unnecessary, and Endeavor was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building and reconfigured for its own next mission.</p>
<p>Any rescue mission probably would have become the last ever shuttle flight.</p>
<p>The final shuttle flight had no backup. Instead, the minimal crew of four astronauts would remain behind on the station and return on Soyuz capsules one at a time over the course of a year. Soyuz capsules would go up with only two crew instead of the normal three, impacting ISS operations by leaving it short of crew but bringing back the shuttle crew safely.</p></div>		</li>
