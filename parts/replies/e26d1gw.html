			<div class="markdown"><p>.......but because most of this cost is processing, every addition gram is only another..... $16?</p>
<p>So ten grams should cost...... $186, not $400. Are bulk purchases like this a possible option?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming the processing cost of $1.50 per 1/8th is already at bulk quantities. They aren't processing one 1/8th at a time for $1.50 each occasion, that's the portion of the cost when it's part of a larger batch.</p>
<p>Since child-resistant packaging is likely required and would have limited/standardized sizes, you may not be able to reduce that cost by using large packages or putting more in each one. </p>
<p>The biggest opportunity for cost savings from selling in bulk <em>seems</em> to be labor, especially on the dispensary's end. A clerk making $15/hour (or whatever) could spend 10 minutes selling 1/8th or spend 10 minutes selling 1 ounce, on the surface it doesn't look like any more labor is needed to sell the bulk quantity. But that employee will still be there, keeping the shop open every day for the whole week, whether they're selling products or not. Since the bulk purchase makes it less likely that they'll make another sale to the same person in the near future, it actually <em>does</em> need to cover more of the upkeep (or profit) needs of the dispensary.</p>
<p>I imagine there is a benefit to buying in bulk, like there are in most places for most products, but it might not be huge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You save on some, but tax is based on weight, which is a large chunk.
Yes, scale does help with the COGs, but majority of  average consumer base doesn’t want to drop $100 or $200 at a time.
Also people love variety - they would rather buy 4 1/8ths at $40 of different flavors than one half ounce at $100</p></div>		</li>
