			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: when putting on the ring you are pulling on and stretching the skin from the tip of your finger to where the ring is (a few cm). When taking the ring off you are pulling and stretching the skin from where the ring is to the rest of your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just put it in, then yes, the ring should pass your knuckle with the same ease as it did when you put it on.</p>
<p>If it has been on your finger for a while and it is tight, then it might happen that your finger is swollen and it becomes more difficult to take it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just attempted this and realized i didn't have enough hands. So i pulled the skin tight with my other hand and took the ring off with my mouth and ot actually came off much easier.</p>
<p>Granted it was stuck or anything but it does help out a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but if the ring still gets a little stuck going over the knuckle, let go of the taught skin and let it slide over the knuckle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wish I could upvote you more than once. Why are people answering questions wrong in ELI5?</p>
<p>On your finger, there is a finite amount of skin stretching from the finger tip. When trying to take the ring off, you have an entire arm length of slack skin. If you had someone pulling the skin back, then it would be easy to take the ring off since the pulled back skin reduces the diameter of your finger, preventing friction forces that would cause skin on the tip side from folding and preventing the ring from coming off.</p></div>		</li>
