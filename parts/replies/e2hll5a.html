			<div class="markdown"><p>I once went to a chocolate museum which took you through the history of chocolate and gave you samples of each historical stage of chocolate consumption and they gave us samples of the Mesoamerican drinking cocao. I thought it was quite nice - obviously not something you could have much of in one sitting but I wonder whether anywhere actually sells such a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The York Chocolate Museum (they seemed to have either rebranded or are using two names since I went because it also appears to be called York’s Chocolate Story). It’s in York, UK. Well worth a visit if you’re nearby; the guides are all lovely and you get a ridiculous amount of free samples. In fact York in general is a great place to go - there’s also the Jorvik Centre which takes you along a street in Viking era York.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They had an exhibit at the Museum of Natural History in San Diego all about chocolate.</p>
<p>It was fun and interesting and then very depressing as they broke down the slave hours that went into a cup of cocoa when hot chocolate first became popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s something they didn’t really go into from what I can remember, probably because it’s more angled towards younger children but then again I suppose it’s important to learn about that sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sitting here drinking French press coffee and just realizing that it really does taste different than drip. I've loved French press coffee for years, but never realized that it was the muddiness that I really enjoyed. It really coats your mouth and I feel is much more aromatic to drink than drip or pour over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>French Press for the win! It also allows a lot more of the natural oils to stay in the beverage, instead of getting soaked up by a paper coffee filter. </p></div>		</li>
