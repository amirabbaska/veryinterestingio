<p>Ohm's law is absolutely true, because it's meant as a defining law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definition of what exactly? A proper reformulation of the law is <strong>J</strong> = σ<strong>E</strong>, where σ is a single, constant real number. So do you mean to say that Ohm's Law is really the definition &quot;an ohmic medium is one which satisfies <strong>J</strong> = σ<strong>E</strong>&quot;? (In particular, the medium is isotropic.) If so, then, sure, Ohm's Law is always absolutely true since it's a definition. But phrasing it that way belies the fact that no medium is actually ohmic and that treating a medium as ohmic is only an approximation. In general, we have that <strong>σ</strong> is a rank-2 tensor, and Ohm's Law is the approximation that <strong>σ</strong> = σ<strong>I</strong> and observed fact that this approximation holds in a wide variety of applications. But... it's not always true even approximately. The arguably simplest counterexample is any homogeneous, anisotropic medium, for which <strong>σ</strong> is diagonal but not a multiple of <strong>I</strong>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on whether you accept that R can be dependent of I as well, without that violating the law.</p>
<p>Of course you are right about the conductivity tensors but even in those cases we can talk about an ohmic resistance that changes with current.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Ohm's Law that the OP posted is absolutely <em>not</em> always true. Go hook up a battery to a superconductor and measure the current, and tell me otherwise.</p>
<p>Ohm's law in the form R = V/I is an approximation that works very well for DC circuits, as long as you're willing to ignore lots of little details (e.g. parasitic capacitance and inductance), but it is quite wrong in general. The generalization of Ohm's law to Z = V/I, with V and I, along with Z, all being complex numbers does hold generally, as far as I'm aware.</p>
<p>But R = V/I is absolutely an approximation, even after accounting for the factors such as temperature dependence, and frequently it is a <em>bad</em> approximation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you think a superconductor connected to a battery will show that ohms law is invalid?   Sure, the current won't be infinite because the resistance is not zero - batteries always have some internal resistance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point about complex resistance, though I still think it's just semantics to call it Z and not R.</p>
<p>All electric circuits with inductors and capacitors can be described as a simple albeit complex resistance.</p>
<p>How do superconductors deny the law?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Superconductors are treated just fine by the generalized version of Ohm's law using impedance. Mostly.</p>
<p>Even still, Ohm's law (generalized or not) still doesn't work for non-equilibrium states! AC circuits are a bit of an exception due to their periodic behavior, allowing us to talk about well-defined rms voltages and current. Nor does it work for describing the behavior of very small systems.</p>
<p>This is why I really don't think it's reasonable to say that Ohm's law is always true. It gives the impression that if we plug in two of the three quantities we will always get a physically accurate prediction for the third, but that is not always true. It's better thought of as a rule which is almost always applicable to an excellent degree.</p></div>		</li>
