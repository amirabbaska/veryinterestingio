			<div class="markdown"><p>Everybody's answering this but I have a feeling that's not the question. Personally, I know how offer and demand works, I get that a currency has a higher value if more people want it, etc. And I suspect OP does too. What I dont know however, is when you see that Bloomberg or Google or whatever tells you in real time that a euro is worth 1.173948858 dollars, how exactly did they get this number? What was the calculation? How did they measure in a fraction of a second how appreciated a currency is in the subjective mind of billions of investors? If feel like this is what this ELI5 is about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On currency exchanges, like stock exchanges, buyers say &quot;I will buy <em> units of </em> currency for $_&quot; and sellers say &quot;I will sell <em> units of </em> currency for $_&quot;. The exchange's job is to match those people together (or aggregate multiple sellers for one buyer or vice versa). As a result, they have data on all of the transactions going on. The <strong>posted price is an average of recent transactions </strong>on that exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an average of the last 100 prices someone bought that currency on an exchange. They read off the data and average it.</p>
<p>(More than 100, formula is more complex than that, but that's the ELI5 version)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But letâ€™s say I want to buy 5 USD. That would mean USD values will go up. But does my EUR money will rise <em>together</em> with USD? How about if I decided to buy 5 USD and sell 5 JPY? </p>
<p>Does USD values go up and JPY go down? How does it translate to EUR? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Price is determined by peoples value of a good. When you buy USD, that just means that the current offered price is at or below your value for USD. If your value for USD is much lower, then you wont buy, and that will drive price down. The price of USD is simply the point where the most trades will happen.</p>
<p>When you buy USD for EUR, that is an indicator of how you value USD  relative to EUR. It shows that you value USD at least as much as the current exchange rate. Its your valuation that determined if the trade was going to happen, and that is what affects the price.</p>
<p>In fact, not buying USD for EUR has just as much of an effect. When you choose not to buy USD, that means that you value USD less than the current exchange rate. This drives price down.</p>
<p>In short, price is driven by opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every trade has two sides, so if you're buying USD with EUR, that means someone else is buying EUR with USD.  There is not inherently a change in the value of either there.</p>
<p>The important thing is whether there are more people like you or like the other guy, and at what price point they would change their minds and decide it's overpriced.</p>
<p>If suddenly everyone wanted to buy USD with EUR, and only a few were willing to take the other end of that trade, the price of USD will tend to go up and EUR will tend to go down.  But as the price of USD goes up, fewer people will want to buy it for that.  And as the price of EUR goes down, more people will think it's a bargain and want to buy it.  So the balance of buyers and sellers will balance out and the price will stabilize, usually after only a small shift in price.</p>
<p>Underlying economic factors can influence whether people think it's a good idea to be holding on to one currency or another, which over time can lead to larger and more sustained swings in exchange rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait a minute. So is it possible that if I have 10 USD, I can buy 15 EUR, then exchange it to 7 JPY and then exchange it to 11 USD in a span of 10 minutes or so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not the case with fiat currencies. central banks exert quite a bit of influence on the rate. it's not a free market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they are also able to affect the demand curve by raising interest rates or selling bonds. i think you should mention central bank influence because free market interactions alone don't explain it.</p></div>		</li>
