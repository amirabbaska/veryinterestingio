			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this reasoning. I often see the &quot;addition of exponents&quot; reason used, and it isn't as intuitive and tends to beg the question of why can you add exponents. Using the associative and commutative properties of addition is much more intuitive and is closer to the axiomatic definition of multiplication, so it needs fewer follow up questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, you don't even need commutativity. The reasoning works for any monoid (structure which is associative and has an identity element) - so for example the same argument shows why a 2x2 matrix raised to the 0th power is the identity matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]], even though matrix multiplication isn't commutative.</p></div>		</li>
