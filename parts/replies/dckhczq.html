			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but this may not be the only reason.</p>
<p>The music will keep you from being distracted by other sounds in the room, much like brown noise, but the rhythm can also help keep you at a maximum APM.  </p>
<p>A very related example of why rhythm can improve APM is typing speed.  A common mistake people make when trying to improve their speed is to have bursts of fast typing when they get to a common letter pattern, only to slow down considerably immediately after the burst.  You will never see someone that types &gt;120 wpm doing this.  Having a constant pace - which can be reinforced by listening to something with a constant rhythm - can help with APM just as it does WPM.  </p>
<p>Anecdotally, focusing on keeping a regular rhythm brought my wpm from 80 to 110 in about a week on 10fastfingers.com.  I don't have numbers, but it did good things for my starcraft game too.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR Yes</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i become hyper sound aware when i lay down for sleepy time. </p>
<p>every noise i hear must be identified and if its a repeated noise (for example: neighbors in apartment below mine) i have to re-evaluate every time i hear it.</p>
<p>every footstep, every cabinet door, every car outside, every roommate snore,</p>
<p>every cell phone buzz, every barking dog, every movie sound, every croaking frog</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty common - that's why sound machines <del>are</del> were so popular.  Try playing some brown noise or nature sounds when you sleep and try to focus on those.  It has helped a lot of people.</p></div>		</li>
