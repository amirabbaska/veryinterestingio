			<div class="markdown"><p>How curious; my hypomanic episodes usually begin with sharp declines in sleep, and this often follows with feeling like you're drunk but intensely caffeinated also, with disinhibited and frankly stupid behaviour augmented with boundless energy. I wonder if these processes go hand in hand or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not his fault, and he wasn't diagnosed until well after we got together. I'm the one who urged him to go to a sleep specialist in the first place. The time between onset and diagnosis is, on average, 10 years. Mostly because people think you're just lazy and lack the willpower to wake up. Fuck them. </p>
<p>But trust me, its harder on him than it is on me. I'd be grumpy too if I felt like that all the time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why do you love someone who is always grumpy? How can you love someone who is always grumpy?</p>
<p>Maybe love is cheap for you, but I could not lease my love to someone who is &quot;always&quot; grumpy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of a weird question. I love him because he's more than just a grumpy narcoleptic. This sounds like anyone suffering from a chronic medical condition shouldn't be loved. Like I said in an earlier comment, you would be grumpy too if, from the second you wake up in the morning, to the second you fell asleep at night, you felt like you hadn't slept in 72 hours. </p></div>		</li>
