			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good reply, very interesting. I'm just curious because I don't have any first aid training whatsoever, but what should you do of someone/you have severed a limb? I know to tourniquet if possible, but what do you do with the severed limb? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;If the part is completely detached, control the bleeding after cleansing the site by covering the wound with a pressure dressing. Wrap the amputated part in sterile saline soaked gauze and place it in a watertight container or resealable plastic bag. Place the protected part in an iced saline container. Do not allow the damaged part to come in direct contact with ice.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Call 911. Ask them.</p>
<p>If you're in an urban area where help is immediately available, it's best to let the professionals handle it. Also, the 911 operator (or emergency operator where you live) will be able to give you directions while you're waiting. A couple of reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>People's belief in their skills often far outpace their actual skills. Even if you took a great first aid class a year ago, a lot of your skills and memories will be atrophied. </li>
<li>Emergency routines are constantly being revised and updated. See for example the discussion of tourniquets above. They used to be quite frowned upon because they almost always meant the loss of limb. But, medical techniques for removing them have gotten a lot better, which has led to an increase in their recommendation. </li>
</ol>
<p>That said, if help isn't immediately available, then you have to do what you can.</p></div>		</li>
