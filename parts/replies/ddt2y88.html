<p>And they still do! That's how the Internet goes between continents. It's just all automated and digital now, and most cables use fiber optics (lasers through glass fibers) instead of electricity through copper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's super weird thinking that when we're loading a website from some remote country, it's going through the bottom of the ocean in some of the remotest depths.</p>
<p>It's also really interesting thinking about the cable laying operation... dropping cable into 4 miles of water is probably a lot trickier than it seems.  I know back in the early days they probably laid it across all kinds of problem features like underwater cliffs (which would probably move with the current and get hung up on things).  I'm sure nowadays they have a submersible helping to route it correctly.</p>
<p>I wish someone would do an hour-long cable-laying ship video... I'd watch the hell out of it to see just how they do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There does exist an official protocol for &quot;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549" target="_blank">IP over Avian Carrier</a>&quot;. IETF is the Internet Engineering Task Force. This is totally a real document for internet by carrier pigeon, but I'm not certain it's ever been implemented in the field.</p>
<p>[Wikipedia] records that the Newfoundland earthquake of 1929 broke a series of trans-Atlantic cables by triggering a massive undersea mudslide. The sequence of breaks helped scientists chart the progress of the mudslide. In March 2007, pirates stole an 11-kilometre (7 mi) section of the T-V-H submarine cable that connected Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong, afflicting Vietnam's Internet users with far slower speeds. The thieves attempted to sell the 100 tons of cable as scrap. So, maintenance and repair have always been very real issues.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a very <em>very</em> expensive repair. They have to send a ship with a hook on a miles-long cable and drag that hook around (by moving the ship, or by driving a remotely operated vehicle along the bottom) until they snag the cable, then haul it up to the ship (twice if it's really broken in two), then mend it before putting it back down.</p>

<p>In rare cases (and mostly in shallow water), a robot can be sent down to fix it in place. But not usually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sometimes. I guarantee in the 50's when you called an operator, they physically moved stuff around on the switch board. They did it for more than long distance then.</p>
<p>I work for a Telco, and if you go into any central office, there is tons and tons of unused space where all the switchboard operators and mechanical switches used to be.</p></div>		</li>
