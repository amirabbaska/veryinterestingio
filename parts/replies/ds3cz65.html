			<div class="markdown"><p>Water, for sure.  But be aware that several <em>carbon based</em> materials will also absorb microwaves and heat up.  Graphite, in particular.   In my reckless youth I put 0.5mm mechanical pencil leads in a microwave and made them glow red hot.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh it just catches fire as it turns out. Nbd. The guy calls it super deadly at the end but it’s no more deadly than lighting a cup of gas on fire. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not apparent, if it gets heated up or not. There is a lot of sparking noises, maybe the fumes ignited because of previous damage to the microwave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for finding this! My dad and I planned to do this one day when I was a kid and it never happened. I always wondered if gasoline could ignite from excitation — most people feel like it needs a spark. Everyone I’ve asked got it wrong!</p></div>		</li>
