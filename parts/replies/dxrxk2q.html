			<div class="markdown"><p>My student dorm has an interesting system, everyone's key can open the front door, everyone in my apartment can open the apartment door and only I can open my room. But I only have one key, and that key only has 2 sets of teeth. Any idea how that works?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are probably more ways to achieve this than this, but here’s one possible way. </p>
<p>Think of a key as a password. This will be overly simplified but here goes. </p>
<p>Each notch or cut in a key represents a character.   Each person has their own 8 digit password. </p>
<p>And all passwords are assigned, so you might have 745<strong>7893</strong>. And your roommate might have 692<strong>7893</strong>. And your neighbor across the hall might have 571<strong>*8***</strong>893**. </p>
<p>So basically the lock only checks a subset of the key for matches, and doesn’t have pins in the other positions. The front door checks less of the key than the apartment door, which checks less than the interior door. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be that not all the pins are in use for all the doors - eg. if it's a six pin lock, they may only have pins 1-3 in use on the shared doors, and pins 4-6 on the individual doors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The trick there is that your apartment doors are normal locks like you see in all the photos. But, the main entryway has some missing pin stacks. For example, if your key has 6 pin stacks (common for residential keys, commercial systems might have 8-10), then the main entry lock might have pins in pin stacks 1-3, and have the remaining pin stacks empty. In that case, every lock in your system has the same configuration for pins 1-3, so all the keys open the main entry door - the remaining pin stacks don't matter. Every apartment has its own combination for pin stacks 4-6, and that's why your key doesn't open anyone else's apartment door.</p>
<p>Now in your case, it's a 3-level system: So perhaps the front door only uses pin stacks 1 and 2, and you can compare your key with someone in a different apartment to see which pins are common. Then the door to your apartment uses pin stacks 1 through 4, and you could compare your key with someone else in your apartment to see which are common. The remaining pins are unique to your room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to key dual cylinder deadbolts so the inside key would not work the outside, but the outside would work the inside.</p>
<p>Also the key in the knob key was different than the outside deadbolt so a homeowner could give a worker a key to just one of the locks.</p>
<p>So there were four different keys for one house</p>
<p>Inside deadbolt</p>
<p>Outside deadbolt</p>
<p>Key in knob</p>
<p>Master key for homeowner.  As these were Schlage C keyways I would also file the bottom at an angle to thwart duplication.</p>
<p>Also provided keyhole blockers and special extraction keys.</p>
<p>A couple of hours work and a few joints.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you duplicate a key, the bottom of the key sits on the bottom of your duplicating kit. If it's at an angle, the key won't sit correctly giving rise to incorrect angles at the top. Not impossible to duplicate, but certainly makes it harder. (IANALocksmith but I've seen this done back in the day)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To copy a key, the base of the key typically rests in the base of the clamp in the key cutter. If you were to grind the base of the key in some way (angle from tip to bow, shave off a bit the whole way along, etc) the key would get put flat in the jaws of the machine, and would copy, but the copy wouldn't work.  The reason this works is because the key indexes on different areas in a lock and in a duplicator. In a lock, the key is indexed by the grooves on the sides, not the bottom. This is a very old trick to make a key more difficult to duplicate. Unfortunately, it is getting less and less effective, as many places (rite aid, home depot, osh, etc) are using duplicators that don't index off the bottom of the blank.</p></div>		</li>
