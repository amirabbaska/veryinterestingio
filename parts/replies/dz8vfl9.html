			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partially correct. The system is very automated but the bulk of the 3d and texture data comes from drones/helicopters/planes they operate themselves. This data is checked against the satellite data and applied using an algorithm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is why if you look at Washington DC everything looks flat and crappy. It’s a no fly zone so they can’t get good data. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>''using an algorithm'' lol.</p>
<p>Reminds me how Morpheus just skimmed over years of technological advancement resulting in machines using humans as batteries in The Matrix with the dismissive line ''combined with a form of fusion''.</p>
<p>A form of fusion? Really? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you want is an encyclopedic explanation in a movie or a reddit comment? I mean I could go into way more detail since I've worked on very similar things to their 3d mapping software but is it really needed in a random reddit comment? Google exists for a reason lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, hes describing the I/O relationship.</p>
<p>Input: Drone Cameras, Satellite Cameras.</p>
<p>Output: 3d models.</p>
<p>Once you establish that is proper &amp; possible, the rest is just busy work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They originally envisioned the matrix to be using humans as processors. They say this somewhere in the extra content. Apparently they did it because people at the time were way more used to batteries than processors, and they thought the public wouldn't understand it.</p>
<p>Makes way more sense if you think about it: we suck as batteries, but have fast brains that can compute a large amount of info.</p>
<p>That's the reason why they dismiss it on the movie. They know it makes no sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that satellite imagery aren't high resolution / frequent enough for the data. Google most probably helicopters or drones for the photogrammetry.</p>
<p>I did saw a video made by the google maps team talking the technology behind it, but I can't find it right now.</p>
