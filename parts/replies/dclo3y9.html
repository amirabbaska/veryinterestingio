			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part of your explanation is accurate, the second is not. The interest paid last year for the debt was 223 billion, only a portion of that paid on debt owned by China. So, no, they aren't making trillions, we aren't paying trillions.</p>
<p>For Op, or for anybody wanting to understand the US national debt, or any sovereign debt, it would be very helpful to forget all lending/borrowing metaphors from the individual consumer market. Nobody from the US government went to China and asked for a loan. That isn't how it works. A better model for understanding this is the buying and selling of stock/bonds on the open market, because that's a lot closer to the process. The US government offers the opportunity to purchase their debt on the open market, and many entities...other governments, banks, and individuals investors buy shares of this debt. Try to understand this less as a loan and more of an investment product, because that's how it functions in the global economy. Countries with crazy unstable currencies buy US treasury debt to stabilize their own currency. That's how stable it is. Much is made of China and other foreign powers owning our debt, but they hold less than 8%. And even though many countries own some of it, 65% is held by domestic institutions and individuals. The rate of return, which many call interest but is actually called &quot;yeild&quot; is rather low. It is low because it's literally the safest investment on the planet, and has never defaulted or failed to return at garanteed rates. Low risk, low return, but again, a garanteed rate of return. </p>
<p>So, for OP, you couldn't really &quot;pay it off&quot; immediately, even with a pile of cash equal to treasury notes outstanding. It would take years for the existing notes to come to term and be paid off, and then the government could refuse to issue any new notes. You could donate your money pile to the government and then ask them to put it in a special account to pay off notes as they expire rather than issue more...but you'd have no way to enforce that. You could buy all the notes on the open market currently and then donate them back to the government, but, again, you'd have no way to stop them from issuing new debt. You could offer to buy out individual owners of treasury notes, at some substantial margin over market value, and you'd probably get some takers, but again...even doing this, it wouldn't stop the government from new debt. And it shouldn't. Because as the previous poster notes, interconnected debt promotes global stability. Having a very stable currency that foreign countries can own a piece of stabilizes smaller and more volitile governments and economies. The national debt is, in many ways, a political bogeyman. It's used to undermine the spending priorities of the party in power. If we want to stabilize or lower the debt total, we have to do it over time via balanced or surplus budgets, instead of deficit spending. That's practical. Paying it off, or carying no debt whatsoever, really isn't.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, it's GOOD for the U.S. to have debt. Backed by taxpayers, the U.S. is one of the safest investments in the world. As long as we are able to continue paying interest on our debt, people will always invest in Treasury bonds.  This makes treasury bonds an important economic recovery tool. When the economy is doing well and you want to curb inflation, the U.S. can sell bonds and remove that money from the economy. When we're in a recession, the way you fix that is to spend money, so the government buys bonds back and gets that money into circulation again.</p>
<p>We <em>want</em> the U.S. to have debt. We never want to default on that debt, but having some debt is definitely a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

is actually a <em>good</em> thing? I'm having a hard time understanding. Also if its a good thing are there bad aspects to it? And if it is a <em>good</em> thing why isn't it understood by more people that way? Its seems to viewed infamously by everyone in the U.S as this massive problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other comments are describing debt being used as a way to finance the budget, not as an economic recovery tool as OP asked.</p>
<p>As you're probably aware, inflation is a thing, and the government has a inflation target it wishes to hit. Now inflation is linked to the interest rate because if interest rate is low, people borrow more and spend more and vice versa.</p>
<p>So, this where debt comes in. At its core, a debt or a bond is a <em>promise to pay</em>. In other words, the government takes your money and tells you they'll pay you back in a few years. So, by buying and selling to the bonds to the banks, they can control how much money is currently circulating in the market and hence affect the interest rate due to supply and demand.</p>
<p>To explain that in detail, let's say the ecomony's a bit slow, and the government wishes to give it a kick by lowering the interest rate. The government will buyback some bonds from the banks (that means paying back the banks some cash!). So all of a sudden, the banks have a lot of money on their hands. Being banks, they want to loan this money out and to compensate for this increased supply, they lower their interest rates to entice people to borrow and voila, the interest rate's down, people are spending more and the economy's successfully boosted.</p>
<p>To be honest there's very little 'bad' things about domestic debt. The government borrows money from its citizens and pays back the citizens with money it collected from the citizens. The money doesn't go anywhere and so it doesn't exactly tend to destroy the economy. International debt is a little more dangerous as when you pay interest, you're giving away assets to foreign countries. I'm not exactly an expert in the area though so I can't say whether the amount of debt the US is holding is a legitimate concern. As to why most people don't understand the use of debt, you can see that it's a somewhat complex topic that's hard to ELI5, so most people just go off what they know and equate it to personal debt, which they (correctly) know to be almost always undesirable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest explanation I've heard is that even if over the long term you plan to balance a budget - that is money going out = money coming in - the flows don't always happen at the same time.</p>
<p>If I build a bridge and plan to pay for it with tolls I collect over 20 years, how do I get they money to pay for it at the time of construction?</p>
<p>On the flip side, if I have a bunch of people putting money into their Federally run pension plan but a smaller number of them drawing on it, what do I do with the extra money?</p>
<p>The reason people think its bad (or it may be bad) is if we don't think about how we will pay for things - refer to the first example above - there is a chance that other financial commitments get disrupted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'm no expert but this is my general understanding based on some classes from college.</p>
<p>Most US debt is owned by investors, not countries. More US debt is owned by US citizens than by China (probably, maybe). Most investors are people like US citizens. That debt allows them a safe place to put their money and grow a little without worrying about, say, the stock market's ups and downs. It's not lucrative, but it is stable. So a good portfolio will have some of these investments just incase everything else goes bad.</p>
<p>Debt allows the government to spend more money than it would otherwise have. This means the government can buy and do more things. This employs more people, which generates more tax money, which hopefully is more than the interest payments on the debt. It gives people an income. It pays for nice things like medicare and highways. Government spending moves the economy upwards.</p>
<p>Or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turns out after certain world events Muslim folks don't always feel welcome in Paris or Disneyworld.</p>

<p>Not feeling like going into lots of detail, but this isn't even close to correct.  The big pivot for Dubai started well in advance of most of these and there are still a TON of Arabs who travel to these places on a regular basis.  Remember that the major Middle Eastern carriers (Qatar, Etihad, Emirates) started to transport people out for tourism (and in for labor) but grew into hubs so they could maximize the potential of those flights.  </p>
<p>Tourism, especially in Dubai, grew out of that.  I mean since people are flying through why not try and get them to stay for a separate vacation there?  Why fly to Paris for big brand shopping when you can A) get the people to come there to shop B) get the profit associated with the brand name shopping C) Tourism money.</p>
<p>Mix into that Dubai becoming a financial hub for the entire region.  All in all it was a wonderful phased approach.  Not without flaws, but still a well planned and executed concept.</p></div>		</li>
