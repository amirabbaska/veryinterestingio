			<div class="markdown"><p>Charge and spin are not the same. The fractional quantities you're referring to are simply electrical charge. All fermions (quarks and leptons included) have half integer spin (Â±1/2). The opposite would be bosons who have whole integer spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so i clearly don't understand fully what the spin 'means'. And i guess its also not that important to answer OP's question. But those fractional quantities are what OP asked about right? &quot;what subatomic particles are responsible for charge&quot;. The positive charge comes from the protons, which in turn get theirs from the composition of two upquarks, and one downquark? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin is an intrinsic element of angular momentum. It's as if the particle has a certain degree of actual rotation but it shouldn't be interpreted that way.</p>
<p>But yes, the +2/3 and -1/3 charges that up (and cousins) and down (and cousins) possess are the ones responsible for the overall charges of protons, neutrons, and other hadrons. Electrons (and cousins) have a charge of -1 and they can not be subdivided any further.</p>
<p>OP was more asking about &quot;why do even quarks have charge in the first place?&quot; To which there is no real answer. AFAWK, charge at an elementary level is fundamental and intrinsic and comes from nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And more importantly that I just realized you said, the up and down names have nothing to do with their spin either, that's just their names. The more energetic cousins, top+bottom and strange+charm have the same properties mentioned in my other reply but are called something else clearly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why an electron has - 1 charge, i do not know.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, no one knows why.</p></div>		</li>
