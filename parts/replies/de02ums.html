			<div class="markdown"><p>This is relevant because rotting food can contain the waste byproducts  of the bacteria that are eating the food. Even if you kill the bacteria, their waste will be left behind, and that waste can still make you sick- even if you cook it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know anything ever but that's how I'd picture it because they've developed for high temperatures and maybe aren't as specific to people. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the endospore is just a form bacteria take when conditions are poor. It is like hibernation in a sense, the bacteria is no longer growing or using energy in the endospore state. Under certain conditions which I don't fully remember, so I don't want to mislead you, but the same bacteria that entered the endospore, leaves it, and can now grow and reproduce as before. The genetic material from the bacteria goes into the endospore form and comes back out. </p></div>		</li>
