			<div class="markdown"><p>Males are (in most cases) simply gene delivery systems; other than the penis they really serve no life function. Take honeybees for example. The hive is  almost exclusively female worker bees, only a few male drones are kept on supply incase the queen dies and they need to quickly get back up and running. A virgin queen will make one mating flight, the drones will follow her out and mate with her mid air, they die in the process. But most of the time the drones aren't needed, all they do is eat the fruits of the labor of the workers, they can't defend the hive (no stinger) and they are essentially dead weight. When the winter comes the female works drag the male drones out of tje hive, rip their wings off, and cast them aside. They never served their purpose so why keep them alive? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, drones most likely won't be fertilizing a queen from the same hive. The new queen will fly in a different direction from the drones from her hive, so that inbreeding is minimized. The queens then go on to mate with multiple drones, so that they can introduce more genetic diversity into their new hive. Also, when queens are laying eggs, they can choose the gender of the egg by fertilizing it or not. Gender is chosen by measuring the size of the cell that the egg is laid into; drones are physically much larger than workers, so they need to have larger cells to grow in. And while there are significantly less drones than workers, there usually are still a lot of drones in a hive. If you start seeing too many drones in a hive, however, it can be a sign that the queen has been replaced by a 'laying worker'. Since workers have never mated, they can only lay unfertilized eggs, which hatch as drones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The worker bees are also just there to serve the hive/queen. Who – in the end – is just propagating her genes. Every living thing is just „serving“ its genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All that is required evolutionarily speaking is that it happened by random chance once upon a time and worked well enough to pass on the genes long enough that it &quot;stuck&quot; so to speak. Of course this is a vastly dumbed down run over. </p>
<p>Evolution is rather clumsy if you think about it. Things just kind of mutate,  and if they work okay they live,  at least awhile. If they don't they die before they can pass on their genes and fade into oblivion.</p></div>		</li>
