			<div class="markdown"><p>I think to clarify for some people who may misunderstand the second-to-last paragraph, but &quot;you&quot; was the formal second person, while thee/thou was the informal second person. In isolated groups, such as the Amish or German Baptists, who still practice an older English speaking style, they will use thee and thou with children and friends, and only you for formality. So in the KJV, when &quot;you&quot; is seen, this is a formal statement, but when thee and thou are used, and can be seen often in the context of someone speaking or praying to God, this is actually a statement of intimacy (as in closeness, like with a friend), rather than speaking formally to a ruler or someone with higher stature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Amish don't speak an older English style, they speak a German dialect. I'm not sure who the German Baptists are (Anabaptists?) but it's probably the same.</p>
<p>Maybe you're thinking of Quakers, who use &quot;thou&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Amish and German Baptists are both descended from the Anabaptists. As far as being mixed up with the quakers, you may be right, but I thought it was the Anabaptist descendant groups. I'll have to double check and make sure I'm remembering correctly. So for those reading this far, assume the comment above this is correct until I have time to fact check myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Umm, I never said I was trying to clarify what was plural and what was singular. And neither was the original comment. It was about formal vs informal. That'd be like talking about artistic styles, and someone clarifies the difference between expressionism and impressionism, and then you saying that it doesn't clarify because it doesn't address the difference in color usage. It's non sequitur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little nit-picking here (I hope I didn't misunderstand your explanation), but &quot;thou&quot; was actually the informal and &quot;you&quot; was the formal 2nd person pronoun. You would never have addressed a monarch with &quot;Thy majesty&quot;, but &quot;Your majesty&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes you're absolutely right! There are quite a few letters between British royalty who wrote perfectly nice letters and looking back you'd think:&quot; oh what a nice letter!&quot;. Looking at the used pronouns reveals that this letter was used as a jab loaded with disrespect, since (as you correctly pointed out) the thou was the informal and therefore impolite way of addressing a monarch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add a polite little nitpick, too - &quot;thou&quot; wasn't only used in Old English. It was used in modern English as well but the word and its use gradually died out.</p>
<p>Old English is an entirely separate language from Modern English and is considered harder to learn than German.</p>
<p>(I'm sure I got part of this wrong and someone will come to correct me.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old English is still linguistically English, not a separate language like German or Chinese. It directly led to Middle then Modern English. It's difficult because of vocabulary, spelling, some grammar and alphabet (thorn, etc). But we still inherited words, basic grammar, and geography. </p>
<p>EDIT: Also I think it's not accurate to compare Old English to modern German. Over time languages have become more regular and simplified as people have made efforts at mass literacy. Now if you compare learning the English of 1,000 years ago to the German of the same time or to Medieval Latin you have a more direct comparison. I.e. hard to learn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh you're absolutely right. I was grossly simplifying the use of &quot;thou&quot;. No language is really harder to learn than any other (for children growing up with that language).</p>
<p>I mean sure relation between the languages help a whole bunch for adult speakers. English for a German native speaker is easier to learn than say japanese or Nahuatl. Sharing many sounds, morphological and grammatical features, similar distinction when it comes to pronouns or prepositions etc. helps. Having heard, read, and spoken Old English however, I can say it surely would have been easier to learn for me as a native German speaker. It's closer in pronunciation and syntax to German than today's English and the whole writing system isn't as fucked as it is today!</p></div>		</li>
