			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding that it's not cortisol, but surfactant secreted by the baby that initiates labor once the baby's lungs are formed. Here is one source but there are newer studies confirming this as well: <a href="http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/news-releases/year-2004/fetal-lungs-provide-a-signal-initiating-labor-ut-southwestern-researchers-find.html" target="_blank">http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/news-releases/year-2004/fetal-lungs-provide-a-signal-initiating-labor-ut-southwestern-researchers-find.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. The fetus cannot produce any cortisol until the pituitary is developed (a hormone-producing part of your brain and one of the last systems to form). So once the pituitary is developed, it can release a hormone called ACTH that allows for cortisol production by the adrenal gland. So while a highly stressful event can indeed initiate labor, it could not happen until the pregnancy was already near to term. This explains why several comments and expressing anecdotes of early labor from stress, but all within a month or so of their due date. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. That is why trauma of any sort can cause a premature labor. Also high levels of stress can make the fetus react to the cortisol produced by the mother and induce premature labor. Fortunately we have some medications that can delay labor but only if it is done before a certain point in the labor process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Certain activities like riding roller coasters and water slides can induce labor. </p></div>		</li>
