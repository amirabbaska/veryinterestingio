			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for microbes, but last I checked, warm water increased the permeability of the skin, leaving it slightly more susceptible to chemicals on the skin. So in a chemistry lab where I work, for example, it makes more sense to wash hands with cold water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opposite is true for the oils from poison ivy for example, where it will emusify with warm water and soap. You want to rinse that off with cold water and no soap.</p>
<p>Edit : apparently cold water is good, but you do need to use soap and a rag as well, to get it off your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warm to hot water makes grease/fats easier to remove, which makes it easier to remove bacteria. Of course, you can also prescrub or soak your dishes in water immediately after using them, which will loosen the same stuff compared to its dry state. </p>
<p>Its more important that you use a good amount of soap, rinse thoroughly, and get all surfaces of the dish object than the water temp however.</p>
<p>A fair number of elderly either get lazy or convince themselves that rinsing without soap = good enough, or a quick scrub without soap under water = good enough. That's not good for long term health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't stick really hot pans in water if you want them to stay flat though.  Allow them to cool until they can be touched then hit the water.  Shocking them in cold water when really hot will warp them.  My favorite skillet was ruined by a well meaning relative this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  I always figured that the lower viscosity of hotter water combined with the ability of soap to dissolve better in hotter water would improve its ability to get hands clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a hospice volunteer training course, basic hand washing was covered for a few hours, they went as far as having us dip out hands in invisible ink type liquid, only visible under a blacklight. They then told us to go wash out hands, checking as we came back. After that they told us that 'singing two verses of the happy birthday song' was about the recommended time for it.</p>
<p>25 seconds isn't a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just looked up the viscosity of water with respect to temperature: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity#Water" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity#Water</a></p>
<p>Cold tap water at 50F/10C water has a viscosity of 1.3 mPa*s, tepid 70F/20C water has a viscosity of 1, and hot 105F/40C water has a viscosity of 0.65. I had no idea there was such a huge change!</p>
<p>Why isn't this doubling of viscosity more evident in my experiences? I would have expected this change to make, say, draining a bottle of cold water and draining a bottle of hot water take vastly different times.  What experiments can I do to verify this change?</p></div>		</li>
