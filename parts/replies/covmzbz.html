			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, basically this. I'm in the UK, and there is a train bridge near me. 100+ pigeons live underneath it, in the crevices where the bridge meets it's supports. I see dead pigeons all the time, but their bodies do not last long in an urban environment, due to the fact that a dead pigeon is a) going to get cleaned by the government within a week at the most and b) dead pigeons are free food for animals. I see a lot of foxes near that bridge.</p>
<p>I've also seen broken eggs, and most excitingly, if someone doesn't come by every week to clean up the bird shit, it gets slippery to walk under the bridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah where i am in the UK a lot of buildings in town centres are usually 3 floors tall. The ground floor is the shop front and the floor above is storage. Above those floors is nothing but empty run down space. My friend from high school had parents who owned a business. He took me to the roof one day and the top floor was scattered with bird shit and pigeon carcasses. Its like they just perch up on a beam and wait for death then plonk to the floor. Its like some animals know when death is coming and go off out of the way and with no fuss to die. </p>
<p>I also have a farmer friend who had working dogs. He has had a few dogs that he said just ran off and hid and he would find they had passed away under vehicles or corners of a field.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure that a lot of animals pay for any food at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback onto this comment, pigeons are incredibly smart but also incredibly stupid. There's a flock that's always near this one bus stop I use to go to school. On the one hand, you can walk between them and they won't give a shit. They even step aside for people they know sometimes. On the other hand, one of them literally got crushed by a car because he didn't move when it drove onto him. </p>
<p>Also, I don't think you've ever seen a dead pigeon in New York because they're not good for business. And there's a lot of business in New York. You see a dead pigeon in front of your store, what do you do? Obviously clean that shit up. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, not entirely sure about that.</p>
<p>Other things not good for business: dog piss, dog shit, hobo piss, garbage, post-pub-crawl-body-fluids, more garbage. Yet you see piles of that stuff on every NYC sidewalk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Predators/scavengers can also play a part in clearing up after dead animals. Not sure about NYC but London has a significant urban fox population. Plus birds of prey. Coincidentally, I saw a dead pigeon under a bench in the main street where I live a the weekend and a street cleaner cam and cleared it away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NYC also has a large brown rat population. Brown rats, unlike black rats (herbivore) are omnivorous scavengers and will definitely eat anything including dead pigeons.
Source: I have a fancy rat (domestic brown rat) and she likes chicken. </p></div>		</li>
