			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in a system where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-integer_representation#Base_%CF%80" target="_blank">Pi is the base</a>, 1 Pi would be a &quot;whole number&quot;.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: we only use the &quot;base-10&quot; numbering system because from our perspective--based on our fingers-- 10 is a &quot;round number.&quot; The Sumerians instead counted up to 12, and had a preference for base-60 (5*12). Thus, the usage of 360° for a circle, which is the closest to the year in base-60, as well as dividing equally in base-12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes— although it was actual Sumerians who originated a Sexagesimal number system, which passed onto the Egyptians. But why do you think they chose 360 to equate to a circle? Because mathematically, it is close to a year, and sub-divisible into 12 periods of 30 days — which is why <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-day_calendar" target="_blank">many ancient calendar had 360 days, of 12 months</a>, and why we still use 12 months in the modern Western world.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-02/who-determined-circle-should-be-divided-360-degrees" target="_blank">Popular Science</a>, &quot;Who determined that a circle should be divided into 360 degrees?&quot; (Feb 5, 2002):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The same people who invented the wheel about 6,000 years ago: the Mesopotamians, who loved the number 60. It's a useful and easily divisible number, which made it ideal for both early mathematics and commercial trade. <strong>The Mesopotamians passed their base-60 numerical system to the ancient Egyptians, who used it to divide a circle into 360 degrees</strong>, Mary Blocksma writes in her book Reading the Numbers.</p>
<p>The 360-degree circle worked out great: The Egyptians loved perfect triangles, and exactly six of them fit into a circle. Therefore, six triangular slices of 60 degrees each made for a sensible 360-degree dissection of a circle. <strong>The Egyptians, who invented the degree symbol, also came up with the first calendar based on a 360-day year, which is only off by 5.25 days</strong>. Since then, the 360-degree circle has more than stood the test of time, it has made its mark on time itself: When time was first recorded on the face of a circle, it was an easy leap to divide hours into 60 minutes and minutes into 60 seconds.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pi is an irrational number. Irrational numbers are all the numbers that can't be written as a fraction of two whole numbers. That also means their decimal representation is always endless. (if it ended, i could just rewrite the decimal as a fraction, so 2.222 could be rewritten as 2222/1000 for example.)</p>
<p>In order to find a base where the decimal representation of pi terminates, you would need to find a base where pi can be written as a fraction of whole numbers. you can see that any whole number won't work as the base. If there were one where you could write pi as a fraction then you could just convert the numerator and denominator of the fraction to base 10, but we already know that no such fraction exists in base 10.</p></div>		</li>
