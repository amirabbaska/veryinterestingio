			<div class="markdown"><p>does the lower pressure not also mean that more CO2 &quot;wants&quot; to bubble out, so the relative dissolvement rate is higher? jeez that sounds stupid, what i want to say is &quot;if th epressure is lower, shouldnt that also mean that more CO2 can bubble, hence making the drink have a longer bubblyness? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To highly carbonate a beverage, you have to push high pressure gas into it. You can think of this like charging a battery. You can only push so much CO2 into a bottle of soda. Once you crack the seal, the CO2 that was &quot;charged&quot; into the system will start leaving. </p>
<p>With carbonation, bubbling means that the CO2 is leaving the solution. Once the pressure gets lower than inside the bottle, the gas starts leaving the solution. It's the same thing as with salt or sugar, but instead forming a solid powder in the liquid, it forms a bubble. Once the bubble makes its way to the atmosphere, that CO2 won't go back in without more pressure.</p>
<p>So, let's say I open a bottle of soda at high elevation and low elevation at the same exact time. The high elevation soda will be more bubbly, but will bubble out and go flat faster. The low elevation soda will be less bubbly, but will stay bubbly for longer.</p></div>		</li>
