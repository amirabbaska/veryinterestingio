			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP was more saying that the appliances are going to be wasting energy via some of the energy they use ending up as heat no matter what you do, so in the winter, they contribute (however slightly) to heating your home, and thus, there is no 'waste' at all, making them 100% efficient because every single bit of energy that goes into them gets used in some useful way. If your TV uses X amount of energy and 95% of that goes to powering the screen and speakers and such, but 5% of that energy ends up as waste heat, then its only 95% efficient. But, during the winter, that 5% that ends up as heat will contribute towards the overall heating of your home, thus meaning that it isnt 'wasted' energy because it still serves a useful purpose and therefore, since 95% of the energy that goes into the TV is useful in powering the screen and such, and 5% is useful in that it add a tiny bit of heat to your home, and thus your HVAC has to do a tiny bit less work, it is 100% efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again,the point is not that your pc was enough to heat the room, its that the heat applied to the room by the pc lowered the total burden necessary to heat by the furnace. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the tempurature you have the house. The wattage output if a typical house hold appliance, if left unchecked, in a sealed room. Would continuously heat it to the output wattage of the appliance. So I wouldn't say perfectly efficient because they also are not designed to spread the heat out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to look at it is electric = 100% efficient all the time</p>
<p>it doesn't get wasted like gas/oil/propane would waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat beside the point, but air source heat pumps are quickly replacing oil in Alaska. Even in very cold weather, heat pump efficiency is about 3-4 times more heat for your watt than resistive electric. </p>
<p>The last 5 years or so have seen it become the best heat source in my area. No new buildings are built without a bank of heat pumps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this considering the common HVAC system option of periodically engaging the fan to circulate air and average out hot/cold spots?</p>
<p>This setting is usually recommended to save energy, especially on setups with a single central thermostat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And running ceiling fans year round. In most homes that can provide a significant energy saving. There's a reason they have warm and cold weather modes.</p>
<p>It does make the point generated heat more useful, but still nothing like intentionally generated. Your oven makes a lot of heat, but without exhausting it efficiently into the air flow you use up a lot of it warming the walls and countertops eventually finding its way out of the home without ever making you more comfortable. The refrigerator surrounds itself in a pocket of heat, causing it to need to cycle more often. So yes, circulation does help, but things not intended to provide heat to your home generally don't put it into an area where that circulation can access it well.</p></div>		</li>
