			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of it, because society spent much of the last 30 years convincing everyone that they had to go to college while simultaneously mocking stay at home moms you saw a trend of two people going to college, meeting while preparing for a career, then getting married and starting to work. At that point, you are both left to decide which one of you can afford to stop working when you have kids and are hit square in the face with the reality that both of your lives would be a lot easier if ONE of you was home (stay at home dads can do exactly the same thing, not to mention get into projects around the house to add more value...but as a society we have to realize that a huge number of women find men who don't want jobs unattractive while the reverse is often not the case).</p>
<p>The problem becomes more difficult to fix not only because you both have invested yourselves in your careers, but because in many cases you took on debt to do it with the intention of paying it off over 20 years. When you want to stop working 5-8 years in...that is a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I hate how people look down on stay-at-home parenting. Just because you don't take home a paycheck doesn't mean you aren't creating a great deal of valuable contributions. My husband is a stay-at-home dad and it's a wonderful arrangement for our family. We eat a lot healthier, our home is well cared for, we actually have time to spend together, he is active in the community, our daughter is well prepared to start school because he works with her everyday. It's difficult to monetize the value of stay-at-home parenting though, so people, even young people in our generation still are biased against him 'not working'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the issue is that people who mock it don't really understand how damn hard and time consuming it is. Unless you park your kids in front of the television and give them microwave meals all day long, it takes alot of effort. I would argue that it is just as exhausting if not more so than a regular job.</p>
<p>Source: took a few weeks off to stay at home with the kids, was exhausted.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think of it this way, would you rather raise your kids? Or have them raised by strangers at a daycare. </p>
<p>Even beyond that, there is a HUGE advantage to a child starting school literate because one parent had the time to spend with them reading and teaching. So many kids start school with nothing and enter the race already well behind their peers, and that's a disadvantage that can stick with them for their entire educational career.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, plus not only were stay at home moms mocked, but I think that the trend away from doing that left many stranded alone all day without other adult company.  My grandmother and her sisters all lived near each other and did things together.  That's actually true of BOTH of my grandmothers, although one great-aunt moved away early.  (They were raising kids in the rural south in the 50s and 60s.)  They had some community that way.  But if you move away from your hometown (or never had one), and you live in a city where most other parents are working, it can be harder to find a support network.  Even if you do make other parent-friends, I think it's never going to be the same kind of community that was once enjoyed &quot;back in the day.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very attractive to see a person pursuing their skills and interests.  I've known a few men who really enjoyed running a household, and had a real talent for doing it.  They're popular, and their confidence is really attractive.  It's harder to do with student loans, but it's possible with a side income.  One I know ran a daycare, and another did taxes.</p>
<p>Boys do get hit with less social programming pushing them to take cooking and cleaning as hobbies.  So, there are many men who don't start with the skills or interests to be happy in the housekeeping job. That can change though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this book for a sociology course in school. The greatest thing I pulled from it was the importance of buying a house you could afford on one income. The knowledge that our house won't get foreclosed on if I were to lose my job is worth not having a huge expensive house. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 2007 the bankers wanted to give us a 250k loan even though my wife was a first year teacher with no contract (not a guaranteed job the next year.) And I was going to school part time and working manual labor.  We made an offer on something much less just in case she didn't get the contract the next year. It was a smart idea and now it's an income property.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last summer we were looking to sell our current home 10 miles north of Seattle and move into another one.  Our lender was willing to loan us 600K (&quot;if you need more we can talk&quot;) on top of the 250K we owed on our current home (we bought in 2011 when the market was still kaput).  Insanity!  There's no way we could have realistically afforded 850K in mortgage payments, and 600+ after our current home was sold would have made us very, very house poor.  We ended up not moving after the housing market in our area took off to 2007 bubble prices once again.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well of course, because they were betting you would not pay it back so they can make more money. Your down payment goes into their bank and then you leave the house. Someone else buys it and they hope they can't afford it and have to default too. They found that's how they make money. Oh then there are all those fees too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I sat there amazed and also bummed that living in SoCal I can never own a home without being riddled with anxiety due to the stress of my monthly payment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still doable in San Jose, or at least it was, until just a couple years back.</p>
<p>My wife and I bought our first home with pricing based on surviving with one income. We had to fight tooth and nail with our realtor to keep her in the price range we wanted. She pulled every trick in the book, including everything from showing us horrible stuff in the price range we asked for, all the way to showing us wonderful dream homes in a range which would demand both of our incomes.</p>
<p>My wife was exceptional at querying real estate online. She found a number of websites, including redfin, and searched day in and day out for weeks, and on weekends we would visit the high lights. We must have gone to thirty open houses in a five weeks In the end, we succeeded, getting something such that if either of us was unemployed, we could live indefinitely anyway, and even comfortable as long as the unemployed half was received unemployment income.</p>
<p>The system is rigged against us. We think that banks are doing us a favor by giving us loans with lower and lower downpayments, but it is quite the opposite. It brings the number of buyers for homes up, because you don't even have to save any cash up anymore. With the additional demand comes a supply issue. And the correction in that equation for the time being has become a price spike. Add in the dual income factor, and homes which were worth only $150K fifteen years ago are worth nearly $1M today.</p>
<p>The quickest, most painful-but-correct solution is to require 20% down to buy a home. The number of buyers in the market would plummet, and home costs would fall to more practical levels.</p></div>		</li>

Warren in particular (if I recall correctly) has argued that the middle-class need to move to the &quot;best&quot; available communities and schools has basically led to so many people moving to homes they can't afford and resulted in a middle-class standard of living which can't sustain itself without two incomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious if we need to have 2 incomes or we want 2 incomes. </p>
<p>I recently had a kid, I'm an apprentice electrician making ok money. The wife is in administration making ok money. I can definitely support our family alone but we are currently renting a house so we chose for her to go back to work to help save for the down payment. </p>
<p>Doing my budget with me working alone. We would be able to afford a lower end rent/mortgage, car payments/insurance for one vehicle, food, cable, utilities, resp for the kid and minimal rrsps for us. And I still have a long way to climb in my field. </p>
<p>I was thinking what would kill you is trying to live like you're both working. 2 cars and a more expensive home. Neither of which are a necessity. </p></div>		</li>
