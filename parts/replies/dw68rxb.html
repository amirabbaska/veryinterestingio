			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the worst. I am dealing with this right now sadly, but I usually get hit with it right after feeling good about finishing the first list of things. There's a brief moment of joy followed by a devastating crash when I look at Jira and it hits that I have to start over on something else. It's like Sisyphus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If you can learn to overcome the dread by blocking out the thought or however else, you'll feel better and get more done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then we love you and sympathize with you. Take 15 minutes without worrying about the paper, just ignore it and do whatever you want. After all, you’ll end up doing that anyway, except you’ll be stressing out and worrying and not fully enjoying what you’re doing. Let yourself have time to watch 1 YouTube video, 1 episode of a show, read 1 chapter of a book, whatever floats your boat.</p>
<p>And then get back to work, knowing that in another hour and a half you’ll let yourself do it again. But only if you finish that paper first. </p>
<p>(You’ve got this dude!)</p>
<p>Edit: half a page left, not half a page written. Makes it a whole lot less bleak! I still stand by my advice though</p></div>		</li>
