			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree, except that the difference in color is from the variation in surface shear flow direction, not temperature gradient. Chocolate doesn't turn different colors depending on how fast it cools, but variation in the orientation of chocolate particles would definitely do it. Rheoscopic fluid would be an excellent example of this effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chocolate can have different appearances and crystaline structures forming depending on what temperature it was heated to, sometimes changing within a degree or two. There might be some variation on the temperature of the poured chocolate from each nozzle creating appearance variation. There's a even a cooking process called 'tempering' where chocolate is heated to a specific temperature in order to create a shiny appearance. If this is happening, it's not the kind of thing you can tell from a photo, but I don't think it can be ruled out entirely. <a href="http://www.finecooking.com/articles/food-science-why-temper-chocolate.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.finecooking.com/articles/food-science-why-temper-chocolate.aspx</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of tempering isn't chocolatier standards but my understanding is that it is basically pretty straight forward after you have a little bit of the crystalline structure you want.</p>

<p>Moreover I recall, but can't find, that there is actually a very limited number of crystalline structures and they actually vary quite a bit. As such if you saw chocolate that was improperly tempered it's not &quot;close&quot; to store bought chocolate its completely separate look, texture and feel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, and another reason to temper chocolate is if you want to mold it: the Î² crystals are denser than the liquid, so the chocolate shrinks upon setting, making it fall out of the mold. Incorrectly tempered chocolate just doesn't demold properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but can it form different structures at different rates of cooling? </p>
<p>If this was a discrepancy between the temperatures at different nozzles we would expect to see entire cells having different shades instead of what we do see which is differences at the boaders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be that the chocolate actually has different thickness in different regions of the cell?  It is applied, then it spreads out.  As it spreads, it thins, and thus yields a lighter appearance.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation makes a lot of sense when you think about other viscous fluids that flow from an injection point, such as injection molded plastic which forms weld lines where flow fronts meet and they are often quite visible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has more to do with packing efficiency. Notice that there are never honeycomb cells that extend asymmetrically like you see in Voronoi diagrams?</p></div>		</li>
