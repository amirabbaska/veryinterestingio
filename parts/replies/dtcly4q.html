			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the LTE signal isn’t available so you are connected to whatever your network calls “4g”</p>
<p>It’s slower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they are different signals and therefore different speeds.</p>
<p>&quot;4G&quot; is basically a marketing label. It's faster than 3G, but is similar in signal.</p>
<p>&quot;4G LTE&quot; is a generation better in signal. It's much faster, and also significantly different than the older generation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>T mobile, for one, has upgraded their 3G signal to 4G, despite it not being really any faster. So my phone goes 2G -&gt; 4G -&gt; 4GLTE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have that backwards. 4G is the ITU standard, LTE is the method in which phone providers are trying to meet that standard. LTE stands for Long-Term-Evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah he's right. I worked at VZW for 9 years.  Verizon was really huffy when ATT and company started saying they made their iPhone 4s &quot;4G&quot; when it wasn't actual 4G/LTE.  They got away with calling it 4G because it was a brand, since the G literally stands for &quot;Generation&quot;. What they'd done was literally just turn the dial up on their HSPA EG like overclocking a processor (it's not technically newer or faster but you can stretch out its performance) and thus they got HSPA+.  Thus, for their marketing purposes, 3rd gen speeds became 4th gen speeds and they got to say they had 4G speeds (really more like 3G+).</p>
<p>LTE does stand for Long Term Evolution, because that bandwidth is much more efficient and capable of vast improvements overtime but that name isn't just an informal description of the process, as it is an actual name given to that technology and the frequency upon which it was founded.  It's just a slightly romanticized name.</p>
<p>So long story short, 4G is a name for speeds faster than those we saw in 3G, but LTE was the official name that that frequency/technology had been given before AT&amp;T bastardized the whole point with marketing ploys.</p>
<p>Side Note, they are working on 5G (speeds up to or over 1gb/s) and testing it in select markets already, and so far I haven't heard of it being given any special name.  Ultimately, these companies are going to use verbiage that makes them sound better in their marketing anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, 4G is literally an ITU standard requiring 100Mbps throughput. IMT-2020 (5G) standards are 10Gbps per connection. You are correct that HSPA isn't truly 4G. Both LTE and WiMax are the technologies used to try to meet the standards. As a communications engineer for cellular systems, I am telling you that you do not fully understand what you are talking about</p></div>		</li>
