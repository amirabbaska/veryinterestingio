			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who was a lazy person all my life, got healthy and am now lazy again, I don't think it's specific to a person. I remember feeling the urge to get to the gym or to ride my bike etc.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what it is, but I vaguely remember reading something about it being tied to the reward centers in the brain. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was that, at some point, you actually get a reward for doing your workout, so yes.. in a way it is like an addiction (e.g. giving your body caffeine when you crave it) and you are rewarded similarly so you actually crave doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I was about to say. Your brain is likely &quot;addicted&quot; to the endorphins and good shit you get from exercising, so it tries to make you feed its &quot;addiction&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say I'm addicted, actually my exercise pattern is highly irregular. So maybe that's a bit confusing for my brain</p></div>		</li>
