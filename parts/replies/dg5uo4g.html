<p>slow down or walk, lean over and take 3 huge breathes.</p>

<p>Never tried that, because... who the fuck walks? amirite? But what always worked for me was changing my breathing pattern and putting my hands on the top/back of my head. </p>
<p>Actually thats a lie, it didn't <em>always</em> work but it did most of the time. If not, well.. just get a straw (so you can suck it up). </p>
<p>I also heard that bending over was bad, and thats why they taught us to put our hands on our heads instead. Idk how true that is, but thats how they do it in the Marine Corps. </p></div>		</li>
