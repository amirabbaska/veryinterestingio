			<div class="markdown"><p>Killer whales target newborn whales and chase them until they drown from exhaustion, or until the parent is too tired to protect the young one. At which point they drown the baby. Saw a horrific doc on it, and I felt so sad for the baby. The mom gave up because she realized she had to give in, and could mate again soon anyway. She was trying to keep the baby at the surface to breath but it was a losing battle.</p>
<p>Killer whales are vicious and amazingly smart beasts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a guess but since dolphins usually only give birth to one baby (what are baby dolphins called? calf?) and they're pregnant for well over a year (depending on the species), unless something is wrong with the baby right off the bat, it's probably in their best interest to not let the baby drown. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are all live birth sea creatures inherently social?  If so is this part of the core trait?  It certainly makes sense that outcomes in sensitive birth situations will be dramatically improved in social groups.  I wonder which came first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And by social, I mean livebearing fish do one of three things as adults: eating, sleeping, and making babies </p></div>		</li>
