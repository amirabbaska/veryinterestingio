<p>That's true, but not the whole story. The question is, if the sun had been hotter or cooler, i.e. emitted more UV or IR than &quot;visible light&quot;, would life have evolved to become sensitive to that part of the spectrum instead? I don't think so. One issue is that UV is so energetic that it damages living things, while IR is probably too low in energy for the electrochemical processes that mediate vision (as we know it). Another issue is the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png/1024px-Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png" target="_blank">absorption curve of water</a>, life's valuable and abundant substance. It blocks the more dangerous parts of UV, and also IR, but is conveniently transparent around the visible range. So, quite a few things turned out to be &quot;just right&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm always bemused on SF shows when human explorers find a new planet and networks of lights on the ground prove someone is home. </p>
<p>In reality, there may be no overlap at all between alien sight and human sight.</p>
<p>For example - some extra UV is just as likely to lead to increased rates of mutation and evolution as to make life impossible.</p>
<p>With big enough &quot;eyes&quot;, presumably on a low gravity planet, it would be possible to &quot;see&quot; RF. (And so on.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Citation, please. Humans can actually see IR, too, under special conditions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" target="_blank">see first sentence here</a>). But it's better to call that NIR (near-infrared, the part adjacent to visible red), because IR is a huge range of the spectrum. As far as I know, there are no animals that can see IR other than a bit of NIR, like humans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>insects and some animals can see UV</p>

<p>Some fish, too. But again, that's UVA, the part immediately next to our visible range. UVA actually penetrates water better than NIR or even visible red (see the absorption curve), which is why underwater photos tend to lack red and have a greenish/bluish tint without correction.</p>
<p>Maybe some animals can also see a tiny bit of UVB, the part of UV that some animals including us need for vitamin D synthesis, and that causes tanning and sunburns. But definitely not UVC and shorter wavelengths, as those cause severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_DNA_damage" target="_blank">damage</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It pretty much is universal for sight on Earth, with a bit of wiggle room to either side, but not much.<br />
As for other planets, who can say... but if you knew the star's output and the composition of the planet's atmosphere, you could probably make a good guess. And if life there was water-based, its visible range would likely be similar to ours, because of the physical facts.</p>

<p>That's why I wrote &quot;vision (as we know it)&quot;. Radio waves are far too low in energy to activate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opsin" target="_blank">opsins</a> that convert light to nerve signals. There is no actual IR opsin. Again, if you have any sources that say otherwise, please tell me.</p></div>		</li>
