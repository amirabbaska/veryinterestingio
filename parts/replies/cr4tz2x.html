<p>It would depend on the rate of animal matter making it into sedimentary rock</p>

<p>Plant matter too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world's total future and historical unproven reserves of oil is approximately 2.5 trillion barrels. (+/- 1 trillion). The age of the oil is almost all under 350mya.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reserves are the amount of technically and economically recoverable fossil fuels, not total existing. And some of the fossil fuels that had originally been trapped should have been lost due to the various processes the sedimentary rock has undergone since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put that in perspective, even if it's the upper limit of 700,000 (less than a million) barrels a year, we use 31,025,000,000 (31 billion) barrels a year.  We're using oil over 4000 times faster than it's being deposited.</p>
<p>In 70 years we will probably have used most of earth's easily available oil and earth isn't making more.  And we will have destroyed the planet in the process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, that long? I thought it was imminent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if it were 700,000 bbl/year, that would work out to about 29,400,000 gallons of oil per year. Compare that with the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthhowmuch.html" target="_blank">volume of water on earth</a> (1.386 billion cubic kilometers), or (if WolframAlpha has it right) 3.66 x 10^20 gallons, or about 13 orders of magnitude in difference.</p>
<p>I imagine if we wanted to look at it from a weight standpoint, I could calculate the weight of the Earth's crust and see how that compares as well.</p></div>		</li>
