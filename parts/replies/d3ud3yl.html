			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;no way&quot;, just difficult for us to do. A solar panel converts photons to electric power which can charge a battery. The mass of that battery increases slightly because it's potential energy has increased. Not enough to be useful or even measured, but it still increases. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, does that mean that a ball at the top of a ramp has more mass than the same ball placed at the bottom of a ramp? That makes no sense to me... but then, &quot;potential energy&quot; has never made sense to me; QM is easier for me to understand. :-/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can incite the creation of massive particle-antiparticle pair, for example gamma+gamma --&gt; e^(+) e^(-). This would require that the energy of the photons is sufficiently high, 2 m<em><em>e</em></em>. Visible light has en energy of about 1.2 eV, the mass of an electron is 0.501 MeV (the mass of an electron pair is close to 1 MeV = 10^(6) eV) - our daylight will never be transformed into massive particles.</p>
<p>Electron are the lightest stable particles that can be created via pair-production, so light would require even more energy to create quarks (components of protons and neutrons).</p>
<p>Edit: [an example of pair production in diagram form. The two photons find each other, interact somehow and out come an electron and a positron.] (<a href="http://astroph.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/photopairprod.png" target="_blank">http://astroph.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/photopairprod.png</a>)</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, this can't happen without the photon interacting with something else first, otherwise you could construct a reference frame where the photon doesn't have enough energy to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is spontaneous pair production from accelerated nuclei ever observed through their interaction with lower energy photons?  Or is this situation not equivalent to the one described above?</p></div>		</li>
