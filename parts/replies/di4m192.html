			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that within the Russian Federation there is a large Muslim population outside of the Caucuses region (Chechnya, Dagestan, etc.): <a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-kul-sharif-mosque-in-kazan-kremlin-at-sunset-kazan-russia-140223031.jpg" target="_blank">Tatarstan</a> and <a href="http://brownbooktv.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/MG_8698.jpg" target="_blank">Bashkortstan</a> are two large regions (a population of 8 million between the two) with an almost 50%/50% Muslim/Orthodox population and basically zero history of conflict between them.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the simplest, and most accurate answer I've read so far.  All this horseshit about Pashtunwali is really just an agitator - not a cause.  The bottom line is a weak central government, lack of infrastructure, and decades upon decades of war provide a fertile ground for this.  The former soviet republics have both national identities and infrastructures that make them less attractive for this than numerous places acrosss Afghanistan.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally! I had to scroll for too long to reach this level of accuracy and conciseness.</p>
<p>Ultimately it was the US funding and arming extremists that kept Afghanistan from being absorbed by the USSR and is the primary reason it is a hotbed for extremism today. If Afghanistan had been absorbed into the union, the communist gov would certainly have stamped out any Muslim extremism like they did (mostly) elsewhere in the union, and Afghanistan today would certainly be much more akin to the other countries mentioned by OP. </p></div>		</li>
