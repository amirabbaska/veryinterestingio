			<div class="markdown"><p>This does mean the ENTIRE power output of the engine goes into heat and pressure of the tranny fluid.  The tranny cannot sustain this for long.</p>
<p>If it's a manual, a skilled operator will be using the clutch until the wheels sync up with the engine.  If the wheels are locked, that won't happen.  In a short time the clutch pad will start burning up, it's stuck in a &quot;rubbing&quot; state and never locking into sync.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's just a dynamic that happens due to reversing loads and play in the drivetrain. if you dump the clutch and you don't have enough throttle applied, the car drags the engine speed down, as the engine speed drops, torque increases (same throttle opening, lower speed means more air per cycle), the engine then tries to pull the car back into motion. When that happens, a reversal of force happens in the drivetrain, which means that theres a brief point of free rotation between the wheels and the engine, due to all of the CV joints, U-joints, differentials in the driveline. When it takes up all that slack, there is suddenly a large change in force from the engine which jerks the car forward. The same happens on the upper side, after the car jerks forward, the speed of the wheels out-paces the engine and the torque reverses again, causing that sudden jerk backward. The clutch may slip a bit when either of these jerks happen, but the cause is the drivetrain.</p>
<p>This actually happens usually when you take off in a manual car, no matter how lightly you launch it. You'll notice that most of the time when the cluch finally stops slipping as you fully release it, the car &quot;shudders&quot; slightly. This is how most manual drivers tell when the clutch is fully engaged and this is the exact same effect. Most dynamic systems have a larger amplitude respons to a larger excitation. So if you release the clutch smoothly, you get a barely perceptible shudder, if you side step it poorly you get a very violent jerking</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. That &quot;hopping&quot; effect is the result of a number of things, mainly a heavy load to the drive train from disengaging the clutch too quickly. The engine might bog down due to the sudden load, but the hopping effect is a mechanical response that has to do with the elasticity of the transmission/motor mounts, and your suspension as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh.  I'd have thought the clutch would slip before the engine would stop in that scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends entirely on the clamping force of the clutch and torque of the engine. But typically a proper clutch will be able to hold more torque than the engine can produce. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, if your engine is slipping the clutch you have problems. Maybe the clutch is work out, or maybe you're just doing it wrong, or (and this is unlikely) you've got a very powerful motor and a very weak clutch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a <strong>lot</strong> of clamping force on the clutch, and a lot of surface area - more than all 4 of the brakes on the wheels. Performance engines use more aggressive clutches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Abruptly stopping an engine is bad for internals. They need to spin down freely to maintain life expectancy.&quot;</p>
<p>I would ask for some sort of source for this one because I have never heard of this being true. The reason an engine sounds bad when stalling is because its rotating so slow and its just trying to keep running. I wouldn't think this hurts the engine at all. Been riding dirt bikes for years and stalls are extremely common and I have never heard of anyone saying they do harm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean... all the bearings and other parts  in the engine are spec'd for a given torque. when you abruptly stop an engine it instantaneously applies a much larger torque than what the engine can produce. This could cause a bearing to have metal on metal contact, which would produce <em>some</em> wear. I would be more concerned about the driveline, however. CVs/U-joints only have so many cycles of life in them and inertial loading of them doesn't help at all. </p>
<p>I would imagine dirt bikes are designed with abuse in mind, so the components are probably designed to handle more shock loading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just fyi, most bikes use wet clutches. The dry clutch of a car is completely different. So Your experience with one is not transferable to cars.</p>
<p>Also, think about it. All the force the engine needs to produce carried through a camshaft to the rest of the drivetrain. You are applying (at minimum) an equal amount of force back the wrong way to stall (in the scenario of this thread at least). That means at one end of the axle the engine is putting a force to spin and the other end is inputting and same amount of force to stop the spin. Exerting on ALL parts up the drivetrain twice the force it was engineered to withstand on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Just like racing between stoplights increases wear on a car. Stalling the motor will increase wear on all parts. I admit, other parts will fail looong before your engine fails due to stalling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For one, why would the clutch type matter? I know the difference between a wet and dry clutch but what is your argument? I cant think of one.</p>
<p>Well the engine essentially is always working like that. When you accelerate you have the piston producing powder which has to move the cam shaft through the gears to the wheels. What makes that any different than it going the other way. Its like braking without pulling in the clutch. And i wouldnt say its trying to stop the spin. It just doesnt have enough energy to continue spinning. </p></div>		</li>
