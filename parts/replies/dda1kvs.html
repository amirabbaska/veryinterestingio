<p>Women are more likely to be woken up by high frequency noises such as 1-5KHz. It is an evolutionary result of women that could be woken up quicker by crying children during the night which lead to higher survivability in their children.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a show was filmed with a laugh track, no shit removing the laugh track will make it weird. Comedy relies on timing, and obviously it sounds dumb if you remove the timing. Laugh tracks exist because the actual studio audience laughs at the jokes, but it sounds better to use the prerecorded studio laugh track than to use the one they record on set</p></div>		</li>

<p>laugh track =/= timing</p>
<p>If joke is unfunny when you subtract other peoples laughing, then the joke was always unfunny. Laugh tracks create an illusion that you are having good time, seriously - try to watch one episode without the laugh track and you will understand.
(Never said it was dumb - the tv series is almost always true to facts, I just dont like this bully/hate sense of humor that is presented as super fun)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The transition from sleep to wakefulness is very complicated and not something I fully understand. My background in neuroscience is as a medical student with a keen interest in neurology, not a neuroscientist, so I can't fully answer the question. I'd imagine it has to do with differences in the mechanisms of inhibition (obviously there aren't actual copper and lead wires in the brain) between people, but I couldn't comment on exactly what these differences would be. </p>
<p>I'm taking a year out next year to do a neuroscience degree before continuing with medicine, so ask me in about a year and a half and I <em>might</em> know the answer! :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is somewhat off topic, kinda anyway. If you become a neurologist, when you can't figure something out, don't just assume that it's a psych issue. I've got a neurological issue. Every single neurologist has treated me like it's a psych issue. I went to psych and they couldn't find anything that would cause my issues. It took a doctor friend that took a special interest in my issues to figure out that I had a disease that can cause neurological problems. A tiny little test, a smear on a slide, that 10 different neurologists didn't do. 10 different neurologists said it was a psychiatric condition. They weren't all unknown neurologists either. They included 1 from the University of Minnesota and the team from Mayo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neuroscientist here! I don't specialize in sleep, but I know enough tell you that you won't find a complete answer to that question. Nobody could tell you for sure. A correct, though incomplete answer is the stimulus threshold required to induce waking is likely set by numerous factors. Stress or even baseline anxiety for instance might influence which sleep states you are prone to occupy at certain times during a given night. Alternatively, you might find differences in brain circuitry dictating your circadian cycle. Some people exhibit behavioral patterns that are conducive to more regular/deeper sleep (sleep hygiene); this could cause plasticity in numerous brain areas associated with sleep. </p>
<p>Ultimately, neuroscience isn't equipped to answer that question in a high degree of detail. If we get someone with a specialization in the neuroscience of sleep they will certainly get more specific than I've been and be able to point to several factors that are crucial for entering, maintaining, and leaving sleeping states but they couldn't tell you specifically what differs between you and another individual... At least without testing you both and even then it would only be an educated and general guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep is not just one thing. There are 4 stages of sleep, usually in this order: Stage N1, Stage N2, Stage N3, Stage REM Sleep. The different conduction analogy is pretty good. </p>
<p>We need to include 4 different wires. For example, stage 1 sleep is really just a transition into sleep. It wouldn't take an extremely loud noise to wake you. </p>
<p>Stage 2 sleep is where adults spend most of their time sleeping. Louder noises required.</p>
<p>Stage 3 is where kids spend most of their time. It is a catatonic, zombie-like sleep. It takes a damn Skrillex concert to wake someone.</p>
<p>Stage REM sleep is where we dream. It changes two wires. It switches back to nearly 100% conductive for hearing. We may sometimes incorporate the sounds we hear into our dreams (check out r/luciddreaming). It switches our body movements to nearly 0% conductive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Other sounds that have very strong associations in our memory, e.g. our ringtone, alarm tone or a doorbell, may also provide enough voltage in the circuit even if they're a bit quieter. </p>

<p>I think this is what OP wanted to know. If in your analogy the ear is at one end of the wire and the brain at the other how does the ear know which sounds you have a strong relation to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neuroscience here is obviously more complicated than just different wires. </p>
<p>When a certain neuron in the brain is activated a lot or activated very strongly, then it becomes easier to activate it in the future. You can think of this like a wire that becomes more and more conductive the more you send electricity through it. </p>
<p>This is the basis of memory formation. You remember things that keep activating the same pathways or activate a pathway very strongly. Something like your name is used so often that the neurons that contain the memory of your name are <em>very</em> easily stimulated by the various pathways that connect to this memory. </p>
<p>So there is a pathway that goes <em>ear -&gt; auditory complex -&gt; area of the brain where the memory of your name is stored -&gt; the response to this memory</em> (obviously this is incredibly simplified). The neurons in this pathway are so easily stimulated that even when they're being inhibited by sleep, someone saying your name may still be enough to wake you up. </p>
<p>However, background noises like cars going past don't really have strong connections. If a car goes past the window then our auditory centre of the brain will process this information but the connections between the sound of a car and other parts of the brain aren't very easily activated. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The door opening is obviously the quieter sound and the alarm clock is something that is a regular experience throughout the week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a shot in the dark here. Id say it has to do with a combination of conscious correlation with things like ringtones and alarms since our conscious mind associates those sounds with needing attention and primal instincts which would explain why some people can have a literal bomb go off next to them and keep on sleeping but step on a creaky floorboard or snap a twig and they're wide awake since those would be signs of a predictor. Course I could be entirely wrong. </p></div>		</li>
