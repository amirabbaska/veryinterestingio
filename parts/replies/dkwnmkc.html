			<div class="markdown"><p>I beg to differ. I am portuguese and have been living in the Netherlands, and here they eat really poorly, basically only sandwiches at lunch, so the only warm meal is dinner. And they could be healthy sandwiches, but no, there are no vegetables or meat whatsoever, it's peanut butter, cheese and butter. And I've heard from friends that in Finland it was the same, but that I can't know for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diet is a factor in fulfilling height potential, but that potential is largely genetic. If you raised a Scandinavian child, a Japanese child, a Kenyan child, a Chilean child, and a Thai child in the same place, with the same diet, these controls would not result in correlating bone growth to length. Historically, Northern Europeans have been taller on average than Southern Europeans. This is likely mostly due to historic natural selection. Northern Europe, particularly the Scandinavian peninsula, has historically been a hard place to live. Thousands of years of natural selection, as well as relative genetic isolation, results in a population that is predominantly of a certain genotype and phenotype that is &quot;hardier&quot;, so to speak. </p></div>		</li>
