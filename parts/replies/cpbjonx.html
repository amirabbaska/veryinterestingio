<p>EDIT: I feel dirty for calling it &quot;south&quot; when, clearly, it's southern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in central California, and being from an agricultural family, these aquaducts are one of the worst things that happened to us. We are not allowed to &quot;freely&quot; take this water and instead it flows down to L.A and San Francisco (IIRC).  It's really aggravating that a huge percentage of the water shortage in the valley would be gone if there was another way of the big cities getting water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which doesn't help much. Taking water water from a drought stricken area and sending it slightly south to another drought stricken area doesn't exactly help the situation either. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/portlet/article/html/imageDisplay.jsp?contentItemRelationshipId=6097576" target="_blank">Unfortunately while most of California has reduced water usage</a> compared to the past few years (by up to 13% less in the Sacramento Valley area), the region around and containing Los Angeles and San Diego (which happen to be one of the most densely populated part of the Golden State) have increased by 8% and by that almost alone have increased by 1%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, there has been research done showing that the Great Lakes,despite having enormous volumes of water available, do not regenerate water fast enough to keep up with a pipeline bringing water to the southwest. It  would completely destroy the Great Lakes. This is why it  hasn't and will not be done.  Source: My Environmental Technology professor, who was an EPA engineer for 20 years</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll live with 2 months of heavy snow, and enjoy my fresh water thank you very much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But Southern California doesn't just steal water from Northern California. They steal the other half of their water from Colorado. When the Colorado river reaches the Gulf of *California, it's only a trickle because all the water was siphoned off by Southern California and Nevada. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, California snuck into Colorado one night and stole the Colorado River.  Now it's entirely within California and Nevada.  No one else gets to use it or had anything to do with how the water is split up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it must be a trickle because it doesn't go to the Gulf of Mexico at all... and it would be insane for California to get water from east of the Continental Divide (which is where it would have to be in order to go there. </p></div>		</li>
