But I've noticed it also gets better by the afternoon and worse right before bed, and I know he wants to go because for him missing school is the worst.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here are the facts then; </p>
<p>A normal cortisol curve demonstrates that cortisol levels spike as soon as you wake up (spike can be from 38–75%, average is 50%), and slowly decrease throughout the day. It does not peak during the mid-day. 77% of the population has a normal curve. </p>

<p>Even if someone had an abnormal cortisol curve, it would look like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://experiencelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cortisol-High-Evening.jpg" target="_blank">Abnormal Curve 1</a></p>
<p><a href="https://experiencelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Cortisol-High-Throughout.jpg" target="_blank">Abnormal Curve 2</a></p>
<p>No mid-day spike seems to be caused, and the only slide I left out is where Cortisol levels remained equal throughout the day (which seemed like it was 0 increase).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It’s why our kids are too sick for school in the morning but by lunch are amping to go play, and you’re sure they’re going to school the next day. Then their fever returns after dinner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm just going to guess; most likely those kids aren't as sick as they are making it out, or just faking it. Hell, I did this as a kid all the time; sometimes I'd be &quot;sick&quot; enough to not go to school and play video games (or be faking it), other times, I'd rather just lay in bed due to how sick I was. If a kid is repeatedly &quot;getting better throughout the mid day&quot;, that's something I'd be suspicious of. </p>
<p>Edit: I posted the information above because /u/PattyLeeTX proposed this;</p>
<p>&quot;my kids feel better mid day compared to in the morning/night time, and that's because cortisol is at it's peak mid day, which allows them to have more energy compared to the morning and not feel sick during mid day.&quot;</p>
<p>This is untrue, and not factual advice, and it's the second most up voted comment on a subreddit that is supposed to be based off factual information that's presented in an easy to understand manner. </p>
<p>Now, people are assuming that what I posted above means that you won't feel better mid day compared to morning and night time, when I never said that. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1v1tli/why_do_cold_symptoms_peak_in_severity_when_i/?st=jdmwngdx&amp;sh=df615fc6" target="_blank">Here's an 4 year old askscience thread that explains why people feel better mid way through the day,</a> and while he says Cortisol is a factor, it's not the main or secondary factor that he lists, and he never changed his OP to add Cortisol as the main reason why you'd feel better mid day.</p></div>		</li>
