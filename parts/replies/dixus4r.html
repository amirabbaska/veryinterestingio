			<div class="markdown"><p>You are doing great by consuming protein because that takes the most energy to break down. And while losing weight, keeping protein intake up is essential so you don't start burning off muscle for energy.</p>
<p>The more muscle mass you have, the more energy you expend to maintain it. Which is why, exercise and diet should always go hand in hand. The more you build muscle, the easier it will be to keep weight off.</p>
<p>Now, consuming fat will automatically be stored as fat.</p>
<p>Consuming carbohydrates will be stored as carbohydrates in the form of glycogen UNLESS you eat a shit ton of carbs and don't exercise, then they will be converted  to fat.</p>
<p>Same with protein, but only in extreme cases where you're eating an extreme excess, which is very rare since the amount (which I am not sure of) needed typically doesn't occur in many people's diets.</p>
<p>1000 calories is pretty low. And without considering your height/ weight, most people have a basal metabolic rate of 1500-2000 calories a day (energy your body expends to sustain normal bodily functions OUTSIDE of exercise)</p>
<p>Increased muscle mass will increase this basal metabolic rate and then adding exercise will expend even more calories.</p>
<p>To answer your question, It's safe to say you will expend more energy than consumed because Im willing to bet your BMR is probably above 1000 Calories. So you will lose weight, but very slowly considering 3500 calories is the equivalent of one pound of body weight.</p>
<p>So if your BMR is 1350 calories a day and you consume 1000, it will  take roughly 10 days for you to lose one pound.</p>
<p>If weight loss is the primary goal, exercise and diet should go hand in hand. Doing one without the other will yield the lease successful results.</p>
<p>I went on a nerd tangent, hopefully this answers your question :D</p>
<p>EDIT: in addition, and this changes from source to source, around 1-3 pounds of weight loss a week is healthy. When you hear people lose 13 pounds in one week, it's typically do to not eating at all/ water weight. This is not ideal and can severely screw your metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I said a thousand-calorie <em>deficit.</em> I'm obese and have a TDEE of around 3000, and stick to 2000 calories daily. Nearing forty pounds lost this year.</p>
<p>The science is all interesting, but I don't think you answered my question. Let's say I stick to exactly my TDEE for two weeks, but go 2000 calories below it for one day. When will I see the effects of that on the scale, and where exactly does the mass go?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, is dietary fat converted directly into body fat? I would like to see a source on this; dietary fat is used for many bodily functions, such as usage in the endocrine system. In addition, studies show that high fat diets and high carb diets have similar levels of weight loss (when calories are held constant).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does a diet without exercise yield less successful results than diet with exercise?  Wouldn't the weight loss be the same if the same calorie deficit is the same in both cases?  For example, eating 1500 Cal and burning 2000 vs eating 2000 and burning 2500.  Or were you just saying that the muscle mass gained from exercising will increase the BMR?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's how fast it leaves and how fast you can measure it.</p>
<p>The NASA types might have a treadmill on a scale with a mask where you can watch the grams melt off in real time. Consider how fast you can measure it. </p>
<p>A reasonably priced scale goes to 0.1 lbs. Lets say you measure daily minimums upon waking on a regular schedule. Lets also say that you get half that precision, or 0.2 lbs, which is 700 calories by the thermogenic formula. That makes the answer to your question:</p>
<p>The loss is as fast as chemical reactions and breathing, but the fastest you can measure it is once a day, and a 700+ calorie deficit should be measureable as a 0.2 lb change from one day to the next.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;stuff&quot; leaves your body via CO2 in your breath, at least most of it.  So it will be just a minute or two from when you burn fat to when the mass leaves your body.</p>
<p>If you are burning protein, some of the mass will leave as urea in urine.  However most of the protein is converted to glucose or fatty acids before being burned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted on /r/AskScience a few months ago but got no replies:</p>
<p>As most weight is lost via CO2 exhalation, would lowering the concentration of CO2 in the room via CO2 scrubbers speed up the rate at which it is expelled from the body, thereby increasing weight loss?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to correct you : 100-200m sprint uses creatine phosphate as ATP only lasts a few contractions. 1600m sprint uses glycogen and lactate (cori cycle). Secondly, when fasting you break down protein before starting fat breakdown (ketoacids accumulate maximally after a week of fasting).</p>
<p>But yeah you made it simple to understand. Maybe my post fills some gap for the more curious. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's because glucose is the preferred energy source, especially in the brain. Amino acid such as alanine are converted to pyruvate which via gluconeogenesis (requires ATP) become glucose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>glycogen -&gt; lactate, to be more specific, since the recovery phase won't be running until you stop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(aerobic)1600 meter+ = fat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, mostly glycogen-&gt;water + CO2.  Mostly protein/fat kicks in after glycogen is exhausted, traditionally around 20 miles.</p>
<p>Also when trying to lose weight, aerobic exercise is good too, but you'll get the best bang for you exercise time with anaerobic exercise, since it will raise you muscle mass and hence your basal metabolic rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To build off of this, the ATP is cell level storage, the carbohydrates (sugars mainly) are (mostly) blood level storage, and fat is whole body level storage. Your ATP is constantly being replenished from nearby sugar stores; your cells run on the stuff. But when the individual cells are near empty they start pulling in sugar from the blood. Only when that blood sugar level starts getting low does your body start converting large amounts of fat back into sugar for use by individual cells. If you constantly snack on carbohydrates then your blood sugar will be high enough that you're unlikely to burn much fat. </p></div>		</li>
