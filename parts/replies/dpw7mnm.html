<p>I don't mean the outer edge (Wilson's disease) the outside edge of my eye is deep blue, the ring is about midway through the iris.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I was also born with almost black hair, it lightened to a mousy brown as a kid, and now it’s a richer brown with red undertones. Also I dye it so who knows what’s under there now???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know but if the iris functions like a moving aperture then a stationary contact lense isn't going to have the functionality of being able to adjust and allow more or less light.  I doubt albino people would benefit.</p>
<p>Maybe someone should invent a contact lense with a smart aperture on it for albino people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contact lenses for the correction of iris defects already exist, they obviously aren't as good as a natural iris aperture (especially in low light or changing environments).</p>
<p>I don't know whether they are commonly prescribed for people with albinism, they usually have a working iris and tinted glasses probably are the go-to solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Albinos have poor vision because the innermost layer of the retina is also pigmented to stop internal refraction of light in the eye.  So when light hits an albino's retina the light hits and bounces around and activates other rods and cones in the retina so they can't produce a sharp image and have poor vision. Contact lenses would not fix this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Albino here. Unfortunately not - it's not so much the colour that causes the bad vision, it's the lack of melanin messing things up in all kinds of ways. If it worked, my doctor would have prescribed coloured contacts for me a long time ago, I imagine.</p>
<p>Human albinos don't have red eyes btw, most have some shade of blue-grey or similar colours. :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure eye color is polygenetic to a point where unless you have a defect, most white families children can have any color iris as it’s nigh impossible to trace that family tree back. On your point of albinos having poorer eyesight because of lack of pigment as a filter: does this mean that brown eyed people possibly have the best built in protection against light and the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is no coincidence that people in bright regions (steppes, savannas, deserts etc.) are predominantly brown-haired and consequently brown-eyed (and darker-skinned). All these darkness protects against the sun that burns with the fury of a thousand angry fires.</p>
<p>Those scandinavians are spared from the wrathful sun and have a higer count of bright-skinned blondes with blue eyes.</p>
