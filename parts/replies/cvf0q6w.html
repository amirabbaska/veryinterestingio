			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we know that at least one of them is traveling pretty quickly. </p>
<p>&quot;Given a recent estimate of 4.3 million solar masses for the mass of Sagittarius A* and S2's close approach, this makes S2 the fastest known ballistic orbit, reaching speeds exceeding 5000 km/s (11,000,000 mph) or 1.67~% of the speed of light...&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of S2's neighbors, S14 (aka S0-16), is the one with the closest periastron distance (only 45 AU), and hence the highest maximum speed. At this point it <a href="http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/kaniol/a360/Black_Hole_in_Galaxy.htm" target="_blank">moves at 11,700 km/s</a>, or 4% of the speed of light.  That's more than twice as fast as S2. However, due to its highly elliptical orbit, it spends most of its time moving much slower than S2. It is very difficult to observe stars in this region, so there may be stars on even closer orbits that we haven't detected yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's hard for a star to keep it's form that close and that fast, but I've read at least one that has matter spinning at 7% the speed of light. It's fast.</p>
<p>edit: <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/universe/blackhole_race.html" target="_blank">it's 10%</a></p></div>		</li>
