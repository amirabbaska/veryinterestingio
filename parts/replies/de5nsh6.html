			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that article is a little misleading. I am not from America, but a quick google search tells me that household consumption is about 68% of annual GDP. That means that if every if the MPC decreased 10%-20% (or MPS increased 10%-20%), it would clearly have a large impact on economic growth.</p>
<p>But yes, the economy can be looked at as savers and investors. If people decide to consume less, then suppliers of capital can pass these savings onto businesses. Now lets look at a part you quoted which says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;which end up in the hands of new and existing businesses who can then use that money to create new technology, factories, or human capital, allowing them to increase their productivity&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue with that line of logic is that there would be no incentive to do such a thing. Why would I build a new factory if demand has dropped 20%? Also, I can't invest that money into human capital when I would have to start firing workers due to decreased demand, by the writers own admission, workers would work less hours too. If the writers argument is that individuals could develop their human capital via education and training, well again, what's the incentive to do so? You have additional money but if there's less work in every sector, why would I educate or train myself? </p>
<p>In aggregate, the economy would clearly continually deflate given people saving more, working less and consuming less, creating a contracting equilibrium LRS and LRD. Can the economy export more? Of course there would be more resources set aside for them to export, and given the weakening economy they would be more internationally competitive in regards to pricing. So naturally exports will rise. The thing is though, the surplus demand of exports would NEVER make up for the excess supply created due to the frugality of consumers. Also the article neglects to mention the impact on social welfare, which in summary, frugality would rape.</p>
<p>The article states that due to reduction of demand for consumer products, there will be a change in tastes and preferences towards different things, then as a conclusion states the economy in the long run won't be too much different to how it is now. Kinda true.</p>
<p>If there's a difference in tastes and preferences, it would create excess demand in those sectors and create jobs etc there. The issue now becomes the skill of labour. If there was a sudden uprise in the demand for scientists, can Timmy the carpenter become a scientist overnight? No. It would force many Americans to move overseas due to lack of skills and a huge surge of immigration because of a skill shortage.</p>
<p>Another issue I have with the article is an example of what excessive household savings can be used on. The writer mentions &quot;developing countries&quot; which while is a great cause, it really isn't good internally. Imagine if 10%-20% of all household savings (or 6.8% to 13.6% of GDP) went overseas to develop other countries. That is a HUGE outlay of funding with seemingly no return since these things are almost always charitable. &quot;Improved education&quot; for what purpose if the country is continually contracting? Fixing the skill shortage would be the obvious reason, but by this point there would be unlikely any excessive demand because the skill shortage was already rectified by immigration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the write up!  I think a couple things to keep in mind is that the article I linked was written with the thought of everyone saving like 40% or more of their income, not the 10%-20% that OP mentioned.  Also, it assumes that most of the saved money is going to be invested in a broad market based index fund made up of a bunch of stocks.  So most of the money would be funneled back to businesses.  Not mostly going overseas as you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing I forgot to mention was the impact on stock market returns which is probably the most important part given its the crux of the writers theory and argument.</p>
<p>Lower national demand = less returns on the market. Why would I put money on an index earning some subpar return (because the nation is contracting) when I can put it in an index with similar or even less risk and greater return? People would just invest their money into overseas companies, creating a large financial account deficit. What the writer claims the money would be used on is <em>overly</em> optimistic to the point of unrealistic.</p>
<p>Reading another article by him, he mentioned he did some class in Economics while doing his Engineering degree. I didn't check anything else out, but that makes sense to me. His understanding of macroeconomics is fundamental at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article sounds a little confusing then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, frugality as a whole would work very well for society. We’d produce less, and we’d earn less, but that is perfect since we would consume less as well... </p>
<p>A certain portion of them would actually be even more motivated to produce new things than they were when under forced employment... </p>
<p>society would probably value different things. Some people would be willing to spend more to buy all-renewable energy. This would create market opportunities to build more of the stuff. And it turns out that there are many trillions of dollars of work to be done in that area. Other people might be willing to spend on better health developments, building up developing countries, or improved educational opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I just re-read this part again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last issue is, “but how will they pay for their early retirement, when all stock investments have collapsed due to the shrinking economy?”</p>
<p>I believe that’s just a misunderstanding of the effects of market forces. When a society decides it needs to earn less money, it can happen in a mixture of two ways:
1) people can work shorter work weeks, but similar career lengths
2) people can continue to work long work weeks, but save and invest the extra income for earlier retirement</p>
<p>Either way, there will always be young people looking to get ahead quickly and companies looking for cash to finance productivity improvements – these people will still need loans to start and fund companies. Similarly, there will always be mobile people in need of housing – and so real estate (just another form of capital) will continue to provide returns in the form of rent payments. Capital will always have some value, and thus the concept of investment will remain valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this part neglects social welfare and makes some assumptions. Yes, there are 2 ways for companies to deal with the less demand as he correctly stated, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>people can work shorter work weeks, but similar career lengths </li>
<li>people can continue to work long work weeks, but save and invest the extra income for earlier retirement</li>
</ol>
<p>The matter now becomes the impact of unemployment and lack of resources.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way. Lets say hypothetically that in equilibrium, the average worker earns $1000 a week. Now if the entire household sector reduces their consumption by any given amount, (we will stick with the 10%-20% since it doesn't matter) then the equilibrium income of the average worker will change. How? Well there would be less employed people and the people currently employed would work less. I am not going to bother with Keynesian/Classical/Monetarist economic theory in regards to labour wages because in the long run, they all end up in the same spot basically.</p>
<p>Basically, we if all spend on average $200 less, then eventually we will all earn on average $200 less. How do we plan on putting all of our &quot;excessive earnings&quot; into a stock market if those &quot;excessive earnings&quot; don't exist? It would create greater inequality of income given there would be a lot more people living in the poverty line, and middle class citizens essentially move to high class because the standard of living just deteriorates that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The issue with that line of logic is that there would be no incentive to do such a thing. Why would I build a new factory if demand has dropped 20%?&quot;</p>
<p>This might be a bit simplistic. If 20% of the cash in the economy has been &quot;invested&quot; there should be a significant increase in demand triggered by that investment.  If I give $100,000 to a tech startup, that's not a $100,000 decrease in demand, because the startup will buy computers and office furniture, pay for various services, and pay salaries to people who will buy consumer goods.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GDP = Consumption, Investment, Net Exports, and Government spending. </p>
<p>If savings in time period 0 go up, you're right, consumption will go down. However, Investment will go up by a proportional amount. This is a wash. </p>
<p>In time period 1, if those investments paid off <em>at all</em>, consumers now have the same incomes they would have otherwise had, plus the additional income from the additional investment. So total GDP is higher. </p>
<p>&quot;But what are they investing in, if consumer demand is declining?&quot; You probably have a hard time imagining an answer to that, because of simple cognitive bias. You interact with many different industries at the consumer end, but at most you probably only really see the back end of a single industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem with that theory is it doesn't mention scope.</p>
<p>If I go out and buy a truck or a new tv, the economic multiplier goes through my local community in a hurry. Eating at bars puts cash right into my neighbors hands. Ect.</p>
<p>Investing in international bonds doesn't have nearly the same effect. Stashing away my cash into a HISA isn't going to make the bank more likely to give someone a loan. In Canada, TFSA's(best vehicle for savings) are strictly prohibited for use on non public companies. </p>
<p>So maybe on a global scale it all evens out but on a local scale, spending is much better than saving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear ya, there definitely are some economic benefits to spending in local communities.  However, I think with a slight decrease in spending (spending 80-90% and saving the rest), businesses would just cope by reducing supply.  It woudn't result in an economic depression as OP asked about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except on average, we probably spend like 105% of our takehome. Dropping to 80% across the board is a 24% total spending reduction. If I can make the assumption of rent, food, and transportation cost about 50% of your take home and it's pretty inelastic. Tertiary spending drops from 55% to 30%, which is a 46% reduction. </p>
<p>That's not an amount that can be solved by reducing supply, that would be the end of many industries. Restaurants and Bars would be the first to just disappear.</p>
<p>In the long run, we may end up with a more balanced economy that moved away from blatant consumerism but there would be a transition period of utter chaos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you care about the local economy, you have to consciously direct your consumption habits to that end. You also have to consciously direct your savings and investing habits.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm off base in Canada, but I think sacrificing the tax advantage and convenience of your retirement savings account is similar to sacrificing the tax advantage, savings, and cc rewards from buying online.</p>
<p>If your day's wages are paying the day's wages for a local IT consultant to upgrade the scheduling system of a local dance studio, your dollar is passing through that IT guy into the community, it's increasing the QoL for workers and clients in / of the studio, and the returns to you and the other shareholders can continue to benefit the community as you reinvest or use them for future consumption. </p></div>		</li>
