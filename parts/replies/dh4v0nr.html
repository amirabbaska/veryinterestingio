			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense for continuity and the health of the actor.</p>
<p>If you're supposed to be onscreen smoking a cigarette during a scene the cigarette can't randomly change in length so they'd have to keep swapping you out to a brand new cigarette or spend time swapping out at predetermined points of burned-ness to simulate a single cigarette being consumed over the length of the scene.  If this is just an extra casually smoking for sure just give them an unlit cigarette and CG in the smoke.</p>
<p>This is the same kind of shit they do when the actors have to actually put food in their mouths.  Most productions will use a spit bucket so the actors spit their partially chewed food out so they don't have to actually eat 12 meals in an afternoon.  Chris Pratt famously refused to use a spit bucket and actually ate everything Andy consumed on Parks &amp; Rec.  Multiple times.</p></div>		</li>
