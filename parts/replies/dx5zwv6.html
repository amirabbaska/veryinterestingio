			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read stuff from sleep researchers,  it seems you really need to wind down before going to bed. Blue light makes your brain think it's day, so I use red light bulbs at night, relax and slowly get sleepy so I can sleep well. I use an eye pillow, black out curtains and CPAP machine, along with a Fitbit to record deep sleep. I slowly tweak my regemen based on how I slept. I have settled on an airsense CPAP, dreamware mask, tweaked to my head. Obsessing over sleep has really helped my at work.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I always called it &quot;mom brain,&quot; but that's just my unscientific term. What's interesting to me is how I can wake up immediately and get out of bed. Nowadays it's usually just waking to my alarm, but when kids were little I could hear the gulping  before they vomited, from across the house. My husband is the opposite. He has to hit snooze a few times, then wait a bit to &quot;wake up&quot; or he feels nauseous. </p>
<p>I could sleep all day though. Put a fan on for white noise, and I could easily sleep 10+ hours. I have read mixed things about sleeping a lot. Some sources say it's a symptom of something wrong. I don't feel sick when I sleep for 12 hrs or more. My dad and sister are the same. Could it be that some people just sleep more? </p></div>		</li>
