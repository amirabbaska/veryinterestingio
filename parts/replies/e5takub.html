			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading the book American Serengeti I fell in love with the US Midwest. Most people think the plains are an absolute bore, but that book will open your eyes to what life was like 10,000 years ago. </p>
<p>Relatively, I know 10,000 years is a blink of the eye, but does your original statement hold true for that area? Prior to the open grasslands was it dominated by ferns and mosses? If so, what happened? </p>
<p>Maybe this can help you focus your response, if not, point me in the right direction for some reading!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So glad to see mention of Buffalo Gap and the Badlands NP. I was their this summer and the prairie is so beautiful and under rated. Eastern SD, around the Sisseton area is also amazing for long grass prairie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can also vouch for Tallgrass Prarie NP in Kansas and Comanche National Grassland in Colorado. I enjoyed both much more than I expected, and slaw a wide variety of insects and tarantula (CO). It was one of the few American tall grass prairies left.</p>
<p>US-50 to US-160 across south Kansas to NW Arizona is an amazing two-day drive (with frequent stops for pictures, short hikes, etc.) from plains to the Rockies to the desert.</p>
<p>The staff at the sites were really informative and helpful too. NPS/FS employees usually are, but this was exceptional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I just wrote my dissertation on “beringia” during the last ice age. Tundras were in fact dominated by coniferous trees but interestingly enough, they would only grow to about a foot tall!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes perfect sense. I’d like to know what allowed grass to dominate after the ice age.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mostly that's because they drive by hundreds and hundreds of miles of corn. So...it really is a bore. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I haven't made it out anywhere to experience the actual grasslands (I've heard the Badlands is good for that), but I have driven through that corn purgatory...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it seems a little fishy that an island perfectly suited to grass and is extremely near a landmass covered in grass would mysteriously have no native grass.<a href="https://i.imgur.com/oDKGr97.jpg" target="_blank"> Dropping in some random place on google maps</a> shows plenty of grass, so you certainly cannot see a grassless landscape there today!</p>
<p>Even if all that grass is brought over by humans, it seems incredibly unlikely that an island could be that close to a major land mass and not have a single grass seed be brought over in the millions of years it has been there.</p></div>		</li>
