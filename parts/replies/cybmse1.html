			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that it's that they greys are more evolved than us (in the way someone who thinks that way would understand it. &quot;More evolved&quot; is a misunderstanding of he theory) </p>
<p>To monkeys, we look thin, tall, big naked heads with eyes and slender fingers, too frail to fight one but somehow technologically advanced enough to utterly destroy them when we lose interest in studying them. </p>
<p>Greys look to us the way we believe we look to monkeys. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but I have a few problems with that theory. Mainly that witnesses typically describe their abductors as specifically nonhuman, even in cases where they outwardly appear human or human-ish. Whereas primates seem to identify humans as their fellow primates, allowing us to infiltrate their social structures a la Jane Goodall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's monkeys though. His point still stands. Your refutation has nothing to do with the idea he presented, only the analogy he used to explain it to you.</p>
<p>What he's saying is that, compared to primates that don't have our mental prowess, over time we lost hair, got bigger heads, etc. because we didn't need those things (due to increased cognition and using tools and stuff because of that). What he's suggesting is that these 'aliens' have perhaps evolved similarly...and compared to modern humans, have bigger brains, better eyes for perception, better technology (less reliant on their physical build), that kind of thing. </p>
<p>Reminds me of the interplanetary evolution theory (this dumb video I saw on YouTube when I was like 13-14, which was really just trying to sell a book, which I believe was called <em>The Antichrist Version 666</em> or something). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually fits what has happened to me. Ever since I had started questioning my religious beliefs (a few years ago) I have had problems with sleep paralysis and the &quot;sleep paralysis demon&quot;, which would sometimes look like a &quot;gray&quot; or other times just a shadowy figure.</p></div>		</li>
