My 6-year-old niece weighs more than my 3-year-old niece, and the 6yo is sooo much easier to carry because she wraps her arms around your neck and sits at an easier angle. Where's the 3yo likes to throw her hands around and sit on your hip and expects you to just deal with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I find my niece relatively light. But the time I had to carry her to the car while she slept was hell. I almost dropped her down the stairs after I bashed her head on the door because she flopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah she flopped when he told her not to, so like a reasonable Uncle he slammed her head into the door rendering her unconscious. Afterwards, he considered dropping her down the stairs as further punishment for the aforementioned flopping, but remembering that the blow earlier had knocked her out and being the still-reasonable man that he is, decided that she'd learned her lesson. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. No problem carrying my wife playfully around. That time she fainted in the church and I had to carry her like 15 meters.... I thought I wouldn't make it to the exit.</p></div>		</li>
