			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be fun with a habitable moon rotating a larger body. Then you'd have effects from whatever its rotating, interactions with other moons, and the relation to all of above to its star. Could there be an earthquake season from higher tidal stresses? 'Every 12 years when our rotation aligns with selmac the hot springs become active. It's said the waters have healing properties. With only a slight chance of lava this season, get yourself down there today!'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way some large moons orbit the bigger planets like Jupiter and Saturn.  They are tidally locked to the planet and the other star is too distant to affect it in a significant way (at least in the short term).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you familiar with how relatively massive a pair of stars must be in order to form a binary as opposed to the larger one consuming the smaller one? Wouldn't the interaction of that relative mass create a barycenter around which any other bodies would orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a matter of to which star it is closer to (and it would likely get toasted in the process unless the distance between the two stars is considerable). But in truth, all objects orbit around each other to some degree (usually insignificant to the point of arbitration).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't 2 stars have to have similar masses in order to form a binary without one consuming the other? Isn't the distance between the two then governed by tidal forces that prevent the less massive one from maintaining a high enough orbital velocity to stay in a further away orbit? What would the ratio of gravitational influence have to be between the 2 stars to make the planet only orbit one, and how would you achieve that?</p></div>		</li>
