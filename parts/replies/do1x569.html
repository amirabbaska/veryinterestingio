			<div class="markdown"><p>All good advice, but just to add a point/tip/pun:</p>
<p>What you're throwing actually doesn't have to be sharp. Don't play with razor sharp axes and knives. If you throw it with enough effort to make it stick in the first place, it's going to stick, regardless of how sharp it is. There's no need to put yourself at a higher risk. </p>
<p>The 'hawk I learned on was dull as shit, and only got worse over 3 years without it ever becoming an issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, use the right kind of target. I've found a flat cross section of a log securely attached to a dirt berm to be best.  The wood grains can catch and hold a blade very well while the dirt berm will not bounce a tomahawk back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR:  They don't, unless the person knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>Excellent advice overall, though I disagree with starting with a screwdriver.  The weighting is all wrong so it'll not rotate right.  But I do agree that you should start with something that's not particularly sharp.  You can get practice knives that are properly weighted but are basically dull.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught with screwdrivers first. Actual practice knives sound much better. I learned with screwdrivers first, then moved on to hatchets. Was going to continue on to knives but left the historical reenactment scene around then and never kept it up. Can still kill people with screwdrivers though.</p>
<p>The screwdrivers were useful to begin with before move to hatchets, even though they are weighted extremely differently. I think it is just the discipline of thinking through how many times the weapon is going to rotate over a certain distance at a certain speed - and getting used to practicing the motion until you get it right time and time again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that makes sense. And I bet you can get screw drivers that aren't that bad.  I was just thinking of the wooden handled ones I have, and how badly they are misbalanced for throwing.  </p></div>		</li>
