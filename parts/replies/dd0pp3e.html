<p>Insulation is seen as a cost center here, most developers will build with a minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's important to keep the the energy expenditure down (for heating). We don't do cooling here. :) The cheaper houses have 21.5 cm (8&quot;), that's about as low as you can go to get a buidling permit. 30cm is the median I guess, some offer up to 40 cm.</p>
<p>Some houses are build with no heating, only by secondary sources like people, appliances, lights etc. Requires even more insulation. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the north of the U.S., probably a similar climate to parts of your country -- the house I live in has so little insulation that if I shut the door to my bedroom for eight hours, the temperature in that room will fall by about 10 degrees.  I can literally see outside through cracks in the patio door, single pane windows, one of which is actually just a sheet of plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it was explained to me by a fire protection engineer, fire codes in Europe look askance at wooden homes because they were preparing their cities to be fire bombed again. We had no fear of being bombed, so we allowed less expensive wood homes to be built.</p></div>		</li>
