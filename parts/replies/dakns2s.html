			<div class="markdown"><p>Mandarin is most common by sheer number of speakers, but the lingua franca of most of the world is English. It's kind of the &quot;fall back&quot; language if you have no other language in common. Chinese and Spanish (the second largest IIRC) are concentrated to their respective areas (China and Spain/the Americas), whereas English speakers are spread all across the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which, given it is the international language of business, is English. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chinese and English are neck and neck for number of functional speakers -- Chinese has an enormous number of 1st language speakers, but English has an enormous number of 2nd language speakers. And while the vast bulk of Chinese speakers (1st or second) are proximal to China, English speakers cover the planet.</p>
<p>Which is why the language of business is English. The language of flight is English. The language of science is English. And so on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem with Chinese is that there's multiple Chinese languages.  Mandarin is the most widely used, but there are Chinese speakers who do not speak Mandarin (and vice versa).  </p>
<p>Your second point is the real reason.  Mandarin is the most widely spoke language in the world, but it's like the electoral college... all of the users are in one area, where as English is spread across the globe fairly evenly.  </p>
<p>Also, computers had their rise in America.  So they were originally written in English.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is probably the most important part. Sure, there are a lot of Chinese speakers, but that's because there are a lot of Chinese people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English wasn't always the only language of science.</p>
<p>Back in tha day, well, the 17 and 1800's scientists had the read papers in French, German, Italian among others.</p>
<p>Some of them were fluent in over a dozen languages  so they could read the original publications</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's got more to do with the fact that most early digital computer research and programming languages were done either by people who spoke English natively, or people who spoke it as a second language and used it so that they could inter-operate with their native-speaking colleagues. </p>
<p>Over time people from lots of places where English isn't the primary language have come into the fold and made meaningful advancements to the fields of computing and computer science, but English has hung on simply because it's already entrenched.</p>
<p>It doesn't hurt that even though programming languages are &quot;in English&quot; doesn't really effect a person's ability to use them. Programming languages are like spoken languages in that they have a grammar and syntax, but they aren't conversational. You could replace all of the English words in C++ with Russian or Chinese placeholders fairly easily but it doesn't really make that big of a difference to a person who is learning the language because the English &quot;words&quot; don't work at all like the English <em>language.</em> You could replace &quot;if&quot; with &quot;blorkabloop&quot; and the only effect it would have is you'd have to type a lot more letters to do the same thing.</p>
<p>There are also languages that bear little or no resemblance to written or spoken languages, in particular assembly. Something like &quot;addl %rax,%rbx&quot; makes maybe only a tiny bit more sense to an English speaker than it does a person who only knows Chinese. </p></div>		</li>
