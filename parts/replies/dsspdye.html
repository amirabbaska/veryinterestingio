			<div class="markdown"><p>Confirming confirmation. Cheap &quot;wall powered&quot; LEDs literally are strobing 50-60 times a second, with pretty much equal on/off time. Because LEDs are light emitting <em>diodes</em>. And diodes only allow power to flow one way. So when the AC wave is positive, relative to the diode, it is on, and when it is negative, the led stops the flow and the light shuts off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it isn't.</p>
<p>LED's are diodes but if you put a too high negative voltage on them, which doesn't even have to be <em>that</em> high, they'll start to conduct in the opposite direction too, and likely overheat (due to a relative high voltage) and burn out quickly.</p>
<p>As protection, you need an extra diode in the opposite direction, which adds to the cost.</p>
<p>So this simple circuit is one that you will only see <em>extremely rarely</em> in the wild, and possibly only in Chinese junk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, because cheap christmas light strings &amp; such don't bother rectifying.  They just put a whole bunch of LEDs, with a limiting resistor in series, and jam 120V AC(or 220V, in those parts of the world,  I assume) through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, when you make millions of units a few pennies more each at the manufacturing level is a way to get that boat or condo for some cheap  bastard. I have seen substandard parts in power supplies all the time that ultimately killed lots of consumer electronics.  Usually just a year or so after the warranty period.
Remember the bad, phony, electrolytic capacitors that got into the computer motherboard and video card industry? it was about 2005-2006. The should have found those guys and give them some Chinese jail hospitality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is absolutely solvable, it just costs more. The power supply in your computer, stereo equipment, or your TV for example will produce a nice constant voltage. You can get LED bulbs which will have no strobe but expect to pay 3x or more for them.</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that cost is not the only concern. In the globes where you often see this the physical space available to house your transformer is at a real premium and it gets pretty toasty. Fitting big smoothing capacitors that can handle the voltage and heat isn't trivial.</p>
<p>E2: As others have pointed out, more expensive LED bulbs can use switch mode transformers to multiply the frequency up higher, which both makes the strobing harder to see and means the smoothing capacitors can be smaller. Not sure how prevalent this style is.</p>
<p>If you are like me and are looking at doing a major light refit it may be worth considering a full DC light circuit. One nice big low ripple 24v transformer at your meter box and replace all your lights with the cheap and readily available LED lights designed for campers and RVs. Plus easy battery backup! Most areas will not require a licensed electrician for low voltage DC so you or your favourite handyperson can do most of the work to save money, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a problem. It is part of the design. To have led turned on a fraction of the time is a good thing (less power, longer life for LED).</p>
<p>On battery (continuous current) and on Wall plug (alternate current), we use different approaches to turn on the on a clock each led separately with a burst of current. The reason we can do this is that our eyes are not good at seeing dark but will see light longer than it is displayed. That way when we flash the time 12:34 we light up the 1, then the 2, then the :, etc. yet our eyes only see the light for longer and gives the effect that all digits are lit at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Obviously with battery (DC) powered stuff, there is no AC and so, no strobing.</p>

<p>Some cars give horrid strobing on tail lights. My eyes get tired and I get annoyed if stuck behind them. I realize the car alternator is AC, but the battery should smooth that all out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's &quot;intentional&quot;. Pulse width modulation is often used on LEDs to control brightness in a relatively inexpensive way and increases the useful life of the LED. It takes advantage of persistence of vision, so it appears dim but it's turning on and off rapidly. It's super common in tons of applications.</p>
<p>Many cars with LED taillights use this for their running lights so they are dim. When the brake lights are actually on, it just turns the LED on fully without modulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And because they're cheap, or possibly because they think people only &quot;see&quot; 24fps, they made the PWM frequency way too low. This is a DC system, so unlike AC mains power, it was a conscious decision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing two concepts here. A LED will strobe on an AC power source, not a (stable) DC source. A car has a stable DC circuit. The fact that it could have an AC source (alternator) that is rectified feeding the circuit doesn't make the voltage drop and peak constantly, it will just cause a ripple around the regulated voltage, say 11.9 to 12.1 volts, not affecting the LEDs.  </p>
<p>The actual source of the strobing is the PWM driver feeding the LEDs. It will create a pulsating DC output, like from 0 to 1.5 volt at maybe 25 Hz or something, that's visible to your eyes as 'strobing'. This would even happen when the engine (and thus the alternator) isn't running.</p></div>		</li>
