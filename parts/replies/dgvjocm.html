			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned the hard way never to let my passport out of my sight. When I moved to Denmark from the UK, I was looking to choose a bank. I chatted with someone at one bank and she asked if I had any ID with me. I let her have my passport. It turns out she had handed my passport over to someone else and they had &quot;opened an account&quot; for me without me agreeing to, or signing, anything. I decided not to go with them after finding out they'd opened an account and I left, telling them to close any accounts they had opened without my permission. One month later, I got a statement in the mail from that bank showing that my account had a balance of 0. The account I hadn't agreed to, nor signed off on (and they had said was closed immediately) was active and without me knowing. Turns out that just a photocopy of the most important page of a passport is pretty fucking powerful. Don't let anyone even <em>look</em> at your passport unless it's necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well shit, this'll make me think twice about sending copies. I'm also Dutch and you're actually the first person I hear about this happening.  Glad nothing serious happened, but its scary they were able to do this so easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The government has an app &quot;Kopie-ID&quot; which lets you watermark your passport or identity card. This way if <em>business A</em> leaked your passport and someone was going to use it at <em>business B</em>, they would see that the watermark is for another company.</p></div>		</li>
