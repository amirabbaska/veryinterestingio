<p>All in all, a history of exposure and burial in a hot arid environment such as the Sahara leaves a deep and recognizable mark on the underlying rocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are there examples where we know that an area had to be covered in a similar manner in the past, since the exposed surface looks just like we suppose the bed rock of the Sahara looks like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of know examples from the geological past, and arid environments have featured prominently in our geological history. For instance, there are numerous examples of such features developed in Triassic rocks in Europe, with extensive development of regoliths, fluviatile and eolian sand deposts, paleosols, calcretes and even silcretes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned regolith, and I thought that meant lunar rocks, but it isn't so?</p>
<p>Is that a type of rock similar to what is found on the moon or a generic &quot;family&quot; of rock?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Gargatua13013 is referring to &quot;paleosols&quot; or ancient buried soil levels you can see when cutting through petrified dunes. They look like <a href="https://news.unl.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large_aspect/public/IMG_0390_T.jpg?itok=G1mShWYf" target="_blank">this.</a> Unless you have training, they're generally indistinguishable from other types of sedimentary rock.</p>
<p>When modern dunes blow away, you might get something that looks like <a href="https://www.mikewatsonphotos.com/Death-Valley/i-R2BgFSd" target="_blank">this</a>, where the caliche hardpan has been exposed. I don't know of any place on Earth where we know dunes used to exist but are now gone, and we know they were there from geologic evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>West Africa is on a large craton that's between 3 billion and 500 million years old...with some bits that are upwards of 4 billion.</p>
<p>I'm seeing that parts of it are 300km deep into the mantle even. Big old masses</p>
<p>The central and eastern Sahara has a huge block of cratons of similar age, and to the south is an even older Congo and Tanzania block of 3-4 billion year old cratons</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question (not OP): Is it sand against bedrock though? </p>
<p>I would expect that major incursions of sand would cover areas of reasonably firm non-bedrock surface without removing them first. So compressed soil, desiccated plant material, and perhaps even remains of older civilizations might be under there, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a progressive upward gradual transition from fresh rock, to progressively more weathered rock. The weathered rock at some point transitions into what is termed a regolith, a soil-type made of broken and weathered material derived from the underlying bedrock. Regolith is then covered by sediments of various natures, which may or may not be eolian sand (plenty of rivers in the Sahara - they deposit sediments too). Surface processes may modify either sediments or regolith further by carrying fine particles away and concentrating heavier particles in a lag deposit.</p></div>		</li>
