			<div class="markdown"><p>My family have been vintners since my grandfather rebuilt the farm after the war. I'd say, from experience both selling and drinking, that descriptions for taste are only to give you a very general idea. You should really taste it yourself before purchasing. Think of it like... the introduction paragraph on Wikipedia. You know what it's generally about, but you have to read it yourself to understand all of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's what ads try and fail to emulate. That's my point. They can throw as much money as they want into a contrived ad campaign but it still can never be as effective as the real thing...at least not until they get smart enough to start passing off ads as the real thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most ads don't of this kind don't really tend to sell products per se. They sell the brand / icon attached. You can go get any fragrance almost identically copied by a company off the internets. It just won't have the stupid plastic bottle, silly name or Â£300 price tag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this being the most neckbeard comment ive ever read: the male models aren't for you, they're for the person buying someone cologne. Axe is the only scent selling to the guys who wear it, no guy is going into Macy's and buying himself Aqua di gio. There are plenty of pretty looking females if you want to buy someone perfume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made a new account just to call someone a neckbeard? Hello pot, I'm kettle.</p>
<p>The models are for whoever is buying it, whether that's the wearer himself or his partner. You might notice that there are almost always models of BOTH genders in the commercials, and that's because they're trying to hit both buying groups. Feel free to provide a source on the assumption that nobody buys cologne for themselves, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you stupid? Advertisers can't find a personal recommendation for everyone.  That's why they use models, because they're supposed to be stand-ins for the girls who tell you &quot;hey I like this on a guy, go buy it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, you're a real treat, aren't you? Yes, I understand the concept behind advertising, and yes, I understand that the advertisements already in place are the closest they can get to what just happened here on a large scale. My only point was that I found it funny that million-dollar ad campaigns are still inferior to even the most basic interactions between consumers. Now get that sand out of your vagina before it becomes a pearl.</p></div>		</li>
