			<div class="markdown"><p>There's really a limited amount of information I can provide about our specific systems, due to confidentiality. But I could provide some knowledge.
An SEM microscope fires electrons on the surface of a sample, this helps us get down to details that could never see with a compound microscope. The reason being that the light waves we can perceive can only go so small, electrons are the perfect solution to seeing the smallest of small and to get mind blowing details.
A TEM microscope fires electrons through a sample to give us a picture, kinda how X-ray machines work. We have a sensor on the other side of the sample which reads how the electrons come through, giving us an image!</p>
<p>FEI is the worlds leading electron microscopy company and we have the most advanced microscopes on the market. We provided the tools for the documentary The Unseen World and you can find it on Netflix.</p>
<p>EDIT:
Mysteries of the Unseen World is the movie title.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here they've spelled out IBM with xenon atoms and taken a picture with an electron microscope.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am 99% certain that this is an STM image, and <strong>not</strong> electron microscopy. It is however possible to go down to the atomic level in a transmission electron microscope (without post-processing or data manipulation)  such as <a href="http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/rmat/v13n4/a02fig05.gif" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any kind of post-processing or enhancement on that image? If we're viewing individual atoms, how is the background so smooth and uniform? Shouldn't we be able to see the individual atoms that make up the nickel surface that the xenon atoms were placed on?</p></div>		</li>
