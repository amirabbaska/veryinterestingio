<p>Superheating any metal will create an electromagnetic field due to the movement of electrons. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm afraid you are wrong here. Sure, termal motion of electrons will create magnetic fields on microscopic scale but due to the motion being chaotic, those fields will be distributed isotropically (and I'm using that word here not in fully conventional way) and cancel out, so there will be no <em>macroscopic</em> field. In order to have considerable macroscopic field you need an ordered drift, and termal motion is not one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Even without superheating, electrons constantly move &quot;inside&quot; the atoms, which should also produce the magnetic field. Why, then, everything around us is not magnetic?</p>
</li>
<li>As you may (or may not) know, there's such thing as Curie point: when you heat a magnet (even a very strong one), upon reaching certain temperature magnetic properties are suddenly lost, and even cooling the resulting un-magnetized lump of metal down will not turn it back into a magnet. How does it prove (or disprove) your claim?</li>
</ol>
<p>Take this as coming from postgraduate physicist specialized in the non-quantum electromagnetic processes.</p>
<p>Also, keep me excused on incorrect wording (if it's there) and crappy use of the articles (which is surely there) - English is neither my first language, nor second one.</p>
<p>EDIT: formatting</p>
<p>EDIT2: added a quote to make the context more clear</p></div>		</li>

<p>What makes you think there is no macroscopic flow to the molten core? The planet is spinning, therefore there are Coriolis forces in play.  There are magma currents just like there are ocean currents and air currents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is macroscopic flow in the molten core, but would you please care to read the comment I was replying to? The dude was talking about termal motion, which is always chaotic and my reply was considering that part. (Just did a ninja edit of my initial reply to add the quote to relevant claim)</p>
<p>IIRC, being chaotic is the definition of termal motion.</p>
<p>Circular(-ish) flow of liquid part of the core is not termal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is saying there is no macroscopic flow to the example given:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a massive amount of metal, molten and flowing with heat and pressure, and you get a significant amount of electron movement, and a resulting electromagnetic field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe he agrees that Earth's magnetic field is caused by this phenomenon, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could take that one step further too. Potentially conclude that the tension on the molten materials around the core causes them to spin around the core and effectively turn it into one massive electromagnet.</p>
<p>And with respect to the cores spin, much like the Sun it would have a wobble to it, which very slowly over time would cause the poles to shift. What we call declination, showing the current orientation of the core.</p>
<p>Much like the Suns Core wobbles, but not nearly as apparent or obvious without significant time for observation.</p>
<p>Also, when you superheat a magnet, all you are doing is destabilizing it's molecular alignment. When it cools, the molecules simply settle in a pattern befitting their environment. Generally speaking, a non-magnetic one, or one with very low magnetism. An electromagnet functions by aligning the electron charge of the metal to a polar one, while a magnet functions by effectively aligning the molecules in such a way that it achieves the same effect without electricity being used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ordered drift would be from the motion of the planets core in this case. I don't expect molten metal around the core to be completely random in its movement, or the core itself not to be moving.</p>
<p>I expect it is spinning, and that will create tension on the molten metals and elements around it, creating a degree of ordered flow. That aside however, electrons moving from atom to atom is not the same as electrons spinning around the nucleus of an atom.</p>
<p>It's the transfer of electrons across atoms in metals that makes up electrical current, which is what generates an electromagnetic field. Something which you can find around any active electrical circuit, in varying degrees of strength, based on the power flowing through that circuit.</p>
<p>Heating metal causes these electrons to transfer from atom to atom within the metal at an accelerated rated, and generates electrical current, which produces electromagnetic fields around metals which are not normally magnetic.</p>
<p>So whether heat eventually cancels out a natural magnetic field is somewhat irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the magnetic poles, but the magnetic flux lines which don't follow the poles and move all the time.</p>
<p>If you were to look at the magnetic fields and flux lines around the planet it actually looks very similar to the Suns Corona activity.</p></div>		</li>
