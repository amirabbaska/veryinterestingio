			<div class="markdown"><p>Ibuprofen is bad in large and repeated doses, so small occasional doses for the odd headache is fine, and these doses will last longer than aspirin. </p>
<p>Aspirin, by design, can be taken in reasonable doses (consult with a physician as to what that means for you) for long periods of time, hence why some older folk are instructed to take a baby aspirin a day to reduce the risk of heart attacks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're taking it for pain relief, ibuprofen has far less side effects. </p>
<p>Aspirin is used as an antiplatelet therapy to prevent strokes and the likes, but when used for this purpose, it's given as a &quot;Low dose&quot;; i.e. at a dosage far too low to cause analgesia (pain relief), but also so low that it doesn't really cause any notable side effects.</p>
<p>I.e., at 400 mg (pain relief dose), aspirin has more side effects, but at 75-125 mg (too low dose to give pain relief), aspirin reduces platelets whilst ibuprofen does nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your health needs! I have to take a daily blood thinner so am advised to take neither aspirin nor ibuprofen. I live for acetaminophen! Just in case anyone wanted to throw a 3rd part into this and make it more confusing :)</p></div>		</li>
