			<div class="markdown"><p>When you put salts (like sodium chloride) into water, it separates into positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chlorine ions. Charged ions tend not to be able to float into or out of cells easily, since the way that cell membranes are made tends not to let things that are charged (or <em>polar</em>, meaning one side of the molecule is more charged versus the other). Because of that, the ions have to either be pumped out using little protein machines or &quot;let&quot; out through special protein channels.</p>
<p>Fish definitely do have to worry about maintaining a balance of various ions from salts like potassium, sodium, and chlorine--just like humans do. This is a major function of the kidneys in fish (and humans!), and it gets really complicated. TBH, I don't know much about the details, but generally the ocean is saltier than blood and rivers/lakes are less salty than blood. Ocean fish have to constantly pump out salt that they're getting into their blood, while freshwater fish have to keep pumping <em>in</em> salt that theyre losing to the water.</p>
<p>If you look up &quot;fish osmoregulation&quot; you can probably find summaries that explain it :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I remember it is that salt water fish &quot;drink&quot; lots of water (and expel excess salt) to keep hydrated, while fresh water fish &quot;drinks&quot; far less to avoid becoming over hydrated and losing salt content.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, it's been a few years since I've learnt about it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but there's more at play when you start looking at how salinity and pressure affect different kinds of fish. Salt in the blood isn't much of a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically diffusion, not osmosis.</p>
<p>Osmosis involves water moving through a membrane when there's a different concentration of stuff dissolved on either side. The dissolved stuff can't get through the membrane, so it doesn't move--only the water. Osmosis is super important in biology, but mostly because of dealing with salt concentrations. </p>
<p>Diffusion is just the natural movement of something from an area of high concentration to low, and thats the major principle at work in gills (and in your lungs!) </p></div>		</li>
