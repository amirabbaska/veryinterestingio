			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: This process is the origin of the phrase, &quot;There'll be The Devil to pay&quot;, except that that is <em>not</em> the full saying. Oh, and it has nothing to do with Satan.</p>
<p>&quot;Paying&quot; is the process of pushing material into the seams between the planks that make up the hull. The most difficult seam to pay was the one between the top of the hull and the underside of the deck. This seam was called The Devil.</p>
<p>The full saying is &quot;There'll be The Devil to pay <em>and no pitch hot.</em>&quot; Which means you have a difficult job ahead and you are under-prepared to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never having done it myself, I can only repeat what I have read.</p>
<p>The planks that make up the hull are in approximately the same plane of movement, so the caulking moves sort of like the things being caulked.</p>
<p>The deck and the hull are two very different things. They are (more or less) at right angles to each other and are constantly moving in opposition / different directions. This means that the joint is highly dynamic in multiple dimensions. Even with modern adhesives caulking a wooden boat so that it is watertight would be difficult. Using only the cotton batting and pitch they had back then it must have been ... The Devil to seal.</p>
<p>And this was only one of many problems they had with wooden ships. Read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_sheathing" target="_blank">copper bottoms</a> for how they dealt with worms in tropical waters that would literally drill holes through the hull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of cottonwoods where I grew up, and every spring they produce these sticky little buds that fall everywhere and are a huge pain in the ass. They get in your pets hair and the only way to get them out is to cut out the clump, they get on your vehicle, and if you try to scrub them off the freaking paint job will wear away before you remove them. </p>
<p>I've also been told by a native friend that they made the best sealant for waterproofing canoes, even these days I doubt you could find a commercial sealant as good as those damn sticky buds.  </p></div>		</li>
