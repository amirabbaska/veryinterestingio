			<div class="markdown"><p>If we crunch the entire universe enough, could we get to a point where the forces of gravity (pushing inwards) and dark energy (pushing forwards) are in balance, like that of a functioning star? Then if possible let's say that that our universe star <em>runs out of fuel</em> (guessing that all of the dark energy turns into space) and the force pushing forwards suddenly stops. Following this wild conjecture would we get an universe nova?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's theoretically possible. In fact, that was the way Einstein originally wanted to deal with the fact that General Relativity predicted expansion or contraction but the universe appeared static, by setting the cosmological constant to a precise value. The thing is that this equilibrium is unstable -if the universe expands the gravity becomes smaller and the dark energy stronger, so it expands forever. If it gets smaller, the opposite happens. But there is nothing analogous to a star possible, because a star is far too dense to avoid collapse if it has a mass close to that of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WHat about the early universe, how did it not collapse into a balck hole then? Form what I understand (which, albeit, is limited), the early universe was a big ball of plasma due to the level of compression. How did that not become a back hole if it was so massive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because, as I said, the universe was expanding, as was space itself. A dynamic spacetime like the universe has no resemblance to a static spacetime like a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, in order to get a black hole you need large local density surrounded by low density. Before the big bang the entire universe was nearly homogenously super dense, so each point had an equal amount of pull in every other direction preventing the collapse into a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After doing the Schwartzchild radius calculation myself, I came up with 4.45x10^22 km, so impressively close. I wasn't aware of that neat rule of thumb where the number of solar masses of an object is almost the same as its Schwartzchild radius. Thanks, faceless internet-goer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the Schwartzchild radius for the Sun is 3 km, so when dealing with orders of magnitude you can just set them equal. It's always good to try to express formulae in terms of some useful reference, i. e., express the radius as 3 km (M/Msun) rather than 2GM/c^(2).</p></div>		</li>
