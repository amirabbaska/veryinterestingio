			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's every few hours and you feel rested, you are probably waking up after a full sleep cycle- during the 'light sleep'phase. It's not as disturbing as if something fell in the house and woke you from a deep sleep.</p>
<p>This is why sometimes you can sleep 3 hours and feel better than if you had slept 4.5 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm like this as well but a while ago I found myself not feeling the same, it turns out the radio talk show I fall asleep to has a commercial with the exact sound of my alarm clock so it was waking me up but my alarm wasn't going off .
People complained and the commercial was taken off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if someone has a day off and wakes up in the wrong sleep cycle, then can they fall back asleep for another half hour or whatever to get to the next cycle to feel properly rested and awake, or will they have to start the whole cycle over again due to waking up even if it's just for few minutes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the dream state is not the first in line and I've often woken up from a dream, fallen back asleep to continue it and then woken up again after 20 to 30 minutes. I think it's possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc a full sleep cycle is around 90 minutes so you can sort of plan around that. </p></div>		</li>
