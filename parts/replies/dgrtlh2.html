			<div class="markdown"><p>The negative mass in that article here is an &quot;effective negative mass&quot; which is a result of the numerous strange behaviours that exotic states of matter like Bose-Einstein condensates display. Transposing classical concepts like mass to these purely quantum states of matter where even the notion of a substantial, individual particle breaks down would be misleading, it's quite different from what's involved in the speculative &quot;negative mass&quot; in general relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is the negative energy described by the potential energy equation a product of creating accurate math (by having potential and kinetic energy sum to 0) while the negative energy of the Alcubierre drive is a physical though theoretical antithesis to positive mass?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That is a byproduct of our definition of the zero point being infinity, but yes, the exact value of potential energy is purely a mathematical result.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters in the real world is the <em>potential difference</em> between two points aka the field between the two points.  </p></div>		</li>
