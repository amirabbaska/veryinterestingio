<p>Let's assume all human representations were not available. No paintings, photographs, or statues. </p>

<p>I liked your post a lot, and I'd like to give an example of where existing evidence gives us a view in what extinct animals may have looked like: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_Spotted_Horses" target="_blank">cave paintings.</a> It was previously unknown that leopard-spotted horses roamed France tens of thousands of years ago, but <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/photogalleries/cave-handprints-actually-women-missions-pictures/" target="_blank">cave paintings at Pech Merle clearly showed them with other creatures we know are realistic.</a> DNA evidence later obtained (in 2011) confirmed this wasn't an imaginary scene, there really were spotted pre-domesticated horses.</p>
<p>With that in mind, there are a lot of statues that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7CZCtSZ.jpg" target="_blank">show hair, ear, and nose shapes</a>... but <a href="http://img.beckett.com/news/news-content/uploads/2013/07/Rushmore.jpg" target="_blank">if Mount Rushmore is the only evidence of our facial characteristics, ears become open to debate.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough, noses seem to break off of statues pretty easily over time.  Many greek statues and even the sphinx are missing the nose.  If human history was a lot different and only those examples survived along with some bones.  I suppose the could infer something was there but could they ever truly get it right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to look at the cave painting page you linked, and tried to read it. It hurt my brain. </p>
<p>&quot;This page has some issues&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leopard Spotted Horses cave paintings - ancient cave paintings of the Stone Age that are among the oldest drawings made by Paleolithic humans, and also serve as evidence of our growing capabilities, what has a great significance in evolutionary sciences.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't disagree with the first part, Wikipedia. </p>
<p>But yes, just imagine the patterns we are missing that could have graced the feathered dinosaurs or even the scaled ones. Another present day example: the lionfish. Yes, there probably would be a good idea of what their form was if ask that was left of them was fossils, but the stripes would be lost. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How would you know what a human genome looked like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Through &quot;whole genome&quot; sequencing. Currently however, that process is only good to about 520 years old though. So we would have to have disappeared pretty suddenly and the &quot;aliens&quot; would have to arrive shortly thereafter. The 520 year mark is just the half life mark though. Theoretically you could combine bits of differing dna where the proteins had not deteriorated yet and make a mutt dna strand that could be synthesized but that's not really in keeping with the spirit of the question. </p></div>		</li>
