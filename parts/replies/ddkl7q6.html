			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, it's far from the least honest thing I've done for money too. Like I've used my SEO skills for companies that actively scammed people. But I've come out of the other end now, full of unending guilt. </p>
<p>In fact when I was churnalising I wasn't like deliberately misleading people. I was told to write two stories for, say, a payday loan company every day. There's not enough positive stuff about payday loans for me to be able to find two fresh new news stories every day, so I would shoehorn payday loans into barely-related stories like I did with e-cigs above. That would occasionally result in me being misleading, borne out of a lack of time / laziness, rather than a desire to scam. I would try to forget about the fact that I was morally opposed to payday loans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and you all are as bad as fake news. </p>
<p>Misleading and ruining actual scientific research by oversaturating the news market. </p>
<p>SAD! </p>
<p>Honestly wish there was an extension to find your name and others on articles and remove them from all searches forever. WAIT, BRB!</p></div>		</li>
