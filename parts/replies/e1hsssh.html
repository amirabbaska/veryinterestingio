			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck that you get an answer to what's going on. Having a diagnosis doesn't &quot;fix&quot; anything yet, but at least it shows a path where to go, what to try next. </p>
<p>If you want to read up a little on trauma problems in general, Babette Rothschild is an experienced traumatherapist who writes understandable and gentle books on the topic. She makes do without triggering case studies and goes with small, everyday examples instead. </p>
<p>People with DID have additional challenges to someone with &quot;just&quot; PTSD, but the basic mechanics are the same and a lot of the ways to control flashbacks, create safe spaces, get out of dissociation, etc. are the same, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some people, this mechanism can also cause schizophrenia, which I guess is related but not the same. It's unlikely everyone with schizophrenia actually suffers from the same illness, so I'm not talking about everybody with schizophrenia, but there is a significant correlation between 'hearing voices' and having suffered childhood sexual abuse.  Some voice hearers identify their voices as the parts of themselves it was too risky to reveal - bits of their personality, and particularly negative emotions, that got shunted off and locked out of their identity in order to keep them safe as children, but which intrude in the form of disembodied voices that seem not to come from themselves when they grow up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be an overlap between what is currently seen as &quot;typical&quot; post-traumatic disorders, schizophrenia, and borderline. With borderline it's a pretty big one, 3/4 of the borderline patients get better with trauma therapy, when 20 years ago that was still considered untreatable (yay, progress!). </p>
<p>With schizophrenia it's a more recent development. Not so clear yet whether some people with schizophrenia actually have &quot;just&quot; a trauma disorder, that manifests differently, or whether it's a mix of two problems. After all, just getting the short stick in one area doesn't mean you can't get another one, or a whole handful of them at once.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those locked-away parts and memories are extremely scary and trauma patients need to learn how to approach them carefully without overloading their minds yet again. It's a skill, there are several techniques to get there (EMDR, imaginary screen, even forms of physical therapy, it's all about staying anchored in the safe place and moment and go look at the scary monster with enough distance). Once people know how to control their mental and emotional state, it can be pretty fast. Not every single traumatic experience needs to be carefully dissected, a few typical ones can be enough and the rest calms down too. The fear what <em>could</em> happen when the memories are brought up is MUCH worse than actually doing it. A good deal of the preparation work is establishing trust between patient and therapist. To approach your worst nightmares you want someone along who is trained, stable and reliable.</p>
<p>Systems are also astonishingly resilient without therapy. As long as they're under stress they keep on functioning, not necessarily in a healthy way or happily, but they do, somehow. The big bang comes when the stress eases off. Their kids moved out, or they retired, or they found a nice, calm place to live and are finally relaxing. I just hope knowledge about complex trauma disorders keeps spreading, so people who think they're going crazy, life is good and still suddenly everything is going haywire, get a diagnosis and treatment faster. At the moment it's still over 5 years between the onset of noticeable symptoms and the correct diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>
