			<div class="markdown"><p>This may seem ignorant of me, but am I supposed to be haggling on my medical bills? I have good insurance b/c my wife is a state employee. We have some bills from doctor visits and prescriptions, and I generally just pay my bills. They honestly don't amount to much more than $100ish for some doctor visits (had an MRI trip + a few other tests that after insurance cost us $700ish bucks). Should I be haggling these prices? The one time we had that $700ish bill we just paid them in like 3 different installments just to keep the burden on our budget minimal. Other than that we get a medical bill, glance at it to make sure it makes somewhat sense, and then put it in our budget spreadsheet to be paid the next month. We don't haggle or argue them. Should I start doing that or just count our blessings for the good insurance and pay our bills?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer is no, you should not.</p>
<p>There's two routes the medical bills can take. One is insurance route and another is true self-pay. Once you use your insurance, you cannot haggle anything unless you are at a privately owned physician's clinic. Hospital bills and physician bills are separate and you always have a better chance to haggle the physician fee down (because at small clinics, you often deal with the doc that will get your money).</p>
<p>If you take the true self-pay route (no insurance or choose not to use insurance), you can haggle for prices. Usually the hospital will even OFFER discounts even before you ask because hospitals know that self-pays are an omen for a bad-debt, a lingo we use to describe a patient's bill that couldn't be paid by anyone. Usual standard is 10-20% discount MINIMUM up front if you pay out of pocket. This is to insure that hospital get at least some money and not nothing. </p>
<p>There are also various charity programs that hospitals will try to enroll you into, especially if your bill is pretty high (say, &gt;$25,000). </p>
<p>You gotta understand that the hospital is often the victim in the healthcare situation. Physicians will always try to save a life. No physician will discriminate against a poor. All hospitals, for or non profits, have separate budget for charity and it does get eaten up quite a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I'm not poor and so I don't really have any need or plan to haggle down my prices. I just wondered if it was common practice even for people who can afford it. Started to feel like when I go to garage sales. I once went with all my mom, grandma, and my great aunt and uncle and they would just make fun of me at everyone for paying full price.</p>
<p>Only time I've really complained is having them re-classify a physical I took as preventative care so that my insurance covered it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have good insurance, there's generally very little wiggle room on what you can haggle down, and it's better to just pay the bill and avoid collections.</p>
<p>That said, if you offer to pay with cash up front and not bill to your insurance provider, the office will generally offer a significantly discounted rate.  The problem is sometimes it's difficult to project exactly what you'll be responsible for after applying the insurance allowable (i.e. the final price you would have paid after insurance), so this discounted rate may not actually be saving as much as you'd expect.</p>
<p>This is also true if you have no insurance.  The hospital I work for offers up to 90% off charges up front if you have no insurance.  That's mainly because if they send a bill to an uninsured patient with $1,000 on it, they'll never see a cent.  So if they offer to drop it to $100 up front, they may see a few cents on the dollar (e.g. $20 or something, which is better than nothing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not usually. Sometimes you can get an appointment billed at a lower level if it was obviously billed incorrectly, so it's worth speaking to a hospital billing department. As a billing coordinator for a hospital, I suggest asking why an appointment was billed the way it was before jumping right into &quot;Don't you think that's awfully expensive? The doctor only saw us for ten minutes.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. The hospital thing makes me nervous. Weird story and I'm sure my details are off... In my somewhat younger days, I was still on my parent's insurance and I got a kidney stone, had no idea what it was at first so I went to minor emergency and ended up getting an MRI. A few hundred bucks later I thought I had paid it off. I kept getting medical bills for like $409 and I called twice and they said that I had paid it off. Finally got a letter threatening to send me to collections, called them, and turns out I had miswrote my check and I was $5 off. They were going to send me to collections over $5! Every time I called they were real nice and helpful, but something about their system was off because they couldn't seem to figure out what I owed. Just scared me that I could've gotten a hit on my credit score over a few bucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just tacking onto this response because I agree with both your points and want to add a third that I'm aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because of a history of large malpractice lawsuits pretty much every doctor is required to have malpractice insurance, which is very expensive. They then push the cost onto the patients. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most don't realize that malpractice insurance costs are out of control for many specialties. I've seen countless practices fold because they simply could not afford to pay near-seven figure annual malpractice insurance premiums (as one of many examples, a few years back a small practice in FL folded in the face of a $900,000/year premium with no prior malpractice claims against).  </p>
<p>Consumers ultimately bear these costs for those medical professionals/hospitals that can survive them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also because of malpractice litigation, among other factors, everything takes much more time and effort than it used to for medical providers. Increased documentation requirements, double and triple checking measures, and defensive medicine practices are all part of this. Americans have, at times, demanded perfection from medicine. They may not yet be getting it, but they're paying for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical liability system costs, which includes things such as malpractice insurance and defensive medicine, aren't as high as you probably think.  2.4% ($55.6 billion) of healthcare spending isn't anything to sneeze at, but it's not exactly the burden on the sytem that many believe it to be.  I linked the [study] (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048809/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048809/</a>) so you can review if you'd like, though note it is from 2010.</p></div>		</li>
