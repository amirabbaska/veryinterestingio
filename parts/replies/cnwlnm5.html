			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth mentioning is that USB C will be about the size of current Micro USB or Lightning plugs, despite being reversible <em>and</em> having the added pins, power and bandwidth.</p>
<p>And for the first time you'll be able to have the same connector at both ends of the USB cable, so the whole cable can be reversed end to end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thunderbolt is a PCIX breakout, it has practical limits to usefulness (there are cable length limits on 40gbps), and the previous versions have SERIOUS security flaws since they access the mobo directly.  I doubt this would be their one connector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty early days.  The spec is finalised now (as of 2014).  I haven't been able to find which manufacturers are on board yet or what their timeframes are.  But I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no word yet on when we’ll see motherboards and add-in cards shipping with USB 3.1 support, but current rumors point to late 2015 or early 2016. Type-C connectors could ship more quickly, since the cable standard is compatible with pre-existing USB chipsets.</p>

<p>Personally I think Lightning was vastly superior to that clunky 30-pin connector they used for years, and it's certainly better than mini or micro USB, so it wasn't a complete waste of time.  But USB C is streets ahead of all of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And still, a lot of people call apple's switch to the lightning port a &quot;cash grab&quot;. Forget that they used the same port for 13 or so years in a time when every phone had a different charger. Hell, even smart phones switched from mini usb to micro usb in the time that the iphone had the old port. I think switching to usb c could be pretty trivial as we mostly only have cheap chargers now and not expensive docks for our cars and stereos since it's all wireless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would help if they didn't try to prevent anyone else from making a compatible cable at first. The cable could have been designed such that a simple &quot;dumb&quot; cable would work for at least charging, or charging plus data. Apple didn't do that, so that they could make more money off of licensing. </p>
<p>Normal phones moving from one standard to another that utilize simple, inexpensive, standardized ubiquitous cables is not that same as moving from one proprietary cable to an even more proprietary cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty typical of the way people deal with apple. The shit only sticks to them. Foxconn makes chips for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn#Major_customers" target="_blank">basically everyone</a>, but all the articles paint it as apple's workers working in shitty conditions. I heard someone in a thread complain about just what you said, apple cash grabbing by constantly changing its connector. Which had happened...once. Never mind what every other company did during the time period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except moving from mini usb to micro usb was switching from one standard port to another standard port (for which countless manufacturers could make adapters). Whereas Apple moved from one proprietary port to another proprietary port.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. From a durability standpoint, the Lightning connector appears far better than USB C: the Lightning plug is solid, where USB C slots around a board on the device, much like HDMI. Will this be a problem in practice? I have no idea (I've yet to destroy an HDMI port, but those don't get plugged and unplugged very often), but in terms of pure mechanical stability it's clear which is better. It's also worth noting that if anything breaks, it would be on the device rather than the cable which means an expensive repair rather than a cheap replacement.</p>
<p>Having said that, the new reversibility is a tie, physical size appears about equal, and both the bandwidth and (supposed) power capacity are a huge improvement. So assuming the USB C connectors don't end up being overly fragile, it's probably a net win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power is limited by the type of metal used in both the cable and the plug, diameter of the wire, whether it's stranded or solid, whether mixed with strands of another material, etc.  Data is limited by number of wires, shielding, and again the specific meterials.  There is a huge range of possibilities even on a small connector.</p></div>		</li>
