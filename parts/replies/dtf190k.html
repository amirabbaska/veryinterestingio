			<div class="markdown"><p>Even some background extras (who are in a union) will get residuals, but not much. My old roommate would just get random checks in the mail from TV shows he did years ago ranging from $12 to just pennies. I think you get less and less every time the episode is broadcast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a buddy who sold some comics and would get tiny residual checks from time to time. He'd get a check for $8 and sigh and say &quot;box of wine&quot; in a glum voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal story - I did a commercial and got a pre-determined certain amount of money for it, and wasn't going to get any more. They decided to run the commercial again the NEXT year, and because of the contract, I was paid the exact same amount again because they were re-running it.</p>
<p>Basically, it really depends on the contract set up. If they had said &quot;Okay, now we own this and you have nothing to do with it&quot;, I would likely have not have gotten the money a second time, but something in the contract meant I got more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An ex-friend (we simply lost touch) of mine did a Pepsi commercial (the one where on a dare the guy drinks everything offered on a train, but then throws up his hands when offered a Coke). It was shot for use on cable TV (used to run on MTV a lot), but then Pepsi wanted to use it in Europe, so they offered him a flat $5,000 payment vs residuals. </p>
<p>He took the $5K, moved back East with his fianc√© and used the money as a downpayment on a Dominoes franchise. Last I heard from him (like 20 years ago), he was already up to owning 3 stores and never acted again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an extension of this, it works similarly for writers as well.  Some get paid for piece-work, others get a residual.</p>
<p>I have a friend who wrote an utterly crap movie, made almost no money when it came out, but he still gets residual checks totalling low five-figures a year because the DVD sells well in Brazil.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I not word good.</p></div>		</li>
