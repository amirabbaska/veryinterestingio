			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the point about math being unaffected:</p>
<p>It is the computations of astrophysics which gives us all we know about dark matter, so OP's question is nonsensical to begin with. If we figure out what dark matter is, it will be because physics led us to the discovery, so it makes no sense that the discovery would change what we know about physics and math.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be insulting, it's just that the question shows a fundamental lack of understanding about what dark matter is, and how we came to begin searching for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i don't think the question is asking whether basic calculus will stop being true. It's totally possible that whatever we learn from figuring out dark matter will inspire new mathematical concepts. It won't change whether anything is true or false, but it could totally be what leads mathematicians to developing new math.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's certainly not impossible, but historically the opposite has been true (kind of), where physicists find that the behavior of some mathematical structure that mathematicians have been studying for a long time just happens to fit in with their observations of the physical world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's asking if it turns out that dark matter consists of something we didn't expect or is not feasible to our current understanding of physics, how would we cope or how drastic a change would it have to be.</p>
<p>It is a question that requires a lot of unknown variables to be really answered, but it's an interesting jumping-off point. Not everyone has the diction to phrase a question in a way that satisfies those qualified to answer it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally true that maths is independent of Physics, but how we discover and verify maths hasn't been independent of physics for a while now. Here, for example, is a wonderful article about how physics and maths are helping each other discover new properties about some pretty outlandish mathematical structures: <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160804-miranda-cheng-moonshine-string-theory/" target="_blank">https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160804-miranda-cheng-moonshine-string-theory/</a></p>
<p>Not that this in any way contradicts your core truth, and there's a good argument here that the article I linked is talking theoretical physics and not experimental physics like the OP's question asks about. I don't know offhand whether there are any examples of experiments discounting a theory which in turn alters out understanding of maths, which would be more directly relevant to your observation. </p>
<p>This comment is more supplemental than any attempt to say you were wrong at all : )</p></div>		</li>
