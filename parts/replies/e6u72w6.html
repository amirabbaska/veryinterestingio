<p>This isn't triggering fusion, but it's another janky variable star. White dwarf slurps material off its binary partner red giant, and makes &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;mini&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; Nova's on a regular basis, from days to decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass threshold is more of a temperature and pressure threshold. Those things absolutely can oscillate (certain types of stellar eruption and supernovae are caused by this and variable stars are extremely common). Also, the 'mass' threshold drops the more metals the star contains, and fusion produces metals. </p>
<p>I guess the tldr is it's not that simple and I don't think anyone knows the actual answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean this doesn’t necessarily cover stars at all ages does it? What OP is describing is almost by definition the moments before massive stars go supernova, with oscillations between fusion and no fusion. Lyrae Variable stars I believe? Been a few years since an astronomy class. And minus some few technicalities (like there is more than one type of fusion reaction going on at different “levels” or shells so there are multiple “thresholds”) they behave almost exactly as op described with shorter and shorter oscillations until eventually boom!</p></div>		</li>
