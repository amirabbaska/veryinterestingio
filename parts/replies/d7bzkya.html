			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at an <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg" target="_blank">all-sky image</a>, the LMC that hosted SN1987A is the larger of the two fluffy things south of the Milky Way. It's a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way (may or may not be gravitationally bound).</p></div>		</li>

<p>And thank you for all the cool info you posted!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I blow the color contrast all the way up on this picture of the galaxy and increase the saturation a ton, I start seeing giant billowy cloud like structures that I don't think are artifacts of the image itself, but I'm not sure what they are. I can't access imgur currently, but see if you can see it yourself. Maybe it's dust or gas </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How could it not be gravitationally bound? In the image it seems to be much closer to the galactic center than we are. Is it much farther away on the z-axis than is evident in the image?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently none in our galaxy, though.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1987A" target="_blank">1987A</a> was in the Large Magellanic Cloud (a nearby dwarf galaxy).</p></div>		</li>
