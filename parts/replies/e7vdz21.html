			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright thanks!
This kinetic energy comes from the neutron released by the fission right?
What about the fusion case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically it gets converted to heat over a few intermediate steps (mainly collisions with other atoms).</p>
<p>In principle you can use the kinetic energy of some produced particles more directly, but that is limited to a few special applications. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betavoltaic_device" target="_blank">Betavoltaics</a> is an example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the particles slow down in the medium in which they exist, their kinetic energy gets converted to energy in the form of heat.  Remember, total energy is always conserved, so the remaining energy of the moving particles has to go somewhere if they slow down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, definitely not x-rays. But anyway, photons carry kinetic energy too. My comment doesn’t distinguish between massless particles and massive particles. Both can result from nuclear reactions. However photons coming from nuclear reactions are going to be gamma rays, not x-rays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually depends on the fusion reactor. In small scale (sometimes amateur) fusors, most of the energy put into the reactor is lost through the electrons removed from the D or T atom in order to accelerate the deuterons towards each other. The electrons will be repelled by the negative voltage ion &quot;trap&quot; and hit the wall of the reactor chamber, and the brehmsstralung will often be x-ray.</p></div>		</li>
