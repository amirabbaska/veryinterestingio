			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine has just been diagnosed with this, however hers is in the brain, so unfortunately no transplant is available.</p>
<p>It's absolutely mind blowing how fast she deteriorated. Perfectly normal 23 year old start of the year, now she can't even speak a basic sentence. </p>
<p>Copper is very dangerous to the unlucky few who have Wilson's disease in the brain. The sooner it's caught the better, get your children checked people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it can show up in the liver or brain unfortunately.  If it’s in the brain they look for kreischer fleischer rings around the iris of your eye, which is a ring of copper.  I’m very sorry about your friend. </p></div>		</li>
