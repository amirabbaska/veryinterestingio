			<div class="markdown"><p>What that article doesn't really discuss is that those two camps are related, and even intertwined.  To be more precise, the term &quot;knot&quot; is not a medical term nor does it have a definition.  Myofascial trigger points do actually exist and can be seen on scans, but they are not always pathological.  Other aches and pains can be attributed to fascial adhesion, which don't show up on scans.</p>
<p>I would personally consider most knots to be muscle spasms, but this can only limited to a few fibers, which could be why they don't always show up on ultrasounds.  You'd need a microscope to see them, but they still hurt like hell.  Call these trigger points or meridian lines or whatever you want.  My theory is that they originate from some trauma, and are then exacerbated by the GTO (golgi tendon organ) feedback loop.  An ELI5 for that is your tendon reflexes.  If you're sitting down and someone hits your patellar tendon(below your kneecap) with a reflex hammer, your leg will kick out.  This is because the GTO detects it's being stretched suddenly and causes the muscle to contract.  All muscles have this system.  </p>
<p>So, your muscle gets tight really fast.  This is often to protect you from injury.  It stays tight for a while, and the GTO gets stretched.  The GTO sends the signal to the muscle to contract more.  Repeat.  This is broken by dry needling the contracted fibers, deep massage or, my favorite, Strain-counterstrain which interrupts the GTO loop.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  A knot can mean a lot of things.  If it's truly a tight muscle, it's likely to be a spasm, which can be caused by a lot of things.  </p>
<p>EDIT:  I meant to say the myotactic reflex, not GTO.  Brain fried from too much work lately.  Sorry.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure a trigger point that can be palpated isn't so small that you need a microscope to see it. Massage therapists have very sensitive hands, but think about it. I'm saying this as a massage therapist for what its worth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so your post got me doing some searching and thinking. I don't know if this is something you would know about or not, but I figured what the hell. I'll ramble on a bit, and if you have anything to add, clarify, thoughts, etc. that would be great! If this is beyond your knowledge right now, no worries. I'm just wanting to type out my thoughts here. </p>
<p>I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobile Type, a genetic condition caused by a defect in collagen production/synthesis/etc. Put simply, &quot;faulty collagen.&quot; Our collagen has increased elasticity, so we aren't able to 'resist deformation' as easily as a normal person can. For example, the Classical Type of EDS has &quot;rubber skin&quot; - it looks normal, but you can stretch it really far out. The Hypermobile Type has numerous hypermobile joints. There is often crossover between the types (there are more than just the two, but those are the most common types). Organs and other parts of the body are often affected as well. Mitral valve prolapse is common, and so are GI issues. </p>
<p>So people with EDS have many issues. For the Hypermobile Type the most notable problem is having loose joints that spontaneously sublux and dislocate, which results in chronic pain. This can happen many times in one day, and it happens throughout the night while sleeping too. EDSers also have endless muscle spasms. Seriously - if I left my body to its own devices and didn't do anything about it, I can have spasms that last for 10 years. Before I was diagnosed, this actually happened. </p>
<p>I try to read a lot of academic journal articles on EDS, but I've never found any mention of the GTO. Almost all the articles I've read that address muscle spasms in EDS say that they are likely caused from the muscles overcompensating for joints that are subluxed or dislocated, and the muscles are working extra hard to keep our skeleton in place. I'm sure that this is accurate, but I wonder if there are also other things that cause these spasms or contribute to them. I get spasms all the time when I don't have a sublux or dislocation, as well as muscle twitches. I know everyone gets them, but EDSers get them more than the average person.</p>
<p>Something else that really stood out for me is the fact that the GTO is a proprioceptive sensory receptor organ. It is a well established fact that people with EDS are clumsy. Not just at sports - we walk into doorways, tables, etc. in our own homes when we are wide awake and all the lights are on. It happens all the time, and it's one of the things that doctor's look for when confirming a diagnosis of EDS. </p>
<p>One of the more recent articles I was reading said that no one knows why EDSers have poor proprioception. The prevailing theory is that because of our constant dislocations/subluxes, our joints are not always in the same physical space. We aren't able to account for these little differences that are constantly changing. Since we live with these changes happening all the time, small changes that would be noticable to others isn't noticed at all by someone with EDS. That may be correct, but it is only a theory right now. </p>
<p>I wonder if there is any research into EDS and the GTO with regard to proprioception. It could very well be that the GTO plays a role in the proprioception issues, in conjunction with the prevailing theory, since what I am learning says that the GTO is stimulated to stretch when the surrounding muscle contracts or when there is a passive stretch. When someone with EDS passively stretches, and especially when they do anything with force, there is always a really good chance that joints will move out of place and/or a muscle spasm will occur. There are specific arm stretches I can't do that aren't that challenging at all, but will cause intense spasms in my neck and shoulder.  </p>
<p>Like I said, I'm just looking up information about the GTO for the first time, so if anything I am saying sounds wildly off track, please say so. I wanted to get my thoughts down so I can come back to this later on and search medical journals for this kind of information (if it exists). I find it all very fascinating! </p>
<p>As for the original ELI5, I wonder if research into EDS would help medical professionals find out what &quot;knots&quot; actually are, or at the very least, help in determining what they are not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually worked with some EDS patients, and it's well within my scope of knowledge.  </p>
<p>With regards to your question about proprioception, I'm afraid I don't have any answers either.  I can see how the myotactic reflex/GTO system could play a part, but I just don't know enough about the cellular chemistry of EDS.  It's true that joint positioning plays a role in proprioception, and tiny changes do make a difference.  The example I use when discussing our balance system is that if you close your eyes, you can still balance on one foot because your joints are detecting these miniscule changes and sending feedback to your vestibular system to keep you upright.  So I can see how with EDS patients with laxity in joints could be affected.  But again, I'm just not sure.  Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ayup.  Knot, is a generic term basically meaning &quot;stiff lump&quot;.  It can be a spasm, it can be an inflamed tear/bruise/injury, it can even be scar tissue...or a combination.  For example:  An injury or errant signal can cause a spasm, and a sustained spasm can cause a kind of scarring(an ill healed build up).</p>
<p>Saying &quot;nobody knows&quot; isn't really accurate, it is that we mistakenly include all causes under one generic and vague all-purpose word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha this is hilarious. Sort of unrelated, but reminded me of a story my mom told me of a patient of hers (she's a neurologist) who had some sort of psychosis or cognitive issue which caused him to only describe his symptoms from the perspective of a car...I know this sounds crazy, but essentially the guy related every part of his body to a part of a car, and couldn't describe symptoms other than relating them to some complex and little-known car parts (he was a mechanic). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's not wrong, we're biological machines.  I don't see sensors coming any time soon though.  Closest thing to a diagnosis is going to be tests: blood, stress, scans, exams, etc.  Try explaining that to him.  Sometimes the oil is bad, so you've got to try a different grade or a different brand.  Maybe the calibrator needs to be cleaned out.  Is he doing the regular maintenance - oil changes, tire rotation, calibrations, corrosion checks?  If a car isn't getting enough air, may need to get a special filter.  And, he should know this better than anyone - older cars need more maintenance and that some times includes special additives, seal replacements, and replacing parts or getting them overhauled.</p>
<p>The human body is a very complex machine that runs on the same principles as a car.  We may someday get to where we can just plug in and get a run down of what's going on, but that's going to take a lot of sensors added to our body.  Currently the only sensors we have are our nervous system.  It's a complex system with very simple alerts, but honestly it's not that much different than sensors on a car - over-pressure, breakage, overheating, etc.  Eventually even sensors need to be replaced to give accurate information, but on cars most of that time is either working: Yes or No?  If no, usually the only diagnosis is replacing what's not working because it's beyond the point of maintenance.</p>
<p>Again, he's not wrong per se, but if he's going to have that attitude he should apply the same logic to himself.  My grandfather is a mechanic and he's said the same thing, but he's also a stickler for his own body maintenance.</p></div>		</li>

It has been shown to relieve cramps around <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/phys-ed-can-pickle-juice-stop-muscle-cramps/?_r=0" target="_blank">37% faster than water</a>.</p>
<p>I also had read a study a while back of where they tried the different parts of pickle juice to see which was the underlining reason. They tried the salt content with salt water, and ect. Eventually they tried Vinegar and found it was actually faster than the pickle juice alone. However, try as I might, the link I had saved died on my old computer, and I can't remember how I came upon it. So I have no source on that, just my memory. :( </p></div>		</li>
