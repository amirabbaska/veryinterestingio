<p>I think technically the specific shades you need to get every other color out of subtractive lighting are magenta instead of red and cyan instead of blue (and yellow is still yellow).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>YES! That's why with graphics and computer monitors (additive) you speak about RGB (RedGreenBlue) and with printing (subtractive) you speak about CMYK (CyanMagentaYellowKey) </p>
<p>edit: And key is mostly black but can be any color.  Thx to /u/nrj for explaining it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The &quot;K&quot; in CMYK stands for key because in four-color printing, cyan, magenta, and yellow printing plates are carefully keyed, or aligned, with the key of the black <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_plate" target="_blank">key plate</a>. Some sources suggest that the &quot;K&quot; in CMYK comes from the last letter in &quot;black&quot; and was chosen because B already means blue. However, this explanation, although useful as a mnemonic, is incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, your key can be a color than black.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you have is a red, green and blue pixel. The red pixel is just red colored glass which is obviously again made by subtracting all the unwanted colors out of white light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are taught - but as secondary colors, because they are made of combinations of primary (red, green, and blue colors). I'd also like to mention that the reason RGB are the true primary colors are because those are the colors the photoreceptor cells in your eyes are tuned to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a little bit. </p>
<p>The reason we always have three colours is because most people have three different types of receptors which produce colour vision (cones). </p>
<p>The only thing that matters perceptually is the relative activity of these three cone populations. You can <a href="http://www.science4all.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cones.png" target="_blank">look at roughly how sensitive these cones are here</a> and imagine how pure light (of a single wavelength) would produce different levels of activity in each group based on where it falls on the spectrum.</p>
<p>What makes it interesting is that it doesn't matter whether you stimulate the cones with a mix of 3 pure(ish) lights or have power across the spectrum, so long as the resulting activity in your cone populations is the same, the colour will be indistinguishable. </p>
<p>This property is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_\(color\)" target="_blank">metamerism</a>. When lights with very different spectral power distributions (i.e., what <em>type</em> of light), actually look the same to us. If we actually perceived the full pattern of light, TVs etc. wouldn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor note: You can't create any color you want by adding red, green, and blue.  You can just create lots of colors.  Do a search for &quot;color gamut&quot;.  You'll see a weird parabola, those are all of the colors we can perceive.  If you mix RGB (or any three colors), you can create any color in a triangle inside the parabola.  You can't get the whole parabola, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The &quot;ProPhoto RGB&quot; triangle actually goes outside the parabola in some places, even though it doesn't cover the whole thing. </p>
<p>If you had an RGB monitor with super super high contrast, then would it cover the whole parabola?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ProPhoto RGB space uses imaginary primaries (they lie outside of the chromaticity diagram). It's a mathematical model, you cannot build actual monitors with those.</p>
<p>Brightness can actually be an issue, too. A deep red spectral color, such as ProPhoto's red, looks very dim to our eyes, which makes it problematic to use as primary for physical displays.</p>
<p>And no, a triangle of a physically possible color space will never be able to cover the entire parabola. But we're getting better. Compare the old <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/CIExy1931_Rec_709.svg" target="_blank">Rec.709 (HDTV)</a> color space to the new <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/CIExy1931_Rec_2020.svg" target="_blank">Rec.2020 UltraHD</a> one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Colors outside the parabola simply don't exist, they are &quot;imaginary colors&quot;.  When you have an RGB monitor, the Red, Green, and Blue points of the triangle each have to be somewhere inside the parabolaâ€¦ which means that it's impossible to cover the entire parabola with only RGB.</p>
<p>Contrast is an unrelated issue.</p></div>		</li>
