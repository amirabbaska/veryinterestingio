			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people are going to gloss over your &quot;one factor in getting Myopia&quot; and go into the rest thinking it's all lack of natural light. A lot of it is hereditary as well. Everyone in my immediate family is near sighted, parents and siblings. We grew up in a rural area, and were always outside. I was the last of my siblings to get glasses in high school. We didn't get our first computer until a year or two before, and we only had 4-6 channels on TV, so not much to watch. Light is just one of several factors in getting Myopia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar experience, grew up in rural Missouri, outside all the time because no internet, no cable, very few channels on tv, no video games. Needed glasses before I got through middle school. All immediate family has vision problems, and if I had to guess probably over half of extended family does too. </p>
<p>I used to stare at the sun though. That probably wasn't a good idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a known inverse correlation between natural light exposure and nearsightedness (less natural light exposure = more nearsightedness) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22669720" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22669720</a>) but... people who read/watch TV/do other fixed-focus activities (where you are looking at something that is a fixed distance from your face for an extended period, e.g. building models or whatever) frequently also tend to stay inside more, so they tend to be exposed to less natural light. So is natural light a causative factor or an indication of lifestyle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The studies that are linked in the article have a semi-experimental setting: So yes we can speak of causation : less natural light -&gt; more nearsightedness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was recently diagnosed with short sight and i have to say i do look at screens a lot and don't get out much :P</p>
<p>Although my grandma has also been shortsighted since her teens and my dad is long sighted so it could be genetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do some testing. If you use a computer take a laptop to a park. Do what you need to in the sunlight but keep looking at the screen all day then check for any difference. For science.</p>
<p>Unless there's already research on this. In which case I welcome links, and do it anyway for funsies?</p></div>		</li>
