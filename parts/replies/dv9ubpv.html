			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-28_Hound_Dog" target="_blank">AGM-28 Hound Dog</a> is a perfect example of this. It was a nuclear cruise missile that used the same jet engine that was on the A-4 and A-6. When it was mounted on B-52s it was used to provide additional thrust to shorten takeoff. Once in the air the Hound Dog would be refuelled from the B-52's tanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true, that's not really applicable to the conversation.</p>
<p>Air-to-Air missiles are universally solid-fuel rocket motors. You only get one ignition...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They made specific bits of kit for this called JATO (Jet Assisted Take Off)  rockets. They're pods of fuel that are fixed to an aircraft to give it a boost to help it take off. I mean that's pretty much a missile but without the warhead, right?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you actually feel a difference in control and/or performance in real time? Like if you were to suddenly drop a bunch of weight in ordinance or fuel or whatever, do you actually feel lighter and more nimble up there? What kind of control feedback do you get? Is it entirely digital and you just know you are faster based on the numbers or is there some sort of force-feedback mechanism like in gaming joysticks?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what/how much weight/drag you’re dropping. I’ve dropped a 2000lbs weapon from the right wing of an F-16 with a remaining 2000lbs weapon on the left wing. You can feel the jet trying to roll toward the heavier wing. It’s manageable. You could even land that way if needed. </p>
<p>If you drop both of those 2000lbs weapons simultaneously you will certainly feel the weight come off and the jet seem momentarily more buoyant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% yes. The stick still feels the same, but the jet responds better to your inputs. Crisper roll, faster onset of G, better climb and energy addition.</p></div>		</li>
