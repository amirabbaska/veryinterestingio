It's a relatively slow-moving cancer and you'll probably get it at the end of your life. When you're older, it's probably not what's going to kill you, but the treatment will.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It shook me for a few weeks, then I learned that pretty much every male gets it I. Their 60's, but it rarely causes any problem or death, apart from a very weak piss stream.</p></div>		</li>

No advances, no adaptation, no new genes of any kind. The organism would just stagnate until the environment changed to the point where it could no longer survive and go extinct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. With cells in an organism you want 100% perfect copies every time, because they're the same organism. Doesn't make sense to have a mutation just in your pinky or something, no matter how beneficial it might be. The only time imperfect copying is a potentially good thing is in reproduction, and it should be possible for an organism to have near 100% perfect replication of its own cells while still allowing for errors in its reproductive cells, because they're created through a different mechanism in most species with sexual reproduction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The mechanism for copying of DNA in the formation gametes (meiosis) is the same as in the formation of somatic cells (mitosis). The difference is that in mitosis you copy the DNA then divide into two cells, but in meiosis those two cells then divide again (without replicating DNA), so there are only half the chromosomes in each resulting cell. The process of dividing is not affected by the process of replicating DNA, and vice versa.  </p>

<p>While it /can/ be a good thing, the vast majority of the time it is either neutral or bad, which means a net cost to fitness for valuable offspring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Cancer is a byproduct of cellular division, which can sometimes be associated with mutation. When your cells divide, they go through an incredibly complicated process known as mitosis which involves several protein pathways as well as regulatory steps. Over the history of life, cells have gotten VERY good at replicating themselves without making mistakes, and there are many &quot;checkpoints&quot; during cellular division where the cell can ask itself if it is ready to proceed to the next step of division. Unfortunately, because of the complexity of the process and the sheer number of cells, mistakes sometimes happen, and cancer is the result. Sometimes this can occur because there is some sort of DNA transcription error, and some regulatory protein that normally prevents cellular division is no longer being produced. Other times, DNA inside a replicating cell might just not line up correctly, or sister chromatids might not separate correctly.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that mutation is not an adaptation, it is a complete accident in DNA replication and production. Sometimes, DNA mutations can lead to some advantageous traits that then must be selected for via natural selection. But mutation by itself isn't an adaptation, and very few mutations actually end up being beneficial. It just so happens that natural selection is great at picking out good mutations from bad ones and allowing them to be happy mistakes instead of disastrous mistakes.  </p>
<p>In asexaul organisms who produce identical copies of eachother, mutations are actually a very serious problem. With no sexual reproduction to create new gene combinations, mutations spread from daughter cell to daughter cell throughout an asexual population. This build of up mutations, known as Mullers Ratchet, is one of the main reasons sexual reproduction evolved.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of mutations do absolutely nothing. They are known as silent mutations. A small handful can be deleterious (bad) and an even smaller handful can be beneficial. Despite the low chance of developing a new gene that helps the individual, this pay out is well worth the risk of cancer or any of the other negative mutations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is more subtle. DNA replication conditions in somatic tissues (that become cancerous) and the germline (that make gametes to produce offspring) could be different if needed. I think it is more that many cancer causing processes are not improved on by evolution, as they happen after an individual has reproduced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not particularly. Evolution in humans (actually all beings who reproduce via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction" target="_blank">sexual reproduction</a>) is driven mainly by creating new DNA combinations by combining genes from two organisms.</p></div>		</li>
