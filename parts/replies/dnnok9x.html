			<div class="markdown"><p>You can.  Or nice protective lenses.  Most 'blind' people are not fully blind, but functionally blind.  The vision can often still be useful so blacking it out isn't always the best option.  Most fully blind patients I see prefer to keep their eye exposed, however many of these eyes end up being removed and replaced with prosthetics.</p></div>		</li>
