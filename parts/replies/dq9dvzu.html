<p>I don't see how any of it would have any impact on anyone outside the u.s.</p>

<p>There are a variety of (mostly indirect) ways this could affect other countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain types of peer-to-peer systems could be broken.  The FCC is already talking about <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/17/11/23/1956215/ajit-pai-and-the-fcc-want-it-to-be-legal-for-comcast-to-block-bittorrent?utm_source=rss0.9mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;sbsrc=yro" target="_blank">permitting the blocking of BitTorrent</a>, for example.  Countries with a lot of transit links through the US may start finding fewer and fewer seeders/peers, affecting overall transfer speed.  </li>
<li>If online gaming in the US is put into a much more expensive &quot;gaming bundle&quot; tier, it may become more difficult to find people to play with/against in such places (as presumably a percentage of casual online gamers won't be willing to pay extra).  This may impact the business case for online gaming world wide (don't we all look forward to <em>even more</em> loot boxes? :P).</li>
<li>Business decisions.  If online services in the US start to find they are shedding users due to being inaccessible to a wide audience, they may start charging higher prices elsewhere to make up for the fact.  If Netflix gets relegated to some higher-tier package that many in the US are unwilling to pay for, the loss of business for Netflix may be reflected by them charging higher amounts in other countries to make up for it.  This may also happen for VoIP services like Vonage -- if the cable companies decide to block VoIP in order to push their own services, that may push a company like Vonage to charge higher fees in other countries to make up for lost profits.  Or worse, it could push some such companies out of business altogether.</li>

<p>Pretty sure that would be highly illegal, and probably break a whole bunch of international treaties. It's not going to happen.</p></div>		</li>
