			<p>I don't live paycheck to paycheck. I live paycheck to 5 days before paycheck.<br><br>I am a college graduate, almost 30, who will probably be paying his student loans and working until he dies--with absolutely no prospects of ever buying a house. Retirement? HA! I'll be lucky if I haven't either worked myself to death or shot myself by the time I'm &quot;retirement age&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Ah yes, I'm sure all of America is suffering economic hardships because people are too passionate about things they care about. I'm sure that's the root problem, it has nothing to do with automation and outsourcing making most jobs redundant or the unprecedented levels of income inequality that exist today. It's misplaced passion that's the <em>real</em> problem. /sarcasm</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Today's people want to follow their passion.<br><br>But can't because every one of those jobs is horrendously impacted.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think that's an overly optimistic view. Job Precarity (the opposite of job security) is a major reason why we're following our dreams instead of our careers. My grandfather never opened a restaurant because he had the same good industrial bakery job for 50 years. But that kind of thing is unheard of these days. So people take out loans and take leaps that previous generations dreamed of but would have been foolish to follow. <br><br>The spread of DIY, home brew, crafts, etc is in large part due to the large patches of unemployment and underemployment we feel. In a way, it's made our culture more vibrant and participatory. On the other hand, I think many of us wish we could afford a house and a family on a salary from a company we know we'll retire from. </p>		</li>

			<p>True there is that aspect of it. You hear people all the time saying &quot;I got laid off so I decided to follow my passion.&quot; Also people have the resources to take those leaps they didn't before i.e. the internet. Also maybe this generation sees the idea of &quot;what's the point of saving everything until you're too old to really enjoy it.&quot; I think maybe we are more selfish with our lives in that all we have is this, so better enjoy it. Maybe partially because of the increase in atheism and other factors.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think a lot of it is also because of a lack of trust.  Being laid off like that is a betrayal, and makes you think twice about putting yourself at the mercy of yet another corporate executive board.</p>		</li>
