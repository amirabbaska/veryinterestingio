<p>&quot;To change ice at 0C into water at 0C, you need to add about 333Kj/Kg of water, which is quite a bit. This energy has to come from somewhere, and since everywhere is cold, somewhere has to get colder&quot;</p>
<p>I think that's the part that most people miss, even the ones that pointed out the energy process didn't explain that one important detail that the energy has to be taken from somewhere. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
