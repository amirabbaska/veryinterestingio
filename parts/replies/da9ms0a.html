			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I've read up on this before, and it's been given a few names: threshold effect, door effect, etc. From what I gather, your brain has a mental construct of the current environment you are in (a room, a car, outside). When you cross the boundary between environments, your brain puts that information away, and develops the construct for the new room. If you are not activly thinking of why you need to go into another room, you brain will also put that goal away. Returning to the original room can spark that memory to return. If you maintain conscious thought of your goal as you transition rooms, it will likely stay with you. </p></div>		</li>
