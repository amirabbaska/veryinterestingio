			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean the bathroom floor?  My educated guess is that first, it's closer to the toilet, which probably offers psychological comfort.  Second, it's almost surely the coolest place to be laying in the house, and if you're hot from being sick, a cooler surface is preferable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardness of the ground seems to be far more comfortable when I'm sick. It makes no sense to me at all. This is damned good question.</p>
<p>For some reason, my shoes make better pillows than a pillow in that state too. Ludicrous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barfing uses lots of abdominal, back, and diaphragm muscles. It often exhausts them to the point of tremors and tiny cramps. A hard floor lets you relax these posture-related muscles in a way that isn't possible on furniture with flexible surfaces.</p>
<p>This is also why laying on a hard floor can help with back pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others said. You literally just got done puking and it was awful. That short rest on the floor by the toilet is time when you aren't puking and feeling terrible. It feels good because you realize the worst of it is over or at least you are getting a break from it. </p>
<p>If you have bad cramps in any part of your body you'll experience the same thing. When the cramps aren't happening you feel better and relief washes over you. When they come back or you have to vomit again you look forward to the part of the rotation that is just you collapsed on the floor so it feels good in relation to what you just went through. </p></div>		</li>

<p>because your heart is not fighting gravity to get blood and lymph to your brain and head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common misconception. There is no net work done against gravity in a continuous system like your blood vessels. There are however other reasons (like pooling) that increase heart work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The extra work isn't being done against gravity, it is being done against the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Think about it. For every gram of blood the heart pumps up, there is a gram going down. There is no net change of height of the 'center of mass' of the blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that because the effort in pumping it 'up' is canceled out by the opposite and equal effort saved when pumping it 'down' again?</p></div>		</li>
