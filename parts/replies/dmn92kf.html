			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they can absolutely destroy coral reefs once they hit shallower waters by breaking the tops off of the reefs. The increased turbidity that accompanies the storms can also shade out photosynthetic organisms, as the particles in the water block light. They can also rip kelp and seagrasses out of the seafloor, which can be extremely detrimental to thise ecosystems. Generally speaking, it is the sessile and/or benthic organisms in shallower waters who suffer the most, as they can't get out of the way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface mixing, which can be attributed to the &quot;massive waves&quot; /u/alldemboats is talking about, is always going on in the ocean and isn't really what drives the redistribution of nutrients. Nonetheless, near-inertial internal gravity waves are generated much deeper in the ocean and can loft up nutrients from the sea floor given the right conditions. These also propagate thousands of kilometers away from the hurricane area, yielding a massive overall effect in basin-generalized energy fluxes and mixing. </p></div>		</li>
