			<div class="markdown"><p>Signal transduction pathways exponentially increase a signal during propagation. If one regulatory molecule binds on the cell surface, a whole bunch of different proteins will be produced very shortly. If, by the uncertainty principle, the original ligand doesn't get close enough or doesn't get enough energy to bind to a receptor on the surface, none of those proteins will get produced. They will, but a bit later after another ligand binds the receptors instead.
While for most things in the body work on averages, some are very sensitive. Likely sensitive enough to respond to quantum effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A single ligand binding event is basically never a signal in the neuronal sense. In neurotransmission, thousands of neurotransmitters are released in each individual vesicular release, and these vesicles represent the smallest unit of release. The average result of these binding events wash out any variability due to quantum effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has to be a threshold for an event to proceed or not. You say &quot;thousands&quot; of neurotransmitters are released per vesicular release. Well what triggers the vesicular release? And how many neurotransmitters are needed to provoke the intended response? Both of these events can have a tipping point that is influenced by a quantum decay or another subtlety on that level. It's not necessarily frequent, but it's not reasonable to write it off. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If an extremely rare quantum fluctuation could change a neuron firing and affect our cognitive function, then we would be going crazy every time we pick up a cell phone, walk in the sun or go to the Dr. office. We're bombarded with a ton of highly excited molecules on an hourly basis that can penetrate our skull and excite our cells. If this were a serious possibility then we would be seeing a lot more evidence of this in our daily lives before we even got to the quantum scale. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's an overly extreme situation. We're not looking for massively different behaviors here. It's a question of whether you decide to itch your nose or your knee first. Whether you blink now, or one millisecond from now. Two things that are nearly equivalent in terms of &quot;should I do this now?&quot; could certainly be swayed by a single neuron in some cases, and now we're firmly in butterfly effect territory. I'm not saying there are many of these quantum-influenced decisions per day, but I don't think it's reasonable to write them off.  </p>
<p>This is interesting in the question of free will, of course. I feel that our universe is fully deterministic in that there's one outcome and there's nothing that can be done to avoid that outcome. But since it's impossible to predict the outcomes of quantum events (since we can never know the starting conditions in appropriate detail), there's no way we can predict the behavior of any system (including the brain) with total confidence and accuracy. So we are still &quot;free&quot; in that nobody will be able to make forecasts of where our (admittedly fixed) path is taking us. I think the computer needed to do that prediction would have to be as large as, and identical in composition to the observable universe. Happy to hear feedback if any of this seems off-base.  </p>
<p>Edit: how did this comment <em>not</em> contribute to discussion? The above comment is saying that &quot;we would be going crazy every time we pick up a cell phone, walk in the sun or go to the Dr. office&quot; if quantum mechanics had any impact on brain function. Is my rebuttal really any less reasonable than this person's claims? </p></div>		</li>

<p>That isn't to say &quot;randomness&quot; isn't potentially useful to the brain: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_resonance</a></p>
<p>It is quite easy to show in simulations that adding some noise to ensembles of spiking neuron models increases the information &quot;capacity&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
