<p>Not entirely correct.  Witness Skymall.  The Skymall magazine was carried on many airlines.  AA calculated that they'd save $350K per year on fuel by just not carrying the magazine.   Ditto for pilots using iPads for manuals than printed books. I think that was over $1M saved.    While I agree completely that a full plane is optimal,  realize that the airlines track the cost of <em>everything</em>, because at that scale even the smallest change can affect profit.</p>
<p>Edit: Put the &quot;almost&quot; in the quote.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Large planes use almost the same amount of fuel whether they're half empty or packed, and airline companies know this.</p>

<p>That sounds like a justification, but it isn't. The plane weighs significantly less for every passenger (and bag) that doesn't show up. The fuel is already paid for because they already bought a ticket. The airline isn't trying to be green or something, they just want as much money as they can rinse out of the flight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember, the customer who didn't show up rescheduled for a later flight, so they still have to fly the customer on another plane. </p></div>		</li>
