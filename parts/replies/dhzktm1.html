			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not as familiar with thermodynamics as I should be, what ensures that the transfer rates between liquid and gas are equivalent for each and every energy?  Naively, I would guess that the more energetic particles would be more likely to go from liquid to gas than gas to liquid with the opposite being true for low energy particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of condensation being equal to the rate of evaporation can be true 'globally', i.e., summed over all energies, without being true 'locally', i.e., for a particular energy. In fact, the microscopic description for evaporative cooling that I have heard corresponds with this: higher energy liquid molecules are preferentially evaporated while lower energy gaseous molecules are preferentially condensed.</p>
<p>While I understand that the transfer rates of a particular energy are probably taken to be equal in equilibrium, I do not understand the underlying physical dynamics.  Why wouldn't the differential in transfer rates for individual energies persist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially your nieve assumption is incorrect. You are thinking of a molecule as a tennis ball that you are trying to launch into orbit, however the mean free path of molecules in the liquid is so short, you have to consider that if you fire 1000000 yellow tennis balls up plus your super fast orange tennis ball, the determining factor in its escape probability is now the nature of the collisions it makes along the way, not it's speed.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect analogy, but I think it's sufficient.</p></div>		</li>
