			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if the difference in detergent makeup corresponds to any difference in industry standards for Washing Machine settings? (i.e.: &quot;Warm&quot; or &quot;Hot&quot; setting on the water temp)</p>
<p>Actually...<em>IS</em> there even a standardized temperature range for the heat settings on washers/dryers? I imagine there would be upper limits to them, at least (for safety/regulatory purposes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the machine but for most, no. If it doesn't explicitly state some form of automatic temperature control in the specs or marketing you can assume cold is full bore cold tap, hot is full bore hot tap, and warm is full bore both and hope it averages right. Which makes it entirely depend on your hot water heater setting, cold water temp in your climate, and the time it takes for the output hot water to stabilize from the pipes.</p>
<p>Adding temperature sensors and electronic controls for the valve relays is an added cost you won't see in the lower, more common, or more reliable models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what would be an indication of that on typical packaging for detergent?</p>
<p>unless there's a real problem with my clothes, I always wash in cold, rinse in cold, mainly for energy conservation concerns.  I might use hot/hot a few times in a year.</p></div>		</li>
