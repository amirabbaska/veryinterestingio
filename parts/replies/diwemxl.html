			<div class="markdown"><p>How would the rope/cable not be coiled around the central rotating object? There's no significant gravity to pull it taught, regardless of the lardiness of the person on the end. Even if someone jumped off the spaceship to make it tight initially, they'd be wound in like a little fish wouldn't they?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Picture holding a short rope by the end and spinning it around your head. Is the rope going to coil around your body while you spin it or does it unfurl out to its maximum length and point away from your body? The rope in this thought exercise is essentially undergoing the same forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. the rope has weight and would extend out.  The ship and the rope would then rotate around their shared center of mass.  The rope would be even more taught as the person is at the end.</p>
<p>It's this property that people hope to use to build a Space Elevator, holding it up using the earth's spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's what you meant by funky rotation. As the person gets on the rope, the center of gravity changes and now it starts rotating around that instead?</p>
<p>I imagine the change would be small in this example, but if the mass of the two objects were closer... i.e., the example of a person spinning a rope and someone else grabs it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the station wasn't spinning and had just started, yes, the acceleration would make the robe curl around. However, after reaching the correct rpm, the rope would unfurl as would anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hang on... why the J shape? The rope is not moving relative to the rotating reference frame; it is just sitting there being pulled taut, as if I were to spin a yo-yo around my head. Why would it experience Coriolis acceleration?</p></div>		</li>
