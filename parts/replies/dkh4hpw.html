<p>What type of math, and what book would I need to understand where the lagrange points would be for any system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hm 2nd year undergrad physics should do the trick. If you do kepler dynamics and analytic mechanics you essentially have all the tools. A requirement would also be an understanding of multivariate calculus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always felt that <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Lagrangian_points_equipotential.jpg" target="_blank">this image</a> off wikipedia is a pretty good visualization.  Put an object anywhere in that image, and it will roll &quot;downhill&quot;, either toward one of the two bodies or off into space.  The five Lagrangians are the only five &quot;flat spots&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, L1 (and L2 and L3) is unstable, actually it always is. Only L4 and L5 are stable, which is why we find trojans at those points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. I think I'm right in that saying that any drift in advance or behind the L1 point in orbit would be amplified, but if an object moves towards either of the two larger masses it will move into an elliptical orbit and so appear to oscillate back and forth over L1. The same goes for L2 and L3. Satellites at these points are put into orbits around the points which can keep them roughly in the right place with minimal expenditure of fuel.</p>
<p>L4 and L5 are stable.</p></div>		</li>
