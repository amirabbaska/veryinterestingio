<p>is a little more expensive than some existing good quality devices</p>

<p>PLUS you need a power feed (like solar panels), converters etc.<br />
How an &quot;average&quot; Indian person / household could afford this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find too many sources for pricing online right now, but this is what I found: <a href="http://www.newtechnology.co.in/su-kam-inverter-price-list-india/" target="_blank">http://www.newtechnology.co.in/su-kam-inverter-price-list-india/</a> Look for 10KVA and beyond. Conversion factor is about Rs 60 = $1. These work okay, but could be better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just the inverter, which is required irrespective of the battery/generator system (tesla powerwall/lead acid batteries or diesel generator sets). Plus you get to pay for any special wiring and of course for the current itself.</p>
<p>Compare that with a home </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for giving us a perspective outside the Rich world perspective. Many countries I've visited in Asia, Africa and South America would be in a similar position to what you describe.</p>
<p>If a power unit were purchased for essential facilities in villages or business, it would greatly improve productivity and reduce load on existing utilities so they could provide a better service. It would also mean private funds (from business or wealthy facilities) would be using their own capital to improve the energy issues facing their nations rather than the state or utility companies.</p>
<p>I think this could be a major development over the coming years as the tech improves and gets cheaper!</p></div>		</li>
