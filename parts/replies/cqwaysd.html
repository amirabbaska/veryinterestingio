			<p>Thank you for giving us a perspective outside the Rich world perspective. Many countries I've visited in Asia, Africa and South America would be in a similar position to what you describe.<br><br>If a power unit were purchased for essential facilities in villages or business, it would greatly improve productivity and reduce load on existing utilities so they could provide a better service. It would also mean private funds (from business or wealthy facilities) would be using their own capital to improve the energy issues facing their nations rather than the state or utility companies.<br><br>I think this could be a major development over the coming years as the tech improves and gets cheaper!</p>		</li>

			<p>Your comment makes me think of some countries that never got a good (landline) phone system.  Instead of plowing forward, they just ignored the problem and adopted cellphone networks which became wildly successful.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; In countries like India, very few cities ever get 24x7 electricity. You can be a millionaire, but still you can not have 24x7 electricity unless you install some sort of an expensive backup system. Almost every middle class and richer family owns a battery or fossil fuel based backup unit for their house and from the smallest business to the largest industry, uninterrupted power supply is always a huge issue.<br><br>Wow. that is kind of blowing my mind. so if you want to do anything involving electricity at night, you just... don't? or lease buy your own generator? that seems insanely inefficient and... I don't know, like, the dark ages or something.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. I have spent many nights sleeping in a pool of my own sweat and studying under dim kerosine lamps. We never bought food for the week like I do in U.S. now because you never know when the power would go out for 4-5 hours spoiling all your food. Most people don't run refrigerators or air conditioners on their backup systems.<br><br>Businesses suffer a lot too. Think of something as simple as a grocery store or an ice cream shop. Even running a simple credit card machine requires electricity.</p>		</li>

			<p>You hit the nail on the head with that one. Where I live, it's hot and humid. No backup. When power breaks down, you're basically at the mercy of weather. And I don't see him saying anything about the night. Power may just go off in middle of the day when temperature is around 45C (113F). And this is in big cities.  <br>In smaller villages and towns, there's a power cut schedule. There are 8 - 10 hour power cuts scheduled per day.</p>		</li>
