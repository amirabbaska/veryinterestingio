			<div class="markdown"><p>A few months ago I interviewed a scientist who recently published the most exhaustive study to date on Mercury's plate tectonics. You might enjoy reading what Watters had to say on the subject. Link to his paper is in the article.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So,i the core of the earth gets really cold, we would not have a magnetic field? If there isnt a magnetic field, how will be living here? I mean, it will change anything, like how a compass behaves, etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, plate tectonics has nothing to do with the fact that we've got a liquid outer core! We have plate tectonics because we have a solid, convecting mantle and abundant liquid water at the surface of the planet and in the upper mantle. That has nothing to do with the outer core. </p></div>		</li>
