			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose I knew that if I thought about it for a moment, but I never considered that until right now.  They’re sort of like rounded hemispheres, right?  I always pictured bubbles in the water to be full bubbles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight addition: A sphere provides the tighters possible grouping containing the air that's trapped inside. Without the air, the bubbles would form balls (or drops, as those balls would just fall down)</p></div>		</li>
