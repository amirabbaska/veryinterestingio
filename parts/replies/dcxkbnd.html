<p>What is so worrying about this? How can we (i.e. they) even determine that the neutrinos were faster? Do they decay?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because tachyons are theoretical particles that travel faster than light and if we discovered such a particle, the very laws of relativistic physics would break (the laws that govern our universe). It would mean information could travel faster than the event that propagated it, allowing causality to be violated. (i.e. a fire could produce light before it was ignited, you could receive a phone call from someone before they called you, etc. A more severe example would be given the ability to communicate with your past self.)</p>
<p>We can estimate the approximate flux of certain particles due to the sun via the Standard Solar Model and the proton-proton interaction that occurs at the core of our star. Mind you neutrinos travel <em>very</em> close to the speed of light, but not equal to, therefore the measured quantities are off only by a small amount. When you factor in electromagnetic scattering, energy output of the solar core and the mass of the sun, you can calculate that the flux per second of photons and neutrinos, which allows neutrinos to appear as if they are moving faster than light, however without scattering photons still would reach the finish line. I found a <a href="http://jila.colorado.edu/~pja/astr3730/lecture21.pdf" target="_blank">lecture</a> that may provide more insight on the measurements behind it.</p>
<p>Note: It's harder to search for because anything with &quot;neutrino&quot; and &quot;problem&quot; tends to always want to redirect you to the Solar Neutrino problem, which isn't the same problem as the one I described. However, I still suggest giving that one a small read if you haven't already. It is both interesting and quite humorous in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>
