			<div class="markdown"><p>True. It also describes present events, like the Grant's research on the Galapagos Finches. Past seed distributions are used to describe the present states of Finch beak morphology. Evolution describes their presently evolving populations on the archipelagos. </p></div>		</li>

<p>(Tbf you have a point of course. I simply prefer to make a very clear distinction on this because otherwise people will—yes, really!—keep on thinking that evolution is a process with a goal.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>We can look at human selection to domesticate animals as a fast-tracked model of the natural selection.</p>
<p>The soviets looked to domesticate a type of fox and so selected the offspring of vixen a that were docile to human interaction instead of aggressive or fearful. Over the generations the proportion of docile foxes increased. What also increased was the prominence of 'juvenile' physical features into adulthood. Docile behaviour was actually a juvenile trait an what was selected for was a broad extension of juvenile traits rather than docility specifically. The psychological trait was being affected just as the physical ones.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution isn't over yet. The evolution of a species stops when the species goes extinct. It's not a process that can finish because there is no &quot;end point&quot; or guided goal other than passing down genes to offspring. In the next million years, brown eyes may outcompete blue and blue eyes may disappear. Maybe that doesn't happen. There's no way to really know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is one part selection and another part random chance. Many traits are a result of nuetral selection ( also called genetic drift, which is basically that traits are selected randomly and not for their advantages or disadvantages), which is typically a big player in evolutionary histories of species with low populations (aka Humans). </p></div>		</li>
