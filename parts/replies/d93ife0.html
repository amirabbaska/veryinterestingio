			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple different answers to that and the answer depends on who you ask.  Some sources hypothesize that it helps the body get rid of heat when you sweat.  By helping sweat stick to the skin, more heat can be dissipated.</p>
<p>Not very ELI5, but here's a link where this is described for those who are interested.  </p>

<p>Another theory is that apocrine glands are responsible for producing pheromones.  In other mammals, apocrine glands are responsible for the production of pheromones and some believe they play the same role in humans.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some research suggests that we developed pubic hair as a sort of catchment for the eccrine sweat running down our bodies. We want to sweat freely to cool ourselves, but not waste the sweat by letting it fall to the ground, so the oilier apocrine sweat grabs on to the eccrine and holds it while it evaporates.</p></div>		</li>
