			<div class="markdown"><p>What I want to know is how does mildew start. If I just washed the clothes, and they haven't left the washer yet, why didn't the mildew spores or whatever get washed away? </p>
<p>Would, in theory, washing at higher temps reduce this, and lower temps increase this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to scare you, but the mildew might have come from your washing machine. Washing machines are a great source for mildew to grow. Specifically high efficiency front loading machines. The design of which inherently has more spots to pool water and help the spores grow. In theory higher temps are able to reduce this, but recommended procedure is to leave the door of an HE washer open to fully air out and wash monthly with washing machine cleaning tablets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. This is currently a problem for me. I wash my clothes and dry them, they smell good. But after a while they start to stink. It's really annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just add vinegar to a load or two a week and it will also kill the bad smell in your washer.  And always leave the door of your front loader open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spores can survive higher temps than the 'live' form. Same with fleas in your carpet. </p>
<p>Physical agitation will remove a good portion of the mildew spores and heat will also kill some of them, but both are better. </p>
<p>Lower temps won't really increase it so much, the physical agitation in cold water will do more to knock them off than cause an increase. If you must hang your crap up to dry put a fan in room to increase air flow on the clothes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wash your towels in 90 degrees (194f). Works wonders. It's not like it'll matter if they lose some color or shrink a little.  </p>
<p>Edit: i do this also with bed stuff. </p>
<p>Don't do it with clothes. It will work, but you probably won't fit in anymore. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It smells bad because you are literally growing a little fungus and bacteria farm in your clothing if you don't dry them all the way. </p></div>		</li>
