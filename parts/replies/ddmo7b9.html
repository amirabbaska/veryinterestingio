			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding correctly, the hypothetical reverse-gravity antimatter black hole is still a black hole - it's not emitting anything except perhaps for Hawking radiation, so it's going to look more or less the same as a regular black hole other than maybe looking bigger than normal if it repels photons the same way it repels regular matter.</p>
<p>Such a black hole would, incidentally, be impossible to orbit (since orbits depend fundamentally on the orbiting object being drawn <em>toward</em> whatever it's orbiting) and in fact its mere presence would have all sorts of interesting effects on star systems and other celestial bodies near it (for the brief time that said bodies actually <em>were</em> near it, before being violently flung apart).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matter and antimatter have equal mass, so they would have identical gravitational effects on each other.</p>
<p>Antimatter does <strong>not</strong> have negative mass.</p>
<p>Antimatter particles and matter particles have opposite charge, lepton number and baryon number to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the leading theory, but it hasn't been confirmed experimentally yet because of how weak gravity is and because of the problems of gathering large amounts of anti-matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure it's just the definition of the word &quot;anti-matter&quot;.</p>
<p>I've only ever heard negative mass particles referred to as &quot;exotic matter&quot;, not that they could possibly exist considering our currently accepted laws of physics. See Bonnor's &quot;runaway motion&quot;.</p>
<p>But hey, I've been wrong before. Please elaborate if you would like to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but wouldn't that mean a black hole made from a theorethical material with negative gravity would never be able to form in the first place?</p>
<p>every particle of that material would struggle to hold itself together.</p>
<p>sure, maybe small ones, where the strong nuclear force can hold them will stay, but anything too big for that tensile strength will inevitably rip itself apart and desintegrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose that to first order, gravity follows the same 1/r^2 law as electric charges, except replace the charge term with the mass of the object, and then put a minus sign out front, so that two objects of the same 'mass charge' attract, and two objects of opposite 'mass charge' repel.
Suppose antimatter has a negative 'mass charge'. Then, antimatter is attracted to other antimatter gravitationaly as normal, but is repelled from ordinary matter. You could very easily form an antimatter black hole that would attract antimatter, but repel ordinary matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oooh</p>
<p>so basically if antimatter is racist, it can form a &quot;white hole&quot;?</p>
<p>that would mean it behaves like a normal black hole, but only pulling in antimatter and repelling normal matter.</p>
<p>which would explain any kind of energy emitted from it as repelled photons from all around, scattered by the negative(?) gravity.</p></div>		</li>
