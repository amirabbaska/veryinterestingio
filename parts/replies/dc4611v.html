<p>The more &quot;extra&quot; energy in the resulting reaction the higher the probability of it happening, so it'll happen with a faster rate.</p>

<p>This is not true in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in Deuterium the neutron can't decay into a proton because the lowest energy state for a proton is already occupied and there's not enough extra mass/energy available (between the mass of the Deuteron and the total mass of the resulting particles from a hypothetical decay of the neutron to a proton) to push the new proton into the next available energy level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lowest proton shell in the deuteron is not full, since it can hold two protons in it. The deuteron is stable to beta decay, but not for the reason you said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's why you can hold a sample of natural Uranium (half-life of billions of years) in your bare hand without particularly worrying about it whereas if you did the same thing with Cobalt-60 (half-life of about 5 years) you are going to have a bad time.</p>

<p>^(60)Co is a very common gamma source in nuclear physics labs. People hold them in their hands quite frequently with little danger. What matters isn't just the lifetime of the source but the activity.</p></div>		</li>
