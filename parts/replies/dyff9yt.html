<p>Its unlikely that the arrival of either on this planet contributed to the foundation of life, but endospores could conceivably contribute to contaminating another one. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except that life appeared extremely soon after the crust formed, an took billions of years to get any visible evolution after that</p>
<p>edit: 4.28b is apparently the earliest evidence for life. 4.1b a different one. 3.5b the latest. Earth's  crust formed 4.54b ago, oceans 4.41b.  Multicellular life took almost 4b years, as it appeared only 600 million yr ago.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a bit more too it than that, although its hard to find actual publications indicating a non-terrestrial origin of life (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12064-012-0172-1" target="_blank">I have found 1</a>, which presents no data and has 0 citations. Compared too tons of publications arguing about RNA world, white hot smokers ect). I would love to see any literature on the topic you have found.</p>
<p>Regardless, an extraterrestrial endospore or virus would not explain life on earth, the endospore being unable to account for archaea (and thus also Eukaryota), and viruses being non self replicating. So if the origin of life was extraterrestrial it would take a much more basic form.</p>
<p>What do you mean by visible evolution, and what do you count as life appearing? Also the earths crust formed 4.6 billion years ago, the oldest known fossilized cell is a maximum of 3.5–1.9 Ga <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4413290/" target="_blank">source</a>. What do you think went down in the missing billion?</p></div>		</li>
