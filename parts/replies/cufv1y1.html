			<div class="markdown"><p>He is not describing Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>Hawking radiation is a different phenomena, which allows black holes to get smaller and eventually evaporate.</p>
<p>Space is full of particle-antiparticle pairs which arise from the quantum foam and disappear again, thanks to the uncertainty principle. Any pairs which spring into existence near the event horizon, don't necessarily cancel each other out again and disappear. The anti-particle may get swallowed up, leaving the particle to run away in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The addition of an anti-particle to the black hole, reduces its mass by that much.  The escaping particle makes it LOOK like the blackhole has ejected a particle as radiation and its mass has been reduced by that amount. That's Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>This new theory is different. It says that quantum information swallowed by the Black Hole never vanishes from the universe. It remains at the Event Horizon. Thus, information is preserved and not reduced.</p>
<p>EDIT : Used to say entropy in the final sentence, when it should have been information. Thanks to hopffiber for the correction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you are missing something. The whole problem comes from that Hawking radiation seems to be fully random, it tells you nothing about what the black hole swallowed before. What he is explaining is basically a pretty old idea of black hole holography, saying that all the information lives on the surface of the black hole somehow. </p>
<p>However, this is not the new idea of Hawking, but was proposed a long time ago by people like Susskind and 't Hooft. And people nowadays sort of believe that it is indeed true, what remains to understand is how this actually works. As far as I understand, Hawking and Strominger are proposing a particular mechanism for how the information is stored on the event horizon surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking radiation is when an particle-antiparticle pair gets split up on the event horizon due to one being close enough to the black hole. The particle sucked in would must have negative energy, hence the black hole shrinks, and an observer would just see a particle being omitted. The outgoing particle only contains information of the black hole. </p>
<p>Professor Hawking's new theory proposes that everything that gets sucked into the black hole, included the particle of negative energy, will have it's OWN information stored on the event horizon. Two theory's very different but understandable if confused between them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clever way of explaining that. The only part I think that was missed is that the information in the event horizon is so corrupted as to be existentially &quot;lost&quot; or useless, anyway. That's what I gathered anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm interesting. So basically they would need to be reverse engineered.  This makes me think of a video I saw where a guy drops a bunch of dye into water and spins it around and then tries to unspin it so the drops go back to their original spot. Damnit this is reddit please tell me someone knows what I am  talking about?  It was fascinating....actually I think I saw it on through the wormhole.</p>
<p>I think Mr Hawking is proposing some type of blood spatter analysis type of deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, lol. That would be a step in the right direction. If the original statement added that, it might make more sense, but it doesn't go far enough as those pieces of food from billions of years are still discernible as food and are individually identifiable. Another user took it to the extent that &quot;So the food particles are too diluted with saliva or too stale and rotted to know what they really are?&quot; Saying that basically you can't identify any of it even as food. Anyway, that's what I understand from hawking's statement. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;The bacteria in your mouth poos in your mouth all night long. It does this during the day, too, but when you're sleeping you don't have as much spit rinsing that poo off as you do during the day.
When you wake up... you taste and feel the poo on your teeth.&quot; - deleted user</p></div>		</li>
