			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't actually get both of those at the same time - cold gas tends to be denser (&gt;100 atoms/cm^(3)) while hot gas tends to be thinner (&lt;1 atoms/cm^(3)). But either way, for a space craft it'd basically just feel like a vacuum. Only the densest stuff would even be visible, and then only faintly.</p></div>		</li>
