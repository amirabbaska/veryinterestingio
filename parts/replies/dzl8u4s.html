			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s the use of the word ‘determined’ that people object to, in the way that you’ve used it above. There is definitely, unquestionably, a genetic component. However, it is not genetically determined. </p>
<p>And now I ask... what is ‘intelligence’ anyway? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of it the same way I do with height. Your genes determine your potential peak but don't guarantee that you'll get there. If you don't eat well during childhood and puberty then you won't become as tall as you could've become, and similarily if you don't stimulate and challenge your brain you won't become as intelligent as you could've become.</p>
<p>&quot;Intelligence has been defined in many different ways to include the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, and problem solving. It can be more generally described as the ability to perceive or infer information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think this has ever been substantiated apart from outlier cases of extreme deprivation (e.g. a child locked in a closet for years).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IQ is what we measure intelligence with. It seems to accurately measure the things we would describe as intelligence, including abstract reasoning and pattern recognition. High IQ is a predictor of greater success in life, even when you control for other variables.</p>
<p>IQ has been found to be strongly heritable, meaning it has more to do with who your genetic parents are than it does with how you were raised.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>IQ tests have a strong cultural component; if you grow up in Western society just by consuming media you can quite accurately predict how a real IQ test will look like. Not 100% accurate of course, but close enough to be mentally prepared. Giving that exact same test to an inland Chinese farmer will give you a completely different result that may have nothing to do with their actual intelligence.</p>
<p>Besides that, the idea that we use IQ to determine intelligence is disputed and not at all commonly accepted scientifically. This is why you often see all kind of explanations about emotional intelligences, physical intelligences, creative intelligences etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High IQ is a predictor of greater success in life, even when you control for other variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we consider 'successful' is also strongly culturally determined. If I recall correctly the study you are probably thinking of <em>does</em> correlate IQ to <em>higher income</em> in life. Whether that means this person is 'more successful' is up for debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a great analogy that i've heard is this:</p>
<p>imagine intelligence as potted plants. the nature is the plant, and the nurture is the soil it grows in.</p>
<p>so two genetically identical plants may express intelligence to different degrees depending on its environment. or a worse plant in a rich environment might outperform a better plant in a shitty environment.</p>
<p>bonus: this explains population variances in intelligence without genetic superiority/inferiority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, why would the brain, the only organ that modifies itself due to perceived stimulus (read: not physical), develop unrelated to genetics? Hmmm...</p>
