			<div class="markdown"><p>I had these - grommets through the ear drum. <del>They've stopped them as a course of treatment in the UK as they leave you with scarred ear drums and it doesn't fix the underlying issues.</del></p>
<p>They're still actively listed here: <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/glue-ear/Pages/treatmentoptions.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/glue-ear/Pages/treatmentoptions.aspx</a></p>
<p>I used to be able to hold my nose and blow a stream of air out my ears... PITA for swimming though and I always had to wear ear plugs. Upside is they alleviated cycles of near deafness as a child due to fluid behind the ear drum / &quot;glue ear&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh bummer! Yeah, I have a really crappy immune system so unfortunately tubes are a must for me. When the doctor put them in he said my ear dum skin was like shoe leather due to so much pressure being from the many infections. LPT- don't get this done without general anesthesia like I did if you've had a lot of ear infections. Fucking painful. I hope you have good hearing now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never been told this by my doctor. I have inflammation problems with my Eustachian tube, meaning my ears are constantly popped and I can’t hear as well as everyone else. I’m really at the end of my rope with dealing with it, and would love it if this sort of thing existed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I have a defective Eustachian tube too. I was one of those kids with ear infections all the time, they did tubes like five times. Then one of those holes in my eardrum didn’t heal so I had surgery on it, twice. Now my left ear just will not pop, ever. It makes flying incredibly painful - also going underwater more than a few feet, changing altitude quickly in a car or an elevator... but flying makes me cry it’s so bad. The best way I’ve found to deal is to take literally 3-5 different decongestants for a couple weeks before I fly anywhere. </p></div>		</li>
