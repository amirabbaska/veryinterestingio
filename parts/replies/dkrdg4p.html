			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less about how you wake up and more about when you wake up. You cycle through different sleep stages all night. If your alarm goes off while you're in NREM 1 or NREM 2, you'll likely feel okay. If your alarm goes off while you're in NREM 3 or REM sleep, you'll feel groggy and a bit out of it and probably want hit snooze a few times.</p>
<p>If you're used to going to bed and waking up and roughly the same time every morning (even weekends/days off) and have generally health sleep, you should naturally start waking up around the time your alarm goes off, provided you're getting enough sleep most nights and aren't using lots of sleep medications. </p>
<p>In terms of actual alarms, there isn't much in the way of evidence for or against a particular general approach. I know there was a popular study a while back that said alarm clocks were bad for your heart because they can obviously startle you, but for most people that isn't actually a health risk. There is also research that suggests snooze is the devil incarnate and a really unhelpful habit, which makes more sense--you are essentially starting a new sleep cycle and then waking yourself up in the middle of a cycle again.</p>
<p>The real issue with alarm clocks is that they may mean the sleep-wake cycle you have to keep is out of sync with the sleep-wake cycle your body wants to keep. This is called &quot;social jet lag.&quot; On the other hand, alarm clocks can be useful for people with circadian or sleep disorders or sleep dysfunction due to things like depression. So there's no one answer for all people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insteresting. In my situation for example, I have my alarm set for 5am and I tend to fall asleep around 11pm-midnight. I am pretty healthy, nothing medically wrong; I exercise everyday, eat semi healthy, etc. </p>
<p>When I wake up at 5 of course I feel tired , but after a couple minutes of washing my face &amp; getting ready I feel perfectly fine and ready for the day. </p>
<p>Now physically I don't feel anything bad happening when that alarm goes off, but over time can this abrupt way of waking up lead to maybe some neurological problems or anything related? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comes back to the when, not the how.  Most people suffer long-term when they get the amount of sleep you're getting, although supposedly a small percentage of people get by just fine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose if you had a preexisting condition, a startle/stress response might be an additional factor to consider, but I'm not aware of any real-life cases looking at alarm clocks in these situations.</p>
<p>Have you thought about how much sleep you get? Less than seven hours a night is iffy for a lot of people, and six hours or less is heading into the danger zone for most. Something to think about :)</p></div>		</li>
