			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation and I'll add one more issue - cold flow. Aluminum under pressure will slowly thin itself out, until the connection is loose. This appears to happen even without thermal cycling. Al terminations have to be properly designed and torqued to spec. Periodic thermal scanning or inspection and re-tightening is the best prevention for fires.</p>
<p>Also I'll mention &quot;Penetrox&quot; and similar products that prevent oxidation in the joint, but must be properly and thoroughly applied.</p>
<p>Basically, anyone can terminate copper, but aluminum wiring should be left to electricians. And it should always be accessible due to these maintenance issues. This is why it is legal for service wiring and industrial uses, but not residential branch circuits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold flow or &quot;creep&quot; affects many materials, but under stresses far below static yield the magnitude of the deformation will be so small as to be negligible in the lifetime of a car. This used to be a problem with aging cars' suspension springs, though. It's also common to see in old oven racks, as creep rate is affected by heat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need anything special to prevent oxidation unless there's already too much at the time of installation. At least one manufacturer of aluminum wire for solar recommends Vaseline for the purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. As an electrician here in Canada, we always assume the wire is in an oxidized state and apply Penetrox or a similar product. No inspector would ever allow Vaseline. This may be a case of better safe than sorry, but... better safe than sorry?</p>
<p>I have applied Vaseline to automotive terminations but never to aluminum. I'm honestly surprised that a manufacturer would recommend Vaseline over an engineered product - just in case something goes wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>both copper and aluminum suffer from cold flow issue.. hence you should use a proper tool to apply the lug. the downside of aluminum is mainly it's significant bigger cross section and the fact that space in residential environment costs much more then the copper cable.
as soon as you get into bigger amperage or lenghts of cavles, aluminum will mostly win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tensile strength isn't a huge problem in power lines.  Low-voltage distribution poles aren't far enough apart for it to be an issue, and for high voltage transmission lines, the cables are manufactured with a steel core to provide additional strength.  Aluminum is mostly problematic when its used in interior wiring- back in the late '60s and early '70s, they used to build houses with aluminum electrical wires, but deterioration could cause fires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in modern homes you'll still find aluminum in certain limited applications. I was working on a project where we moved 14 houses to new entrance panels with underground service, and the new entrance panels were in a different part of the house. Because we didn't want to re-wire the entire place, what we wound up doing was running 80A service to the old entrance panel, and turning it into a sub-panel. </p>
<p>The cable we used for that was aluminum, as the equivalent copper would have been horrendously expensive. We were just careful to torque everything to spec with a proper torque wrench, and to apply the appropriate goop on both ends. </p>
<p>Aluminum is also pretty common for service entrance wire, again because it's cheap, and it's reliable enough.</p></div>		</li>
