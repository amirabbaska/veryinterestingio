			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use https, it doesn't matter what you do. They'll be able to see where you're going, but the traffic will be encrypted and your personal information is safe. If you don't want anyone to see where you're going, just use a vpn. Either way, there's no reason o ever worry about someone stealing your personal information over public wifi because https is the standard for anything sensitive, and your browser should warn you otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using https everywhere extension in Chrome for quite sometime, even before sites forced https.</p>
<p>That being said your statement is only partially true, there are still ways to decrypt it utilizing MTM attacks.  If you've ever used wireshark to capture and analyze packets you would need the RSA key to decrypt https.  </p>
<p>Now there is an easier way, if you're interested c<a href="https://jimshaver.net/2015/02/11/decrypting-tls-browser-traffic-with-wireshark-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">heck out this 2015 article.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can already use the power lines inside a house for LAN. I'm wondering if they can do the same in subways over the electrified rail. That should give trains easy access to internet. There might be problems with the range of the signal or if it can be transmitted at all through high voltage lines. I hope someone more knowledgeable can chime in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BPL is a technology ATT invented in 1914. It isn't particularly practical for anything high volume because of massive signal attenuation. Especially with using a third rail, you'd get additional attenuation from all the arcing that happens between the shoe and the rail, rendering the connection completely useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that the rail would actually generate too much interference (every time it sparks it sends out an electromagnetic pulse that interferes with the signal).</p>
<p>I'm sure with time they could come up with an error correction mechanism that's hardware based (otherwise your connection would be really slow).</p>
<p>Either that or find a way to piggyback the signals on the radio transmissions (which would also be slow).</p>
<p>Adding access points is probably the best long term solution IMO, they aren't that expensive and once they are in place they are easy to maintain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being paranoid about free wifi is healthy. However, HTTPS as a transport mechanism does offer some level of protection. Just don't use it for anything you'd not want your mum to find out about you visiting, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Get a VPN you can connect to from your phone (any OpenVPN provider will work for Android). Use that when on any public wifi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in IT for 30+ years, when it comes to browsing on public wifi there is no such thing as being paranoid.</p>
<p>If you are into IT check out wireshark, it's a packet capture and analysis tool that lets you analyze the contents.  Granted https traffic is encrypted but you can still get around that by using what is called a man in the middle attack (MTM).</p>
<p>MTM attacks are pretty straight forward, you setup a device that looks like a free wifi hotspot but is connected to another free wifi.  Once a person connects you are in the middle and can figure out the encryption key, then decrypt the traffic.</p></div>		</li>
