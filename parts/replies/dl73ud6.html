			<div class="markdown"><p>Around 10 years ago, at 2:00 am I read something about a free signup to this thing called twitter so I tried it. I still have my history where I'm tweeting &quot;hello?, hello!?&quot; And &quot;this is interesting but I don't need an app to talk to myself&quot; and other clever gems. </p>
<p>I thought I got a good deal, assuming future accounts would cost money!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your handle could be valuable if you picked a username that was a single letter or popular word or something. There was an article recently where a guy was targeted by hackers and they held his website hostage for him to turn over his twitter handle &quot;n&quot;.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few questions:   </p>
<ol>
<li>Why was the hacker so willing to tell him how he was hacked?    </li>
<li>It seems @n is still active to Naoki. Did he get it back?   </li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a story! I don't think my handle choice is all that coveted, it's a variation of my real name. Wish I had had the foresight to get something cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Reddit used a bunch of fake accounts when it first launched. A lot of the first links were kn0thing just spamming shit. Kind of ironic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. IIRC, it was something like 95% of content that was being posted by 2 or 3 <em>really</em> dedicated users, (aka the admins,) in an attempt to make the site look super popular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also fairly common knowledge that the founders of Reddit faked activity early on to give the sense of a thriving community before it was actually there. (See <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/z4444w/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2" target="_blank">https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/z4444w/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2</a>)</p>
<p>Depending on what you are building this is a feasible option, but just be careful not to somehow get into any legal trouble. Eg I'm not sure if fake reviews are considered false advertisement for a product you sell.</p></div>		</li>
