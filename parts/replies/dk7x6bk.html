			<div class="markdown"><p>This here is what I was told. Even putting extra water (over 2oz) was a warning from nurses and peds. This subject made it pretty big a few years ago bc from what I understand, a couple who had become first time parents was diluting their baby's formula to &quot;stretch it out&quot; because of the cost. The baby died. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it; the main reason (aside of course from the high nutrition needs. Even adults can overdo it with water but we of course are much more adept at knowing what our bodies are signaling and can handle electrolyte imbalances with a little more forgiveness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but with babies, they can't tell us if something is wrong and because of their size, these issues can become life threatening in a shorter amount of time than an adult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is truth to this statement the main reason you don't give babies water is you'll lower their sodium level in their body (an important electrolyte that affects muscle and brain function) and you'll give your baby a seizure or even worse cause coma or death. </p></div>		</li>
