<p>Comp a person off a green screen into a game, and the graphics that just looked good are going to look laughable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at a game that has modded in Hi-Res textures that don't update the models, animations, and normal maps and it will stand out a lot more. Or a Hi-Res texture pack that only changes some textures and not others, will make the low res textures stand out. </p>
<p>In either case it will become apparent how far away games are from photorealism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the life of me, I cannot understand people who make and use hi-res textures in minecraft. It doesn't look good, and never will.</p>
<p>And shaders are always excessive and over-the-top, as if covering everything with lens flare and bloom lighting will change the fact that it's still minecraft. A little subtlety wouldn't kill ya.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Textures
The secret is to model in 3d and bake-in the details, lighting and shaders.  The resulting Texture looks really good.  When this object gets into game, it's a simple texture that holds up in limited environments.</p>
<p>Particle systems
ALL of these are faked.  Things like physics and fluid sims all have their tricks.  Sometimes these too are sim'd in a renderer and turned into a flipbook. </p></div>		</li>
