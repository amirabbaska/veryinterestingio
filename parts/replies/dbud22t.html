<p>That IS how some employers regard it, though: butt-in-chair time is meaningless, results and deadlines met are what matters.</p>

<p>That can backfire horribly though, and result in everybody being overworked and management being unhappy because &quot;nothing ever gets done on time&quot;, unwilling to acknowledge a lack of manpower and thus deciding that the workers must be too inefficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My employer is the same, but I consider myself lucky.  I usually come in an hour later than we're &quot;supposed to&quot; and sometimes I will leave 2-3 hours earlier than we're &quot;supposed to&quot;.  On some occasions, I will stay 2-3 hours later too, depending on how motivated and interested I am in the current task I'm working on.  I also work from home basically every Friday.  I regularly work less than 40 hour work weeks, but my managers tell me I'm all good as long as I keep performing at my level.</p>
<p>I think the core of the problem is employers who don't know how to measure performance other than measuring time at work.  I can work my ass off for 20 hours a week and get more done than if I half-assed my work for 40 hours, so that's really a broken measurement for most professions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah depends on your employer.  I've been lucky with both my last two.  Worked in an office, boss only cared about work done.  Many days I'd leave early with full pay, and I already got off at 3. (I do miss getting off at that time.)</p>
<p>My current job is more service oriented and I get a combination salary and based on billable hours.  I don't have a quota.  I leave when I'm done for the day.  Some days I work from home.  Other days (usually a Friday) my boss will take us to the gun range for the last half of the day.</p></div>		</li>
