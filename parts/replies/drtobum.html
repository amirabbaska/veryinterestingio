			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.   A quick google search says there's something like 420 billion different combinations, but when you start adding the idea of evolution this blurs the line.  It's possible that there really are limitless combinations.  But some of these combinations will result in disease and fatality.  I dont think anyone really knows the answer.</p>
<p>And then if you want to get really crazy we could start talking about epigenetics, which is basically different proteins being transcribed based on the same DNA but different environmental conditions </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also be really interested in the role of epigenetics in this case. Are you considered a clone if you have the exact same DNA, but different epigentic markers and therefore different expression patterns?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with crossing over, the half-relatedness remains the same. Crossing over changes content, not content statistics. Individual genes might change, but overall heredity is maintained.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I said nothing about heredity.  He asked if they'd be a genetic clone and I gave him my opinion </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they would be genetically siblings, but not twins (identical or otherwise).</p>
<p>Identical twins occur when one fully fertilized egg/sperm pair (Zygote) splits physically in two and separates.  Therefore there are now two viable zygotes with identical DNA.  Non-identical twins and regular siblings are formed by different egg/sperm pairings.</p>
<p>Therefore two sets of identical twins having one kid each would be the same as one set of regular people having two kids.</p>
<p>Edit:  It sounds like I'm saying identical twins aren't regular people.  They are, they're just genetically interesting.  I'm not editing the body of the text to change this but am merely adding this addendum to clarify I'm not twin-ist.  Even though I actually am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be closer to calling them siblings than clones. They won't have the same exact genes as each other but will still be very similar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard or read somewhere that if two male identical twins were to have children with two female identical twins, their offsprings would genetically be brothers and sisters. Is that true? I may over simplify, sorry :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that’s about right.  Let’s imagine that there are two identical twin brothers called A and B, and two identical twin sisters called C and D.  If A and C have children together, then a standard paternity test wouldn’t be able to determine if the real parents were AC, AD, BC, or BD.  If you sequenced everyone’s genomes you could probably do it using crossovers, SNPs and the like, but it would be complex.</p></div>		</li>
