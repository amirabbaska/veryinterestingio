			<div class="markdown"><p>To build on that, our concept of taste is very influenced by our perception of food which includes the visuals but also the texture. The texture of melted cheese is so vastly different, it would contribute massively even if heating it didn't allow it to aerosolise more and react more vigorously with tastebuds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the smell of the food and it's texture play a large part in how things taste.
The texture of melted cheese is drastically different, and this coupled with the fact that it is warm and usually served with other things that smell great makes it taste different than cold cheese. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Taste buds are sensitized by heat. </p>
<p>Also, flavours are volatile compounds that are present in foods. Some of these compounds are activated by heat. Some
are destroyed by heat. More and different volatile compounds can be present when food is warmed, when it is too warm, when it is kept warm for too long, when it cools back down, and so on. </p>
<p>Coffee is a good example. The key aromatic compounds that give coffee its characteristic flavour are altered or destroyed when the water used to brew it is too hot. They also break down when the brewed coffee is left on a heating element too long, to stop it from cooling. If you have a cup of hot coffee that just doesn't taste right, it is usually the way it was prepared rather than the quality of the bean.</p></div>		</li>
