<p>Why are they immortal? They still experience apoptosis, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't do their job when they're immortal. One of the reasons they die off is because the young whippersnapper cells can actually do the work that needs doing and the older cells aren't very useful. We'd have to not only maintain immortality in cells but also maintain function. Only then can we really be IMMORTAL!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a wonderful SF story which featured a search for alien rejuvenation technology. The end result was they discovered something like a start trek transporter, moving you a few metres. The secret of course, was that it only moved you, carefully leaving behind all intracellular detritus and toxins, effectively rejuvenating you on a cellular basis.</p>
<p>A wonderful but impossible idea. All cells tend towards senescence and as you say, mitosis allows a partial reset. Some material is carried over but much must be created anew.</p></div>		</li>
