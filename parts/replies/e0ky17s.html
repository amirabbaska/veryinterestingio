			<div class="markdown"><p>I think general sales means that they can sell them in stores that are not pharmacies. In some countries, all over the counter medication is sold only in pharmacies. You can't go to a grocery store and buy ibuprofen, only a pharmacy can sell it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard of those as BTC, behind the counter, with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a pharmacy, not requiring a prescription but requiring a pharmacist's discretion to purchase, as of drugs or medical devices. Please be aware that all behind-the-counter purchases require identification so the pharmacist can verify your age before purchase.</p>
</blockquote></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Myself and any doctors I work with tend to consider 2 and 3 as otc, as when we ask the question we're really wanting to know if you take any meds that aren't on our computer system so we can make sure you're not going to accidentally double up on something (such as paracetamol with co-codamol)  or take something that interacts with what we're prescribing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My interpretation is how it is taught in the law module of a pharmacy degree but I guess as otc isn't a legal category and more an informal grouping then you can interpret it as you please. </p></div>		</li>
