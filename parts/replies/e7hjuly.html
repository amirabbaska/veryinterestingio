			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t this mean anything heavier than iron should decay on its own?  I expect the answer is probably they do, but with a long half life.  But I haven’t heard of something like normal gold decaying on its own.</p>
<p>Also, what allows the unstable atoms to have a long half life?  What is causing the potential barrier that prevents these atoms from spontaneously decaying immediately?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We haven't identified any combination of particles that form a proton when combined, and have a lower total rest mass than a proton when separate.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you clarify this please?  The rest mass of a proton is 938 MeV/c^2 , while an up quark is 2.3 MeV/c^2 and a down quark is 4.8 MeV/c^2 . I'm not sure how the energy in the gluon field fits into your explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, and appropriate user name.  I tried to make my answer simple, but it was a little too simple.</p>
<p>To get energy out from splitting a particle, the initial rest mass has to be higher than the rest masses of the products <em>after they are separated a large distance</em>.  If you try to knock a single quark out of a proton, it won't come out by itself.  You will have to add energy initially to move it away from the other quarks.  The strong force is so strong, that you end up adding enough energy in that process to create a new quark-antiquark pair out of the vacuum.  Then, one of those may go with the quark you're knocking out and the other may stay.  The first quark can now be separated from the other two, but presto-chango, it's not a quark anymore - it's a meson.  and the other two aren't a pair of quarks, they got that other one so they're back to being a baryon.  The proton is the lowest mass baryon, so no combination of meson+baryon will have lower rest mass than a proton.  There are more complicated combinations of breakup, but they will always include, in the end, at least one baryon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A detailed, most correct answer is beyond my recollection.  However, a simple answer is to note that baryons have an odd number of quarks (3) and mesons have an even number (2).  No combination of even numbers will add up to an odd number.  All sorts of messy combinations may be possible in a very small time frame during the split, but to release energy, the resulting combination of particles has to exist for a relatively long time separated by a relatively large distance.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that particle-antiparticle pairs can be created from the vacuum, because that process never results in an unpaired quark.  If you try to stick up that pesky lone quark in a meson in the final state, by joining it with a quark that was created as part of a quark-antiquark pair from the vacuum, fine, but there's the other quark from the created pair that you now have to account for.</p></div>		</li>
