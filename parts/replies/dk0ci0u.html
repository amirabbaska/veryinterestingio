			<div class="markdown"><p>Am in med school.  We just covered this topic in Immuno.  Spot on explanation.  The helminthic treatment has also shown to work on food allergies IIRC.  </p>
<p>Also to the comments asking about synthesizing the worms immune modulating compounds, worms trigger our IgE antibodies.  That is just one wing of our immune system, and it exists solely to deal with worms.  My guess is that the worms only modulate that portion of our immune system, so it would be unlikely to help protect us from anything other than IgE reactions.  So would work great on allergies.  But not so great on something like lupus.  I'm just speculating on this part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems a reasonable hypothesis.  But, per Wikipedia's entry on helminthic therapy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lack of exposure to naturally occurring pathogens and parasites may result in an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. Correlational data has shown the prevalence of helminthic infections to be greatest south of the equator where the rates of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis are low.[16][17] This is consistent with the hygiene hypothesis which suggests that helminthic infections protect individuals from developing auto-immune diseases rather than being an agent responsible for inducing them.[9][18][19] A complete explanation of how environmental factors play a role in autoimmune diseases has still not been proposed. Epidemiological studies such as the meta-analysis by Leonardi-Bee et al.,[9] however, have helped to establish the link between parasitic infestation and their protective role in autoimmune disease development.</p>
<p>Genetic research on the interleukin genes (IL genes) shows that helminths have been a major selective force on a subset of these human genes. In other words, helminths have shaped the evolution of at least parts of the human immune system, especially the genes responsible for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease; and provides further evidence that it is the absence of parasites, and in particular helminths, that has likely caused a substantial portion of the increase in incidence of diseases of immune dysregulation and inflammation in industrialized countries in the last century.[20]</p>

<p>There's lots more in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthic_therapy" target="_blank">article</a>, if you're interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.  I'm not sure if it is triggering the same pathways.  Might be.  Someone with more immuno experience than me should answer this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in theory, we could figure out what specific thing the worms give off that supresses immune response, synthesize it and cure a shit ton of allergy and auto-immune disorders?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly.  It could also be the presence of the actual worms themselves that teach the immune system what it's really supposed to be fighting.  We're not too clear on why this works, yet. </p></div>		</li>
