			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be quite possible that plant and animal life would flourish in a similar environment to what existed &quot;3 million years ago.&quot; But here's where that all falls apart. We haven't taken 3 million years to change the climate back to what it once was, we've taken 100-200. [<a href="https://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/uploads/AR5_extinction_speed___arrows.png" target="_blank">IPCC</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A<strong>brupt irreversible regional damage, by 2100, under all but the best-case emissions scenario (RCP2.6)</strong> </p>
<p>Within this century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0,and 8.5) [i.e., all scenarios except the best-case RCP2.6] pose high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands. (AR5 WG2 SPM)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Practically speaking, at the rate we are going now most herbaceous plants and virtually all trees can be expected to become radically reduced in population and health by 2100. Simply because if you move the plant's suitable climate more that that one plant can migrate, it dies.</p>
<p>This is only one of the priceless side of climate change, as for one you could theoretically measure in damages($), water level change is very problematic. The simple facts that &quot;hot climate melts land ice&quot; and that we appear to be doing little to lessen CO2 emissions should worry you dramatically. If all land ice melts, the global sea level would rise the equivalent of a <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/quickfacts.html" target="_blank">21 story building</a> at every shoreline in every country. This is enough to displace roughly<a href="http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/methodology_sheets/oceans_seas_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf" target="_blank"> 40 to 60% of all humans on earth</a>. Look at the panic that's occurring because of Syrian refugees in the western countries, that was only for <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php" target="_blank">5 million refuges</a>. Admittedly water level rise occurs over a few millennia, but we are getting close to permanently displacing 4.5 billion people. What won't wait for a few millennia, however, are storm surges (e.g. raising the water level a few feet allows for storm surges to be launched further into the mainland, destroying things like <a href="http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/1_24_13_news_andrew_nycsurgeevents_1050_1005_s_c1_c_c.jpg" target="_blank">the NYC metro</a>
with increasing occurrence).</p>
<p>This isn't something you can just shut off in 50 years. CO2 emissions are basically inert in the atmosphere, meaning they don't react with much and thus stay in the atmosphere for <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-residence-time.htm" target="_blank">many times more than a few millennia.</a> If we want to counter some of these effects, we have to do it <em>now</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious follow up question in regards to the plants: Assuming what you said about plants, could humans just intervene and plant plants in new locations so that they wouldn't have to migrate themselves?</p>
<p>Also, I made the assumption that the plant's suitable climate would expand rather than move. Hence, they wouldn't really die and radically reduced in population as you mentioned. Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

<p>sure, but on that scale your looking at huge costs with no direct financial reward for the party doing the planting.</p>
<p>you run into the same problem as with preventing climate chance in the first place. it's doable, but it doesn't benefit you financially. it's better for individual actors to hold out and hope that somebody else shoulders the expense.</p>
<p>the big problem is of course that everybody thinks that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/qwertx0815 answers your first question well, in a cynically correct kind of way. It's something that would have to occur at a national level, and as the only superpower on earth is actively denying basic logic, it's a far off possibility, for right now anyways.</p>
<p>Before I get to your second question I would like to let you know that you're making a common fundamental flaw in your reasoning. It's one that runs something like &quot;we can just delay it and everything will go back to normal, right?&quot; Delaying the destruction of an immeasurable amount of cellular life for 20 years is not the same thing as stopping it permanently.  </p>
<p>As for your second question, you appear to be incorrect according to the graph I linked previously and its <a href="https://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/ipcc_2014.html" target="_blank">study</a>. The study incorporates the variables of forest fires, drought, and insect infestation to produce a number respecting an organism's ability to survive dryer lands or find wetter ones. No, basically anything you've ever heard that says &quot;climate change is good&quot; is drastically outweighed by the <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-positives-negatives.htm" target="_blank">negative results it produces.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consequences of climate change become increasingly bad after each additional degree of warming, with the consequences of 2°C being quite damaging and the consequences of 4°C being potentially catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental</strong></p>
<p>Positive effects of climate change may include greener rainforests and enhanced plant growth in the Amazon, increased vegetation in northern latitudes and possible increases in plankton biomass in some parts of the ocean. Negative responses may include further growth of oxygen poor ocean zones, contamination or <strong>exhaustion</strong> of fresh water, increased incidence of natural fires, extensive vegetation die-off due to droughts, increased risk of coral <strong>extinction</strong>, decline in global photoplankton, changes in migration patterns of birds and animals, changes in seasonal periodicity, disruption to food chains and <strong>species loss</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting fact. Did you know that climate change is a primary reason as to why pine beetles and the like are moving like a scourge? With climate change comes decreased occurrences of subzero (or just really cold) days, which were one of the few things that could kill large swaths of pine beetles as their unhatched larva are particularly prone to cold temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
