			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't really matter because there is equal gas pressure from the outside of the bubble as the inside, unlike a balloon the tension force is so small that it's not really affecting the pressure. But sure, if the pressure inside wasnt evenly distrubuted you'd not get a spherical bubble</p></div>		</li>
