			<div class="markdown"><p>False, a GS1 code does not encode the country of sale, it encodes the country where the company that bought the EANs was registered.</p>
<p>If your EAN code starts with 871 that means the company was based in the Netherlands, not that the product was ment for the dutch market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It encodes the county the company is in. Sometimes, that coencides with the market as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The leading 0 <em>is</em> used in a 13 or 14 digit UPC.</p>
<p>A UPC Company Prefix <em>is not</em> the same thing as a GS1 Company Prefix. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>UPC Company Prefix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>123456</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GS1 Company Prefix </p>
<blockquote>
<p>0123456</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you use a GS1 Company Prefix on a 12 digit UPC, you're actually saying your UPC Company Prefix is 012345 and your Item Reference Number is 6xxxx.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other than the country code, it's kinda funny how closely this tracks to how IP addresses were assigned, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>some companies/organizations - kind of arbitrarily - getting large blocks (GE, IBM, AT&amp;T, Ford, Apple, and the US postal service all got &quot;Class A&quot; blocks, each of which contains over 16 million individual IP addresses. HP has <em>two</em> class A blocks through their purchase of DEC.)</li>
<li>And later companies getting smaller blocks.</li>
<li>variable length prefixes (The IETF introduced Classless Inter-Domain Routing which allows for variable length prefixes)</li>
<li>too many people needing barcodes (IPv4 address exhaustion)</li>
<li>prefixes that are for internal use only (192.168.*.* and 10.*.*.* are probably the most well known private network ranges)</li>
<li>Heck, even country code has kind of an equivalent in that there are 5 regional Internet registries for handing out IP addresses in the various regions in the world. If you're in the US, you get your IP address from ARIN. If you're in China, you get yours from APNIC. So this is kinda like continent specific prefixes.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  When my small company needed 200 barcodes, we bought 200 barcodes and you just use a webform at GS1US to enter the product information and they assign you a barcode.</p></div>		</li>
