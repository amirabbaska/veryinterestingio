			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in the states there were boundary conflicts, such as the Michigan/Ohio border. This lead to a two-year delay in Michigan being granted statehood, skirmishes with stabbings and garrison forces occupying conflicted territory, and ultimately Ohio gaining Toledo and Michigan gaining the Upper Peninsula which realistically would be more aligned with Wisconsin's interests than Michigan's. #RememberTheStrip!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the war for the Toledo Strip was because Toledo was an important port in Lake Erie for trade, and whoever got it would receive a great economic position. When it was decided Ohio got it Michigan got so angry that to nip that in the bud they were given the Upper Peninsula. </p>
<p>Even after that Michigan was fuming, until it was discovered that the UP held one of the largest native copper deposits in the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toledo was so important because of the ease of access to the interior, too. At this point in time, Detroit was essentially surrounded by swampland which diminished its utility as a port.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Only twice have states gone to war with one another. One of them was Ohio and Michigan, where they had a boundary dispute over Toledo. That history doesn’t record who won the war, but we have to assume Michigan did, because nobody would fight to keep Toledo&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Illinoisain here. I never thought much about the shape until I saw a map of rivers only in the elementary school's atlas, and found that the Mississippi River had the same exact shape as map border of the state. I also learned later that Illinois used to be smaller but they pretty much asked Wisconsin for a little strip at the top so they could have access to lake Michigan. So yea, both examples in my state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about a lack of space, it's entirely about the history of politics and conflict. China and Russia both have massive countries, but their border has been changing for centuries, before accurate maps and measurements of longitude existed, so they're squiggly.</p>
<p>A straight border is a border that's been created new, without reference to old borders, including natural ones, and then hasn't changed significantly since then.</p></div>		</li>
