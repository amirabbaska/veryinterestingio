			<div class="markdown"><p>Marijuana dispensaries are basically just stores that sell marijuana. With many states legalizing marijuana many of these stores are popping up to sell it. The problem is that even though states are &quot;legalizing&quot; marijuana, marijuana is still illegal at the federal level. Federal law supersedes state law, so the states are not so much legalizing it as just choosing not to enforce federal laws. This &quot;legal but not legal&quot; status creates a lot of problems.</p>
<p>One big problem is that these stores cannot open bank accounts. The reason being is that the banks taking their money could be considered money laundering since, at a federal level, the selling of marijuana is illegal. Thats why dispensaries have to deal purely with cash.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also may be that the bank you deal with is actually a credit union that does not operate outside of the state of CO which would go a long way in protecting them from federal interference as most banks are concerned about the money they take in from shops being electronically transferred across state lines into states where weed is still illegal. Doing so would open the bank to a whole lot of leaf all trouble that is not worth the hundreds of millions they could be making from the weed industry. This kind just illustrates how much money they are making off all the other morally questionable but legal business they work with SMH.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in Washington this is still a problem last I heard. FDIC insured banks won't take your mj cash here. There are some special non-fdic banks that are doing it but the deposit limits that they self insure are small. If they got robbed or went under you could be fucked from what I understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so simple as that. The tenth amendment to the constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, if the Constitution doesn't specifically spell out a power to the federal government (or forbid the states from having said power), the states have that power. </p>
<p>Problem is, over the course of our history federal courts have done some wonderful gymnastics to stretch federal powers where they don't belong.</p>
<p>For instance, the federal government does not have the ability to ban a substance, but it can control interstate commerce. So, even if the marijuana is grown in Colorado, sold in Colorado, and smoked in Colorado, the fact that it COULD potentially cross state boundaries causes it to fall under the interstate commerce clause.</p>
<p>If you follow that thread of crazy logic far enough, the federal government has unlimited powers over the states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taxes is something you pay on income, not only legal income, but all income. IRS isn't there to enforce federal laws except taxation laws, and I believe they do not share sources of income with other government agencies, I think you just mention you have a business, the type of business is probably same as selling herbal stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this covers quite a bit of the contradictions in the ways our pot laws work including the banking problems and such that dispensaries both medical and recreational have to deal with and the taxes which turns out they have to and do pay</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If u watch John Oliver's segment on this. He explains that's it's illegal on the federal level but you still have to report your taxes. It's a purely cash business but they still keep track of all sales</p></div>		</li>
