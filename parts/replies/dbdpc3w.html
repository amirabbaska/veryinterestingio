<p>Not that I support cutting the science budgets, but it's not a <em>complete</em> waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't go as far as to call a large potion of humanity &quot;stupid&quot;, they just prioritize different things. IMO the further development of science and technology will likely lead to a easier and stable future for future generations (I hope). But some people just say &quot;meh, I don't live long, fuck it&quot;. Some people are just trying to live their lives and could care less about science, but I wouldn't call them stupid. </p>
<p>Just to clarify, I only used &quot;I don't live long&quot; as a example, I'm sure there are many other reasons. Most people are not ignorant to the point of believing thst the future of society is not important. But if you give him the option over, let's say, lower tuition costs for himself and kids with effects felt almost immediately, or funding for science, which would <strong>you</strong> choose. People are just trying to live a good life and survive. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think people realize how everything they own and use is related to some field of science, which is at the top of the pyramid. All the funding required to build the base of that pyramid is the science budget...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I, on the other hand, have very little faith in the average human and would definitely go as far as to call a large portion of humanity &quot;stupid&quot;. I would also argue that lack of foresight and/or caring about something simply because &quot;I won't live to see the consequences&quot; is a very, very stupid outlook on life. </p>
<p>Granted, I'm considering starting a PhD in engineering, so maybe I'm not the best person to be making this judgement. </p></div>		</li>
