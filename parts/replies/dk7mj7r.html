			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity. It really isn't spinning fast enough to have that kind of an impact. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81m/s^2, and centripetal acceleration is just going to be a=v^2 /r, where v is tangential velocity and r is radius around which it's rotating. I can't really do that math right now, but it's orders of magnitude weaker than gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way weaker. Here's a clever description of orbital velocity at the distance of the International Space Station:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ISS moves so quickly that if you fired a rifle bullet from one end of a football field, the International Space Station could cross the length of the field before the bullet traveled 10 yards.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's far away. As you get closer to the ground, where most of the atmosphere resides, orbital velocity becomes absolutely mind boggling. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The vacuum of space, while extremely empty compared to anything we can make on Earth, isn't actually a true vacuum. It tends to contain anything from a few tens of particles per cubic centimetre (vacuum between planets) to as low as one hydrogen molecule per cubic metre (vacuum between galaxies). That being said, Earth's atmosphere basically becomes space at between 500 - 1000km up, a region known as the exosphere, where the density of atmosphere is so low that it can't be defined as a gas because the molecules are too sparse to actually collide with each other often and produce gas-like properties. This is where the vacuum of outer space begins. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK, this one is just the fact that gravity provides a stronger pull than centrifugal force does. There is a slight bulge in the atmosphere (and the Earth) at the equator, but the rotation is nowhere near fast enough to actually throw the entire atmosphere off, as it weighs a huge amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth is not &quot;incredibly fast spinning&quot; in anything close to the ballpark of &quot;tearing the atmosphere away&quot;. At the equator the surface is spinning at about 1000 miles per hour - which is much slower than what orbital velocity would be at the surface (the speed you would need to exceed to &quot;tear off&quot;) which is about 18000 miles per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In orbit, you're in free fall. You're going so fast that when you fall, you miss the planet. </p>
<p>Flying fast enough to support yourself with lift means you're basically pushing the atmosphere down to keep yourself up. You've got drag and you require continuous power to keep yourself from falling. </p>
<p>I'm trying to give a more coherent answer than &quot;They are nothing alike.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

<p>The curvature of wings creates a lower pressure on the top of the wing.  This imbalance - low pressure on top, high pressure on bottom - is known as &quot;lift.&quot;  At high altitudes the overall air pressure decreases so a wing must travel faster to generate the same lift it would have at sea level.  (Ex: planes can take off and land at about 100mph, but to maintain level flight at 30,000ft they need to be going closer to mach speed.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>being in orbit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orbit means you are traveling so fast that the acceleration due to gravity turns your path into a circle but you never actually land.  (Ex: you toss a ball, it arcs and lands a few feet away.  You hit a ball with a bat, it has a much larger arc and lands a few hundred feet away.  You launch a ball into orbit with a rocket, it falls the same as the first two, but it keeps <em>missing</em> the Earth as it falls past the curve of the horizon.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't how wings work. Otherwise planes would never be able to fly upside down, yet they do. There are also planes with symmetrical airfoil wings.</p>
<p>Lift is generated mostly from the angle of attack of the wings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you took away all the forces acting on your craft other than gravity (so discounting air resistance/lift, engine thrust, etc), and your trajectory has you falling around the planet rather than falling into it, you're in orbit. If your trajectory falls into the planet when you take the air away, you were not going fast enough to orbit, and instead were supporting yourself with lift. So if the speed it would take to generate enough lift to hold up, say, a ten ton space plane at a 100km altitude is GREATER than the speed it would take for a ten ton brick with no wings to orbit normally at that altitude, it's more meaningful to describe it as being in orbit since it doesn't need the air to do what it is doing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would still be an orbit, just one that intersects the surface of the planet.  But yes that is not a very practical orbit unless your in the artillery business.</p></div>		</li>
