<p>The water being boiled as part of the brewing process of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, the ale didn’t really stop the epidemic but was the reason the cause was found. John Snow realised that the people working at the brewery weren’t getting infected by the cholera. This led to him doing a survey of the people getting the cholera and found that people near the one pump were getting it most. After his report, it was discovered that the cess pit next to the pump was leaking in, which caused the water to be contaminated. This was fixed, and was a big step to realising the causes of cholera and how sanitation effects health. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The linked article debunks the theory that bad water made people turn to beer.  But it doesn't debunk the theory that lots of people were already drinking beer instead of water (and that theory is pretty easily provable) and thus not getting as sick.</p>
<p>tl;dr People didn't drink beer because of bad water. They drank beer because they liked it. The side benefit was that they didn't get cholera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out the beer was a sort anti-patient-zero.
Here:</p>
<p>There was one significant anomaly – none of the workers in the nearby Broad Street brewery contracted cholera. As they were given a daily allowance of beer, they did not consume water from the nearby well.[19] During the brewing process, the wort (or un-fermented beer) is boiled in part so that hops can be added. This step killed the cholera bacteria in the water they had used to brew with, making it safe to drink. Snow showed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company were taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the Thames and delivering it to homes, resulting in an increased incidence of cholera among its customers. Snow's study is part of the history of public health and health geography. It is regarded as the founding event of epidemiology.</p>
