			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, get ready for that healing honey lather, my friend:</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the chemicals in honey may kill certain bacteria and fungus. When applied to the skin, honey may serve as a barrier to moisture and keep skin from sticking to dressings. Honey may also provide nutrients and other chemicals that speed wound healing.</p>
<p>Topical use of honey has a long history. In fact, it is considered one of the oldest known wound dressings. Honey was used by the ancient Greek physician Dioscorides in 50 A.D. for sunburn and infected wounds. Honeyâ€™s healing properties are mentioned in the Bible, Koran, and Torah.&quot;</p>
