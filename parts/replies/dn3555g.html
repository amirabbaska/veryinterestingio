			<div class="markdown"><p>I would've assumed that the game told the Alien the area you were in, but not your exact location. When you first encounter it in the medical bay, it patrols the first area until you get through the passcode door. Then it only patrols the area past the door. Then you get to the hospital rooms and it only patrols that area. Same thing on your way back. It seems like there's a rubberband attatched to you and the Alien, and I heard it gets a lot smaller on the hardest difficulty.</p>
<p>What kind of hints could it be fed, beyond &quot;They're somewhere in this area&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once told that when the alien finds you in a hiding spot and then kills you, it checks that hiding spot first the next go around, so you're never allowed to rely on the same trick twice. That might not hold true at lower difficulties, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It checks randomly on set places. Say it checks under tables, in vents, and behind boxes, and you're in a locker. And it's never seen you in the locker it'll tell the game, check these 3 locations in no particular order. It won't find you in a locker. But if you take out the heart beats sensor it'll hear it and open the locker. Next go around it'll know to check under tables, behind boxes, in vents, and in lockers. </p>
<p>What if it never finds you in a locker? The game automatically unlocks it's ability to search lockers and different areas further into the game so your tactic won't last forever </p></div>		</li>
