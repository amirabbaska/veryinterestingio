			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little bit to the end, one of the requirements for the fabrication of a processor is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_set" target="_blank">mask set</a>, which is kind of like a set of stencils for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography" target="_blank">photolithography</a> process (The laser-etching with light). The mask set costs a ton of money (Millions USD, I believe, but I don't know across the board), which is why there is a lot of work that goes into making sure the design works before it is printed. Some defects can be fixed by modifying the existing masks, but when a defect is bad enough to require a redesign, then the company has to order new masks to be created.   In addition, the enormous up-front cost often makes it cheaper to produce a line of products using a single mask set. An example would be what princesshitler was talking about, with lower performance i7 processors being sold as i3's and i5's. It's possible that Intel only has a mask set for fully-powered i7 processors, and disables cores as necessary to meet the demand for i3 and i5 processors. I know that is common practice with the silicon that I work with, but I don't have any inside knowledge on Intel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would imagine there are a couple of different mask sets - it's not just a matter of establishing how fast it will reliably clock and then disabling some cores if one of the cores hasn't turned out right. There are different features around hyper-threading and virtualisation (for instance) that I imagine aren't in every chip. They won't have a different mask for every product, but I suspect they have more than one for each generation of product.</p>
<p>That said yeah, rebadging your reject pile as lower grade product is standard across many industries and means you can sell product for something rather than having it go as wastage.</p></div>		</li>

To make this work, the mirrors and lenses used to focus the beam need a special coating, and the chambers are filled with special gasses to not let the beam be absorbed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One thing I would like to note that you may have forgotten is before anything, you need to design the datapath around the functions you would like to support. For example, a GPU is going to have hardware specifically designed for dealing with graphics related computations.</p></div>		</li>

You should take a computer architecture class that teaches you verilog as then you start to really understand what's going on and it starts to make a lot more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds awesome! I've worked with ARM at the assembly level but I've been wanting to check out the MIPS instruction set to see what the differences are. You're right though, it's tough deciding what's within the scope for a conversation with someone who likely knows absolutely nothing about circuits or digital logic.</p>
<p>In the case of the GPU, as far as I know the communication is all PCI protocol. It'd be awesome to learn more about those implementation details like what information is being sent back and forth</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I assumed that's why you left it out, but after just finishing my Computer Architecture course I had to geek out a little... </p>
<p>My professor was talking about how he was going to switch to the ARM instruction set soon (mostly due to it being more modern). Apparently there are a lot of similarities between MIPS and ARM!</p></div>		</li>

<p>simulation software such as Modelsim or Quartus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used Quartus for my computer engineering courses and I often stumble upon weird bugs where one change would cause the software to prevent me from running the simulation and stuff. The the thing is it's not a design error because after I copied everything into a new quartus file the thing works just fine.</p>
<p>I can't imagine a big company using these software for their huge projects, or maybe I was just retarded and made a mistake myself.</p></div>		</li>
