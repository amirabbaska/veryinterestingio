<p>Does anyone know if this concept has a name? Something only exists or is enhanced because the antithesis of that things also exists. I feel like I come across similar ideas all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; The main constituents of a satisfied life appear to be two, either of which by itself is often found sufficient for the purpose: tranquillity, and excitement. With much tranquillity, many find that they can be content with very little pleasure: with much excitement, many can reconcile themselves to a considerable quantity of pain. There is assuredly no inherent impossibility in enabling even the mass of mankind to unite both; since the two are so far from being incompatible that they are in natural alliance, the prolongation of either being a preparation for, and exciting a wish for, the other.&quot;  -John Stuart Mill, <em>Utilitarianism</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a description of a form of positive vs negative (thermal) alliesthesia. Same as with a warm fire and a window open is often preferable to having the air heated to the same temperature as the comfortable 'sweet spot' between the two. The negative can highlight the positive. It is very heavily influenced by personal feelings as well. Some 5% of people will claim to be uncomfortable in the exact situation they claim to desire the most. </p></div>		</li>
