<p>They separate of the platelets for people who need those, and the plasma for people who need that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are packed cella, not washed. Youd only wash if you need to remove an allergen that causes real problems. For example, iga in a unit can cause anaphylaxis in a patient that is iga deficient. That unit must be washed. </p>
<p>Some patients break out and get itchy from some random plasma proteins. Those units dont get washed, patient gets a benadryl or a different unit. </p>
<p>No circumstance calls for washed unit in a trauma patient that I know of</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently learned you can get a buildup from iron in your blood as a result of receiving red blood cell transfusions. It just occurred to me that would be another reason to avoid giving whole blood when just the platelet count is low. Apparently, the liver can’t efficiently filter out extra iron and it can just hang out in your blood for years. That was my understanding when St Jude explained it to me (my daughter received numerous transfusions over the course of three years so this was a possible side effect).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do separate the components and use them for different patients. Usually it's broken up into plasma (just the liquid and important proteins), platelets (coagulation) and red blood cells (oxygen transport). You can freeze plasma, red blood cells can be stored in the fridge for at least a month, but platelets decay within days, which would spoil a full blood donation. </p>
<p>Separated it's relatively easy to match donor component to recipient. Red blood cells have a whole bunch of antigens beyond just the AB0 and Rh ones, but it's usually possible to find matches (some people produce reaaaally weird antibodies and then matching even red blood cells can become a nightmare). </p>
<p>Full blood <em>would</em> contain some of the donor's immune cells and they'd start attacking anything in the recipient's body that doesn't match the donor's. It's usually not quite as impressive as giving someone a totally wrong match (their blood coagulates at random, then they start bleeding at random when all the coagulation factors are used up), but if a patient needs blood they're usually not so healthy that you'd want to add that risk. The only time full blood transfusions work fine is when people store their own blood before major surgery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would make blood types even more important, since you would be introducing blood that could have antibodies against your blood cells. For example if you are AB, you could no longer receive A or B, only AB, since the A blood could have anti-B antibodies, and B could have anti-A and O could have anti A and/or B. The blood would also contain T-cells, which could be activated to expand and attack your own cells if you shared some MHC haplotypes (like a reverse transplant rejection). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ABO red blood antigens are weird and are kind of an exception to how antigens normally work. You will almost certainly form antibodies to the ABO antigens (A or B) that you lack - So O patients will form Anti-A and Anti-B, A patients will form Anti-B, and B patients will form Anti-A. AB patients will form neither. O patients can receive only O red cells, but any plasma. A patients can receive O or A red cells and A or AB plasma. B patients can receive O or B red cells, but only B or AB plasma, and AB patients can receive any red cells, but only AB plasma.</p>
<p>For patients with an acquired or hereditary immunodeficiency, the blood will be irradiated, which destroys T-cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells, to prevent it from attacking the patient's own blood (and other) cells (transfusion associated graft vs. host disease) .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The residual amount of anti-B in a unit of A RBCs is clinically insignificant due to the antibodies being diluted in the patient's total blood volume, along with the tendency of ABO antibodies to prefer soluble antigens.</p>
<p>Giving A units to AB patients is fairly common. I work in a hospital lab that dispenses blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you say “washed”? Could you change it to separated? Washing is a special process not commonly done and reduces the lifespan of the product to 24 hours. Where I work it also requires Medical Director approval and also takes 2 hours to do so definitely not for traumas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neonates do get a product with more specific requirements, but not washed. </p>
<p>Where I work, we give CMV Neg, fresh, with a specific additive, O NEG blood type only (all of these are not necessarily rare, but difficult when put together). If birth weight is really low and it’s not emergent release we will irradiate the blood. And all testing done for every other unit is still done. Usually neonates will also get designated units to prevent exposure to multiple donors.</p></div>		</li>
