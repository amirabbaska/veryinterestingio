			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very possible for dogs to become depressed. After 9/11 it was reported that many of the search and rescue dogs suffering symptoms of depression because they could never find any survivors, only bodies. Their handlers would stage fake finds so that the dogs would cheer up and keep searching.</p>

<p>But more about your specific situation. Dogs do tend to become attached to their &quot;owner&quot; and will behave differently when that person is not around. The relationship can be similar to parent/child.</p>

<p>However the behavior change you are describing is unusual and maybe dangerous. I would try to get your family members to be more active in taking care of your dog while you are at home and while you are away, so that your dog understands you are not the only human it can rely on. It's also possible they are unintentionally training your dog to act that way. Some things to watch out for: Do they yell at your dog when he wants to play? Do they complain about feeding him? Are they only nice to him when he exhibits depressed behavior?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs definitely get sad and I have no doubt your dog misses you, but sadness that can be normal and healthy is difficult to discrimanate from something that might be clinical in a dog.  I would say for the most part if you have a dog surrounded by its family they will be very happy even if they miss part of the family. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before there's evidence for cognitive decline in dogs in general as they get older. We even have powerful evidence from our Dognition citizen scientist that around age 7 things start to change in terms of a dogs memory and attention.  I have an older dog, Tassie, who is 8. I make sure he stays stimulated by playing cognitive games with him (we try all the new Dognition games out on him), and I also feed him Purina's Bright Mind, which I think is a really exciting breakthrough in dog nutrition. It has a compound called MCTs that are designed to support your dogs brain health. The most important thing is to make sure your dog gets the right exercise, food, mental stimulation, and love.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buying dog food on presence/absence of a single fancy additive isn't a fantastic idea. Focus more on quality of actual nutritionally necessary ingredients, how they're sourced, processed, etc. As someone who sells dog food to people I'm always immediately suspicious of any food whose first advert claim is &quot;contains such-and-such ingredient that no one else has!&quot;, particularly because that should make you wonder why exactly no one else has it if it's so great. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I consider Purina to be a mid-quality brand that seems to focus more on marketing than nutrition standards. I'd recommend about a dozen other brands ahead of them. But that's just me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It works for humans too, by causing the body to make ketones that feed the brain in people whose brains have become insulin resistant from a lifetime of too many carbs.

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the symptoms of depression, except for suicidal thoughts, can be induced in dogs (and people) by subjecting them to unavoidable punishment / stress in the lab.  The condition is known as learned helplessness.  Martin Seligman the psychologist has a lot of stuff out on it: some of his followers are kind of woo-woo, but he is not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really appreciate this comment.  I am aware of this type of work and I certainly take the point that this is something that many scientist have traditionally promoted.  I personally would recommend extreme skepticism from both a scientific and ethical perspective with approaches that treat animals so harshly in captive laboratory environments.  There may be similarities between human conditions of depression and what happens to a dog who is forced to suffer in a lab but this approach has long suffered itself from an inability to translate much toward human treatments......I very much doubt what researchers need to call &quot;depression&quot; in dogs to get their next grant has much to do with human depression. It is what makes treating human depression so vexing...there is nothing like it in animals.    I may be wrong but if dogs suffer from human-like depression you would predict that there would be a measurable and valid approach that can differentiate acute from chronic sadness in pet dogs and it would be used widely by veterinarians for dogs in the real world.....there is not one.  So yes in an extremely artificial context you can produce something some people might call depression in caged lab dogs.....but that is very different than seeing it in the real world or it having any relevance to humans.  Again there are many opinions on this and I write this merely to express my own - flawed as it may be. </p></div>		</li>
