			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good question - thankfully Jupiter has a nice thick atmosphere to provide aerobraking, and also very importantly, lots of big moons to allow trajectory corrections.</p>
<p>If you do the calculations, it turns out the only giant planet we'd need considerable extra fuel for establishing orbit around is Neptune. Aerobraking alone isn't enough to slow the spacecraft down without damaging it, and Neptune has only one decently sized moon.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should add &quot;<em>with current technology</em>&quot; to that. There has been some investigation into establishing orbit around Neptune using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballute" target="_blank">ballute</a> for aerocapture, but considerably more research needs to be done before this is feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. I thought aerobreaking was impractical in real life (use it all the time in kerbal space program). </p>
<p>Has there been any mission that has used aerobreaking? </p></div>		</li>
