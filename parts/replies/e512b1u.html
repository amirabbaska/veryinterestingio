			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing that humans donâ€™t do well is just the first step. We are now trying to understand exactly why. Once the mechanisms are sufficiently well-understood, in the future, we might find solutions to that problem - or we might learn something new about physiological processes that again might unlock solutions to other and seemingly unrelated problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>humans don't do so well in microgravity</p>

<p>Not being mean to you, but I see this so many times in /r/askscience and /r/science, it seems like the vast majority of people never advance beyond the simplistic science they learnt in middle school. They think that all scientists test hypotheses as simple as &quot;do plants grow faster with more sunlight?&quot;. </p>
<p>Yes, we know a long time ago that humans don't do so well in microgravity, but the research doesn't just end there, because once you established that fact there are so many other questions that you could ask. Just listing down the complete symptoms of prolonged exposure to microgravity is a long task itself. After that, you need to study the progression of those symptom. We lose bone mass, but how many grams of bone per day of microgravity. Does this vary between men and women? Menopausal women versus non-menopausal women? Humans and dogs? Asians versus Europeans versus Indians versus Africans? How about BMI and height and fitness level? How about diet, how much calcium you eat, how much calorie you eat?</p>
<p>This is what I love about science so much, because the quest is never ending. Once you finish one study, it opens up even more questions, and you just keep chasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think an old Futurama episode summed this up completely. In the episode the Professor discovers all the answers to the universe and creates the &quot;Grand Unified Theory&quot; and reduces all the laws of physics down to a single equation. He then gets depressed because he's answered every question in science. Then Fry goes </p>
<p>&quot;That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that.&quot;</p>
<p>This makes the Professor happy because hey look...a new question to go study. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But isn't that just doing science for the sake of science and not really helping NASA go forward in manned exploration? We know it's bad. Why waste time measuring precisely how bad across dozens of different variables when we could spend that time finding ways to simulate gravity and essentially eliminate the problem altogether? What is it going to matter knowing that short, overweight, menopausal native American women experience 3% less bone loss due to microgravity if we can instead develop a simulation of gravity that keeps everyone healthy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>During the stay on board of the ISS the crews of Expeditions 49 / 50 carried out the following scientific experiments (without Russian experiments):</p>
<p>ACE-T-1 (Advanced Colloids Experiment-Temperature control-1)</p>

<p>At Home in Space (Culture, Values, and Environmental Adaptation in Space)</p>
<p>And so much more (it's in alphabetic order, I've got 167 experiments, without Russian ones)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think something that others are thinking when proposing this isn't necessarily how well suited such a module is for testing purposes, but rather, how well suited it is to let our brave men and women stuck up there do their work with minimal health risks in the process. We don't know the complete range of risks that micro gravity poses to a human body in the long term. It could have drastic consequences we don't know about. We already rotate the crew of the ISS fairly regularly, partly to address this very issue. This could conceivably limit the duration of some experiments, in which case, a partial gravity module might just let someone remain long enough to do more thorough investigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldnt it still have an area of microgravity toward the center? </p>
<p>And couldnt crew quarters exist in different parts so if you are gathering data on effects on humans you could still have them be 100% in microgravity? I could see this one as being no and real estate is at a premium to set up two different quarters/what would they use the non-microgravity outer ring for. But I would also think that by having a more normo-gravity  region to sleep, you could extend astronaut stays and run experiments longer with one team.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do you put the ~150 concurrent experiments distributed over many modules all in the center?</p>

<p>That was the idea of the proposed ISS module with a centrifuge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microgravity experiments are easily ruined by vibrations.  Having a large spinning object connected to the Station is going to send vibrations all through the station.  Of course a lot would be done to minimize those vibrations, but they would still exist.</p></div>		</li>
