			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of it is pretty straight forward. The noticeable phases of the moon (new moon, half face, full moon) are separated by 7 nights hence the week. A full cycle equals a 'month' whose name again, reflects the 'moon'. </p>
<p>A year, is obviously based on the sun. The ratio of moon's vs sun's cycle is just random, and happens to have 52+ weeks, or about 12+ lunar months.</p>
<p>The grouping numbers, are actually quite straight forward too. You basically want numbers you can group into as many smaller chunk as possible. The first number that lets you group into 2, 3, or 4 (ie. halfs, thirds, and quarters) is 12. So it is a the first go-to number. The first number that lets you group into 2, 3, 4, and 5, is 60. So that too is nice! So when there wasnt the sun or moon affecting things, we'd group stuff into part of 12 or 60. A grouping into 12 obviously gives the day.</p>
<p>Now sadly enough, humans have ten fingers instead of 12. So from that angle, people have always wanted to count till 10 instead of 12. And this has been an enduring conflict between the instinctive vs the learned minds.</p>
<p>The more intellectual fields therefore picked and kept 12 and 60, and hence 12 hours and 60 seconds of the clockmakers and 60 degrees of longitude/latitude of navigators and so on.</p>
<p>But the less intellectual areas that only needed to count, kept with 10. Hence the 10 of arithmetic, and the 1, 10, 100s of the decimal system.</p>
<p>One can only wish humans had 12 fingers, and we'd have perfect beauty of mathematics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About the impulse to count twelve: if you count the individual finger joints on the median human hand out with the thumb of that same hand, you count twelve. That was not an unheard of system for counting in numerologically inclined ancient societies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can also represent 32 on one hand, or 1024 using both!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A common THEORY is that 12 was used because that's how they counted on their hands. Using one hand they would use their thumb to point/count the number of 'sections' of their fingers. So each finger is 3 sections times 4 fingers is 12. Then use the other hand to keep track of how many time you've hit 12. You have 5 things on your left hand, each one representing 12, thus you get to 60.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda related, I loved learning about counting to ten on one hand when I visited China. </p>
<p>It's very clever, I was told it was invented so you could secretly negotiate prices on the market. Merchant and customer shake hands, sign their numbers and it's all silent and hidden from sight because they are wearing wide sleeves. Fucking brilliant!</p></div>		</li>
