			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. Hyperboloids provide somewhat better cooling performance, but it's not amazingly better than just a straight chimney. If hyperboloid towers were twice as expensive as straight towers and any less than twice as effective then we'd just build two straight towers instead of one hyperboloid tower.</p>
<p>But no, hyperboloid towers are easy to make, and they just so happen to be better at cooling. Thus, it makes sense to use hyperboloids. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The hyperboloid shape is able to be constructed using only straight lines (i.e. the curve doesn't need to be built into the raw materials).</p>

<p>That's not how they're built, though.  When you say a hyperboloid &quot;can be constructed using straight lines&quot;, I assume you mean diagonal lines like this:</p>

<p>But hyperboloid towers are not built from diagonal members.  They're built a layer at a time by assembling a ring of concrete forms, pouring concrete, then moving the forms upward to pour the next layer.  The forms have to be shaped to conform to the circular footprint and the sloping sides of the tower, and the same technology could be used to build a paraboloid, a sphere, or any other shape.  There's nothing special about hyperboloids from an ease-of-construction perspective.</p>
