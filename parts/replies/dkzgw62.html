<p>God, I have tactile hypersensitivity. Just some childhood trauma that caused an anxiety problem where seams in clothes, textures, tightness or looseness, will become an all consuming obsession in my mind. So all jobs requiring jeans and boots, or suits and ties, are out. Didn't go to college entirely because I didn't think I could do 4 more years of socks and shoes, so I guess it saved me from crippling student debt. But damn it fucked up my life. No one gets it, even I've written myself off as a crazy person, but at least someone out there understands. They know they're not suffocating, I know a toe seam is not hurting me, but we just can't fkin' turn it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine what that's like, so I guess I don't &quot;get it,&quot; but I can imagine how difficult that would be and I empathize. You're not crazy though, literally a part of your body isn't working as it normally would, like a broken bone. I think today more people are becoming more understanding of mental health issues, so I hope you have positive experiences in the real world when you have to share your struggles. Have you looked into any work-from-home jobs? I have some friends who do stuff like that. One does scheduling for a company, the other is a customer service chat representative for a clothing company. Maybe that would be up your alley?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Go buy a cheap pair of underwear and a cheap T-shirt, both two sizes too small with tags that poke out, and spend a few minutes thinking about how the tag feels on your skin. </p>
<p>Or get some socks with that little plastic thing that holds socks together (the long, clear strip of thin plastic wire).  Cut it, but leave it in your sock so it jabs you in the foot. Then put on boots.  Walk around like that all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw man. I don't experience this to the same degree, but fabrics really can be disruptive. I get it. I wonder if occupational therapy or CBT could help or if it's pretty hardwired. I've always been this way. My mother had a hell of a time keeping clothes on me as a toddler, when most kids don't have the coordination to remove their own outfits yet. I still remember being 4 and being on the verge of tears because my socks were soooo pretty, but I could NOT stop feeling their scratchy stitching. It was agonizing, I could never wear my pretty socks again. :'( I still hate socks in general 30 years later.  Ah, the perils of preschool when you're a little girl with a sensory processing disorder....</p>
<p>You can be glad you don't have to wear a bra? Those are a special kind of hell. Uggggh.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I wonder if it's something you can grow out of. I used to despise the line in the sock and had to pull the fabric up and over to block it from touching. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That <em>sounds</em> like sensory processing disorder, not that I'm in any way qualified to say that. I know there is stuff that 'can be done' for children but I don't know that a lot of it is appropriate for adults. There's a lot about weighted blankets and lying on top of them (for pressure) and such.<br />
Has there been any attempt at therapy for your issues? Anyway I'm sorry to hear you're suffering still from something that happened in your childhood.<br />
I believe I had SPD somewhat similar (but opposite) to you as a child. My parents split up when I was 4 (father was abusive towards mother), and when I was 5 we immigrated with my new (and really strict/mean) stepfather. I can remember having to have all my socks and shoes as tight as possible, I was always tucking my shirt in as hard as I could, adjusting my skirt to maximum tightness throughout the school day etc. Clothing not being tight enough would cause me to cry, or at the least be angry and anxious. I think I just naturally grew out of it for the most part though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why rhinoplasty that affects these structures can be so dangerous - if something is done to disrupt the ability of these structures to channel air properly, it can cause a “suffocating” feeling that can cause sufferers all sorts of discomfort, to the point of committing suicide just to obtain relief.</p>

<p>jesus christ</p>
<p>imagine being the first rhinoplasty recipient to discover that the rest of your life is now going to be spent feeling slightly waterboarded constantly.  what a nightmare.  the potential for horrors in this world far outweighs the joys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was diagnosed with sleep apnea I was told there was a surgery that reduces the size of your uvula, but sometimes patients were left with a feeling that they need to swallow because something is in the back of their throat and it never goes away.  I would rather snore than live that nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sleep on my side for sleep apnea as well. In my case, everything (tongue, uvula, etc.) slides toward the rear when I lie on my back. Even when I’m fully awake it can be a chore to continue breathing like normal without choking, not to mention doing things like eating or drinking on my back. And I’m not even overweight - this hit me in my late teens, when I was 188cm and barely 80kg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffer from mild sleep apnea. I was diagnosed about five years ago, but realized when I was looking into different treatment options that I've probably suffered from it my entire life - i got my uvula removed along with my tonsils and adenoids when I was five years old. </p>
<p>One of my favorite party tricks is telling people that I don't have a &quot;hangy-ball&quot; </p></div>		</li>
