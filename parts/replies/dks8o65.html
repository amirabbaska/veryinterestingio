			<div class="markdown"><p>True, the range is limited. However, if you have the money for a big house, you can likely shell out the money for a good second access point to double your signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A second access point can be beneficial for 2.4GHz as well, even if your existing router's signal is strong enough to cover the location. We're getting much better coverage with two access points with 2.4GHz at medium power then we did with one at full power. Phones and other small devices typically don't have the same transmit power as an access point, so even if you get solid bars from across the house your device may not be able to respond back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can the interference be damaging to Wifi transducers? I had a 2.4GHz Headset that got interference on the audio whenever walking next to a cooking microwave. (figured I would listen to music while cooking). Oddly enough the headphones started breaking down and I had to get them replaced with warranty after a few weeks. Now with my new headphones I am always careful to avoid going near the microware with them.</p></div>		</li>
