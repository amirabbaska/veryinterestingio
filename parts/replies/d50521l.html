<p>Planet Vulcan was proposed to explain mercury's orbit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this, the actual explanation was found in general relativity, which offered exactly the corrections to Newtonian gravitation needed to explain Mercury's orbit.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-Vulcan-Discovered-Relativity-Deciphered/dp/0812998987/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1467739112&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=finding+vulcan" target="_blank">The Hunt for Vulcan: . . . And How Albert Einstein Destroyed a Planet, Discovered Relativity, and Deciphered the Universe</a></p>
<p>It's a fascinating read, or get the audiobook and enjoy on your commute/jog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Galileo didn't have a chance. Without satellites for direct observations, Newton's law of gravity (~1680) is the only way to approach this, and it was formulated after Galileo's death.</p>
<p>The easiest approach is probably to determine the orbits of Earth and Venus as precise as possible, to about 1 part in a million (with the precise number depending on what exactly you measure). In 1860 measurements were precise enough to measure the perihelion precession of Mercury with an uncertainty of just 10% of the effect of Earth, at that point a second Earth would have been clearly notable. While the perihelion shift didn't match predictions with or without a counter-earth (later resolved by General relativity) other calculations would have easily spotted it.</p>
<p>That leaves a 200 year time frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What aspects of planetary movement were measured, and how were they measured?</p>
<p>This is all so fascinating, that something so precise was managed in 1860, before electronics and digital measurement.</p></div>		</li>
