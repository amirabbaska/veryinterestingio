<p>It’s easy to see stars or the brighter planets at night. It’s much harder to see them during twilight. Partly this is an issue of contrast, but there can be plenty of contrast and the eye just doesn’t want to focus on infinity. Once you find Mars or Venus or Sirius and your eye is focused on them, they stand out fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just answered a magical phenomenon I had. I’d look at a star, and then look elsewhere and it would disappear. I always wondered the mechanism behind it. I believe this is it. My eyes aren’t focusing at that range anymore and blotting it out in my close peripheral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s another thing that can cause that: your retinal nerve causes a blind spot. The brain tries to fill in the missing detail and it works great when you’re looking at most things but small details on uniform background just blink out of existence.</p>
<p>There’s an opposite phenomenon where a faint star shows up in peripheral vision but disappears whenever you look directly at it. This happens because the central portion of the human retina contains many cone cells instead of rod cells, making it sensitive to colour and bright light but quite insensitive to dim light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good advice for driving too. Sure it’s a lot easier to focus on something outside the car at ground level but it’s easy to focus on something inside the car if you relax your eyes. </p></div>		</li>
