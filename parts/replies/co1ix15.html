			<p>It also depends on the humidity out doors as well.  I had friends in the Costa Rican rain forest that claimed that hanging clothes to dry outdoors simply didn't work.  The humidity caused them to stay damp.<br><br>As a person who lives in a dry, near desert climate, drying indoors is a win/win situation, as the clothes dry quite quickly and I don't have to run my humidifier as hard when I am drying clothes indoors.</p>		</li>

			<p>The type of fabric is a major factor too as I have easily dried my travel clothing in a rainforest after they were soaking wet.<br><br>Most people are using cotton which is lousy at drying compared to some of the modern tech fabrics.  I have a travel tech shirt I can wash in a sink, hang up indoors, in within a few hours it is dry.  Meanwhile a non tech shirt that is smaller but not cotton will take overnight in the same conditions.</p>		</li>

			<p>Perhaps true from an engineering perspective but not from a biological one. Consider how nature had exponentially more years of natural selection to find an optimal solution, and how much sophistication it manages to package into DNA.

			<p>That's not how biology works. Natural selection doesn't &quot;find an optimal solution.&quot; Natural selection has no knowledge of what is optimal, simplest or best, and it cannot design. Only the human brain can design, because only the human brain can plan for the future.   <br><br>Wool isn't &quot;the best solution&quot; for sheep's fur; it's the solution found by random mutation and sexual selection that is most likely to allow a sheep to survive long enough to reproduce the most.   <br><br>Natural selection is a <strong>natural</strong> process, and does not have the will to create adaptations that are &quot;better.&quot; Engineering is the process of actively using your will to create things that <strong>are</strong> better. Engineering is only limited by human understanding, while natural selection is basically a set of rules for biological evolution; it is nothing but limitations.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well there's always the idea that engineering and design draws from nature and improves upon it. Take humming birds and helicopters. Engineers were inspired by humming birds for a long time to create a hovering mode of transport and studied them relentlessly, until they could create a helicopter that could carry a number of people and cargo, a much greater weight than that of the little humming bird.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not semantics, dude. It's <strong>how natural selection works.</strong> There is a massive misunderstanding of natural selection. Most people do think it works the way you're talking about, that it causes &quot;good&quot; things to happen. It doesn't. Engineering <strong>does</strong> reliably turn out better than biology because the entire goal of engineering is to <strong>improve the chance that something will make humans comfortable and happy</strong>, which is what we define as &quot;good.&quot; The entire goal of natural selection is to <strong>improve the chances of the survival of genes</strong>. The interests of genes are not always the same as the interests of humans. I'll give you some examples of how:  <br><br><em> cancer<br></em> down syndrome<br><em> color blindness<br></em> cystic fibrosis<br>* hemophilia    <br><br>All of those are a result of natural selection. The things that fix them are all a result of engineering.</p>		</li>

			<p>This conveniently omits the problems engineering has caused with its unintended consequences which can be quite numerous.

			<p>It's not &quot;convenient,&quot; it's intentional. I'm not talking about the problems with engineering (of which there are myriad). I'm talking about the problems with evolution by natural selection, which does not seek to create things better suited to human comfort. <strong>The fact that wool was produced by natural selection over the last few epochs is not evidence of it being &quot;better&quot; than synthetic materials, and saying so is faulty thinking.</strong> Cancer and hemophilia and Down syndrome are not &quot;unintended consequences&quot; of evolution the way human error or poor foresight are for an engineering project. As far as nature is concerned, they are equal in every way to the evolution of the human eye or (of wool as sheep's fur) until the genes for them go extinct. Engineering has mistakes, while evolution is just the ONLY process there is for nature to create complexity. I think your whole confusion here boils down to the point below.     <br><br>&gt;It's also important to think of the multiple million or billion functions which work properly in multicellular organisms and self-regulate or self-correct properly the vast majority of the time with perhaps minor exceptions.    <br><br>You're conflating two things here: complexity and &quot;goodness.&quot; Yes, biology is more complex than engineering; complexity as a quality requires the passage of time. Biology has had roughly 13 trillion years, while engineering has had less than 100,000. Yes, natural selection creates biological components that &quot;work properly&quot; when their goal is to pass on their own form, but evolution isn't trying to make things &quot;good&quot; for us. If it were, we'd by immune to lava, could breathe underwater and be able to fly or live for decades longer than our flesh-and-bone organs. Guess what does allow us to do those things... engineering. There is no instance of evolution overcoming the problems of an engineered project, while engineered things are specifically designed to overcome the limitations of biology. This discussion itself is about making a <em>coat</em>, an engineered thing.     <br><br>Would you at least concede your original point that a wool garment should be &quot;better&quot; at keeping humans comfortable than a synthetic one <em>because</em> it was crafted by natural selection over a geologic time scale? That's all I'm really disagreeing with.</p>		</li>

			<p>How does merino function in a warm, humid environment, though?

			<p>Really well actually.  If you get thin merino shirts they do a great job of keeping you fairly cool and dry, even in the heat.  Obviously thicker wool doesn't work for this, but you can find some nice thin merino base layers that are great for warmer environments.</p>		</li>

			<p>Soak the clothes in cold water and white vinegar for 15 to 30 minutes, then wash as usual (err on the side of less soap, actually--and no fabric softener!!!) until the final rinse. Add a cup of vinegar to the final rinse and dry on low or hang dry. Drying on high heat helps lock those awful smells in, which is the opposite of the goal here.  </p>		</li>

			<p>It just creates a film between the clothes and detergent that keeps it from getting really clean!  That's part of the reason the vinegar soaking works.  And it's why you do it before and then after your detergent has been washed out--you don't want a barrier there.<br><br>I've heard if this happens to your towels and that sort of material that you can actually wash them without detergent on high heat a few times to strip them of this buildup, and then they'll be ready to go again!  <br><br>I haven't actually tried it yet and I don't think the method would be safe on regular clothes but the science is sound!</p>		</li>

			<p>If you like the extra softness of fabric softened clothes but hate the expense and resulting odor of in-wash fabric softener... try the dryer sheets kind. Works pretty damn well and is a good compromise. Just don't use it on your towels, they'll pick up water better off of your body if you do <em>not</em> use the sheets.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think this would work on most shirts, but didn't work on mine unfortunately :). I also tried the baking soda paste over the area twice but no luck. It was a Coca Cola brand shirt from a few years ago when they were trying to give off an &quot;eco-friendly&quot; vibe by recycling their plastics into clothing.

			<p>I have that problem with many of my shirts holding residual pit odor, and a few weeks ago (after nearly a decade of trying solutions) hit upon success with 2 parts hydrogen peroxide and 1 part blue Dawn dish detergent rubbed into the problem areas and then laundered. This is a color safe laundry stain treatment and it works well on many stains. Must be mixed fresh each time unless you have a lightproof bottle to prevent the hydrogen peroxide from breaking down.</p>		</li>

			<p>Anything but cotton, really. Polyester is the most common, but there are quite a few synthetic and semi-synthetic fibers to choose from, and a garment can be made from a blend of different fibers and the shape of the fibers can also be altered to change the feel and other bulk properties. Basically nothing used in clothing is as hard to get dry as cotton.</p>		</li>

			<p>And it's so great at regulating warmth for you. It's warm when you need it to be, but never too warm except on hot summer days. And if it gets wet, it stays warm and doesn't <em>feel</em> wet.
