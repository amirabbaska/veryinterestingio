			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on the humidity out doors as well.  I had friends in the Costa Rican rain forest that claimed that hanging clothes to dry outdoors simply didn't work.  The humidity caused them to stay damp.</p>
<p>As a person who lives in a dry, near desert climate, drying indoors is a win/win situation, as the clothes dry quite quickly and I don't have to run my humidifier as hard when I am drying clothes indoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The type of fabric is a major factor too as I have easily dried my travel clothing in a rainforest after they were soaking wet.</p>
<p>Most people are using cotton which is lousy at drying compared to some of the modern tech fabrics.  I have a travel tech shirt I can wash in a sink, hang up indoors, in within a few hours it is dry.  Meanwhile a non tech shirt that is smaller but not cotton will take overnight in the same conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I travel to Mexico or further south I just bring nylon based clothing.    You can wash them in the sink and dry them quickly.  Cotton never seems to dry.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget about the use of air movement for disrupting the boundary layer around the clothes.  This is imperative if you want quick drying.</p>
<p>OP: this same sort of idea is utilized in convection ovens as well.</p></div>		</li>
