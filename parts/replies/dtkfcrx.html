			<div class="markdown"><p>The article states that they tested with MCL and follicular lymphoma tumors.  I have CLL, presented as SLL in my lymph nodes.  The clinical trial calls for SLL as an inclusion in the trial.  Would this be an injection into a swollen lymph node?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know of any tumor types that this wouldn't work on?  My son has neurofibromatosis, and while he doesn't have any plexiform neurofibromas (yet), I'm wondering if they would be eligible for something like this, since they are technically not cancerous.</p>
<p>I did some digging and saw that plexiforms do have some t-lymphocytes in their makeup, but I'm just a layman, and have no idea if it's enough, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do not know very much about neurofibromas either. Given that the mutations that drive the disease are present in every cell (from my understanding), this therapy does not sound like a good fit as it would target all the cells.</p>
<p>I assume that gene therapy is a more likely candidate to cure this disease</p></div>		</li>
