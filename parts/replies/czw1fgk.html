<p>incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors</p>

<p>The article's description really brought it home for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the sensitivity achieved by Advanced LIGO, which can detect stretches and compressions of space-time that are as small as one part in 1022 — comparable to a hair’s-width change in the distance from the Sun to Alpha Centauri</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's amazing to me that humans can confidently detect such a small change from an event that happened 1.3 billion years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which article was that? 1 part in 1022 seems much, much bigger than a hair's-width change in the distance from the Sun to Alpha Centauri. Mistake in the copy-and-paste?</p>
<p>Edit: Ah, I watched the PhD Comic's video and it quoted 10^23. So just a mistake in the superscript.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so sure that it occurs 1.3 billion years ago. That would assume that the waves we are observing move similar to that of light. On top of that general relativity states that gravity does have an effect on the speed of light. (Which is why we are seeing the disturbances) so the speed of light nearer to the event is slowed. Granted probably not very significantly. But the change in gravity between us and the two black holes is massive. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not just similar, <em>exactly</em> the speed of light.</p>

<p>The problem here is you're confusing your &quot;observer&quot;. Yes, the wave itself &quot;experiences&quot; a massive change in gravitational force and so if it were able to perceive it, time would speed up or slow down accordingly.</p>
<p>We on earth, however, experience no such drastic change in gravitational forces. What's more, I'm fairly sure time dilation is more to do with velocity than gravitational forces in your inertial frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What really blew my mind was when on the press conference they told that the amount of energy released on these gravitational waves from the black holes mergin was equal to 50 times (if I remember correctly, could be wrong) the output of all the stars on ENTIRE universe. Only for 20ms though. And the energy was &quot;only&quot; equal to complete annihilation of 3 stars the size of the sun. </p>
<p>It happened 1.3 billion lightyears away, and yet we could still detect it here on earth. It'd be really interesting to know what kind of effects the gravitational waves would have on for example earth, if this would have happened 1 lightyear away and if we'd ignore all the other apocalyptic stuff propably occuring. Would it be bit like some kind of uniform earthquakelike occurence, or would we simply warp a bit without ever realizing that anything special happened?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The power output, not energy, was roughly 50 times that of all of the stars in the universe. This is because it happened over such a short timespan (order of milliseconds).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A reply above mentioned that the effect is basically being stretched, then squeezed, and the amount of stretching and squeezing is determined by the speed and acceleration of the black holes' orbit. So having that happen a lightyear away would (presumably) be <em>very</em> bad for poor little specks like ourselves, because we would be stretched and squeezed at light-speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Purely speculating here, but if it's a waveform then I'd assume you'd feel the fluctuations in gravity akin to the feeling being in a wave pool (minus the buoyancy).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I'm trying to understand this. Aren't gravitational waves predicted by basic gravitational theory? Gravitational force is dependent on distance. As distance increases/decreases (as you &quot;shake&quot; the matter), the gravitational force will decrease/increase with the same period. So you get a gravitational force &quot;wave&quot; emanating from the shaking object towards all other nearby objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newton's model of gravitation does not admit wave solutions, no.  This is because the speed of the force propagation is infinite/instantaneous in that model.  GR has gravitational waves because, among other reasons, its &quot;speed of gravity&quot; is finite, so you can have a traveling, persistent wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you solve Newton's model of gravity for an oscillating object you would have a wave solution (force varies with time in a cyclical nature with a time period equivalent to the time period of the oscillation).</p></div>		</li>
