			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this explanation the most. You can test it yourself simply by covering up parts of the image as I did <a href="https://imgur.com/HOp3Ej3" target="_blank">here</a>. This sliver should appear blue to everyone.</p>
<p>This is an example of color contrast effects that we're pretty familiar with. For example, <a href="http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/IMG/purves01.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> the two brown patches appear to have very different hues, but actually they are identical (as can be seen in the image below). <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcb1uJPcwao/TMThMklvtHI/AAAAAAAAABc/V4sJv-7qvKw/s1600/Untitled-2.png" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/Tcontrastc.gif" target="_blank">here</a> are two other examples.</p>
<p>Edit: someone suggested showing a strip of the dress that included a portion of the other black dress that's in the background. <a href="https://imgur.com/b0gZJee" target="_blank">Here</a> is that image. The &quot;gold&quot; portions of the dress now should clearly appear black to everyone (matching the adjacent dress). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I don't understand.  I zoomed in as far as I could on both, and while the 'white' part of the dress is a light blue, the 'gold' part is . . . still extremely golden.</p>

<p>If the effect is just because of how my brain is interpreting the scene as a whole, shouldn't zooming all the way in negate that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's certainly possible that the true hue of that part of the image is brownish. One interpretation of the lighting makes the brown area appear gold; the other makes it appear black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also apparent when putting the dress in context with another &quot;white&quot; in the photo -- the black and white dress in the lower left corner. By cropping the photo on that region, it's apparent that the &quot;white/gold&quot; is actually &quot;blue/black.&quot; The blacks from both dresses match. And you can see how the black starts to appear gold on the right due to the perceived  illuminant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the reason not everyone sees the same illusion for the dress is most likely due to the ambiguity of the lighting. The photo is back-lit, but you're also getting shadows falling across the front, so it's not clear to the visual system what the context is for the color.</p>
<p>If you compare it to something like this, which is the same illusion <a href="https://phenomenalqualities.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/rubiks-cube-2.jpg" target="_blank">https://phenomenalqualities.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/rubiks-cube-2.jpg</a> there is no ambiguity here with regard to the lighting. The square that looks orange looks orange to everyone because we are all seeing it in shadow.</p>
<p>With the dress, some people are getting the illusion and others are not because of the interpretation of the lighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of expertise I was a television news photographer for a number of years. </p>
<p>Your explanation is more or less exactly my thoughts on first seeing the dress although I looked at it from a more practical application. The way the photograph portrays the scene the backlighting seems to be coming from a window or another natural light so around 5600K. The light bouncing off the front of the dress is substantially higher and therefore giving it a blue tint. Therefore your optical illusion is created. </p>
<p>Personally, I don't so much see a white and gold dress as I see a white and gold dress in a badly white balanced photograph. </p>
<p>However, this still doesn't account for the fact that black does not blow out to gold and that there is simply too much detail in the white/blue part to match with the supposed black and dark blue dress from other photographs. It leads me to believe that the camera that took the photo was more or less dropped on its head as a baby. It could be a misbehaving camera producing an image that was then processed with some sort of Instagram tonal shift. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally think the bad camera quality is responsible for the black looking brown, which helps it look gold if you interpret a shadow falling across the dress. I suspect that adds to the image not looking white balanced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has long-standing familiarity with trying to figure out accurate colours from Second World War naval photos, I might also suggest that part of the difference may be due to people's different monitors. Some screens have much higher contrast than others, as well as different colour tint biases - my laptop, for instance, produces a much whiter/bluer light than my old LCD monitor, which has a yellowish glow. This is one of many factors that make it difficult to determine the &quot;true&quot; colour of a digital image - without people all calibrating their screens the same way, it's hard to tell that we're all even looking at the same image in terms of colour!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may have some effect on the perceived color, but multiple people looking at the same monitor are reporting different percepts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a point, I think that can have an impact on the strength of the illusion, but probably wouldn't be able to explain it entirely. There are significant issues with trying to get true colors from LCD monitors, and not only do you have people looking at difference screens, but your viewing angle is going to impact color perception as well.</p>
<p>One way to show that it isn't just the monitor would be to find someone who sees it as gold and white and just cover up the entire image except for a small strip of the fabric in the middle. It should become blue and black to them, even though it's displayed on the same monitor.</p></div>		</li>
