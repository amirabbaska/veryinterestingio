			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be because band camp is rarely a physical camp. It is normally music and marching rehearsals held every day for a week or two before the fall semester at the school band hall and marching field. If it were a dedicated or rented camp facility you would use &quot;the band camp&quot;. But since it is the term for the extra practicing period before school starts it is more abstract than physical so you do not use the article &quot;the&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
