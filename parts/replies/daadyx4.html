<p>Single-action weapons, like the revolvers of the old west, require you to cock the hammer each time you want to fire, before you pull the trigger.</p>

<p>For the curious, this is why you may see cowboys in old Western films &quot;fan the hammer&quot; - where they hold the gun in their dominant hand while repeatedly striking the hammer back with the other. They're pulling the trigger between shots to rotate the cylinder (brings up another round) and to keep the catch for the hammer down, so the gun fires every time they slap that hammer. This lets them speed through all six shots in the cylinder of their revolver. </p>
<p>Quite fast. Not particularly accurate. </p></div>		</li>
