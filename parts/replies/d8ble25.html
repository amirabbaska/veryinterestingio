			<div class="markdown"><p>This exact behavior is what makes me nervous about colonizing Mars. We know it has water, in the form of ice, under ground. Plus, there is strong evidence that life used to exist on Mars before it drifted too far from the sun. </p>
<p>What happens when we, human colonists, melt said ice and all those hibernating organisms/animals starts to spring to life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then the life gets to survive and we can cultivate it. If it they exist it's actually the best thing that could happen for them, because without intervention Mars isn't warning up again anytime soon, which means they're dead for good. They'd also probably be useful to us in greening the planet since they're adapted to the local chemistry.</p>
<p>It's not likely there are going to be tiger-tier monsters in extended hibernation, the things that do this on earth are usually relatively primitive mouse-sized creatures, almost all aquatic. The reasons for this limitation are physics and chemistry based, so unlikely to change as long as Martian life were carbon-based.</p>
<p>There's also very little risk of disease, since we're so so distant from whatever lives there that their vectors of attack probably won't even exist in humans. Look at the difficulty bird and pig diseases have in spreading to humans, and then consider whether you've ever worried about catching lobster pox, or a spider's cold, or dutch elm disease. Of course not, it seems silly. And that's the kind of evolutionary distance we're probably talking about with whatever life exists on Mars (if there is any at all, which is unlikely).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some animals, like certain species of fish and amphibians go into a hibernation or suspended animation state in a little &quot;cocoon&quot; they make out of mucus and mud and bury themselves in the mud. When the pond gets filled again, the cocoon dissolves and they emerge again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was always taught it was for this reason and was shocked other people hadn't mentioned it. Growing up, I used to live a couple of hours away from <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Lencois_Maranhenses_8.jpg" target="_blank">Lençóis Maranhenses</a>, a crazy ecosystem filled with ponds among desert scenery with small fish all over where rivers are mostly too far from the dunes to have any impact.</p></div>		</li>
