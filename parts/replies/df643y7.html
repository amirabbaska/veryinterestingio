<p>The oldest continental crust we've found so far is 3.8 Ga old, in the eastern part of the Canadian Shield - that's ... pretty old. But the age of that oldest rock is complex and layered. The 3.8 Ga age is an U-Pb age of crystallisation, the age at which the magma solidified into a rock (it was a volcanic rock). But the very same sample was dated using another method (Nd/Sm geochronology). This yielded an age of 4.38 Ga - the meaning of this second age is different from, and complementary to, the first one. What this Sm/Nd age indicates is the time at which the volume of magma which ended up in that rock was extracted from the Earths mantle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case anyone is wondering, these age dating techniques rely on radioactivity and the trapping effect of crystallization. </p>
<p>All isotopes of uranium are radioactive and, in the case of U/Pb dating, we care principally about 238. U238 will radioactively change into lead through a decay chain which has a half life of roughly 4 billion years. A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a starting material to change into another. That is, if you had a <del>Kg</del> mole of U238 and waited 4 billion years, you'd have roughly half a <del>Kg</del> mole of U and half a <del>Kg</del> mole of Pb.</p>
<p>Scientists will take a rock with crystals in it that they know contain appreciable amounts of uranium and analyse the uranium to lead ratio. The crystals they select are also known for including uranium in their structure and excluding lead. That way, they can assume the crystal had no lead in it when it solidified and all the lead they found is from radioactive decay. With that assumption and the U/Pb ratio, you can then calculate the age of crystallization for that mineral!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Half a Kg of Pb? Sure? How many moles of Pb will form at the end of the chain from one mole of U238?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hahahahah keyword ROUGHLY! I'll just edit it to moles for accuracy's sake. And of course, there will be a measurable amount of decay-chain isotopes in there too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I never understood radio carbon dating until this description. It seems rather simple now!</p>
<p>But I am curious: If you are an archaeologist and you want to date material that does not have PB/U or another date-able element, you simple select some material in the same layer and cross date right? Is it that easy to find a dateable material or is there a ton of stuff that cannot be reliably dated because no carbon dateable material is nearby? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the date range, and the preservation of the site it can be very difficult to find dateable material.</p>
<p>With radiocarbon (or C14) dating, you need to have an object containing organic material.  Regardless of what many science-fiction movies and TV shows seem to think, you cannot carbon date an igneous or sedimentary rock.</p>
<p>In addition, the half life of carbon 14 is 5,730 years.  Anything beyond about ten times that amount results in so little of the radioactive isotope left that any dates over 50,000 years old are incredibly unreliable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the next most usable technique, potassium-argon (or K-Ar) dating can only be used on materials that include substantial quantities of potassium.  This can include clay minerals, but the ideal substance is quickly cooled lava.  </p>
<p>The half-life of potassium 40 is about 1.25 billion years, which should mean it is ideal for dating objects almost as old as the Big Bang, and almost certainly as old as the solar system.  However, such a long half-life makes detecting small amounts of decay in time frames like just a few hundred thousand years very hard to detect.  So K-Ar is only reliable on material that is older than at least 100,000 years old.</p>
<p>As you can see, that leaves a big gap between 50 kya and 100 kya that doesn't lend itself to either of the major, most reliable radiometric dating techniques.  </p>
<p>Of course, that happens to be the approximate time frame that anatomically modern humans (<em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>) likely developed - so, you know, kinda important archaeologically.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can get at least an approximate date either through other, slightly more esoteric dating techniques (like thermoluminescence) or relative dating techniques like biostratigraphy or stratigraphic corellation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that it's Radiometric Dating in the case of inorganic/noncarbon material. All Radio-Carbon Dating is a form of Radiometric Dating, but not all Radiometric Dating is Radio-Carbon Dating. U/Pb is Uranium/Lead, no carbon in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Just find another piece of dateable material. It's not that it's super abundant, but the layer you're looking at should be big enough to find at least something. And yes, we are careful so that we don't get any cross contamination. That's why digs you see pictures of have string grids laid out on them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the case of rocks of the age being spoken about, the key tool is actually <em>isotopic neodymium</em>, specifically Nd-142, which was only formed during the first 500 Ma of the planet's formation. Same principle of estimating age through elemental and/or isotopic transformation, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, right. I've given the U/Pb example because it's a bit more common, mentioned here, and everyone has heard of those two elements! But you're right, the same principle applies. Plus, as OP pointed out, the dating methods represent two different phenomenon happening to the rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Sm-Nd age obtained on the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt (O'Neil et al Science 2008) has been shown to be wrong. The two different decay systems of Sm-Nd (147Sm-143Nd and 146Sm-142Nd) did not match, and this didn't make sense. So these samples have been reanalysed by the same and different workers. The 4.35Ga age obtained has been shown to be an inherited signature and not the age of the rocks or even of the generation of that melt event. But rather the inheritance of an earlier (and lost) melting event (Roth et al Earth and Planetary Science Letters) 2013.
However, we do have zircon minerals from the Jack Hills in Australia that date to 4.4Ga. There is ongoing debate as to how these formed, but their age is set in stone.
Nevertheless, none of this matters. As the age of the Earth is obtained on the age of meteorites - specifically carbonaceous meteorites. Their composition closely matches that of Earth, and it is therefore assumed that they are the building blocks of Earth. Their age of 4.57Ga is the age we use when discussing the age of the Earth.
EDIT: To further answer the question. We are constantly looking for new old rocks. And the only potentially good thing about climate change is we'll finally get to look at Antarctica's very interesting geology! ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell us a bit about what makes it so interesting? I think the relatively unknown geology of an isolated, frozen continent is pretty intriguing myself, if only because of the mystery of it. Who knows what sort of fossil story might be told by those rocks! What do we know and suspect about Antarctic geology? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well a lot of it was a part of Gondwanaland, so will be able to tell us a lot about the break-up of Gondwanaland and perhaps have different or similar fossils to other parts of the world (not really my topic so not sure to be honest). There's also the Transantarctic Mountains that would be interesting to structural geologists in comparing to other mountain belts, as well as assessing the volcanic record to see if there are any unique geochemical signatures that can help us understand the formation and differentiation of magmas. In Eastern Antarctica there is definitely some Archean (&gt;2.5Ga) rocks, that would be great to get our hands on. We're always comparing Archean areas in the hopes of gaining some insight into the formation of Earth and how the planet has changed through time, so having access to another location would be extremely useful. There's also probably a lot of mineral resources hiding down there, there's definitely some coal, perhaps diamonds and who knows what else! </p></div>		</li>
