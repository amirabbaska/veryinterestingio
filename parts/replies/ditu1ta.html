			<div class="markdown"><p>As a footnote ears don't have to be symmetrical.  Some nocturnal owls have asymmetric ears to increase their ability to pinpoint prey.  <a href="http://www.owlpages.com/owls/articles.php?a=6" target="_blank">http://www.owlpages.com/owls/articles.php?a=6</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess that if you need multiple of something, symmetry is easier to generate than good/benefitial asymmetry.  For us ground dwellers, detecting along the &quot;flat&quot; plane of the ground is probably &quot;good enough&quot; and thus can be done well with symmetry with ears on each side of our head parallel to that plane.  (This allows us to tell if it came from the left or right, and since our ears aren't symmetrical in the other direction, front and back as well.</p>
<p>The owls on the other hand aren't tied to a flat-plane, so they've developed the more advanced asymmetry to also detect &quot;height&quot; from the plane.  When combined with the directional &quot;radar dish&quot; of feathers and a neck that can turn much more, they can better pick out a precise direction (and with motion, distance) of the origin of the sound.</p>
<p>But that's just me making a hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another thing is that any organ pair (lungs, kidney, etc) is symmetrical because there's two of them. The heart isn't symmetrical because there's only one heart. If you look at a single hand then it's not symmetrical by itself, hands are only symmetrical because there are two of them. so another way of asking the question is why do you we have two lungs and kidneys but only a single liver and heart etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also symmetry tends to be one of the things humans find attractive.  Thus, over time, it is theorized that people with less symmetrical features would reproduce less, thus there are less people with those features.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that somewhat begging the question?
Do we find symmetry attractive because it leads to improved sensors that make us more fit for our environment, or were the individuals wth more symmetrical features more fit for their environment and thus attractiveness for them emerged? Or perhaps a mix of both?
Maybe an anthropologist would know more, I didn't do too well in that class. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be both. Those with the trait are more successful, so those that select the trait are more successful by extension. It's the trait that dictates the success, but early adoption of attraction would accelerate selection in the species.</p></div>		</li>
