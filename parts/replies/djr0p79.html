			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - I came out with my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck and a mouth FULL of Meconium. Scored the lowest possible Apgar. Yay me!
<em>Edit</em> adding couple details - I was actually doing pretty damn well after a couple hours. My mom however was was hemorrhaging like a balloon with a hole in it. She swears that I didn't want to come out (I think my depression had already kicked in and there were just too many people in that room for me to feel comfortable so much so I attempted prenatal suicide) because the doctor (according to her) was jumping on her stomach trying to force me out. I don't respond well to pushy-ness; never had, never will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yikes guys.  glad you made it...so speaking of meconium, I, like Maxwell, ate my shit.  Unfortunately for me it made my lung collapse.  I was immediately tossed in a helicopter with strangers in what must have been a chaotic event, and whisked away from the hot water and towel mountain hospital, and into the city with incubators and stethoscopes.  Seriously though, I wonder how that shaped me, and it was tremendous to see my daughter instantly  feel safe with mom and get to drink milk until she passed out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, maybe that says something about my cooking, especially as apparently twigs and leaves picked up off the ground in the park are also delicious snacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is there a particular reason our bowel movements shift from this fairly odorless mess to what we regularly shit out as we get older? </p>
<p>I'm guessing it has to do with the bacteria that start to take root in our digestive track, the increased production of a variety of bodily substances (bile, etc.), and the fact that we're no longer 'eating' relatively inoffensive material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You answered your own question - the smell is the result of the breakdown of the food we eat and the byproducts of the bacteria in our gut.  Breastfed baby poop is fairy odourless because it is very efficiently broken down.  It is not unusual for breastfed babies to poop only once a week because there is very little byproduct when digesting breastmilk. Once you start feeding them solid foods (and especially dairy and meat) that's when the poop starts to take on that classic shit smell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies in the womb aren't exactly &quot;eating&quot; at all. They access already-digested nutrients from the mother's bloodstream, not food straight through the mother's digestive system, and nothing goes through the baby's own digestive system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the many baby books we had said breastfed baby poops are odorless to help keep them scent free as an old way of natural protection when we lived in caves. </p>
<p>I don't know how true that is, but I know some animals like deer keep their babies as odor free as possible and I've heard of other animals that'll eat their babies bodily functions to keep them hidden so I guess the breastfed thing kinda makes sense that way. </p></div>		</li>
