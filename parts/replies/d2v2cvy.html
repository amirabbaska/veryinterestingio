			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummmm…..kind of? It’s not Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park all the time if that’s what you mean. But I do consider myself lucky to be able to do something I love as my profession.The non-glamorous parts mainly consist of all the work it takes to actually do a dig: finding funding (usually through grants, which is really hard!), organizing the trip, getting there and back safely. Then there is all the many hours of cleaning, cataloging, and studying all the fossils you do bring back, which can take years (or decades even) for material you found. This requires long hours, patience, and dedication. But there is no better feeling than finding something  and realizing that it has not seen the light of day for milions of years. ON top of that, if you realize that it is potentially something new and significant. Can’t beat that thrill of discovery. Plus working in remote locations can be breathtaking. I miss being able to see the Milky Way the way I can out west, or the intense blue and all encompassing fullness of the daytime sky in these remote areas.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'd have the patience you mention, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure I would call the research glamorous, but it can be a whole lot of fun. Finding something new, whether it’s a previously undiscovered fossil in the field or an unnoticed specimen in museum storage, is really exciting. Presenting those cool, new things to our colleagues or the public is also really fun (and maybe a bit more glamorous at times). In between that though, there’s a lot of writing, and reading, and sometimes having unpleasant allergic reactions to being half eaten by biting gnats. I wouldn’t trade it for any other job though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister in law is an archaeologist. </p>
<p>She spends most of her time in Honduras digging through the jungles -- Once she got so sick they had to airlift her to the city to go to the hospital. And another time she brought some sort of plague back during Christmas that got everybody in the house deathly ill and turned our snot black. </p>
<p>But she sends us emails every now and then along the lines of &quot;Hey, I opened up a tomb today and found a human skull with a jade figurine.&quot; </p>
<p>So.. Pluses and minuses I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, has she, or has she not, confirmed the historical or present existence of aliens?</p>
<p>I can only assume the answer is yes because of the jade skull and the X-Files style black snot sickness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not saying that correlation is causation, but I've watched enough TV to know how this ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha</p>
<p>The tomb incident was a year or two before she came to visit for Christmas and brought the jungle plague. But if I remember correctly, it was somewhat close to when she ended up in the hospital from something else. </p>
<p>We determined that what she brought to the states for Christmas was some form of fungal lung infection and it pretty much laid the whole house out for a good week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We get the opposite sometimes. Lots of ID requests get forwarded back and forth between geology and anthropology departments. The best I can do when identifying a projectile point is something like &quot;worked flint.&quot;</p>
