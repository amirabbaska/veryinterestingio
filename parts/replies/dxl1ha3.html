			<div class="markdown"><p>What you've said is mostly close enough that the difference doesn't matter much to a layperson. However this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Light does not pass through time (which doesn't make sense to me, but I read that somewhere) which is why it is always moving through space at the speed of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is a bit off while also being a very interesting topic. I imagine the source of this statement is related to the fact that photons will always travel at the speed of light, relative to <em>all</em> observers. In other words, if I were to travel towards you at 0.5c, then shine a light towards you, the light would travel away from me at c while simultaneously (from your point of view) approach you at c, not 1.5c.</p>
<p>In essence, if you assume it to be true that the light moves away from me at c, and towards you at c, the only way to reconcile the two statements is that we experience time differently.</p>
<p>This incidentally is a really good starting point for learning about General Relativity (I heartily recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-mc2-Should-Care/dp/0306818760/" target="_blank">Why Does E = mc² (and Why Should We Care?)</a> if you find this interesting as it does a way better job of explaining it than I could).</p>
<p>One good example from that book is a thought experiment where you have two observers. One observer is on a train. He has with him an extremely precise clock that simply bounces photons from one plate (bottom) to another (top). For this observer, the photons are going completely vertically as long as the train is NOT accelerating. It critically <em>does not</em> matter whether the train is moving relative to the ground or not, only whether it's accelerating or not. However, to the observer on a platform as the train goes by, the position of the photon as it bounces off the bottom plate, is not directly below the point at which it hits the top plate. It's very close, as the train is not traveling at relativistic speeds, but it's definitely not directly above (picture it as a right angled triangle where the light just traveled the hypotenuse).</p>
<p>This means that even in something traveling relatively slowly, the light has traveled <em>further</em> for the observer on the platform, than for the observer on the train, despite being exactly the same photon traveling at exactly the same speed (c). How much further the light traveled depends on the relative speed. One of the interesting things about this though is that the time dilation effect is actually real and measurable even at relatively slow—certainly achievable—speeds. In fact, it actually effects things we use every day. Flights for example are fast enough that it's measurable, but more interestingly, GPS would not work for more than a few days at a time if the satellites we put in orbit for it to function did not take this effect in to consideration!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the evidence for the speed of light actually being a constant though? The things that you've described could also be explained with time being constant and c being the variable, which seems more intuitive...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's quite a lot to get in to there, but that's not really how these things work. When Einstein proposed this with his paper on special relativity he used the assumption of variable time rather than variable speed of light as the foundation to make predictions (with no real supporting evidence, just merely no known contradicting evidence).</p>
<p>The predictions could then be tested by experimentation (as in the standard scientific method) and if he was wrong one of those future experiments would sooner or later not match the predictions that come from special relativity. There could be some experiment that shows in a intuitive way that the speed is constant, but the important thing is that no experiment since special relativity has ever managed to disprove the assertion that time is variable while the speed of light is not (though I believe there have been experiments that disprove the reverse, but I could certainly be wrong). We have pretty conclusive evidence that it's a better model for what really happens in the real world than any previous model, but that's about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very.  The understanding is obviously not quite there, but most of those sentences are at least mostly-right.</p>
<p>Note that due to (special) relativity, it's not about moving quickly, but quickly relative to something else: in my reference frame's understanding of what's going on there's time dilation on you, but the converse is also true.   Only the speed of light is constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A mass that is not experiencing any force is at rest in it's reference frame. It has no kinetic energy. If a force is applied to it it accelerates and once the force is removed it immediately comes to rest in it's new reference frame.<br />
This suggests to me that all energy is (that which causes forces) is the thing which moves a mass from one reference frame to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accelerating frames are also reference frames, btw.  </p>
<p>That's unfortunately not all energy is: the mass-energy of a particle, for instance is a real think. Even thinking about forces gets a bit wonky in both GR and QM, so despite the fame of newton's laws we don't actually talk about force that much in physics these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up some videos on general and special relativity on YouTube, there are some very nifty graphical guides that help reach an understanding. </p>
<p>That said, that paragraph where something is perpendicular to time is the wonky one. For a photon, time does not pass, it would be at its origination and termination point &quot;simultaneously&quot; if the term was even defined for it. </p></div>		</li>
