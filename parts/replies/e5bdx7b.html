			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes plenty of species eat only dead or decaying tissue and leave the healthy behind. </p>
<p>They have a nifty enzyme that can break down and dissolve &quot;shells&quot; on super germs and bugs. So if a infection doesn't respond well to antibiotics maggot therapy may help more. </p>
<p>There are a few species that also eat healthy tissue. Those are not obviously used for this therapy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes maggots are used to clean dead flesh from large wounds. I’ve read that they’re actually pretty clean and can help in the healing process. I don’t know that it’s totally accurate but I asked a doctor and he said it’s not as uncommon as you might think. </p></div>		</li>
