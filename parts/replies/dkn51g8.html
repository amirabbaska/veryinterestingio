			<div class="markdown"><p>As a CPA and an auditor, this sounds like 80% of my job...checking that these controls are actually in place and working as they're supposed to. They definitely include a huge automated component. The individual reviewing this is likely reviewing a report that includes certain suspicious transactions already flagged by the computer, and then the human signs off as having reviewed this report and then they save this as evidence for the auditors later. then the auditors come in and check that the individual reviewed the report and also that the report within the computer system was pulled correctly and didn't exclude any transactions. This is called &quot;404 work&quot; for us and is related to the passing of Sarbanes Oxley.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an added note, and not applicable for all institutions, but there is a nightly processing that occurs during the weekdays to &quot;advance&quot; the date. When this occurs a lot of back end processing happens that will only run though one time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just created a list of rules that could easily be automated and would in fact be better off fully automated.</p>
<p>As for fraud, banks already have credit card fraud departments operating 24x7x365 using machine learning to flag fraud.  Automating bank fraud - at least the flagging - using AI would be more accurate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely do foil your average Eastern European and Russian identity theft kiddo using a stolen card which is the vast majority of why we use automated controls. No one expects the Russian government to use their debit card but they do expect some shitty Russian hacker to get a hold of some identity theft list of credit card numbers and fuck their life up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is part of my job at the moment. I'm helping the bank deploy proper AI and other automation solutions to reduce this turnaround time to seconds down from days. </p>
<p>Basically working myself out of a job ;) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you've missed a point of my post: even once the AI gets deployed -- which in many large institutions is already there for fraud detection -- many transactions will not be processed on the weekends.</p>
<p>This indicates that the reason is not a technical or a procedural one; it is more or less grounded in tradition for the same reason we have the term &quot;banker's hours&quot;.  Luckily, the latter has had to adapt to consumer demand over the years.</p></div>		</li>
