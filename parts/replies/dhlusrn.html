			<div class="markdown"><p>James Cook University in Queensland does a lot of marine science research on the reef. If you wanted to look into research on the GBR I'd look for media releases and videos on what they're doing. I know there's a video somewhere of their experiments on the effects of ocean water temperature on coral reefs in which they mention selective breeding of temperature resistant coral.</p></div>		</li>
