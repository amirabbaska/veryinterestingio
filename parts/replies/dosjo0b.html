			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I learned too. It's all about those cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds. The more cysteine in your amino acids  that make up the protein in your hair, the curlier it is. That's what I was taught at Michigan and at the protein folding lab I worked at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. Possible higher/lower Cys residue ratio in keratin in different people leads to curlier/less curly hair. </p>
<p>Kudos, I wish this point were higher</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be higher, since it's the actual answer. The hair follicle shape has little (nothing?) to do with the texture of the hair. </p>
<p>The sulfur in cystine is responsible for -S-S- bonds and all chemical/heat treating does to hair is break the bond to let hydrogen get in there and prevent the sulfur from reforming the disulfide bonds.</p></div>		</li>
