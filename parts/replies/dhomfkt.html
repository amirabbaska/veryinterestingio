<p>you are free to remarry if your spouse dies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>^^this. That's what I did. My spouse died at age 24. I married again at 27.</p>
<p>See also Romans 7:2-3
2 A married woman is united with her husband under the Law while he is alive. But if her husband dies, she is released from the Law concerning her husband. 3 So then, if she lives with another man while her husband is alive, she’s committing adultery. But if her husband dies, she’s free from the Law, so she won’t be committing adultery if she marries someone else.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Deuteronomy 25:5
If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a thing because of inheritance and not letting a name die out, also so the widow was cared for. When the widow married the brother (or next closest male relative), the first (male) child was considered as the dead guy's and was given his inheritance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a Christian perspective, I also think it's relevant to consider Joseph was descended from Ruth and Boaz, who was Ruth's second husband after she was widowed. Remarriage is built into the lineage of the Holy family. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the same idea applies in death. Louis ck made a joke about a couple who has been together for 60 years. One day richard dies leaving rose to be alone for another 10 years before she dies. Her final words are &quot;at least now I can be with my richard forver.&quot; Louis questions where she got this idea cause no religious texts he found state you wait for the living spouse in death. Cause richard has been dead for 10 years, in heaven, having the time of his life until an angel comes up and tells him his wife is coming. He comments that he has a girlfriend here and doesnt want to see his wife. &quot;But she is the love of your life.&quot; &quot;Yea but not the love of my death.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
