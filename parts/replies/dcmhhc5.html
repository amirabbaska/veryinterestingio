			<div class="markdown"><p>Emergency Dept. nurse, here.  You may want to speak with your Primary Care Provider or surgeon about Dumping Syndrome, which can occur after gallbladder surgery.  This can be dangerous because your body doesn't fully absorb all nutrients during digestion and can be quite unpleasant, as you may well know :)  Feel well!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok so nurses are awesome and you're awesome and you know ten times more then I do..</p>
<p>Dumping Syndrome is different then what <del>u/generalslee</del> u/macmelody is describing. Dumping Syndrome is typically associated with weight loss surgery where undigested sugars and carbs &quot;dump&quot; into the intestines and cause a person to feel like shit in literal and figurative ways.</p>
<p>Bile Acid Diarrhea is probably what <del>u/generalslee</del> u/macmelody suffers from. In this case it's not sugar and carbs that cause the BATHROOM NOW need, but bile acid from the liver entering the intestines because they no longer have a gallbladder to store it.</p>
<p>^I ^had ^my ^gallbladder ^removed ^15 ^years ^ago ^and ^still ^suffer ^from ^the ^latter. ^(I am also a (much more recent)^) ^weight ^loss ^surgery ^patient</p>
<p>Edit: Fixing grammatical errors and because I can't reddit very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole thread has been so helpful to me.  I now know that I have Bile Acid Diarrhea.  I can't anything that has been cooked in oil or have a lot of fat in it.  Too much fat and oil (which I know are not good for me anyway) causes extreme time in the bathroom.  Thanks for the info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad to see I'm not the only one. I have had my gall bladder out for 10 years and 12 days and I still suffer from Bile Acid Diarrhea as well. It was really really bad when I first had my gallbladder taken out and I had to take some sort of medicine to control it but I didn't take it very long because it was expensive as hell. My wife doesn't understand why I have to use the bathroom as soon as I eat or sometimes during a meal, but when it hits it hits hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FINALLY I KNOW! I had my gallbladder out almost ten years ago and I swear that within the same day out will be coming what I put in that morning or something. Also very pleased to now have a name for what I've been experiencing for a large chunk of my life now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely unpleasant, but by recent I more precisely mean a year, two months, and nine days as of today.  I'm military so they're pretty good about being more worried about out health than we are and I've brought it to the attention of my PCM a few times.  They seem to be pretty underwhelmed about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>at least the military caught yours,  i started having gallbladder attacks a year before i got out, usually once every few months. i went to medical several times and they even ultra sounded me and said they found nothing. one month after im out a gallbladder attack puts me in the hospital and they say it has to get taken out, luckily i had insurance through my employer, but it was still alot out of my pocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they are more concerned with treating the syndrome, not finding cooler names for them. It was probably how it was more often described than not when it was first discovered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here.  I have a recently diagnosed rare gi disease, and have done some full studies with barium, etc.  My mouth to Anus time can be as little as 3 hours, of course that's why I've lost 39 pounds since August, as the food isn't staying in me long enough for all the key nutrients to be absorbed, so I'm living on liquid supplements,  ensure, and baby food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buddy, I say this from the heart.</p>
<p>Go. To. The. Fucking. Doctor. If. You. Have. Issues. Medical. In. Nature. You. Complete. Twat. </p>
<p>But seriously, yea it sucks to go to the doctors sometimes, and I HATE hospitals due to the smells and the feelings of... I don't know, sadness? hanging in the air, but I recognize that doctors are needed to help you sometimes. It isn't something you can just turn off or &quot;deal with&quot;, it takes time and effort each time you go to eventually become more comfortable. </p>
<p>I grew up hating dentists, I cannot stand teeth cleaning, but I go twice a year and grin and bear it anyhow because I know they are one of my best defenses against cavities and serious problems. </p></div>		</li>
