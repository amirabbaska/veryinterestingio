<p>State of the art text-to-speech (or speech synthesis) is getting pretty good these days but this example is a long way below top grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds exactly like a certain British generated voice I've used before. Even without that context I'm certain it must be some sort of text to speech. Forgot the exact website but it's one of the more popular british text to speech voices.</p></div>		</li>
