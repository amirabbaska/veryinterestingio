			<div class="markdown"><p>.com is the commercial domain for the US. .co.uk is the commercial domain for the UK. Likewise there's .gov.uk and .org.uk. Just having .uk wouldn't tell you much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because that's how the UK people decided to do things.</p>
<p>Until recently you couldn't get .uk domain names, only .[something].uk were allowed, with the [something]s restricted to certain categories.</p>
<p>Fun fact; The UK's ISO 3166-1 code (used for all other ccTLDs) <em>isn't</em> UK, but GB. So UK domain names should end .gb (because who cares about Northern Ireland?). However JANET had already started using .uk before the ccTLD system was established properly, and while there was an attempt to get the UK to switch over to .gb it never succeeded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really an important factor in their decision to setup a store on the domain. They could purchase all the Amazon.whatever domains and just squat on them, if they were concerned. They could also sue anyone who tried to purchase an Amazon.whatevrr domain and tried to setup a store. </p>
<p>Having a store on a domain name as a way of blocking others is likely not even a concern to them. It costs so much to setup a store, all other ways of defending their trademark are far cheaper. </p>
<p>Edit: typos and clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have legitimate right to register a domain, for example &quot;amazon.whatever&quot; in the specific country under some rules. A bad example would be that you run a non-profit &quot;Save the amazon forest&quot; operating under &quot;amazon&quot; and register the &quot;amazon.li&quot; and still be able to keep it and the 'true' amazon can't say anything because that country may allow it.</p>
<p>By registering all of the possible domains they ensure a future expantion in that country too, and avoid their domain name form being 'stolen'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might not be a factor commerce wise but it is a factor in security and reducing fake URLs that are used for phishing. A lot of malicious domains for those major sites are 1 or 2 characters off or use a different Unicode that looks like an 'o' because the company has taken over all these domains. It doesn't cost much to set up a redirect to pull logins the push over to a valid url. Their are even sites that will do it for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each top level domain sets its own policies. Nominet who manage the .uk tld decided to have only a limited set of second level domains (co, org, ac, gov, net). These also had rules (in the same way edu and com have different rules on who can apply for one). Recently the rules have been relaxed and anyone can buy a .uk second level domain </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect from a legal sense. Many countries have data within country border regulations. Having country defined domains helps with maintaining compliance. So there are restrictions that prevent companies from operating under a single domain especially if they store data that's owned by public sector entities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps but AFAIK it's not a requirement. Do you have an example of a country and law that requires a company to keep a separate domain when doing business with people of that country?</p>
<p>I can setup a .Com e-commerce site, take orders from anyone in the world and ship to any part of the world. What legal requirement would I have to get a country specific domain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flip side, it does demonstrate some geographic integrity for at least some of them. <a href="https://www.1and1.com/digitalguide/domains/domain-extensions/cctlds-all-you-need-to-know-about-country-code-domains/" target="_blank">You can't register in the .fr domain unless your company is based in France.</a>. So this provides a measure of consumer protection to French people, letting them know there's a French business entity behind the domain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Like i mentioned it's primarily related to public sector not commercial. However there are commercial entities that either do business with government directly or have political influence and therefore are subject to said or similar regulations.</p>
<p>You're right, you can setup .com and run it business-wise without these regulations. Until the point in time it catches the attention of someone in your country who can make it difficult (PCI compliance) to do business or you want to do business with someone who has to maintain compliance. Then you are subject to those set of regulations.</p>
<p>That's pretty much how it happens. </p></div>		</li>
