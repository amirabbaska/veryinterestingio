			<div class="markdown"><p>Could they not have moved the first shuttle away and into an orbit with the ISS when the second came to dock?</p>
<p>And how many people were actually needed to get the shuttle into orbit and docked?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are always at least 2 flying the Shuttle. Columbia had a crew of 7 and the shuttle only has room for 8 people. So the 2 flying the rescue shuttle plus the 7 from Columbia would not have fit on the rescue shuttle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was later determined that it would have been possible to add seats to Atlantis, which was almost ready for its own flight. Columbia had enough stores aboard that it could be stretched to thirty days, and Atlantis could launch in 25 days. The mission would have been dangerous but might have been able to save the crew. However, no one realized how badly Columbia was damaged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How rough would it be to just 'hang on tight' in the cargo hold while landing?</p>
<p>In the hypothetical choice of having a seat &amp; seatbelt in shuttle A but it will probably blow up, or just hang on tight in shuttle B which will land safely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's possible to operate the shuttle remotely.  If someone was onboard to pilot it, they would have had to get into their  EVA suit without help, to through the airlock without help, and them somehow get back to the ISS without any help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>I believe that had the damage not happened right where it did, the flight might have made it. I could be remembering wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no &quot;may not&quot; about it. Shuttle couldn't dock to ISS because they were in different orbits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. When building ISS, some hardware was going to be removed from modules, launched on later flights, and installed on-orbit because shuttle needed a lighter load to make up for the effort needed to reach Baikonur-friendly orbits from Kennedy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, but ISS isn't capable of spinning to simulate gravity. I'm pretty sure you need that to dock two shuttles. And I'm pretty sure the hose isn't long enough to refuel the second one.</p></div>		</li>
