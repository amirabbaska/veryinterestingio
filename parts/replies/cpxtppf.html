			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  People often fail at order of magnitude math on these things.  The inflated prices are because health care is simply the most profitable section of our economy.  People need it, but competition and shopping around simply aren't practical.  From the AMA lobbying to keep the number of doctors limited (so that even the lowest paid surgeons make nearly 300k/yr, making medicine the only profession giving guaranteed entrance to the top 2%), hospital administrators making insane amounts of money, to pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of tens of billions in government research and spending most of their money on marketing, everything in the system jacks up costs.  There is no silver bullet, but adding an extra factor of .3 - 2 here and there quickly adds up.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You're confusing spending for profit. That 50 billion is a complete loss and only represents some of the expense items. Litigation, protection (insurance) and R&amp;D costs are extremely high. My wife works for a pharma company that just got done spending 2.5 billion dollars on a drug that they took a complete loss on.</p>
<p>That 2.6 trillion number (assuming it is accurate) may only amount to 20% margins in actual profit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, it doesn't add up because while the medical industry will tell  you that they have to overcharge for medical things to make up for the non-paying patients, that is just an excuse to severely overcharge for their services, and its a total scam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in medical manufacturing and am not any kind of expert on the greater  issue. But i think its worth mentioning that any medically used device costs way more to purchase than a comparable device for normal use because there are a lot of qualifications required to make medical parts and there are other factors that increase the cost like redundant inspection. Lets take a screw for example.  A regular screw is cast from cheap metal and costs less than $.50 at a hardware store. An orthopedic bone screw will be machined on a CNC lathe (costing between $200k to $1m) to much tighter tolerances, the material has to be qualified as pure and free of defects by outside services, the machine and inspection equipment has to be qualified to meet the required manufacturing standards. There has to be traceability  to the entire process so if a bad part is found it can be traced all the way back to the raw material being mined incase a recall is required.  The part is inspected carefully under a microscope and hand deburred. Cleaned, maybe media blasted, anodized to specific color to prevent parts being mixed. Cleaned again and inspected. By the time the part or assembly is ready for use it was handled and inspected by dozens of people and often required many outside services from companies other than the manufacturer. A bone screw can cost any where from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars.  This sounds like a lot of extra work but if defective parts are identified and a recall is required,  they will go as far as to surgically remove it from your body. Its in your best interest that these parts be made right the first time even at a high cost. My company doesn't make Que tips or aspirin but i guaranty there is a lot more cost in any medically used anything to ensure the highest quality for you safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Quality, regulated manufacturing does cost more and its worth it. </p>
<p>If you buy a new phone and the battery is defective you just get an exchange, and its a minor inconvenience. If that were to happen with a new pacemaker in the other hand...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really confused about this and I need some help.</p>
<p>Okay, this answer spends most of its time talking about the uninsured and how we pay for them and doesn't give any other hints as to why the US spends double what most other western nations spend on healthcare as a % of GDP. I can't see how the total cost of uninsured folks is even in the BALLPARK of the premium we pay for health services compared to other nations.</p>
<p>I did some research maybe a year ago and I found that the estimated charge to the uninsured from hospitals was only a few hundred billion dollars per year. A majority of that money is paid, either by the people who got the care or by non-profit organizations who help with medical bills. So that leaves AT MOST somewhere in the neighborhood of $100-200 Billion which hospitals eat annually in terms of services which are billed for but never paid. I think the real number is probably &lt;$100 billion. So that means that our total healthcare spending is 80-200 times more than the shortfall. And hospitals are the only point where healthcare spending on the uninsured is required by law, as far as I know.</p>
<p>So why, then are prices so inflated relative to the rest of the world? And it isn't just the prices, we actually spend double what anyone else spends. Even if the hospitals don't know how many people will not pay them in a year and so they charge the insured patients 5 or 10 times what they expect to lose in uncompensated services, you're still NOT EVEN CLOSE to explaining the gap between what we pay and what other nations pay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important point of clarification. /u/bs_altogether  addressed the main causes of hospital markup and excess overhead. I also took that to be the focus of OPs question, but it is by no means the sole cause of out of control healthcare costs in the US. </p>
<p>The US spends far too much on healthcare and, for many conditions and populations, also experiences sub-par quality and patient outcomes. There is no doubt about this point; but hospital markup is a tiny and relatively unimportant factor in the overall picture. </p>
<p>Here are some of the better accepted reasons why US healthcare has been inefficient:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of access to and utilization of preventative services - chronic diseases are much cheaper to treat if caught early or prevented altogether, but issues with our healthcare system (such as lack of insurance or insurance with sub-par coverage for preventative services, lack of paid sick leave, lack of easily understood and predictable costs to consumers) tend to push people towards delaying care until it is too late</li>
<li>Poor continuity of care and follow up - when your hospital doctor and primary care physician work for different companies (or sometimes even when they don't), communication between them can be poor and is hindered by a lagging national health information infrastructure. This causes many patients who need good follow up care to fall through the cracks and end up back in the hospital frequently for conditions like heart failure that could be managed much more cost effectively if done proactively in the outpatient setting</li>
<li>Some aspects of pharmaceutical/medical device industry regulation - new drugs don't have to prove that they are better than existing drugs to get approval, but instead only that they are better than nothing. Combine this with our lax regulations regarding marketing to doctors, and you've got physicians being convinced to prescribe the newest, most expensive treatment for a disease based on misleading information about just how effective the new treatment is in comparison to cheaper alternatives. </li>
<li>A payment system with perverse incentives - payments to providers has been based solely on quantity services provided without attention to quality. This encourages ordering tests and providing services with marginal benefits rather than considering the costs and the benefits together</li>
<li>A litigious environment - in a malpractice suit, a doctor is safest if they ordered every test and offered every possible treatment. This compounds the incentive to provide quantity care over quality care </li>
<li>Healthcare services treated as consumer goods - we expect patients to make decisions about what care and services they receive as if they are any other consumer good, but without providing upfront information about the relative costs of their options. Since it's not really feasible to be a &quot;rational actor&quot; when it comes to your life and the actual costs are hidden at the point of &quot;purchase&quot;, this tends to lead to even more excessive care</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of these issues are currently under reform. The Affordable Care Act has already addressed #1 head on, and it's provisions for #4 are just starting to take effect. The HITECH act and portions of the Affordable Care Act have also put people hard at work on #2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top comment (though it'd take a pretty smart 5 year old to completely understand). I work in healthcare consulting and it's disconcerting seeing how ill-informed people are about this stuff. </p>
<p>The issue with the American healthcare system IMO is that the government has treated a necessity like it's a commodity and little tweaks to the system to rectify this have only exacerbated the issue (EMTALA).</p>
<p>The ACA is probably the best bandage that has been put on this issue to-date but it still hasn't resolved the underlying issue. High healthcare costs are heavily driven by the uninsured but until there's a single payer system and not such a focus on profit, Healthcare will continue to be ridiculously expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a medical student who has been through the VA, I feel that single-payer, at least the American version of it, is even worse.  It is so inefficient, plagued by all these crazy government regulations that staff have to follow.  There are so many inefficient people on staff that never get fired because of seniority or nepotism, and our clinics were insane.  We'd make people wait 2-3 hours or more and see patients for only 5 minutes each. Everyone that works there uses the excuse &quot;it's the government, what do you expect?!?&quot; I know other countries do single-payer better, but it's almost as if Americans have such a obsession with proving &quot;socialism&quot;  wrong that government services are undermined just to prove a point.  Unless we can get over that somehow, I don't see single payer working anytime soon, here.</p></div>		</li>
