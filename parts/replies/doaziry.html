<p>inflation in the geological record is <em>really</em> difficult, and really only possible at all for modern volcanoes with geologically recent activity.  For example we can look at the side walls of a caldera and see where the palaeosurface was. By measuring the distance between that palaeosurface and the drop down to the modern caldera floor you can estimate order of magnitude for how much more inflation might be accommodated. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So if we measure inflation (is this with satellite data?) and deem it to be significant, would the next step be to try and assess the nature of injected material? Is this possible? I realise supervolcanoes are a slightly different beast to volcanoes with a history of lower volume eruptions, so I guess I'm asking about either. </p></div>		</li>

<p>luckily, right?</p>
<p>how relevant are extraterrestrial volcanoes for your research? is there enough overlap to make it worth your time to, say, study ice volcanoes on enceladus and such? (guess the data is still scarce... but may be worth the investment?)</p>

<p>hope that's 10k-20k, not 10 years to 20,000 years ;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah 10k to 20k.</p>
<p>I personally don't work on supervolcanoes particularly, but yes certainly there is plenty of research being done on extra terrestrial volcanism.  However,  most of it is in the opposite direction; i.e. this is a thing we can see on mars photography,  it looks a lot like this thing we see on earth,  therefore maybe we can infer this process occured on mars.  There's a huge amount more information we can gain on earth systems so we tend to use earth to infer things about the other planets and moons rather than visa versa. </p></div>		</li>
