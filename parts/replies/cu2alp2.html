			<div class="markdown"><p>Another point is that even with rhythmic countdowns you can still false start and leave the line early. The only method that doesn't have a false start is when the movement of the racer starts the clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. In bike racing, plenty of instances of false starts on timed events with rhythmic countdowns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this has been mentioned or not yet and I'm on mobile so it's hard to check, but sailing starts are really cool. Basically the race starts at a certain time so you have to set yourself up so you are crossing the start line at that exact time or later, if you cross too soon you have to turn around and go back </p></div>		</li>
