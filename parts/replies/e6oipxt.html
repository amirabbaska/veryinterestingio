			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll see downthread a bunch of hypotheses about how fire or houses or group living or cooking are the reason that people breed year round. </p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to point out that just because you can come up with a plausible story about why a trait evolved doesn't mean that explanation is correct.  As the parent comment notes, non-seasonal breeding long predates any of these other things, so they can't be the explanation for it.  Always be suspicious of plausible sounding evolutionary explanations that don't double-check against the facts on the ground...such things are very common</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It’s an asinine hypothesis anyway. Agriculture is maybe 10-15,000 years old. That’s no time at all on an evolutionary scale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>changes can happen faster than people realize honestly. Evolution has periods of rapid development and periods of slow development, and different traits can develop faster than others. </p>
<p>This is especially true for traits related to breeding and food consumption, esp for predators. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, yeah, but stuff like this isn't always genetic or evolutionary.</p>
<p>Plenty of organisms take fertility queues from the environment, and we can control fertility by controlling the environment. That's why I can breed tropical fish in my central Europe lounge - nothing genetic has changed between them and their wild counterparts.</p>
<p>There isn't much difference between the tropical fish in my fish tank and the human beings just outside the fish tank - all of us are living in an artificially-adjusted environment.</p>
<p>It's just that, in this case, the environment has nothing to do with how often I get it on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious- is the evolution of non-seasonal breeding even something that has to be explained, or is seasonal breeding the thing that evolved from prior norms? Is the question, essentially backwards?</p>
<p>It would make just as much sense that prior organisms had just reproduced whenever, but then certain species had higher chance of the next generation reaching reproduction age if their reproduction fell in certain times based on climate, predation ,etc. So those animals that developed more seasonal breeding habits tended to out-survive those that didn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Seasons. Seasons are the cause of seasonal breeding patterns in animals. Conditions worsen for survival when there is a shortage of food, and seasons cause periodic scarcity in food for most species outside of the tropics.</p>
<p>When you look at the distributions of seasonal breeders, you notice they tend to not be in the tropics. The closer you get to the equator, the less extreme your seasons are, and thus species adapted to those regions often breed year round. On the other hand, creatures far to the north have shorter windows during which their young can survive.</p>
<p>Mating is almost universally done in these regions in the fall in to winter, and offspring are most often born in the spring.</p>
<p>As for the others being continual, you have to look at what niche that species is adapted to do. Sometimes the niche a species fills is not its environment, but rather another species itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance from the equator would make a difference.  In the case of humans and other apes, our long lifespan makes a difference.  No matter when a baby is born, it will face winter while still a baby so it doesn't really matter when it is born.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>continual breeders will outpace the growth of seasonal breeders, but if they are unable to raise their young to maturity they will have wasted resources making them less efficient than seasonal breeders, which also have to spend less resources on menses. just another selective pressure for evolution.</p>
<p>Another question in the same vein is why do some species have obvious signs of being ready to mate like baboons swelling butts vs. not signaling being ready to mate successfully.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All we have are hypotheses, some of which (Aquatic Ape) have been thoroughly been debunked.</p>
<p>Speculation is its advantageous for humans because uncertain paternity is somehow a boon in our hyper-social species. </p></div>		</li>
