			<div class="markdown"><p>I always figured it was really all about the amount. You usually only spray cologne once or maybe twice a day, while people who smoke will do that more than twice a day. If you took perfume and sprayed it all over the house every hours for weeks, would it linger much, much longer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The base notes will linger a few days, but most of the scent will be gone within hours unless you can trap the oils in something that limits their evaporation, like scented leather, or wood, etc. Simply spraying the air or a bedsheet won't make it linger as much although if you were to spray cologne on a shirt, and left the shirt undisturbed in a drawer, it will keep the scent much longer than if it were in moving air and light. </p>
<p>I have some very fine colognes, hand made artisinals that make use of real ambergris, and that has to be one of the scents that lasts the longest. I bath a lot so I don't often have the opportunity to leave a cologne on for days to see how long it lasts, but I've put some Creed or an Andy Tauer cologne on in the car, and smelled it for weeks afterwards. </p>
<p>I actually have cologne I don't wear and purchased exclusively for making my linens smell good, or making my bedroom smell nice. I put a few drops in my humidifier and it's wonderful. I recommend Grey Flannel in the winter, it makes a room smell so cozy. </p>
<p>Also, I'm a former smoker and my wife smoked a ton in the house. All of my paperback books have smoke rings around the edge of all their pages. It turned the walls yellow and was disgusting. I cleaned everything I could reach with rubbing alcohol which seems to dissolve it pretty well, but that stuff gets everywhere you know? If she lit a cigarette outside and came back inside the house after smoking it, and then I came home an hour later, I could walk in the house and tell she had smoked. Cigarettes are nasty and I think if you used to smoke, once you quit, you become VERY sensitive to that smell in a bad way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, sugar, just quit smoking two days ago and thought I'd give you a tip on getting the yellow off your walls:</p>
<p>Alcohol works ok, but Windex is where it's at! I worked for a truckstop for a few years about a decade ago and we always used a bucket of this industrial-strength windex that came in tabs that dissolved in hot water. I'd use that and a scrub brush with a twelve foot handle to get the tops of the walls in the place. The yellow nicotine/smoke stains would just slough right off the walls with that stuff and even the regular offbrand stuff works greats on my own place. </p>
<p>I'm barking my head off right now because of my COPD, but as soon as that dies down in a couple weeks I'm gonna make a sweep of this house with the windex treatment to help get the yellow off the walls the scent of stale smoke out of the house. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I've bought things on Ebay with air freshener stink that's as pungent and difficult to remove as smoke damage from a house fire.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_fatigue</a> also comes in to play here. If you smoke you stop noticing the smell. On the other hand, if you lather your house in multiple air fresheners every day (and yes people do do this), you will also stop noticing it. If those two people switched houses it would take both of them several months to get the other's stink out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God my mom uses air fresheners because she smokes. The whole house feels sticky and damp because of both. The furniture, and the carpet are the worst, and people wonder why it's not habit I don't take off my shoes when I go in someone's house. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely is about the volume. I make fine fragrance and my workspace reeks of it just like a smoker's house does. Most people just never deal with the ingredients in similar volumes to cigarette smoke residue. I do.
Many very popular fragrance ingredients are NOT oils, they are white powdery solids that will continue to smell for years and years on their own. Almost all tonka bean notes comes from synthetic coumarin, most &quot;ambergris&quot; notes come from ambroxan, vanilla comes from vanillin or ethyl vanillin. These are incredibly powerful and tenacious, but you only deal with them in amounts that are orders of magnitude smaller than the tobacco smoke residue in a smoker's house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's the volume in all cases though. Consider vaping as suggested by the top comment.</p>
<p>I used to rent a small room in an apartment that had a strict no-smoking rule, but I would vape in that small room pretty much non-stop whenever I was home, almost every day (I guess you could call me a &quot;chain-vaper&quot;). None of my housemates ever noticed a smell, nor did the landlord when she would come by.</p>
<p>Contrasted with cigarettes (obviously I used to smoke, which is why I vape now instead) the one time I smoked a few cigarettes in my bedroom (different apartment) it stank for a couple days afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had to google to confirm that was really used in perfumes wow. How does that smell? The perfumes are way out of my price point from an initial search</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does that smell?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freshly produced ambergris has a marine, faecal odour. However, as it ages, it acquires a sweet, earthy scent commonly likened to the fragrance of rubbing alcohol without the vaporous chemical astringency. Although ambergris was formerly highly valued by perfumers as a fixative (allowing the scent to last much longer), it has now largely been replaced by synthetics.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was travelling in Morocco I went into a kinda perfumery shop, and the geezer running it showed me these 2 waxy-ish solids. Rubbed them on me and my gal at the time's hands and then told us that they were ambergris and deer musk. They both smelt nice, but the musk was better in my opinion. As a vegetarian I didn't buy any, but it was interesting to see/smell as I'd never encounter it here in the UK.</p></div>		</li>
