			<div class="markdown"><p>A simplistic answer is that scouts find potential nest sites and return to the swarm, where they use the dance language to inform others of the site's location. Bees witnessing the dance will follow the directions, inspect the nest site, and return. If they also like the site, they will also begin dancing the site's directions. Otherwise they will not dance for the site and follow directions to other sites. The process continues until the majority of scouts are dancing for the same site and a quorum is reached.  See, eg, Seeley 2003 &quot;Consensus building during nest-site selection in honey bee swarms: the expiration of dissent&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is completely fascinating.</p>
<p>Is there ever a truly legitimate reason to purposely destroy a bee hive? They seem to provide so many benefits to our world with only very few drawbacks.</p>
<p>As far as wasps, I hate them, but the same question: Do they provide benefits that many of us are not aware of? Should their nests ever be intentionally destroyed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't answer how the bees communicate and decide. Since they can't talk, how do they know which worker has found the best new location? Do the deciders visit every possible location? Do they just pick one of the scout's locations at random? What makes them pick one location over another? </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the queen was killed, the workers would likely attempt to drift to a nearby colony and/or simply starve to death. </p>

<p>But why? What is stopping them from executing basic survival tasks? I understand that if the queen dies, the colony would stop growing, but why would the worker bees stop gathering food, even for themselves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are ant colonies with a single queen like this as well? I know if the queen dies, the colony dies, but is that because the queen lives for many years while worker ants only live for a few months at a time, or do the ants just lose coordination as bees do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true. Queens do not direct the hive. The lay eggs and produce pheromones which suppress the ovary development of workers and announce their presence and thats about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do continue to gather food. They will also attempt to raise a new queen if there are any eggs or larva available. A few of the workers will even start laying eggs, though unfertilized. </p>
<p>The lifespan of workers is only about 45 days however. As the population declines workers from other hives and other pests will start to attack the hive and eventually steal the resources and kill the last workers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of it as survival of the individual, but rather the survival of the colony.  If the queen is still alive, there's a productive egg layer; wasps will rebuild a nest, the queen will lay, and the colony survives.  If, however, the queen dies, there is no productive egg layer, or any means to <em>create</em> one (in the case of bees, so long as there are eggs in a hive, a dead queen can be replaced...without eggs, the colony dies...in beekeeping, beekeepers will &quot;re-queen&quot; a hive in such an event...I'm not sure what wasps do...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasps die.  But most eusocial wasp nests all die every winter anyway.  Some eusocial wasp species will even murder their queens partway through the season, when she was about to start laying only male eggs, so that the workers can lay all of the male eggs instead (since unmated workers in many if these species are capable of laying male eggs, just not female ones.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't just think of it as survival of the colony, but survival of the genes. Plenty of them have certainly done what JohnDoe_2408 suggested and survived well enough. But doing so didn't do anything to help spread their genes. Others started working for a nearby colony - and being nearby meant that the its queen was probably closely related to theirs. Doing so supported a colony that was manufacturing the genes that supported this behavior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right in that in a reproductive sense for A. mellifera linguistica (typical honey bee), swarming tends to require quite a bit of preparation and that does involve the slimming down of the queen. Without preparation, A.m.l. queens still retain retain some ability to fly, just not the long distances which reproductive swarming tends to entail. As the hive must relocate quickly or perish in response to destruction, longer distances are both unneeded and dangerous. Other species (and even subspecies of A.m. like A.m. scutellata or africanized A.m.l. colonies) routinely and totally abscond from their nests in a non-reproductive manner such as in response to food shortages and require little to no preparation.    </p></div>		</li>
