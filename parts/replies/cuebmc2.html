			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good example of storing mechanical energy through gravity is when you wind up a clock. You put the weights higher so they get gravitational potential energy that'll be used to make the clock run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... Sort of. </p>
<p>The earth-moon system creates tides purely by gravity. And there are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_power" target="_blank">tidal generators</a>. Technically speaking, you'd be making electricity by stealing from the <del>moon's orbital velocity</del> redacted. </p>
<p>Edit: someone down in the comments brought up a really good point. The tidal generators are actually stealing rotational speed from the Earth to turn into energy, so they would actually be assisting in tidal locking the Earth to the Moon. Not that this one effect would make a real difference before the sun swells up into a red giant and swallows the Earth moon system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's referring to the fact that the work done by gravity in a closed system is zero. The energy from the tides is, as you said, coming from the orbital energy of the moon, not from moving things around in a constant field like a gravitational Carnot engine. You are both right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is that they'll slow each other down each time they pass each other which will cause their orbits to decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a really crazy way to make a battery (you'll only get back a portion of the energy you put in to launch it, and drawing energy out will slow both down, causing their orbits to slowly decay).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you don't even have to do that. you could just stretch out a wire while it's orbiting earth. the wire passing through earth's magnetic field will induce a current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congratulations, you've invented tether propulsion! If you harvest that current, that will result in a force on the wire, which will cause its orbit to decay. You could do the opposite and force the opposite current through the wire, which will also generate a force and boost the orbit of the wire (and presumably the attached spacecraft).</p></div>		</li>
