<p>Borrow and study the ARRL operating manual from your local library, find the nearest Technician Class test at a local club, and buy a Baofeng handheld from Amazon for $30. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in the US, check out the ARRL website: <a href="http://www.arrl.org/licensing-education-training" target="_blank">http://www.arrl.org/licensing-education-training</a> There's classes they organize but you can also teach yourself. In the late 90s when I got my license I was given a couple ARRL prep books by a friend of mine. I'm sure you can find all sorts of stuff online these days. If you have a general understanding of electronics you can pick things up fast. There's a lot of electronics and RF questions on the test, but there's also questions about operating radios which you can only learn from either books specifically about amateur radio or other people. They also ask questions about what modes of communications are allowed at certain frequencies, what allowable frequencies you can operate on, things like that.</p>
<p>The cool thing is, all of the questions are written by the FCC and they're all publicly available so there shouldn't really be any surprises on the test. The Technician license which is the lowest entry one is pretty easy. General and Extra get harder, but if you want to start experimenting with basic stuff you only need your Tech license.</p>
<p>If you're not in the US, your country should have an organization similar to the ARRL that should have information. While many of the frequency bands that are used are universal, there are multiple regions of the world and things can differ from region to region and country to country. Here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:International_Amateur_Radio_Union_member_societies" target="_blank">list of all the ones Wikipedia has entries on</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct AM stations are below 2MHz and the propagation is always best at night:</p>
<p>I will now quote Peter Gabriel &quot;when the night shows and signals grow on radios&quot; Here comes the flood from the 'car' album.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reasoning for this: AM radio is in the MF (300kHz-3MHz) to HF (3-30MHz) frequency ranges, which has wavelengths long enough to be bent in the upper atmosphere very easily (skywave refraction), or to bend around obstacles in their path (ground waves) . The reason it is better at night is because the upper atmosphere becomes charged by the sun's radiation (giving rise to the term ionosphere), more charged particles means more interference in signal during the day. Frequencies used in FM (88-108MHz, smack in the middle of the VHF 30-300MHz range) are beginning to have enough energy and a small enough wavelength that they start penetrating the atmosphere instead of refracting back to earth, but in the right conditions are able to do so.
AM radio transmitters also push out massive amounts of power compared to FM. Some AM stations push as much as 50,000 watts and can be received thousands of miles away because of the wave characteristics, while using that much power for FM would be wasted as the wave would just continue on into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ducting was taken advantage of in WWII for communications over large distances. If you identify and target these inversion layers you can send the tiniest signals much farther than refraction through the ionosphere would ever get you. Really cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>
