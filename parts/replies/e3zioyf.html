			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably one of the biggest factors. The only ones we regular people notice are the  spiders that have built their webs on successful spots. With the number of offspring a single spider has, the reason we're not overrun with them is most die off quickly and we dont see the ones who built webs in particularly bad spots</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some great info in other comments about how they can actually plan where they build their web but anecdotally, when they're in a human environment (my house) they choose the dumbest spots. Like recently one connect to the showerhead that I turn on every day, spider bro built it overnight one night. They choose dumb spots too but I suppose in a house it's pretty much wherever they can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a spider that hangs out near my front porch light. I've named him Ted. Every day this summer he would have a web made around 10:00pm. Generally I don't leave my front porch light on except when I walk the dog around 10:00pm. In the 20 minutes I'm out with the dog Ted catches like 20 flies that are attracted to the light. The other day I came out a little earlier around 9:00pm and Ted was still working on completing his web. I am now convinced that Ted has memorized my patterns of behavior and builds his webs accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the thing. You said a &quot;jackdaw is a crow.&quot; Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be &quot;specific&quot; like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying &quot;crow family&quot; you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people &quot;call the black ones crows?&quot; Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well actually...</p>
<p>In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax.</p>
<p>&quot;The researchers found that the smaller the spider, the bigger its brain relative to its body size.</p>
<p>In some spiders, the central nervous system took up nearly 80 percent of the space in their bodies, sometimes even spilling into their legs.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/12/111219-spiders-big-brains-bodies-legs-webs-animals-science/" target="_blank">https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/12/111219-spiders-big-brains-bodies-legs-webs-animals-science/</a></p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider" target="_blank">Despite the relatively small central nervous system, some spiders (like Portia) exhibit complex behaviour, including the ability to use a trial-and-error approach.</a>&quot;</p></div>		</li>
