			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, he's relatively recent, a cousin of orang utans. Gigantopithecus only went extinct about 100,000 years ago, so they were so recent that humans saw them alive! The mammals at the end of the dinosaur age were small and only just beginning to diversify into the groups we know today.</p></div>		</li>
