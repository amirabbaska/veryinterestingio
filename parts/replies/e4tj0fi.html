			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no doctor but I’d wager that it’s due to the fact that your core started with more fat than your limbs did. If you want to lose that to just eat less (don’t starve yourself but eat less).</p>
<p>To lose weight you eat less. </p>
<p>To get healthy you exercise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the stomach is not the first place you will notice trimming down.</p>
<p>If you are a man fat goes first on, last off to your gut. So you can do everything right and still not see progress for some time.</p>
<p>If you're a woman fat goes first on, last off to your hips, boobs and ass. Which one, or which combination, or which ratio between all three depends on genetics. Some women naturally put all their fat in their ass. Other women put it all in their thighs. Womens magazines like to mention the four shapes women come in: Apple, Pear, Banana and Hourglass. Men come in one shape: upside down triangle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not necessarily true. Although many people gain the most weight on their stomach, people also differ in the pattern of their fat loss. Some could have a lot of weight stored in front of their abdomen but will only begin to lose this once they drop to, say, &lt; 18% body fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Places with higher fat usually have had that fat longer, making them the last places you'll lose fat from. That's why so many guys still have periumbillical fat even at low bodyfat percentages</p></div>		</li>
