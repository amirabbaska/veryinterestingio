			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I understand your explanation. So for example let's say I'm on Mars and you start the DCQE experiment here on earth and send me 1,000 entangled photons to my lab on Mars. </p>
<p>After traveling through the solar system for 3 minutes, your entangled photons finally arrive at my lab on Mars. Upon arrival, I direct all of the photons into the eraser section of the experiment and within the eraser, I use a special beam splitter to direct 99% of the photons into detector C.</p>
<p>From my limited understanding of the quantum mechanics, it seems to me that back on Earth, you would have immediately received 99% of the typical waveform interference pattern as soon as you started the experiment (even though it would be another 3 minutes before I would receive the entangled photons) allowing you to deduce that 3 minutes later that I would have later eventually directed the entangled photons into detector C on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I just always receive the unfiltered C+D combined pattern, which is always a blur/blob.  Nothing you do before or after can change this for me.  I can't filter my measurement result to just the subset of my photon impressions that paired your Cs until you tell me which ones were Cs for you.  For which you will need to send a lightspeed signal.</p>
<p>And, if you choose to send 99% to C, this won't be very interesting to me, once you send me the report of which photons were C photons.  It will at best filter my blob down to a fringe pattern overlaid with 98% of an anti fringe pattern.  This will not really look any different than the full C+D blob I had pre filtering.</p></div>		</li>
