			<div class="markdown"><p>1.) When you talk about bending materials on a macro scale, usually you don't really see changes in the bonding structure. What you'll get is slight displacements between the atoms or molecules or polymer strands or whatever that add up over billions of atoms to produce a macro effect. Of course, chemical bonds themselves are not rigid and you can get long, floppy molecules because they're able to rotate or stretch or something, but that's not normally the macro bending or flexing that you see. </p>
<p>2.) You're probably thinking of molecular encapsulation. This is actually a really interesting topic and something that people already do a lot! It is perfectly doable to trap all sorts of molecules inside other molecular &quot;cages.&quot; The applications for this sort of thing are really cool--you can make molecular cages that are &quot;openable&quot; by things like light or pH, so that you can control the release of some substrate or ligand based on things like light intensity. This allows for some really powerful control of reaction rates. You can even control the release of molecules inside living systems, for use as drug delivery agents or something. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the basic idea behind things like enteric-coated capsules, right? They survive the acidity of the stomach but are dissolved and release their contents when they reach the basic environment of the intestines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not really; having enteric-coated capsules is more akin to wrapping something in Saran wrap; it's just a simple material coating. I mean in principle, sure it's the same idea, having a coating that's stable in particular environments  but not in others. But like for a coated capsule maybe bit dissolves in the acidic pH of your stomach. For an encapsulated molecule, you could have a lot more control over that specific type of environment, so maybe the capsule enters  your bloodstream and only breaks up at like pH 5.5, around a tumor or something so the drug doesn't reach your healthy cells. Molecular encapsulation is different because you're encasing just one molecule with another, the scale and processed involved are totally different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow killer response. I wonder if mother boards use this molecular encapsulation that you're taking about. The process of moving an electric signal through transistors uses a similar concept (i watched a YouTube video on it once, definitely not an electrician or computer scientist). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So electronics are totally different; the transistors that are ubiquitous in modern computers are pretty much all a particular type of semiconductor called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor" target="_blank">field effect transistor</a>. Transistors are powerful as switches and logic gates because you can control their properties (i.e. whether or not they conduct or insulate).  They're not based on molecular encapsulation, instead they are the way they are because of what's called the electronic band structure of the material. Basically, this describes the energy gap between the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals over the whole material (because you get a range of energies in a metallic bonding structure), which in turn describes the ability of electrons to flow through the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a material flexes or bends, barring plastic deformation (which is permanent deformation of the material), the bond lengths and angles do change. This kind of deformation is elastic, and can be approximated to a a network of springs connected to one another. I don't know enough for your second question, and someone else should answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. :) Much appreciated.  I'm guessing in a material like silly putty those bonds are constantly breaking and reforming as you pull the material? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonds do not break in elastic deformation. In elastic deformation, the material always returns to it's original state after the stress is released. If it doesn't do so, then that would be plastic deformation, which is permanent deformation. In the case for silly putty, silly putty is a polymer, which means it's made up of a bunch of molecules that are long chains. Because these are long chains, they tangle up, and as a result are unable to move easily. Think of it like tangled up strings, and you're trying to pull them apart. As a result, these strings need time to relax (move so to reduce their energy) in response to a stress. Depending on the force that you pull on the polymer, the bonds that hold those chains together might just break, or the chains will be able to move to relieve the stress. </p>
<p>Note that the mechanism for deformation in this case is different than for something like a metal, which is not made up of long chains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2) The answer is not much. The reason helium makes things float is because of buoyancy, like a boat it's lighter than the air it displaces. If the helium atom replaced &quot;air&quot; (mainly nitrogen or oxygen molecules) in the &quot;cage&quot; then the material would be a little lighter. If it was instead put into an empty &quot;cage,&quot; the material would actually be heavier (because helium has mass).</p>
<p>Not sure about unusual properties, but probably nothing too interesting. Helium is basically inert, and I can't think of anything interesting that it would do if contained.</p>
<p>Lastly, helium is <em>very</em> small, being a single, small atom. It's so small that it can sneak between atoms in metals, so making a &quot;cage&quot; that would hold it in would actually be quite difficult.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes complete sense. I feel like I should have been able to figure this out on my own. :P It seems so obvious laid out like that. But my instincts have been wrong before when it comes to chemistry so I figured it would be better to ask someone who knows. </p>
<p>In any case, thanks for the reply. </p></div>		</li>
