<p>Ever wonder why we are told to wash our hands with warm water? I used to wonder why warm water because wouldn't that help the bacteria multiply faster than cold water? While yes that is true, the warm water &quot;activates&quot;(increase the metabolic rate of the bacteria) so that the active ingredient can complete its mechanism.(break down the cell wall, target protein synthesis, etc)</p>

<p>Contrary to what you've been told, tests show that warm water isn't actually better than cold water for cleaning hands.</p>
