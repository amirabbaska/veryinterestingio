			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the size of the planet that increases gravity, as I understand it. The relation to other high-gravity environments around the planet affect time as well.</p>
<p>Neil Tyson was on NPR a little while after Interstellar came out, saying that their interpretation of the gravity/time relationship was pretty accurate, so I'll use one of the examples from the movies.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>SPOILERS AHEAD!!!</em></strong></strong></p>
<p>When they are on a planet close to a black hole, the planet has (I believe) 130% of the gravity of Earth, and they said 1 hour on that planet to them would be 7 years to the guy staying on the ship.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. Interstellar changed me, man. I'm obsessed with spacetime right now.</p>
<p>Edit: It was 7 years, not 14. My mistake.
Edit 2: Neil Tyson. Not Neil Gaiman. Wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm guessing that the orbital path around a black hole must be very narrow due to the incredible gravitational pull, and even the slightest alteration to said planet's mass (like a landing or departing ship) could disrupt it's orbit and wither send it into a decaying orbit, or expel it from said orbit.</p>
<p>I'm not very educated on the subject, but I think I understand some core concepts. Please correct me if I'm wrong!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason the time dilation was so large was because they were so close to the black hole. That's also why the waves were so huge, because of the immense gravity of the black hole. A gravity of 1.3 times earths would probably have a mostly negligible effect on time dilation. It certainly wouldn't be enough to dilate time at a rate of 7 years for every hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those calculations accurate? 1.3x the gravity doesn't seem like much of a difference. Or was the effect of the black hole much more than 1.3x earth's gravity? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the movie that was a miscalculation, it ended up being longer than 7 years. It said so when they return on the ship, arguably they were there for less than 2 hours it's never explicitly stated though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is given by the relatively simple formula here:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#In_gravitational_time_dilation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#In_gravitational_time_dilation</a> its dependent only on the distance to the event horizon of the black hole (&quot;schwarzschild radius&quot;)</p>
<p>Assuming the black hole does not rotate (in interstellar it does) and assuming time dilation to be 80 (e.g. 80 years pass on earth whilst you are only experiencing 1), working out the numbers gives you a position at 1.000156 times the radius of the black hole. So you have to get really close. If the diameter is 2000km, you have to go near it to about 1km!</p>
<p>Rotational black holes complicate matters and i frankly have no idea how to calculate that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the Schwarzschild radius is not the same as the event horizon. For example in the movie Interstellar, the event horizon of the black hole is much farther out than the Schwarzschild radius (hence why going past the event horizon of that particular black hole doesn't result in instant death).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I was seriously confused about that in the movie, how they were able to go past the event horizon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read up on that because I find it very interesting! I think you have the order mixed up in your second sentence.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gothosenterprises.com/black_holes/rotating_black_hole.html" target="_blank">This site</a> has the following to say about ergospheres (of whose the maximum radius corresponds to the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>):  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The outer boundary of the ergosphere is the static limit of the rotating black hole. What's that? It's where you can no longer stay still, even if you were going at the speed of light. For static black holes the static limit is the event horizon, since after you cross that, even if you go the speed of light, you are pulled towards the singularity. A rotating black hole is different from the other two (once again!) in that its static limit is above its outer event horizon.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, but what does it mean?! It means that once you cross into the ergosphere, it is impossible to stay still. Even light rays are dragged along in the direction of rotation. However, you can enter and leave this region whenever you like, unlike the abandon-all-hope-ye-who-enter-here static limit/event horizon of the other two black holes. You can merrily weave in and out of the ergosphere with no nasty side-effects. It's a place of quirky spacetime of the black hole that we can actually visit and leave.</p>
