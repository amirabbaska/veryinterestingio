			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, the reason the gen 2 Pokemon games (Gold, Silver, and Crystal) are notorious for running out of battery is that they were some of the first to keep track of the real world time as they had a day/night cycle of 24 hours. Since date information was not kept on the handheld itself, the cartridges needed a clock which drained the internal battery much faster than most other Gameboy games of that era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually due to small inconsistencies in manufacturing. Electronics use crystal oscillators for keeping time. They are basically small crystal based components that pulse at a precise frequency when electricity is applied. When buying these components one of the properties is its tolerance shown in ± X ppm, which tells you how many parts per million the crystal may have of impurities. These impurities can slow down or speed up the exact frequency of the oscillators which will cause the clock to run behind or ahead. This is why digital watches get out of synch over time also</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The clock cycle is measured by counting the oscillations the crystal makes as a known voltage is passed through it.  A battery dying is the slow process of the voltage it emits becoming too low for the device using it to power itself.  So as the battery dies, the crystal oscillates slower and slower which causes the lag in the clock cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the correct reason for this case. The Pokémon games needed the battery to keep track of time while not in use. If you play the game with a dead battery, it keeps time only for as long as the game boy provides power. Once you turn it off, it would ask you what time it was again.</p>
<p>Source: I had to replace the battery on a Pokémon yellow cartridge for my sister about a year ago. It requires soldering and a little bit of patience. I am also familiar with Real Time Clock circuits that are found on older motherboards and RTC Arduino modules.</p>
<p>Edit: I felt like I should clarify. The information about saving data with power is not incorrect, but the battery was used to power the Real Time Clock circuit in the cartridge in order to keep track of time like a watch would. In fact, the battery is a glorified watch battery that lasted longer than usual because it had no moving parts. I believe the average lifespan is 10 years. Also, not all gameboy cartridges had these batteries, it was just a way to add a hardware feature to the game boy without requiring the release of a new device.... ah the good old days....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soldering isn't actually required, you can do the job with electrical tape if you make sure it's tight. I've replaced a few Pokemon cartridge batteries this way. (The only one I've used a lot since is Blue, but it's held up after several months.)</p>
<p>(Other tools also required, the most annoying being a special screwdriver for those Nintendo screws. It's apparently possible to make one yourself with a lighter and plastic pen? But I just bought a set on eBay for a few pounds. A bargain really, since I'll also be able to replace my SNES cartridge batteries when a) I buy the right battery type and b) am brave enough to risk it. My Mario SNES games have an even higher nostalgia value for me than Pokemon.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to electrically stored data, magnetically stored is also popular. This is because of the innate relationship of electricity and magnetism and how a change in one will effect another (under the fundamental force of electromagnetism). Magnets, obviously requiring no power, are used in systems such as Disc drives which take advantage of magnetic needles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooo something I can answer as an ex Silicon Valley device engineer. The way flash memory works is very cool. Basically you use electrical energy at a point in time to charge or lose the charge on a specific 'gate' which corresponds to a 1 or 0. When power is turned off that charge or lack of charge stays. Another analogy is that imagine you have land and a nearby islands with water separating them. You as a person are on land and represent a charge and can't get across the other side to the island. Every now and then with some 'power' applied you can get the water to freeze into a walkway that you can run across, and when the freezing power goes away, you are left on that island. Flash is tested to reliably be able to do this millions of times, and to also store that charge without time for years (you simulate time by heating it)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Often it stores more than a 1 or 0 (which is a single bit). That's called SLC, and is mostly confined to (some) enterprise uses. Cramming more bits into each cell means you get much more storage space for the same cost.</p>
<p>Most consumer flash is either MLC or TLC, storing 2 or 3 bits. Where SLC requires 2 voltage levels (representing 0 and 1), MLC requires 4 levels (00, 01, 10, 11), and TLC requires 8 levels. Obviously this means the voltage differences get a lot smaller when you cram in more bits, so it makes the flash memory more sensitive to voltage drift issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it's 100% accurate, but I think of it kind of like a <a href="http://machinedesign.com/site-files/machinedesign.com/files/uploads/2014/07/relay_diagram.gif" target="_blank">relay</a>. (using one circuit to run an electromagnet that physically connects another larger circuit)</p>
<p>You apply energy to a material in a certain way that makes it more conductive, allowing energy to transfer. Freezing the water and allowing people to cross seems like a good explanation to me</p></div>		</li>
