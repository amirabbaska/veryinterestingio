			<div class="markdown"><p>Phenol certainly will crystallize, and yeah it will burn like mad (though oddly enough, somewhat dilute solutions will actually numb your skin... before they burn you).</p>
<p>Also smells like a hospital. Really potent, characteristic scent.</p>
<p>Won't kill you that easily though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like the answer as Granpa said it was phenol and phenol acts like the crystalization story.  It's likely that the substance had a hyperbolic reputation created by the transporters and users.  This reputation would be for fun and to make it seem dangerous and cool and also for safety reasons as phenol left on the skin will poison someone in addition to burning them badly (though it looks like there would have to be a large amount of phenol left on the skin to actually kill.)  Also, it sounds like phenol will damage someone over repeated exposures, so having a 'convenient lie' like that a drop will kill you instantly helps ensure less people will be exposed in any way.</p>
<p>Thoughts, /u/kraybae?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like phenol to me.  It is crystalline, used in rubber production, can kill you if ingested in fairly small (but way larger than a drop) doses and will burn the hell out of skin due to its proteolytic reactivity.</p>
<p>Story is definitely stretched, but still a ridiculously hazardous work condition.</p>
<p>Fun story: a friend of mine worked in a lab where a guy commited suicide by drinking a phenol solution.  He died horribly as his stomach and throat were chemically disintegrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I just watched a clip about it the other day, and the dimethyl mercury passed right through her glove. Would’ve been the same result if she’d been wearing no glove, because it was the accumulation of mercury in her brain that led to her death. She suffered neurological decay for months, losing motor skills and sensory function until she slipped into a coma and died a few weeks later. </p></div>		</li>
