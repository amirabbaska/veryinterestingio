			<div class="markdown"><p>This was only like one company though, so there'll be more if more dodgy companies get leaked and the police can only go after people they really have a case about so can't get everyone, but yeah 2 per country is still a bit too low </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>11.5 MILLION leaked documents though. Thats way more than the WikiLeaks and they were handed to media organizations that are already low in available budgets. Just sitting through what's relevant and what's not will take years. Even then, playing connect the dots on how they relate or don't relate to each other will take an enormous amount of research. You can't expect it all to be wrapped up with a bow withing a few months. I wouldn't be surprised if we're still hearing new infoation about this like 10 years from now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having offshore companys isn't illegal per s√©. it may seem fishy and it often is indeed illegal and/or unethical, but just saying &quot;x has an offshore company&quot; seems useless, since it doesn't reveal if it was used for outright illegal things, for legal but unethical things like tax evasion or some other reason (which might be completely fine).</p></div>		</li>
