			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is anecdotal, but I'm currently getting chemotherapy and I smoke pot. I would say the relaxation answer is pretty valid. So much so that it helps stop my nausea. When I'm about to throw up and I smoke my stomach immediately stops churning and I'm able to get over it. Don't know if other people get the same reaction or what. Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you can relief. Watched a friend go through chemo years ago, and his suffering was heartbreaking to see.</p>
<p>He's been cancer free for 15 years. Keep on trucking. One Internet stranger is pulling for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't scientific studies out on it yet (they are under way including in our lab), but do some searching on its effect on Parkinson and on Epilepsy, they are having some amazing results so far. </p>
<p>Also watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta's movie &quot;Weed&quot;, for a good look at these things as well. He has a new &quot;Weed 2&quot; out but I havent' seen it yet so not sure how it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We found it to be one of the best antinausea treatments around. Not sure what studies have been done for that, but my mother who is a stage 4 pancreatic cancer victim could barely eat, and was constantly vomiting. The pain relief was good and all, but the fact it could get her to eat and hold it down was what sold me on it. Her antinausea meds just weren't doing it. </p>
<p>I am not a doctor. But when nothing else works and no adjustment to meds seems to stick while weight loss just continues, not sure it takes a doctor to see her go from a eating a little bit of a popsicle to eating most of a cheeseburger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal, but I have a friend who only survived the early years of the AIDS epidemic thanks to marijuana, for just that anti-nausea reason. She was one of the people who AZT made so sick that she couldn't even keep down a glass of water, let alone any nutrition, and was having to be &quot;fed&quot; and rehydrated intravenously several times a week--stupidly dangerous for someone with a compromised immune system. Nothing worked, not even Marinol. Her doctor recommended that she try marijuana, even though she was at the time morally and ethically opposed to it. She found out that half of a thin marijuana cigarette, once a day, would calm her stomach enough that she could choke down one glass of water and one can of Ensure, and keep it down. And that's what she lived on until the current &quot;cocktail&quot; therapy was invented.</p>
<p>She's healthier now than I am. But without marijuana she would have been dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to hear your friend is doing well! </p>
<p>It's crazy that &quot;morality&quot; and &quot;Ethics&quot; prevented her from trying marijuana when her doctor recommended it. The Drugs she had been taking before were probably 20x more dangerous than marijuana without doctor supervision. It's amazing what our society is led to believe. Alcohol is 10x more dangerous and bad for you, but since it's legal, it's morally justified in the eyes of the society. I just think it's crazy sometimes what our society finds morally just compared to what isn't in circumstances like this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was interviewing doctors who I thought were Marinol researchers (long story).  I asked one guy &quot;What kind of research have you done on cannabinoid receptor agonists?&quot; and he laughed and said &quot;You mean other than when I was a resident and used to bring cancer patients up to the roof of Major University Medical Center to get high before chemo?  None.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also helped with my wife when she was pregnant. Hypermeresis is a bitch, and a morning toke was preferable to vomiting bile all day. The right OB has no problem mentioning it on the sly, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to point out that it's a good pain relief option for patients with liver damage since every other pain relief drug can damage the liver. Also pain patients are or will be made into junkies at some point, anything that will stop or slow this is desperately needed in the medical field.</p></div>		</li>
