			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they would not be identical. Different colored pigments have differently shaped molecules so they would leave behind different fragments. As to whether you could figure out how the fragments were originally arranged to determine the original color, I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I had always wondered if you had a completely faded photo, like a Polaroid, if it could be divided into a fine grid and be able to have the original color information pulled  from it by analyzing the chemical makeup of each section. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could, at least if you have a known sample of pigment to compare to. It's hard to look at the &quot;fragments&quot; and say that something was green, but it's relatively easy to say that the fragments look like what you get when some particular known green pigment is bleached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be a &quot;trail&quot; that could lead you to the original color. However, in reality, who knows how successful you would be trying to figure that one out. This is due to the molecule colors of red and blue, can degrade in a different ways. Especially true when it's something as generic as the wide spectrum of energy that sunlight blasts onto the red and blue (Like it's kinda hard to figure out what race, age, and sex of victims, of a fire are; if the final result is nothing but cremated remains). The final result may or may not be easy to detect depending on the circumstances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;White&quot; is just how our vision perceives a disorganized jumble of wavelengths.  As pigment molecules break apart, so does the preferential absorption of specific wavelengths.</p>
<p>A &quot;red&quot; object is absorbing more of every other color of light, so that mostly red photons hit our eyes.  The molecule(s) absorbing the green, blue, yellow, violet etc. <del>heat up, they</del> break apart and stop absorbing as much.  The object starts to reflect a little more of everything and whitens.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, a red object is absorbing light of a complementary color, in the case of red it is absorbing light in a region of 500-520 nm (Green). It is not absorbing every other color of light, it is specifically absorbing light in one area and not the others. While there are molecules with multiple absorption regions, these are the minority and most molecules have a single broad absorption region in the visible spectrum. You are suggesting that dyes absorb the entire spectrum except for a small segment which is the color that we see. Since white light contains a broad range of wavelengths, absorbing the green light out light bouncing off the &quot;red&quot; object makes the remaining wavelengths all add together to look red. You can check [here] (<a href="https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/spectrpy/uv-vis/spectrum.htm" target="_blank">https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/spectrpy/uv-vis/spectrum.htm</a>), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment" target="_blank">here</a> or any number of first year textbooks on the subject of UV-VIS absorbance. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Again not really the correct explanation. The molecule loses conjugation and no longer absorbs the wavelengths of light it used to absorb, and so now it reflects all wavelengths of visible light. It still reflects the wavelengths it was never absorbing to the same degree, it just now also reflects the wavelengths it used to absorb.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The bond breaking isn't specifically caused by heat. It's caused by higher frequency photons, like UV light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that double and triple carbon bonds have color while single bonds do not.  Bleach breaks apart these double and triple carbon bonds, turning them into transparent single bond compounds.  So you will see the underlining material which is usually white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color generally comes from long conjugated organic molecules. UV light breaks down or alters the conjugation. If you lose enough conjugation, the molecule will no longer absorb in the visible region and will appear white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but you said any light source would be able to bleach it and that isn’t right.  Only visible light sources that depend on black body radiation necessarily emit in the UV spectrum, which is what you’re going to need to make electronic transitions take place.  </p></div>		</li>
