			<div class="markdown"><p>I did describe resonance and it’s a better way to think of light as it interacts with matter.  If you want to fully quantize the light and treat light as bullets you lose a bunch of the physics in the process.</p>
<p>For the record, my expertise comes from being a graduate student in an AMO and my thesis is on how light propagates through ultra cold atomic vapor created in a magneto-optical trap.  I’m pretty confident that my explanation using resonance is correct but I’m happy to hear counter arguments;  I’m certainly not claiming to fully understand all the details but I’m confident in the broad strokes I’ve illustrated here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a metallic faraday cage for example. As long as the hole size is significantly smaller than wavelength, it will not pass the radiation. Since the effect spans multiple decades of wavelengths, I don’t see how your explanation would apply there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heuristic explanations like this don't actually apply on the quantum level. Electrons and other quantum objects do not have a well-defined position and thus they do not actually &quot;wiggle&quot;. This explanation also fails to account for the fact the size of the absorbing particle in this situation. Particles that are of a comparable size to the wavelength of the incoming radiation will interact. Gamma rays are significantly smaller than a typical atom and end up passing right through. Atomic nuclei are much smaller and do interact with gamma rays, which is why dense nuclear matter (like Lead) are used to shield gamma rays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on which treatment of light you want to use.  You can fully quantize the field and the atoms but it’s messy and non-intuitive.  You can treat it completely classically but then you have to deal with the Ultraviolet Catastrophe somewhere.  The semiclassical explanation (quantized atomic level with continuous fields) is an approximation but it’s significantly more intuitive.  You can go into whatever detail you’d like but the bottom line is that if the light isn’t capable of interacting with the electons and protons in a meaningful way (which I’m using ‘resonance’ to explain) then you end up with some amount of electromagnetic transparency. Yes, matter will always have a small amount of interaction regardless of the situation but that level of detail is better suited to a PhD thesis than an AskReddit explanation.  Take it or leave it I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's basically just using the oscillator approximation, which has an obvious quantum analog. What's the point of objecting to an analogy just because it isn't absolutely perfect? The average position of a particle will wiggle as it absorbs radiation, so I don't think there's anything wrong with that as an analogy.</p></div>		</li>
