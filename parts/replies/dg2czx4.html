			<div class="markdown"><p>OP here. Thank you, this was a great answer. I think I get the gist of it now. There is still one thing that is a bit unclear to me... I get the purpose of the &quot;interactive&quot; particles now, and the basic components and sub components of the atom. Something that is still a bit hazy in my mind is the point of the &quot;very nearly electron&quot; particles like the tau. Reading through some of the other posts I was starting to come to the understanding that they were some sort of free range particle like the photon but reading your post I don't think that is the case. </p>
<p>So for example a hydrogen atom... there's one electron, there are several quarks there making up the proton/nutron nucleus, gluons holding all that together, and various force actors on the atom. I'm following along with that okay. But then where the heck do taus and neutrinos come in?  Are they there inside that hydrogen atom somewhere?</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong><em>RE: muons, taus and neutrinos of all flavours</em></strong></p>
<p>The best way of thinking about muons and taus is as &quot;pretty much the same as an electron, just more massive&quot;. They are so massive, in fact, that when they <em>do</em> appear they are rather unstable and therefore very short lived, decaying very quickly into other things (note: by decaying I don't mean &quot;breaking apart into components&quot; as they have none. Rather, becoming other combinations of fundamental particles through exchanges of interaction particles, usually resulting in just &quot;energy&quot; being left). In many high-energy reactions, such as those that occur between massive charged particles from the sun (and the rest of space) and the top of our atmosphere, you can sometimes get a muon or a tau as a by-product of the reaction where, at lower energies, you'd get an electron. Otherwise, they don't really exist normally in our &quot;stuff&quot;, although theoretically you could replace the electrons in an atom with corresponding muons or taus and things wouldn't be <em>drastically</em> different (OK, chemistry as we know it would probably change, but the physics of the system would be fairly the same). </p>
<p>Neutrinos are similar, but even more niche. They are extremely light particles (even when compared to quarks) and they don't really interact a lot with other stuff when they do exist. Again, they mainly appear as by-products of high energy nuclear reactions (nuclear in the sense of particle physics, not necessarily reactions involving the atomic nucleus). Because, at the highest level, energy is always conserved, whenever you have a nuclear reaction (fundamental particles interacting with each other, becoming composite particles, breaking apart, crashing with each other, changing to become another particle, etc), a lot of the individual parameters of the particles before the reaction must be the same afterwards. Neutrinos are very good at helping balance these reaction &quot;equations&quot; to ensure everything is properly conserved, especially in high energy collisions, and therefore that's where they mostly come from. They don't really &quot;do&quot; much on their own that we know of, but detecting them (which is not exactly trivial) helps us determine what kind of event happened to produce them. <del>For example, (if I'm not misremembering), we know that muons and taus are formed in the upper atmosphere because we can detect the neutrinos that are produced when they decay.</del> I missremembered. Please see the reply below mine for a better idea of what we actually use neutrinos for. </p>
<p>I hope this answered your question. </p>
<p>EDIT: credit to /u/nottherealslash for reminding me of something I wanted to include in this reply. As they say, it's only really protons and neutrons (up and down quarks) and electrons which are stable enough to form &quot;stuff&quot;. Everything else really only appears in extremely high energy collisions for very short times (well, neutrinos stick around for a decent amount of time, but they kind of just whizz around and don't really make &quot;stuff&quot;), decaying very fast into more stable particles and energy.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually are able to detect Muons from the atmosphere since their half-life, combined with some relativistic effects, is just long enough for it to reach the earth (but not really enter that deep into the crust). This is why a lot of high sensitivity detectors are deep below the Earth's surface: they want to avoid these large-ish particles from interacting with their detector. So neutrinos aren't really used all that much to detect muon decays (maybe Tau decays, I don't remember all that well off the top of my head). Neutrinos are more widely used to detect supernovae, since the neutrinos move very nearly the speed of light on account of their lightness. If a neutrino detector goes off, the astronomers know to look for a recent supernova in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't normally find muons and taus, or charm and down quarks around for very long.  They are essentially heavy versions of the lighter particles, and they are allowed to decay to the lighter products by various different channels. For example, a muon will decay to an electron (preserving the charge) and a muon neutrino (preserving the muon-ness), and the mass will be carried away as kinetic energy.  All of this happens in about 1/200th of a second.  As a result, you need high energy events to create and study these particles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some follow up questions if you don't mind:</p>
<p>1) I don't understand force carriers very well.  For example I understand what you mean about EM giving rise to being able to &quot;touch&quot; things at a macro level, because of repulsive forces between atoms of one's hand and an object for example. (is that right?)</p>
<p>But then you go on to say EM is mediated by photons.  I also get how photons are EM energy in a sense (or excitations of the EM field, but fields confuse me).  But where are the photons when touching an object for example?  Or, if gravity is mediated by Higgs, shouldn't there be Higgs particles     flying back and forth between me and the ground constantly?  Yet they are extremely difficult to produce/detect.</p>
<p>2) is there an inverse relationship between force strength and distance at which they operate?  It seems to me as a layman that strong is, well, strong but short distance, EM in the middle and gravity very weak but operates at galactic distances.  The weak force obviously spoils the trend but maybe it's super strong at even shorter distances than the strong force? If there are any shorter distances!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heya!  No I don't mind at all.</p>
<p>I'll preface my answer by stating that fields confuse me too, which is why I was more &quot;handwavy&quot; about them (and also the reason why particle physics fascinates me at a superficial level, but not enough to properly study it - it's a chore and I'm much happier sticking with plain atoms).</p>
<p>The simplest (although, again, incomplete) way of thinking about force carriers is that sometimes they are &quot;real&quot; and sometimes they are &quot;virtual&quot;. </p>
<p>They are &quot;real&quot; when they are the product of a reaction and shoot away and you can detect them. Like the photons we can see. Or the W^+ bosons you can &quot;detect&quot; at the LHC.
However, when two particles interact with each other, sometimes they might &quot;exchange&quot; one of these &quot;virtual&quot; particles. Which basically means that the force carrier appears in the &quot;equation&quot; of the reaction, balances it out but then disappears again - absorbed back or converted into energy; and these we can't exactly detect.</p>
<p>In the example of your fingers touching things, you might say that the electrons in the atoms of your fingers are repulsing the electrons in the atoms of the stuff. What is meant by &quot;repulsing&quot; though? What is this &quot;repulsive force&quot;? You can interpret it as the electrons &quot;exchanging a virtual photon&quot;. Of course, the more correct way is to consider that the electron field (or strong field, or weak field, or whatever) is being excited when the two particles interact between each other, and this excitation is what we call a photon (or gluon or weak boson) - but fields are confusing and I my understanding of them is not good enough to explain them properly.</p>
<p>Also, gravity really spoils the picture (the force carrier for gravitation is the graviton, not the Higgs Boson btw!). Yes, you'd expect gravity to work the same as the others and for gravitons to be flying back and forth, but there's no hard evidence for gravitons so far. Also, how come gravity is only attractive, but all the others can attract <strong>and</strong> repel? These are big issues the Standard Model does not currently address.</p>
<p>As for question 2, it is as you say. There does seem to be a correlation... the strong force is the strongest but only at very small scales, whereas gravity is billions of times weaker but it's effects can be felt pretty much across the universe. We are pretty sure that the strong force is the strongest though, because it completely dominates on the scale of quarks in a nucleus. While there are theoretically shorter differences (the Planck length is the smallest scale, I think?), practically there is not much sense in talking about distances smaller than the smallest things we know about, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity and EM both follow an inverse-square relationship, with the force between masses or charges being proportional to 1/r^2 where R is the distance between them. Large bodies like planets and stars typically have a lot of mass and not a lot of charge, which is why you think of gravity at galactic distances even though EM follows the same relationship.</p>
<p>The strong force between particles as they approach (say protons or neutrons) rises from essentially nothing to strongly repulsive, but if they're forced closer still it becomes strongly attractive. This is why nuclei are hard to fuse but tend to hang around once they're put together.</p>
<p>The weak force is confusing as shit and it's been too long since I studied physics, but it's involved in decay and fission so explains why nuclei don't <em>always</em> hang around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>quarks cannot exist on their own, so they group together in two's (mesons) or three's (baryons) (and theoretical groups of five)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LHCb at CERN's LHC clearly found groups of 4 (meson-like) and 5 (baryon-like). Not theoretical any more.</p></div>		</li>
