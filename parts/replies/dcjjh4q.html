<p>experiment and better understand DNA </p>

<p>Do you mean better understand the mutation processes, or better understand chemistry of DNA? Answer to both is yes, we can use synthetic cell systems for both.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of work done on the origin of Darwinian evolution in protocells (that's what we call synthetic cells when we make them to study the origin of life). The simplicity of protocells allows us to study how mutations came to be, what mutation rates are best fo efficient evolution, and also it gives insights into why do we have this particular genetic system (both &quot;why this sugar&quot; as well as &quot;why this nucleobase set&quot;).</p>

<p>make cells that can perform chemical functions that no known life forms do today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's one of the main goals of my own work, and a very rapidly developing field.</p>
<p>For example, recently there was an amazing paper showing how you can make combinatorial biochemistry, effectively a molecular assembly line, in cell-free protein expression system (not a whole synthetic cell yet, but still amazing): <a href="http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31246-6" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>We have recently shown how you can use synthetic cells as little programmable bioreactors: <a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nchem.2644.html" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>There's a lot of interest in this kind of applications from biotechnology, especially metabolic engineering field. </p>

<p>Do you plan to use &quot;Natural&quot; selection (albiet in an artificial environment) to allow &quot;nature&quot; to fine tune cells you create?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. As soon as we make a synthetic cell that can actually evolve, like spontaneously divide, we will try to apply quasi-natural evolution strategies. We've done some of it already, for example mimicking natural selection (link)[<a href="http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v5/n6/full/nchem.1650.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v5/n6/full/nchem.1650.html</a>]</p></div>		</li>
