			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, my question was &quot;this happens to people?&quot; As I was reading this thread, so no, I've never really experience headrushes, or hearing loss when getting up. Maybe occasionally a rush when getting up from laying down, but nothing barely notable, and definitely not when standing up from the toilet... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah- heart specialists couldn’t find anything. Even with her being wired up to a monitor for three days. ( her faints are almost daily even with her medication)</p>
