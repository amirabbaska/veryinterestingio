			<div class="markdown"><p>I have worked with a lot of children with various forms of autism, worked on it in mice, and read a lot about it. I've never heard of an actual patient who could instantaneously recognize the exact number of many objects as is depicted in rain man. Kim Peek, the person who the movie is based on, had an incredible, almost unbelievable memory alongside his autistic features. But as far as I know he had no such  instant counting ability.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that rain man and Kim peek are very atypical types of autism. The vast majority of children and adults with the disorder do not exhibit any savant traits. Some of these kids do have a fascination with numbers and counting, and are very good at keeping track of many different quantities in their heads. But I do not think that I've ever heard of a case of someone who could consistently count toothpicks or anything like that as depicted in the film. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks for this information. I figured it was somewhat dramatized for the movie, but I wasn't sure which parts. I think a few other people on this thread have mentioned that in a documentary about autism some of the individuals depicted are incredibly fast counters, so perhaps it's even more rare than we think. </p></div>		</li>
