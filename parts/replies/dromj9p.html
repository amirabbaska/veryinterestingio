			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. It serves as the basis for self esteem, we have to believe we are more important than the reality of what we really are in order to survive and thrive. The reality is we’re alone, weak animals and ultimately die in a apathetic universe. But you can’t actually internalize that as it’s not evolutionarily conductive to survival. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or subconsciously block out. I’ve heard evidence to support that people who are depressed tend to notice/latch onto negative things that others simply don’t notice (very small tendencies/body language/ facial expressions, etc). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We see what we want to see. When I'm not depressed, I see people's good points and recognize my own more quickly than I do when I'm depressed. When I'm in a deep rut, criticism of others and myself comes to mind more easily. Situations that make me uncomfortable or sad have more impact and linger longer than happy ones.</p>
<p>I think there's truth in both ways of seeing the world, but I think sometimes there's a little more truth in pessimism than optimism. What do I know, though? I'm depressed.</p></div>		</li>
