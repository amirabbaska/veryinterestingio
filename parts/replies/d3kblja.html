			<p>We know of some ongoing work using our data. And it is certainly inspiring! Using these data is not easy we are really glad to see that it is possible.<br><br>With the new release including the accompanying simulated data (which is essential for many physics studies) we expect even more interest. However, we know that doing analysis and understanding all details takes time so we are not surprised to see many results yet.<br><br>There is also quite a big interest from machine learning community and for these data, as well as for using it to improve statistical methods.<br><br>(klp)</p>		</li>

			<p>Can you elaborate on what aspects of machine learning this would be helpful for or do you know?</p>		</li>

			<p>I can speak for how this can help machine learning methods in data acquisition. Basically the whole process of data acquisition comes down to knowing which data you should keep and what to throw away (and usually you throw almost all of it away), so essentially it's a plain old classification problem. This is generally done by reconstructing an event and looking for specific properties that make it interesting, e.g. missing energy. ML methods can replace that step to an extent by basically showing them a bunch of events you have already classified as interesting and letting them figure out what kind of features they should be looking for.<br><br>Large training datasets such as this can be used for evaluating &amp; calibrating generic ML algorithms that can be applied as classifiers in other data acquisition problems. It's a bit of a heavy-handed approach for things like physics research, but it can benefit areas like industrial control systems that deal with large amounts of captured data and care more about e.g. predicting defects than actually analyzing and understanding the exact physical process that causes them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hey that's excellent. I really appreciate your tying this into a practical example like industrial control systems because I can really get my head around how that would be useful to an operation at scale.</p>		</li>

			<p>There was a competition with LHC data on kaggle.com recently. In the forums you should be able to find some info.</p>		</li>
