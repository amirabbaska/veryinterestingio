			<div class="markdown"><p>To tack onto this the dogs often times, if they are with their owners long enough, will get used to the same patterns and rhythm of the day as well. I worked with a blind guy for two years and his old dog knew when it was time to get up before heading home, autopiloted him to a loading dock where his bus picked him up and even knew when he would go to a local carryout every few days. </p>
<p>He let me take her on a walk once to see what it was like and she knew exactly where to go and where to cross to get to that carry out. Dogs are like people. They get into routines and habits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who is blind. When she first gets a new dog, the trainer works with her and the dog for weeks, going over and over her usual routes, before ever turning the dog over to her alone. They do the walk to the corner store, walk to work, taking the bus to the grocery store or a restaurant, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of time is put in to training the animals and making sure they are safe and know what's expected of them. (edit: not just in general, but to that person's specific needs.) (and the trainer is always a phone call away, if a it seems like a dog might need a bit more reinforcement, or if a route to a new location is needed. This is the original Guide dogs for the blind organization)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a completly blind guy who works in the next city and takes the bus, the train, a tram and walks 2 kilometers to work everyday without a dog or anything. I'm always amazed how he never gets lost but he once told me. He explained that he has a kind of minimap in his mind of the places he has been. When he takes a new route he usually crosses into a route he does know and it helps him to connect the pieces of the map.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Met a blind guy while sling volunteer work. He was part of our project team. One of the other members dropped us off to a train station, and since him and I take a common route we decided to travel together. I was new to the station, so he grabbed my elbow and guided me through the entire thing right up to the platform. When we got to the other station, we walked out and went up the stairs where he kept clicking and using echolocation to find his way around. It was pretty cool to be honest. The guy was born blind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know that phrase, &quot;the blind leading the blind&quot;? Actually goes back to the Bible â€” the idea that a blind person will lead another blind person into a pit. </p>
<p>When I lived in Berkeley I saw a blind person showing another blind person how to navigate the complicated intersections downtown. And I thought, &quot;hey, it's the blind leading the blind! Which... actually makes a lot of sense. Because what the hell does a sighted-person know about getting around this intersection while blind? I bet another blind person who knows how to do it has way better things to say about that.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
