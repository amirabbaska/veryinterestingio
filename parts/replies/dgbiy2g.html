We aren't born knowing healthy grass is green, we learn things by trial and error and then form opinions based on those experiences. You might like purple because your mom does, but that's because you have good associations and memories of your mom. Not because either one of you genetically likes the color purple. It's all about environment. </p></div>		</li>
