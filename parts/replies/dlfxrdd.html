			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. One of the chemicals used in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1unayl/how_do_topical_pain_relieving_creams_work_ie/cek5bwy/" target="_blank">topical creams is capsaicin</a>, which comes from red peppers. Apparently it works by depleting your nerves supply of neurotransmitters that let it signal pain. I've used red peppers before for this by cutting them and rubbing them on my forehead.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capsaicin relieves pain by depleting your nerves’ supply of substance P, the “bad pain” neurotransmitter. Physicians classify pain as “good pain” or “bad pain”. Although you might find it hard to admit that any pain could is “good,” in fact, the short-term (acute) pain that you feel when you accidentally rest your fingers on a hot stove instructs you to jerk your hand away before it is burnt to a crisp, so it is good. “Bad pain” is long-term (chronic) pain, and is mediated by a different neurotransmitter than the one that signals good pain. Nerves that send good pain signals are fast, but nerves that send bad pain signals are slow, and they generate chronic, long-term pain. The bad pain neurotransmitter is called substance P (the “P”, of course, stands for pain). Capsaicin causes your bad pain nerves to deliver off their substance P to other pain nerves up leading to the brain in a big way. The bad pain nerves lose so much substance P all at once that they are depleted of this molecule, and are unable to release any more. Initially pain is felt, but after the substance P supply is dumped, the nerves are no longer able to send a pain signal to the brain, because they are all out of substance P, and don’t have time to make any more.  </p>
