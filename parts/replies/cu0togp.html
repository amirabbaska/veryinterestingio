			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a good Modern Marvels episode (Hot and Spicy) that goes into all this info and shows what goes on in the mouth when eating wasabi and how its different than eating peppers. I'll see if I can find it because the visuals definitely help explain it and make it more ELI5y.</p>
<p>Edit: No official links, but you can amazon watch it. Or you could pirate it but maybe you'd want to support history channel on this one because it is factual and interesting? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. It means friendly, simplified and <strong>layman-accessible</strong> explanations. I don't know about you, but usually I don't go around discussing allyl isothiocyanate,  lachrymators and sulfhydryl functional groups in enzymes.</p></div>		</li>
