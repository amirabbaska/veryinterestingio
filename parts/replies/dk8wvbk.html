			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the itching is caused by the anticoagulant protein itself, but yes technically you're correct about the swelling. At the site of the bite, your body releases histamines as an immune response to the foreign proteins and other nasties left by mosquito saliva. Histamines are an essential part of the local immune response, because they command nearby blood vessels to dilate, increasing their permeability for white blood cells, and supplying extra resources to combat the invasion. This increased blood flow at the site of injection is what results in the visible swelling and redness of a mosquito bite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the cause this, though I certainly know it to be true. I don't think it is a placebo effect. If I had to guess, I'd say that it's caused by a spreading of the anticoagulant protein in the area. When your immune response occurs, the bite region inevitably swells. Consequently, this swollen area increases the volume of fluid that the remaining proteins are suspended in. When you scratch the inflamed area, you essentially compress the fluid, causing it to permeate outward and spread the itch inducing protein outside of the immune system's current area of operation. </p>
<p>Just an educated hunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea these existed, but it makes sense in theory. Proteins are folded chains of amino acids, who's validity depends on its configuration. Every protein has a range of specific conditions (temperature, pH, charge gradients, ect.) that are required in order to maintain an effective configuration. Changing these conditions will, in theory, denature (disconfigure) the protein, rendering it ineffective. I assume the piezoelectric device instigates a charge differential across the protein causing it to be denatured, but I could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never used one myself but apparently it helps and makes them feel less itchy. Oh okay interesting I didn't realise proteins could get denatured by electricity. </p></div>		</li>
