			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno. I bought a Pirates of the Caribbean knock-off Black Pearl to see about the quality at 1/10 the Lego price. Quality is great, instructions were good but all parts were mixed in the bags. 8/10 would buy again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they actually called it a &quot;Pirates of the Carribean&quot; set (instead of, say, &quot;Sea Pirates&quot;) it is infringing on Lego's and Disney's intellectual property rights.  Of course, depending on where you got it, they may not be able to do much about it.  The people behind a Chinese-based website would likely yawn at an angry letter from Lego's lawyers.  An American discount store, on the other hand, would likely comply with a court injunction.</p>
<p>As for quality, some knockoffs have gotten a lot better.  I saw a CNBC show about counterfeit goods made in China, and in some cases the bootlegs are made in the same factories contracted to make the genuine goods!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mega Bloks does its own original work, though. I think OP is talking more about companies like Lepin who literally copy everything LEGO does, right down to the <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4323/35844946770_66621fe539_z.jpg" target="_blank">logo and the box art</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here si the big problem for something like a licensed lego set being sold by someone like lepin:<br />
If things really went bad for Lepin with the sets as they are, they could always just sell the sets without any pictures or insxtructions and at that point it is very questionable wether anyone would be able to stop them from selling a sorted mix of stones to build custom sets and as all lego instructions are freely available anyway no one can stop you from then downloading and building a set with those instructions and the fake stones.<br />
That however is mostly a solution that would work for europe and the U.S. and it would probably be nearly impossible from stopping Lepin from doing something like that here.
Lepin sets are however mostly meant for asian markets as a direct competitor to lego and in those regions the rights are usually not handled with the same scrutiny as they are here and lego will probably not be able to sell their sets at those markets much anyway.</p></div>		</li>
