			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a lot more complex than the serotonin hypothesis would indicate. There are people with high levels of serotonin who are depressed. There are people with low levels of serotonin that are not depressed. There are lots of other things that affect depression. The body system isn’t so simple that merrily raising serotonin levels would equal a one to one impact on Depression. I see that auto correct for merrily and I’m just gonna leave it because this is a post about depression and that makes me happy. Voice texting is so awesome LOL not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serotonin levels affecting depression is inconsistent*</p>
<p>They've measured serotonin levels in living depressed people and found lower, around the same, and higher serotonin. They did this post-mortem in <del>autopsies</del> suicide &quot;victims&quot; and found the same inconsistency</p>
<p>edit: never clarified it was from suicide, obviously it was from an autopsy -.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally think that in time we will come to recognize depression not as a disease but as a symptom, in the same way as, say, high blood pressure, or as a complex of related diseases like diabetes.</p>
<p>It's basically the only way to explain why some depression is helped by SSRIs, some isn't but does respond to tri-cyclics, other people with depression are helped greatly by lifestyle changes but for others that does nothing, for some people single-dose treatment with dissociative anaesthetics has a huge impact, for other people only ECT works, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a dumb question but couldn't you test this with a (admittedly oversimplified) study where you just give people serotonin and ask if they're more or less depressed and give serotonin blockers to another group and ask the same?  Add in appropriate controls of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly how SSRIs are tested for effectiveness in clinical trials. It does not help explain, though, what is going on in the brain to affect the depression. It just shows whether it helps. </p>
<p>We essentially do not understand the mechanisms of how depression happens within the cellular and chemical structure of the brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can certainly give people serotonin, which will give them diarrhea without any effect on the brain. Turns out a lot of neurotransmitters can't go from blood to brain. This allows them to work double duty, controlling body functions independent of what they do in the brain. An alternative is to give the substance that's one step short of being serotonin and can get converted,  but it doesn't last very long. </p>
<p>&quot;Serotonin blocker&quot; is less meaningful than you'd think. There are a number out subtypes of serotonin receptors which do different things in different places, sometimes interacting with other neurotransmitter systems. Blocking the 5HT2A serotonin receptor actually has some antidepressant potential. Blocking the 5HT3 receptor... helps with nausea, especially in chemo.</p>
<p>What has been done is to prevent serotonin synthesis. These studies have been inconsistent, but it can definitely reverse the effect of antidepressants which work on serotonin, can likely lower mood significantly in at least some people with a history of major depression, and maybe mildly lower mood in other people. It's still not a clean technique and may affect other stuff. </p></div>		</li>
