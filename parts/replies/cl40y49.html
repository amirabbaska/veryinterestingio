			<div class="markdown"><p>Today's programmers completely could do that. But they have other priorities, because it really doesn't matter for the use cases that people care about.</p>
<p>I can make my program smaller -- or I can implement three new features a customer wanted. Or I can make it compatible with more devices. Or I can make it look prettier.</p>
<p>My favorite saying about software development is &quot;Software is never released -- it escapes.&quot; There is no hard, functional limit to how much you can keep improving the code for any reasonably complex bit of software. But who is going to pay you to do that? At some point you have to ship it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, it doesn't matter if what you are writing makes this particular video card run 50% faster if someone else beats you to the market with a viable driver making the people paying you lose interest because it's already out there making them see their profit returns go down due to something already doing what you are coding it to do in the market.</p>
<p>Making small, lean code is a luxury not seen in <em>most</em> software development industries. Get something that works and does x, y, and z. Oh you could make x go twice as fast and get rid of the need for y? Both routes will get the job done except one taking up way more time and money out of the company trying to profit off your code. And there is <em>always</em> something more you can do to your code to make it smaller, faster, more efficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a software and firmware engineer who also makes &quot;games&quot; for fun I can confirm that while your numbers are made up the point you're making is correct. Most game development today uses pre-built code libraries that are like an all-in-one solution so very few games use all that it has to offer and the rest is just bloat.</p></div>		</li>
