			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, another bad physicist here. Photons are an oscillation between electric and magnetic field due to relativity. </p>
<p>Since relativity dictates that the speed of light doesn't get added to the speed of an observer, geometrically you can ask what a person traveling on a train near the speed of light would see compared to a stationary observer. Essentially, c being fixed means d and/or t is what's changing. Length contraction describes the matter actually compressing along the axis of travel as it approaches the speed of light to respect this rule. </p>
<p>So consider an electron traveling through a wire. A normal wire would have an equivalent balance of protons and electrons right? And with moving electric current, this is still true. However, due to length contraction, a stationary obeserver (or charged particles) looking radially at the wire would see a cross section of stationary protons and <em>relativistically length contracted</em> electrons. <strong>This means there is less effective electron per proton only at right angles to the flow of current.</strong> the particle would see an electric force according to the right hand rule. </p>
<p>Aha! That's what a magnetic field is. It's the relativistic effect of the motion in the electric field. So fast moving electric field disturbances length contract and create &quot;magnetic&quot; fields. And a moving magnet drives electric current. Which then can also length contract and cause electric fields. So a photon is like a spring-mass system which bounces from storing all its energy in electric vector to unwinding that energy in the magnetic vector. This chain reaction is the electromagnetic wave. Think of it like a superconducting solenoid - an electromagnet pulling on an a magnetized bar so hard that the bar overshoots and the moving magnet induces an electric current in the wire which powers the electromagnet to pull on the magnetized bar again. It just occilates like this. </p>
<p>So... Take this intuition and apply it to a photon traveling in a space which resist changes in electric field. Just like an electromagnet falling through a copper pipe, we'd expect this oscillating electromagnet to slow down. The permittivity of that space is lower because changes in the electric field are inducing currents in electrons instead of creating the magnetic portion of the wave. They spend some ricocheting around the complex interactions of the atoms as a phonon before returning to the electromagnetic wave fully. Moving electrons in their orbitals do have a chance of emitting a photon of the same wavelength. And the fact that the overall direction of induction favors the existing direction of travel of the photon wavefront, means the light stays traveling the way it came in. So in some ways it's absorbed and in some ways it's just complexed up. </p>
<p>Think about the fact that you can neatly arrange all the polarization in a material with an electric field. It makes sense that polarizing a material will increase its permittivity to an electromagnetic wave and increase the speed of light inside that material. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know how to eli5 this, but the speed of light is not constant. It depends on Permittivity, Permeability of the medium. Basically, how easy electric and magnetic field 'travel' through the medium. equation 9</p>

<p>Important note: c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is a constant. Light does not always travel at c.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, that's exactly what I mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, was just making it clearer as c is normally called the speed of light, even though that technically isn't true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have exactly the same qualification as yourself; a physics degree I didn't quite pay attention to... </p>
<p>Anyway we were talking in a tutorial about permittivity etc. I asked if the reason for the apparent slow down was due to an interaction with the glass or water molecules, ie the light is being constantly absorbed and re-emitted thus causing a slight delay. I felt like a big part of physics I'd never quite got was finally falling into place. Light can't slow down, relativity says it absolutely cannot change speed. But then it goes into glass and, well... So finally, a chance that my world might make sense again... </p>
<p>Is it Doc?  Is that the reason?</p>
<p>The doc said, 'ah no. Not really.' and then moved on. </p>
<p>I haven't been able to physics since. </p></div>		</li>
