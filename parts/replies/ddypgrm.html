			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the light from the sun isn't all absorbed or reflected at the surface, it can penetrate to a certain depth. Water can also mix vertically. So you're dealing with a much thicker layer that heats and cools seasonally. On land, it's really only a few meters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>86F = 30C</p>
<p>Quick tip:
82F is approximately 28C.
61F is approximately 16C.
40F is approximately [0] 4C.
32F=0C.
-40F = -40C.
You can use 2F for every 1C around these equivalences and be pretty close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem there is that for several reasons, including relative specific heat and currents, land heats up faster than water. This is actually what causes beaches to be windy - in the morning the air over the land heats up faster than the air over the ocean, causing the air over the land to rise and the air over the ocean to blow inland to take its place. In the evening the reverse is true, with the ocean and the air above it maintaining their heat more effectively than that over land. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The term &quot;ocean desert&quot; is also used by oceanographers to refer to large regions with little primary production. Phytoplankton don't grow in these regions because there is not enough of some limiting nutrient (often nitrogen but could also be iron for example). These ocean deserts are found in the centers of the major ocean gyres where the surface water is disconnected from the major nutrient sources: the continents and the deep ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment could be taken to mean that these gyres occur in shallow ocean where there is no &quot;deep&quot; ocean connected to it, but the detail is that productivity in these regions is tied to upwelling, which only specific parts of the ocean do and usually due to geophysical circumstance. In most places, the photic zone (where photosynthesis can take place) does not have any method of nutrient exchange with the deep ocean below and relies upon external fertilisation to generate primary productivity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's really no reason to do that when you have the entire Sahara just begging to be Solarified. The big problem with sea-borne arrays is salt, and surf. Maintaining a floating solar array would be monumentally costly. </p>
<p>The reason the Sahara isn't already littered with arrays is twofold. First, we haven't quite figured out good ways to transport energy long distances, making supplying say, Italy, with solar energy from the Sahara unfeasible with our current technology. Second, the nation-states with the best places for arrays are poor, unstable, and crippled by corruption. Of course, there are some sizable arrays in the Sahara. Morocco in particular has constructed a few impressive ones. </p>
<p>In the future, it wouldn't surprise me if large-scale Saharan arrays were competitors with large orbital arrays. </p></div>		</li>
