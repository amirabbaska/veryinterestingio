Asking for a book -- one of my characters has a little device around his larynx to enhance his mimicry talents, but it breaks and keeps him from speaking at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's a one way system. You can still think about moving your arm when it's paralysed, this is the same deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't fully understand this process as far as I know. It's most likely just different neural circuits firing, but that's a vague and kind of obvious answer.</p>
<p>I can tell you that the basal ganglia &quot;gates&quot; all motor commands. Basically, your brain says &quot;do this motor action&quot; in the motor cortex, and the signal travels through the BG where your brain says &quot;you sure you wanna do that?&quot; </p>
<p>This region may or may not be involved in the process you're asking about, but that's all the info I have off the top of my head. I study the spinal cord mostly, so this isn't a question I have to worry about :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've two thing a bit related. I think I've read about this as the 'veto' function. Your brain 'chooses' to 'want' something to happen subconsciously but you can veto them. Is this for all functions?</p>
<p>Secondly, quite some things are done by the central nervous system. Like breathing and walking. I can actively breath and take a step and and an other one. Is the brain needed for walking and/or breathing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you describe it, I wonder if there's a link between that &quot;gate&quot; mechanism and impulsivity. Would someone who's ponderous have a differently-developed mechanism to someone who's impulsive, or highly trained to react physically?</p>
<p>For example, people sometimes talk about how they didn't think to react - the training just kicked in, which makes it seem like less of a &quot;decision-making&quot; thing (frontal lobe, I think?) and more of unhindered movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it’s basal ganglia. It gates at many different levels. So it’s likely that the subvocalization is gating at the higher levels, and not the lowest motor levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they’re entirely seperate. The signals when you <em>think</em> about your arms moving are not the same signals as moving your arms. It’s not like you’re opening a valve on your spinal cord and just allowing the signal to flow through. This is really easy to prove because you can move your arm <em>while</em> thinking about moving your arm a different way. If they were the same type of signal you couldn’t do this because they would conflict. I can also <em>think</em> about doing things that my body can’t actually do. I could think about my body doing Olympic gymnastics but if I actually tried it I couldn’t do it. </p>
<p>Consider what it means in the brain to think something as opposed to doing it. When you think about moving your arm you think about it moving left and right and up and down and bending and picking stuff up, stuff like that. But that’s not what your brain is sending to your arm when you actually do that thing. Your brain is sending specific messages about which muscel groups to move to make your arm do what you want. So “move arm left” is how you think about moving your arm but your arm can’t do anything with that kind of info. Translating that into actual muscle movements happens almost entirely in the brain.</p>
<p>You could argue that the first step to actually moving your arm is thinking about moving it, but my example early showed why that doesn’t make sense. You can obviously control your muscles subconsciously (you don’t really have to think about walking) and even if you are conscious of what you’re doing you are never conscious of that actual translation to muscles movement. So if they’re separate your brain doesn’t have to figure out which is which because they don’t mix. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... There's a couple of things here. There are 2 (at least) levels of motor control. One is the conscious level, the one where we are thinking of the movement. This involves the cerebral cortex, the conscious, information processing part of the brain (for want of a better generic description). Most examples where this is the dominant factor is in learning a new skill, rather than  doing things you already know. Think about learning how to touch type. For a long time, you seriously need to think about it, and watch your fingers, etc. In this situation you probably <em>couldn't</em> imagine typing in another way while successfully typing in real life.</p>
<p>Once you have learned to touch type, the skill has become learned as a motor program in the cerebellum. This is an area of the brain that relays motor information <em>without</em> requiring conscious control. It is more efficient and faster. At this stage, your cerebral cortex does not need to concern itself with the details of where your fingers are, and so is free to think about other things, including imagining typing backwards or whatever. </p>
<p>Fun corollary (note: personal conclusions here rather than strict textbook stuff) is that this explains the terrible valley where you seem to get worse and worse initially learning a skill - first time, you just recruit some other motor program which may work OK. Then as you try and improve, you lose the efficiency of the cerebellum by taking over with cortical, conscious control - which is terrible at that. Then as you build a new motor program specifically for the activity, you can improve again. Further to that, it's also why thinking about really basic skills or actions totally messes your ability to actually do them, and why one of the biggest elements of sport is not concentrating on the movement itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. I have been curious for the longest time - to what extent or how much time per day/what situations do people generally consciously think (words)? As in, what is a normal amount of time spent doing this vs just doing things without thinking about them in a sense of a conversation in your head? I feel like this is still within the spirit of OP's question.</p></div>		</li>
