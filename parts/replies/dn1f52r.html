			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you SO much for introducing me to Naive Realism. I've been trying to call myself out on my confirmation biases and I think it's helped me see where I'm wrong in my thoughts and arguments. Im going to look up Naive Realism and see if I can sort myself out a bit on that front too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty eye opening concept.  You should give &quot;The Righteous Mind&quot; by Jonathan Haidt a read.  Lighter reading than scientific text, but everything he says is backed up by research.  There's an excellent metaphor he uses with a rider and an elephant.  Basically the short version is that our thoughtful reasoning part of our brain (the rider) makes decisions, and then the gut instinct part (the elephant) follows along with our justifications.  Haidt essentially argues that in the vast majority of the cases, our gut instincts and immediate preferences guide our decision, with our thoughtful justifications coming after the fact.  We just fool ourselves into thinking that we made our choice by reasoning it out, but the elephant is actually steering the whole time.  He explains it better than I do though, check it out!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that what he means by the words &quot;post hoc reasoning&quot;? [the rider/elephant <em>is</em> post hoc reasoning]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get those places whatsoever.  I mean, sure, if one wants an echo chamber to metaphorically masturbate, that's one thing.  But IMO one has to consistently test and revise one's views given that humans are wrong so, so much.  And it's so hard to understand a view that's different from yours, when those holding the views deign you're stupid or irrational, and won't even try to have a conversation with you.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not always true. I generally like r/socialism (sometimes, some people on there can be a bit <em>harsh</em>) but the mods tend to block people who aren't socialist and aren't looking to learn about socialism. It's not about masturbating into an echo chamber it's for two reasons: </p>
<p>1) Trolling is a huge problem on such a controversial sub
2) There are dedicated discussion/debate subs, we don't want to get into an argument every 10 seconds. It's a sub about socialist news primarily and discussion on that, we also help non-socialists to learn about us and understand what its all about and remove the stereotypes . </p></div>		</li>

But the continue to let differing viewpoints exist as long as they aren't ad hominems.  They continue to let every other god damn fallacy run rampant though.</p></div>		</li>
