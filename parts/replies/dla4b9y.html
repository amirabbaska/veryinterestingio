			<div class="markdown"><p>Your question doesn't make much sense to me:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not necessary that directional antennas have higher ERP</li>
<li>Higher ERP does not necessarily mean better SNR at a receiver site</li>
<li>I'm not aware of any commercial quasi-hemispherical antennas - last I knew (late 2016) they were still an R&amp;D subject - but if you would point one out I could look into it</li>
<li>Using directional antennas makes sense when they operate with line-of-sight, hence no physical interference, hence no multipath propagation</li>
<li>ERP is a characteristic of the transmitter/antenna, while multipath propagation a feature of the environment - thus they're not directly correlated</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you clarify exactly what you're asking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the pre-cable days, HBO was distributed over a microwave link, and some of us built our own receivers. The usual receiving antenna was a coffee can with a stub feed attached to a low-noise amp stage that was powered through the coax from a freq converter on the TV set; the feed was pointed into a reflector made from a dish-shaped aluminum snow sled.</p>
<p>First thing I saw when I turned it on was Bo Derek, stark nekkid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here to confirm that a beans can works well. I go to from 65% to 83% signal when replacing one of the three antennae with such a can. I recommend baked beans with bacon, for added enjoyment while you build the antenna. </p>
<p>I have two floors, a couch, some of a kitchen, and a bunch of metal and electronics between my card and the router.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beamforming can be applied in addition to a waveguide. The process of beamforming can be thought of as finding the distribution of power to the antenna which results in the best possible data rate. Hence, the addition of a waveguide (which physically concentrates the signal) will not remove the ability perform this optimization. Instead, it will restrict the gain from it.</p></div>		</li>
