			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflation has NOT been 3% for a while. The investor class would freak the fuck out if it was. The FED has an official target of 2% inflation, and we were below that until very recently.</p>
<p>If you make your money based on interest rates, inflation is the only thing that cuts into that. That is why the investor class has taught us that inflation is always bad. In reality, if you carry debt, inflation is good for you, because your debt  cost is fixed and inflation reduces the nominal price of that debt.</p>
<p>Here is an official inflation table by month:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Public or private, the company is there to make money for the owners of the company. The only difference is that in a publicly owned company, a lot of people own the company, and anyone can buy or sell shares of ownership. In a privately owned company, the shares of the company are still owned by someone, they just can't buy and sell that ownership in a stock market. The other big difference is that public companies generally need to keep their books more open than private companies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly where it's at. The answer to OP's question isn't about the absolute quantity, but a simple competition between vendors. In public companies, most shareholders are basically just a different form of customer (leave the accounting view aside for a sec- from a purely economic perspective). If said customer is presented with a number of different products to purchase, each of them possessing a different value in their eyes, and assuming there's little to no penalty for switching between them- one would assume they would purchase the product that would maximize their utility. While a 3% decrease in earnings may not be a lot relative to how much the company's still worth, it could mean that its stock is less attractive to a potential buyer now as it provides a lesser utility. This would make it less competitive, and in the world we're in it could definitely signify the death spiral described above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question:  when shares are sold how does that affect the company itself? The shares were already initially sold when the company went public. Why is it bad that consumers sell their shares and stock prices go down? Like the price of the shares how does that affect the actual money the company has to operate? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but as people sell their shares to other people, the price they can sell at goes down.   Supply and demand.   Shares and therefore the company itself, are valued based on the trading price of their shares.</p>
<p>Very basic Example:  Company A has 500 shares valued at $100 each.   The company is valued at $50,000.</p>
<p>Suzy isn't happy with the company making 3% less profit, so she sells 50 of her 200 shares.  They sell for $100 each. </p>
<p>Bobby sees this sale, and wants to sell 50 of his 100 shares.  Because more people are selling than buying, he can only get someone to pay him $75 per share.  Anyone else who owns shares can also only get $75 per share, so that becomes the stock price at the end of the day.</p>
<p>There are still 500 shares, all owned by people, but now the company is only valued at $37,500.</p>
<p>Suzy started the day with $20,000 in stocks.   She sold $5,000 worth, and the remaining 150 are worth $11,250.  At the end of the day, she lost $3,500, or \~18%.</p>
<p>Bobby started the day with $10,000 in stocks.  He sold $3,750 worth, and the remaining 50 are worth $3,750.  At the end of the day, he lost $2,500, or 25%.   Anyone who didn't sell any stock also has 25% less value in their portfolio now too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's bad to the owners of the shares, who collectively own the company. Sure, if they, as a group, decided they don't care that they lose on their investment (and the company needs no future outside funding), that doesn't affect the day-to-day business or cash flow a lot. But they do care. So they ensure that rates of return increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a reasonable question. Here are two reasons it's bad for a company's stock price to go down:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the stock price goes down, it's because public perception of the value of the company has gone down. That's never good. That might mean that people are less willing to buy the company's products, or that other large companies are less willing to do business with them. Would you sign a 5 year contract to sell widgets to a company that might go bankrupt next year?</li>
<li>A lower stock price harms the company's ability to raise capital. A company that wants to spend money on expanding (building new factories, starting new projects) might not have the cash on hand to do that stuff. They can raise money by selling more shares, or by borrowing money from a bank. Selling more shares doesn't work as well if the share price is low, and a bank's confidence in your company's ability to repay their loans is probably going to be poor if the share price is low.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just a ludicrous explanation. Stock prices are not lossely and magically linked to &quot;perception&quot;, they are based on a company valuation. A stock price is the consensus market valuation of a company, divided by the number of shares on offer. Valuations are based on expected future profits. If a company makes less profit than expected today, that means it is likely to make less profit than expected tomorrow. Hence the valuation is less, and the stock price goes down. Even if the company is the most profitable company in the world. The answer to /u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/azoriusmoons" target="_blank">azoriusmoons</a> 's question is that if a stock price crashes it means that investors lost enormous amounts of money, and naturally people care about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your assumption here involves that the company is profitable.  It may not be.  A lot of large companies aren't yet profitable.  For them a large drop in stock price can directly affect their ability to keep raising the cash they need to 'keep the lights on'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shareholders own the company. They don't want their assets to lose value. So to stop that from happening, they shut down branches of the company that make less (and are expected to in the future) than average market returns.</p>
<p>And that's efficient overall. It ensures that capital is allocated to its most profitable use.</p></div>		</li>
