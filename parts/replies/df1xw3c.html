			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a great point. I've seen this question about shuffle before, and I think what always gets me is the redefining &quot;shuffle&quot; and &quot;random&quot; as two different things. I found this <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/itunes-just-how-random-is-random/" target="_blank">OG article on Cnet</a> about how people found more coincidence in the original iTunes shuffle - that was actual true randomness. Example: 3 songs by the same artist back to back on full shuffle... <em>what are the odds??</em> </p>
<p>Somehow feels less random, right? Even with basic math justifying the original shuffle, they ended up tweaking it to be more defined and reduce what users described as &quot;coincidence.&quot; This way, the odds of getting two or more songs in order are artificially lower than actual random. It's a mad world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is always used in CS classes as a case study to explain the difference between what users ask for and what they actually want.</p>
<p>When you hit the shuffle button do you really want <em>random</em> tracks? Does ensuring that every track has an exactly equal probability of being played increase the quality of a playlist? Not at all, when users ask for a shuffle button they're really asking for <em>variety</em> which is a pretty hard problem. You would need a Pandora style classification of song characteristics to make sure that the next song is sufficiently musically different from the last and even that isn't perfect. Introducing randomness is a good approximation and over time we ended up forgetting what we were really trying to accomplish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had it come up where I've been shuffling my entire phone library (around 800 songs) and it's played two songs from the same album back to back, but not in sequential order. I thought it was neat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem" target="_blank">birthday paradox</a>: even if you have 10000 songs and 1000 different artists, the chances of getting the same artist twice in a row at some point during the listening session ends up being quite high. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense, really - the odds of the whole thing playing in order are very slim, but the odds of at least one song playing in the position where it should are somewhere in the ballpark of &quot;pretty likely will happen at least once each time&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>but most randomization algorithms focus on purposefully avoiding noticeable patterns like that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you go further into that? This sounds interesting, but I don't really understand why they'd do that and have never heard of it. Actively avoiding patterns would take a lot of effort  and would also diminish the quality of the numbers in a runs test. After all patterns are something that just happens on accident from time to time. And in most cases the combination of a random seed with a pseudo random derivative should be more than sufficient. </p>
<p>To some degree it makes sense in case of an iPod - you don't want to play the same song in a row - but going into metadata and trying to prevent the human from recognizing a pattern seems weird. </p>
<p>Edit: It seems to be indeed a thing on iPods and the like (or at least a lot of people claim it were, but I haven't fund a scientific study), but I want to add that randomization algorithms in contexts where you actually need truly random figures will never ever try to avoid patterns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People cannot create a truly random pattern programmatically. At least they haven't been able to yet. If it is programmed, it is by definition not random. </p>
<p>And truly random would have a lot of patterns that people are not fans of. Creating a non-random pattern that avoids certain criteria is not as complicated as you might think it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ask a human to generate some &quot;random&quot; data, they will tend to subconsciously avoid clustering and spread things out, even though some coincidental clustering is expected in genuine randomness. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion</a></p>
<p>So it makes sense that humans sometimes see nonexistent patterns in randomness, and can even be annoyed by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the link. I knew about the issue (a statistics professor mentioned that humans were awful at generating random numbers) but had forgotten the name. </p>
<p>I'm just not sure that it makes much sense to go that far with a playlist. At least when you only play every song once. </p></div>		</li>
