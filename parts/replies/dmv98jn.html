			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if interest is allowed.</p>
<p>The amount wouldn't be counted towards net worth.  As the card has not been redeemed, the money &quot;technically&quot; doesn't belong to the store yet.  Think of them more of a custodian of the cash until the customer makes a purchase decision.  The money only gets to enter their revenue (and count towards their net worth) when they make the sale.</p>
<p>But of course the business would be aware of this outstanding balance, and if they've been around for a few years then they can use it to help forecast future sales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can still book the revenue eventually, though, so they do sort of have it correct. It sits as a liability for quite some time until it expires though. I'm sure with large firms the gift card revenue can be in the millions from unused expired cards.</p></div>		</li>
