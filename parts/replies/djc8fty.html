<p>The vast majority of all money is digital these days. Bills and coins make up a tiny portion of the monetary base. When you transfer money using online banking it's just changing numbers in a database.</p>
<p>Banks is audited pretty tightly, every transaction has to be accounted for, all the credits and debits have to add up at all times. When you transfer money to someone at another bank, it ends up transferring money between the bank account the banks have at the central bank. For international transfers you have other institutions, BIS.</p>
<p>At every step of the way, it all has to balance.</p></div>		</li>
