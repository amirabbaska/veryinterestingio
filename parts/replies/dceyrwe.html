			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct on the first part. Lack of ATP which disrupts cell membrane activity is essentially the only important factor here. The efficiency of aerobic to anaerobic energy is nearly 20x greater. There just isn't enough energy to maintain the high energy cost of a cell membrane without oxygen (in humans, in most cells, in most organs). Once this barrier is violated, the cell is no longer isolated from the rest of the world and is &quot;dead&quot;.</p>
<p>pH will further limit reasons but misfolded proteins and calcium influx are more for apoptosis cascade than necrosis. </p>
<p>Edit: it's a timeframe issue. The cell dies before the latter stuff you mentioned has a chance to be relevant. For a timeframe: hold your breath to see how long you can live without oxygen ;) yes you die first from pH from not exchanging CO2 but if you're a smoker with COPD you die from lack of O2 first since you've slowly adapted to a more acidic environment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked it up in Robbins &amp; Cotrans <em>Pathologic Basic of Disease</em>. The way it's worded seems to imply that the importance of Ca2+ mediated effects is a relatively new thought (&quot;The finding that depleting calcium protects cells from injury induced by a variety of harmful stimuli indicates that calcium ions are important mediators of cell injury&quot;). It brings up opening of mitochondrial pores/mitochondrial swelling (-&gt;inability to generate ATP even in the presence of oxygen) as important processes, and might be what causes the cell to cross the point of no return. &quot;Profound&quot; membrane dysfunction (e.g. lysosomal) was also associated with irreversible cell damage </p>
<p>It kind of makes sense that Ca2+ plays a role in both apoptosis and necrosis, as there's iirc a gradual transition between to two. So, if the Ca2+ increase that triggers catalytic processes via caspases occurs in both necrotic and apoptotic cells, we would get the same enzymatic response, if in varying degrees of potency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be surprised if any ion shift against the gradient before insult/injury wouldn't be beneficial. Ca clearly plays a cascade role in apoptosis but cell membrane integrity, including Ca regulation, would affected prior to apoptosis. Necrosis, imho, is loss of cell membrane prior to completing apoptotic pathway anywhere along its course. </p>
<p>All these studies are in vitro with cells relatively inactive and isolated from in vivo counterparts and the relatively dense environment therein. Once adjacent cells start necrosing a cascade effect can occur. Cell contents are on the inside for a reason..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General rule of thumb is that 3 minutes without oxygen is when you start to run into trouble. Trained divers who conserve oxygen can push the envelope, but for most people holding your breath for five minutes would be impossible, and oxygen deprivation for that long would be inadvisable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neurons in the brain are also much more reliant on aerobic pathways than other cells. Active neurons will apparently skip glucose altogether and use the breakdown products of lactic acid/pyruvate from surrounding supporting astrocytes for entirely aerobic metabolism. So cutting of oxygen can kill the most highly active neurons even faster since they don't even have anaerobic use of glucose immediately available.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To put that in context. GFLOPS of computing power is dedicated to the study of folding proteins and we're still barely scratching the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GFLOPS?  That was mid-1980s on machines such as Cray-2.  By mid 90s a thousand times as fast, TFLOPS with Ascii Red. Another factor of a thousand faster,  PFLOPS (PetaFLOPS) in 2008, and in about a year or two we'll have EFLOPS (ExaFLOPS)</p></div>		</li>
