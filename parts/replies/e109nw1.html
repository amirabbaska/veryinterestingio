			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a '+' made out of five solar panel squares (one in the center, one on each side). Now fold each of the side panels in as if they were the sides of a box, but only fold them about 30 degrees. When the center panel is aligned with the sun, the top and bottom pair (as well as the left and right pair) will be at the same angle to the sun, and therefore produce the same voltage. If you wire these up to a motor in opposition (not sure of the correct term here), this means the motor receives no voltage, and doesn't turn. As the sun moves, one in each pair will receive slightly more power (because the sun faces it more directly) and this provides a net voltage to the motor, aligning it in real-time.</p>
<p>Also the side solar panels can be really small, since they only need to power a low-speed motor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>hook those up to the motor in such a way that when one small panel is receiving more direct light (creating a net voltage), the motor turns slowly to equalize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would you measure that and have the motors function without a computer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motors work by using voltage (potential difference) to turn in a certain direction. If you hook up both to opposite ends of a motor, one will be higher than the other forcing theotor to spin the other way? </p>
<p>I'm basing all this off of my brief time working with an H-bridge motor so I could be wrong</p></div>		</li>
