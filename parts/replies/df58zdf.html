Maybe our wildest dreams will come through and some alien spices finds it and thinks of to jam a needle on to it and spin it for how-ever-many-rpm's it needs, and they have ears to hear what it says... but mostly, it's for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speak for yourself. The message really being for us? I can get behind that. But us being not all that important? We have no idea what our future holds. Maybe we colonize the entire galaxy? Find ways around the laws of physics to reach the rest of the universe? Heck, some have questioned if maybe our future selves are the very initiators of the universe itself. Who knows? Sure, there's a beauty in the idea that we're just a tiny bit in all this and no more significant than any other tiny bit. But that doesn't mean it's true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It holds death and impermanence. No ambition or pride will last. This is not pessimism, it is realism. It is the middle path.</p></div>		</li>
