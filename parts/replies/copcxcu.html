			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I believe Josef Mengele experimented on sets of twins, and one of the experiments was to attempt to fuse twins to each other by cutting them open and sewing them together. I think I remember hearing the story of a fellow prisoner who euthanized a set of twins who had suffered through one such experiment.</p></div>		</li>
