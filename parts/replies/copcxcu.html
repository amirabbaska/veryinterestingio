			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I believe Josef Mengele experimented on sets of twins, and one of the experiments was to attempt to fuse twins to each other by cutting them open and sewing them together. I think I remember hearing the story of a fellow prisoner who euthanized a set of twins who had suffered through one such experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually the shape. Imagine the protein segment is the hotdog: It could be kosher, it could be pork, it could be a bratwurst-- and the T-cells will look at it and say &quot;Yup, that looks normal&quot; if the protein is something it's used to seeing. But it could also be something else that fits that shape-- like a small hammer or piece of shit. If you saw something like that, it would make you go &quot;wait a second, that's not right&quot; and then attack the host. Similar idea here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know my first response when I see someone carrying around a hot dog bun with a deuce in it is to scream bloody murder and attack them with the hammer I had secreted away in my own hot dog bun. It's simply a natural reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understood what he meant.</p>
<p>Basically imagine a &quot;hot dog bun&quot; as the &quot;showing tray&quot; and the &quot;hot dog&quot; as a peice of protien from inside the cell. He was just showing how the HLA &quot;displays&quot; the protien to the outside. </p>
<p>Its hard for me to explain too apparently. </p></div>		</li>
