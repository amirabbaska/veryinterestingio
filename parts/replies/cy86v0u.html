			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the fact, that beside being stiff, glass also has a lot of pressure trapped inside, contribute to this loudness? I'm thinking about tempered glass, which I witnessed shatter a couple of times without apparent reason. That was LOUD too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Internal pressure will increase the effective stiffness, which will likely increase the q-factor of the resonance. Where the q-factor gives a measure of how pure the resonance. Rubber has a very low q-factor (it can resonate) whereas glass has a very high q-factor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think whats important here is that oscillators with a high q factor lose energy more slowly, thus oscillate for a longer period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inclusions (small particles of not glass) can easily get stuck in glass during the manufacturing process. These are basically tiny crack initiation sites, that might start growing if they get stressed by temperature changes or small amounts of external pressure. Since tempered glass is packed full of stored energy, a growing crack can easily shatter the whole pane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on, the resonant frequencies will depend on the size of the shards, the type of glass, thickness of glass, etc. This is why a bunch of similar sized shards all from the same source would be particularly loud. Also, as the above poster notes, glass will resonant for a long time and perceived loudness isn't solely dependent on dB but also duration. There are also certain frequencies to which we are more sensitive, do that could also be a potential factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A practical example is dumping a bin full of glass bottles into a recycling skip already half full of glass bottles.</p>
<p>Even with care and caution and keeping the skip lid mostly closed it is an excruciatingly loud noise, as anyone living behind a bar will attest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived with my parents, we had a glass recycling bin, but it didn't get taken out very often. When there was already a layer of bottles in the bin, it was absolutely impossible to put more in without making an ear shattering noise, unless you literally set each bottle carefully on top one at a time.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This would've been my first guess in this situation. The sound of glass breaking is in the very high frequency area, in which we are very sensitive to even small amplitudes.</p></div>		</li>
