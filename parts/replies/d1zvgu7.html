<p>In astronomy, a metal is basically anything over Lithium (or maybe it was Carbon, it's been a while). Most of these &quot;metals,&quot; ie. heavier elements, are created in the center of stars</p>

<p>Primary Elements is the term.
The largest element to form is iron and they are created via fusion within a star known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">Stellar nucleosynthesis</a> , elements above that are created via super-nova. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis" target="_blank">Supernova nucleosynthesis</a></p>
<p>Fe that is the heaviest element to have a net release of energy by nuclear fusion.</p></div>		</li>
