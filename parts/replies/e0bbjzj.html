			<div class="markdown"><p>Also think of TV remotes like torches, you just can't see the light they emit. And the bulb is tiny, it doesn't take much power to flash on off quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see it in action, point the remote into your phone camera and press a button.
Or eyes can't see the infra red light emitted by the remote, but your camera can. Those little flashes are interpreted by your TV as a command.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see the output of some remotes with my eyes. Really, really dim but it's there. I always assumed the diodes were just terrible and not properly IR, or maybe they were super bright enough that my eyes can pick it up. Or both!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to that the joy stick thingies use potentiometers to determine their position (similar to a dim switch. Middle position - middle brightness - represents idle position while off is for instance left and full open is right). Remotes are more like a morse switch. It's an open circuit until you press a button.</p>

Which isn't terrible, but it's still nothing like the longevity you'd get out of a standard IR remote. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They had IR for 3rd party wireless controllers back in the 90’s and it was almost always a disaster. I knew a kid who had one for N64. It was incredibly laggy when it did actually work. You also had to be fairly close and in direct line-of-sight. It was one of those “the technology just isn’t there yet but here’s a half assed attempt at what the future could hold” type of things.</p></div>		</li>
