			<div class="markdown"><p>tesla claimed he could build one large enough it could be used a strategic &quot;death ray&quot;, basically a water-tower sized tesla coil that would strike planes and tanks with lightning, as a defensive measure. (it would not be mobile enough to be used offensively).</p>
<p>This claim came during the more <em>eccentric</em> period of Tesla's life, but I am inclined to believe him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true he supposedly had a deathray design, but his initial use for the tesla coil was the wireless transmission of power, which he achieved over a short distance. He built larger scale tesla coils in hopes he could scale his distance but found the transmission of power degraded much faster than he anticipated when transmitting through the air.  That's when he started work on the wardenclyffe tower, which was essentially a reverse tesla coil when it comes to circuitry, the tesla coil emitted power through the air and the circuit returned via ground, where as the wardenclyffe tower was intended to emit power through ground and the circuit would return via the air in hopes that the transmission of power wouldn't degrade as fast before reaching its intended destination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a &quot;ray&quot;! </p>
<p>Nikola Tesla claimed to have invented a &quot;death beam&quot; which he called teleforce in the 1930s and continued the claims up until his death.[9][10][11] Tesla explained that &quot;this invention of mine does not contemplate the use of any so-called 'death rays'. Rays are not applicable because they cannot be produced in requisite quantities and diminish rapidly in intensity with distance.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automotive ignition coils act like tesla coils. The ignition coil primary is always energized, with a static magnetic field. When a spark is needed, the power to the primary is abruptly switched off. The magnetic field collapses and generates a high voltage in the secondary, and the secondary rings at it's natural frequency like the secondary of a tesla coil until it dissipates all the energy into the spark.</p></div>		</li>
