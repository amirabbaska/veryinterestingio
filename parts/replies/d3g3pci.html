			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but this is one thing that ticks me off about the TSA. If I'm going to bring something on an airplane and make an explosive it's not going to be a liquid OR a gel. Those will expand, and not react correctly due to temperature changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that one guy who absolutely did that and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Airlines_Flight_434" target="_blank">very nearly blew a plane out of the sky</a>. The fact that it didn't crash is entirely due to the incredible skills of the pilots, not due to the bomb not working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The TSA have their own screwed-up definitions of everything.  Who in their right mind considers peanut butter and toothpaste to be liquids, but fountain pen ink to be a solid? As it turns out, I've carried filled fountain pens through airport security literally a hundred times -- but semi-regularly lose my toothpaste or shaving butter when I forget and bring 'em along anyhow.</p>
<p>If you ever start to think the TSA are doing something valuable, have a look a <a href="http://terminalcornucopia.com" target="_blank">Terminal Cornucopia</a>, which is all about how to produce deadly weapons from things you can buy <em>after</em> you go through airport security.  (a &quot;Fraggucino&quot; shrapnel bomb made from a Starbucks vacuum mug, a breech-loading shotgun made from rolled-up Vogue magazines, and a remote-controlled incendiary device using an RC car toy are just three of the more exciting ones).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>which, the toothpaste?  Well, toothpaste is technically neither a gel nor a liquid, it's a paste (unless it's a gel toothpaste, in which case it's a gel...)</p></div>		</li>
