			<div class="markdown"><p>So a while ago I watched this documentary about a really really schizophrenic little girl, who learned language milestones of like an 8 year old at 1 1/2 years old. And then subsequently went very very deep within her own head and is no longer part of this world.</p>
<p>My parents said that I learned how to read very early(with uncorrected vision, even) and I have some profound psychotic experience(all in the form of grandiose religious delusion but goddamn if that's not intense).</p>
<p>Think there's any link between genetic/fetal epigentic propensity for language(or in other words the human-specific pattern of hemispherical lateralization that gives us the strict 1 to 1 mapping of formants to meaning) and schizophrenia?</p>
<p>I feel like nobody is going to understand this but I will post it to remind you all life is an exercise in nihilistic futility. I can spell pretty much every other word correctly why the fuck can I not spell exercise?</p>
<p>Clearly that is my code word for vibrator rape or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, that rock isn't usually calibrated, and isn't usually in a crystal oven to even out the temperature, so counting AC power cycles - <strong>over time</strong> - is a far more accurate way to measure seconds than the built in clock.</p>
<p>Computers aren't always plugged into the AC line 24/7, but when they are, your $2k gaming rig has less long term accuracy than my 80s era digital clock radio. </p>
<p>Fortunately, there is something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol" target="_blank">NTP,</a> which periodically allows your PC to talk to other PCs that regularly talk to atomic clocks. Over time it can also compensate for your built-in cheap-ass non-calibrated real time clock.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, because nothing is really perfect in the real world, we have the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Real computers have clock drift so they communicate with NIST to figure out what the correct time is. Network latency is taken into account when NIST sends the time so that's how computers stay synchronized and know the correct time.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To be more accurate, real computers have formed a network of timekeeping computers organized into 'strata' such that the NIST servers don't get overwhelmed with requests for the time.</p>
<p>Think of strata as layers, with each layer being farther away from some stratum 1 computer, which has its own reference clock, which is either an atomic clock, a GPS receiver (because GPS satellites are largely atomic clocks in space), or a radio receiver tuned to receive the broadcasts from an atomic clock, such as those on WWV. The reference clock itself is stratum 0, BTW.</p>
<p>A stratum 2 computer gets its time information from a stratum 1 computer, a stratum 3 computer from a stratum 2 computer, and so on; the highest possible stratum is 15, but I've never seen above 3, myself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but I think they still drift. I'm pretty sure the clocks in GPS satellites are atomic clocks, and GPS devices have to account for the satellites clock drift</p></div>		</li>
