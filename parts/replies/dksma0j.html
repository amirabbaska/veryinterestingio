			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure can.</p>
<p>It'll be difficult to get an experimental apparatus perfect, but with a simple plastic water bottle and some food coloring in top, squeeze out as much air as possible before closing, should demonstrate it pretty well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doing some dye  visualization experiments as an undergrad with very low reynolds number water channel flows, I found that it is <em>very</em> difficult to match the density of the dye to the density of the water. Therefore, most of the time when you do this, you may actually get relative (i.e. not solid-body) motion due to density gradients being accelerated (by shaking, with or without gravity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you right now as a chemist, if you fill a volumetric flask up and just shake it up and down without inverting it, and then inject that solution into something like an HPLC you'll notice that you won't have consistent chromatography due to poor mixing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... and very slight difference in density based on temperature would cause a little movement of the fluid in the bottle when the bottle is moved. Ninja Edit: This is in addition to just convection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. While the water may not <em>appear</em> to move, there is constant shuffling of the molecules due to various forms of heat/energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't there be shear stress from accelerating in any direction?</p>
<p>The container pushes the water molecules at the edge, yet the water molecules in the centre want to stay motionless. The water molecules at the center don't 'know' whether the difference is linear or circular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good thought that gets toward the intersection between considering fluids as a collection of particles, and considering fluids as a continuum.</p>
<p>When I specified <em>incompressible</em> (which is physically a very justifiable simplification here), one implication of that is that disturbances in an incompressible medium travel <em>infinitely fast</em>. There isn't any lag time between the container motion at the boundary, and the innermost fluid. Of course nothing is infinitely fast in reality, but for the purposes of this set up you'd basically have to shoot the water bottle out of a cannon before you see even the tiniest compressibility effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you could accelerate (linearly) this bottle fast enough that the pressure of the water actually rises to a point where the water should theoretically turn into one of the types of ice. Would it actually turn into ice, or would it just heat up instead? And what acceleration would you need for it to do this? Is this even possible? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since grad fluids but wouldn't your acceleration need to also be perfectly parallel with gravity, your water be a homogenous isotope, and have the molecules magically aligned just right? I'm sure heavy water counts as particles and water is implicitly approximated as spheres in your scenario.</p></div>		</li>
