			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a little more specific: &quot;and if they're large enough or moving fast enough, they can create gravitational waves <strong>that we can detect</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>Any two masses moving around each other generate gravitational waves, it's just that these waves are generally so small, we have no ability to detect them. It takes <em>very massive</em> objects moving very quickly to generate gravitational waves large enough for us to measure.</p></div>		</li>
