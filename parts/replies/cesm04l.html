			<p>Another point is the fact that the pipes are basically being washed, 24/7.  Bacteria have a difficult time forming biofilms under such conditions-- they're washed away and appear in your tap and toilet water in such small amounts as to be trivial.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is my basic understanding too. A further point to note is that it's not enough to have the water chemically or otherwise treated to make sure it stays clean or pure. Standing water from a mains supply can still attract growth of nasty bacteria. A major one of these is Legionella, which can grow in warm standing water. Chlorine can help control this, but common practice in systems with warm water storage is to periodically raise the temperature of the water to above 70 degrees C to kill the bacteria.  </p>		</li>

			<p>kinda like large versus thin rivers ? differences in flow/pressure/speed &quot;forbids&quot; organisms to grow ?</p>		</li>

			<p>I studied and even visited a few water treatment stations during my studies.<br><br>This is not how it works, sadly. The reality is a little more disgusting than this. There is dirt and bacterias at all time in the water pipes. However, the amount is heavily controller and chlorine in the water kills most of it.<br><br>THe problem is that dirt layers get formed on the inside of old pipes, pretty much like that :<br><a href="http://www.glowinternational.net/system/files/imce/Pipe_whole.gif" target="_blank">http://www.glowinternational.net/system/files/imce/Pipe_whole.gif</a><br><br>What happens when the water pressure drops is that chunks of dirt, containing bacterias, may detach from the pipe. This can cause a higher amount of bacterias than expect and also color the water yellow or orange.</p>		</li>

			<p>Isn't that formed by some kind of metal-eating, non-harmful bacteria? I may be completely off here, but I vaguely remember reading about this.</p>		</li>

			<p>What happens in the event of the processing plant being shut down? For example, when a city or area releases a boil all water advisory - are the pipes being contaminated and will they recover simply due to the high pressure and constant flow?</p>		</li>

			<p>Your water plant is required to have water storage capabilities with restrictions and minimums based on how much the plant produces.  If the plant shuts down then water towers will maintain the chlorinated supply and pressure needed to keep above state regs.  There are also booster stations that increase pressures or add chemicals (chlorine) depending on the layout of your water system.  We run a nanofilitration plant and shut down periodically for membrane cleaning.  Beforehand they will fill all the water storages to capacity and elevate the chlorine residual slightly.<br><br>If a boil advisory is released it usually due to a line repair.  Most places flush the repaired line, test for a chlorine residual, take a water sample for testing and then announce a boil advisory as a precaution.  It takes 24 hours to lift the advisory due to lab testing.  And for those situations a results sheet must be sent to the state.<br><br>Source: Laboratory tech with a Total Coliform Cert, does the line/distribution sampling, and I hold a B-well Operator License.<br><br>Edit: you can also tour your public systems.

			<p>does a pur filter on my faucet that can get rid of giardia and other similar things make me not need to care about boil advisories?</p>		</li>

			<p>I would still boil my water or use bottled in that event.  Most faucet filters are good for organic matter that is larger. The thing that would concern me is that you may clog your filter if there is sediment from the repair and then the water doesn't recieved your additional filtering. I found a link a for another state addressing boil advisories and filters <a href="http://www.charlestonwater.com/custserv_svc_intptns_boil_advisory.htm" target="_blank">here.</a> <br><br>I'm on my phone getting my car serviced so I'll give a more detailed response when I get home.<br><br>EDIT:  Giardia and cryptosporidium are parasites that require a filtration pore size of 1 micron or smaller.  Total <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coliform_bacteria" target="_blank">coliforms</a>, used as an indicator organism, are larger than a 0.45 micron pore.  That's why we use a 0.45 micron filtration pad in membrane filtration.  I can't find anything on the pur website that gives the filtration pore size.<br><br><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/training/videos/transcripts/water.pdf" target="_blank">CDC water borne information</a><br><br>With all that being said, I personally would remove the filtration device during a boil advisory or change out the filter after the advisory has been lifted.  Non health related, but if you get a lot of advisories that result in sediment in your lines then you will want to periodically flush your hot water heater.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>This is why, in emergency situations, they announce that you need to avoid tap water for however many days and get/make/boil your own.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are numerous reasons for a boil water advisory. The water may be contaminated with chemicals or minerals the plant cannot filter out. Low water levels my result in more sediment being taken in than the plant can remove. The plant may not be able to keep up with demand as more residences are built. Old pipes will leak letting bacteria in. The guy who runs your water supply could go senile and stop taking care of things. The guy who replaces that guy could be too cheap to pay for the correct filtration materials so just dumps in a bunch of bleach and laundry detergent.<br><br><br>Source: Grew up and parents still live in a very, very rural &quot;neighborhood&quot; that's been under a boil water advisory for literally twenty years. Luckily the water comes from a mountain stream so its not too bad, except in torrential rainstorms when all the abandoned coal mine runoff turns the mud that comes out of the faucet a nice orangish brown .</p>		</li>

			<p>Lucky you. For me it was the opposite. Growing up, orange was the default color of our stream, and it only ran clear during heavy rains.<br></p>		</li>
