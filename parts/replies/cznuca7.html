			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pegasus can only carry small payloads, with a max of 433 kg to LEO. For context, that's less than 4% the mass of the Hubble Space Telescope. It would be possible to scale this concept up, but only to a certain point. It wouldn't be effective to launch any large or manned payloads like this.</p>
<p>Side note: both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_X-15" target="_blank">North American X-15</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipOne" target="_blank">Scaled Composites's SpaceShipOne</a> (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo" target="_blank">SpaceShipTwo</a>, if all goes well) achieved manned suborbital spaceflight with a launch like this, but could attain nowhere near the velocity required to achieve orbit.</p></div>		</li>
