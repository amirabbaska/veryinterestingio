			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is absorbed in the large intestine, which varies processing. empty stomach, haven't eaten for the day? Little as 2 hours. Just finished a big meal, lots of big meals? Typically 24 hours. You can trick your body though, you can drink a crap load of water and &quot;flush&quot; aka get your body to speed up and flush out your digestive tract(prepare to have dirreaha) but it will hydrate you quicker,
When you wake up, if you drink a glass of water, it will make you feel better, and it will hydrate you pretty quickly where as you wait till AFTER you eat, its much slower. </p></div>		</li>
