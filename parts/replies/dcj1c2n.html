			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, additionally over time those muscles you aren't using regularly (back extensors when slouching for example) get progressively weaker. Then when you try to actively use them (say to be more mindful about posture) it is more uncomfortable in comparison because those muscles are weak and the &quot;opposite&quot; muscles (chest wall in this example) are tight. So you're stretching out tighter muscles by engaging weaker muscles and therefore as soon as you're not actively thinking about it, you revert because the tighter muscles go back to their tightened state. </p>
<p>As a physical therapist assistant I pretty much fix everyone's posture no matter what else they come in for because most everyone's is horrible. People often don't understand that when your posture is off, it's a domino effect to cause other dysfunctions. </p>
<p>Also, this was my first time responding in ELI5, so hopefully I scaled down my answer to 5 year old status ;) Hope it helped. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised what you notice about your body once you get it back in alignment. It's like &quot;oh, that hurts, that's why I started slouching in the first place&quot;. Then it's just a matter of commitment to wanting to do the work to fix it. It will suck, but it will suck less than the long term ramifications of not fixing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, for me it's comfortable to sit like <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/mCccr" target="_blank">this</a> until I try to get up and my knee is just aching terribly. It always makes a really loud pop when i stretch it all the way out and it takes a few minutes to get it back to feeling normal. But its such a normal way for me to sit. Why is it more comfortable like this than sitting normally?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, that's exactly how I sit!!! I think our knees hurt because pressure is being put on it from a weird angle when you're sitting like that. Mine does start to hurt if I sit like that for too long, but always hurts when I stand up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have sat like this for most of my life. Please try not to, it's terrible for twisting your knee. I now wake up in the night with excruciating pain. (the knee I always bent under my leg.)
I'm hoping I've not done permanent damage (should probably get it checked out)  I'm making a real conscious effort to correct my sitting and it is helping. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I spent years doing little things and <em>thinking</em> about fixing my posture, then i found him this year. His <a href="https://youtu.be/nAmc9SNciTg" target="_blank">35 minute yoga video</a> in addition to his videos on the recommended routine over at r/bodyweightfitness (link in that subs sidebar) have helped me leaps n bounds towards strengthening my back. And thats me as someone who works out sporadically, not a super motivated person some days...and i smoke. </p>
<p>Worth at least watching. Especially, his <a href="https://youtu.be/nAmc9SNciTg" target="_blank">35 minute yoga video</a> Do that a couple times a week, and youll notice huge benefits in a matter of weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The good news is you're not alone! Slouching is human nature. Some physiotherapists do emphasize posture, but in practice I find it's much easier for us to not worry too much about it (since it's going to happen, especially if you sit for work) and instead focus on:</p>
<p>-Taking a very short walk/stand break 1-4x / hour and a longer one every 2-3 hours
-Use a standing desk at times if able
-Counter-act the effects of sitting for extended periods with general exercise
-Counter-act the effects of &quot;creep&quot; by doing some very easy exercises targeted at some of the muscles affected by it, and some &quot;core&quot; exercises to support the joints</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, thank you!  PT here and there is a bunch of research showing that posture does not correlate to pain, sitting does not lead to back pain, and chairs aren't the devil.  Yes posture could help with increased shoulder mobility and improved thoracic mobility may help with neck positioning but does not correlate with pain.  </p>
<p>I really hate the differences in research though.  Some supposedly evidence based and high level research shows importance of structure while others completely disregard it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am old and fat.
There are a hundred ways my poor and sedentary lifestyle will kill me.
But.
I have had good posture since I was a child and standing, moving and sitting with good posture is just automatic for me.
Aside from the occasional stupid-related back injuries I have never had back pain in my life and any back injuries tend to get better quickly. </p>
<p>Good posture uses muscle.
Using muscle hurts.
After a while, using muscle doesn't hurt anymore. </p>
<p>Take the time to build the muscles for good posture and you will benefit from it for the rest of your life. </p></div>		</li>
