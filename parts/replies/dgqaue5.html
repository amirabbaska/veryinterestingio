			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer but I feel like it is slightly missing the point of the question.</p>
<p>There are flowers that smell like rotting corpses in order to attract flies to pollinate them. If all flowers smelled this way, I think it's fair to assume they would not be used as decor by humans and the floral profession would not exist.</p>
<p>I think OP is asking: why do some flowers smell and look good to humans, when the &quot;goal&quot; of the flower is to attract flies, bees, or birds? Is it pure coincidence that human preferences overlap with bees and birds, but not with flies? Or is there something else at work here?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chilis. They're hot so they deter walking mammals from eating them and pooping the seeds close by and overcrowding an area. Meanwhile birds without a receptor for capsaicin gobble them up and poop the seeds a hundred yards (or a few miles) away.</p>
<p>Humans decided we like to burn out tastebuds, so we take to &quot;liking&quot; burny stuff.</p>
<p>Real answer: there is never a &quot;goal&quot; in evolution, just whatever worked good enough for the previous 5-100,000 generations.</p>
<p>&quot;sweet&quot; smells are shared by a lot of mammals (humans, bears, dogs?). Why do hummingbirds and bees &quot;like&quot; the same flowers? the flower didn't have a say in it, the ones that smelled the sweetest attracted both species into the same ecosystem and there was enough to go around. If the same scent starts attracting destructive ants or other bugs, then that type of &quot;smell&quot; is a detriment of the flower and it will die out to be replaced by its cousin who smells good to the bees but ants ignore it. Then we get into our meddling to breed special types with bigger petals or less or more smell.</p>
<p>tl;dr- Its mostly coincidence, but some observational bias. We are only familiar with the ones we like and are durable enough market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is hard to distill this into the sort of simple answer you would get about, for example, flowers attracting bees because humans operate on a different level than simple animals or insects. Our capacity for higher thinking and ritualization means that, unrelated to pheromones evolved just for us or other traits that naturally evolve due to selective pressures, we interact with a ton of plants and animals for our own purposes that exist only within human-created systems. We then breed them for uses that were never &quot;naturally&quot; intended. Just the fact that we enjoy patterns so much, combined with interesting colors and smells, could be what sparked the imagination of our ancestors to use flowers as symbols or as an ingredient for dyes. I think this likely means, beyond our own breeding for better yields, landscaping and whatnot, flowers did not evolve traits due to human pressures.</p>
<p>Insects wouldn't have the concept or need for &quot;Art&quot;, but we will often take objects and change or arrange them for artistic needs that might have nothing to do with their utility. I do personally believe that if all flowers had interesting visual components, coupled with smells we have innate aversions to, we would still eventually find uses for them beyond food, water and shelter as we progressed as a thinking species. Until you reach the point where you are manufacturing your own interesting objects and not just using whatever you can find in the natural world, you are kind of stuck with what is growing around you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment reminded me of how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1zmfTr2d4c" target="_blank">bowerbirds</a> use flowers, fruit, and other colored objects to create beautiful attention-getting displays. This presumably has little benefit to the flowers or fruit, other than a little seed distribution. Although not really comparable to human art, the bowerbirds are still using the flowers simply for their visual appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at images of flowers through ultraviolet and infrared cameras. What we see is a byproduct of them producing colors on these ends of the spectrum. The smell is sweet because they're trying to attract animals that are looking for sugars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason that I don't usually buy flowers, at least the typical sort of cut flowers most people think of, is because they're expensive (understandably) but they also don't last super long. What I prefer to do is buy small potted plants so they last longer and can potentially be transplanted into bigger pots/gardens.</p>
<p>Also what's your favourite flower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should perhaps shop around in your area for different florists.</p>
<p>My standard is to buy a $10 bunch of carnations from the grocery store every other week, and those things are like bionic wonders, typically last for that full two weeks without any efforts on my part.  They are, of course, kinda bottom-barrel of the flower world, but as a bachelor, nearly everyone is highly impressed that I have a vase of flowers at all on my table.</p>
<p>Beyond that though, I get great value from local hole-in-the-wall florists.  I'll usually go in and say &quot;I have $20 and lady friend with a birthday or perhaps my mom is coming in from out of town&quot; and they'll hook me up with something appropriate and impressive. </p>
<p>If you cut the stems properly when you get home, and keep them fed in a vase, they should hold for at least a week, perhaps two or three if you have a green thumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't have to be expensive. A brick-and-mortar floral shop will charge almost three times the amount of what the flowers are worth. This is because they have to pay for overhead in addition to a designing fee in addition to paying for employees. I always find very reasonable and hearty flowers that are seasonal  at Trader Joe's. </p>
<p>I am mainly attracted to Spring bulb flowers like hyacinths, daffodils, tulips and Narcissus. But I really love lilacs,hydrangeas, peonies and tropicals. Thanks for asking!</p></div>		</li>
