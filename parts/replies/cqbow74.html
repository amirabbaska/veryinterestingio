			<p>What Netflix pays must still be hefty though.  All of these originals that they're footing the bill to produce are apparently cheaper than paying licensing fees. <br><br>Maybe it's an expense over time comparison.  It might cost a lot to make now, but it's theirs now and they don't have to pay themselves anything to keep playing it, years from now, sort of deal.   Dunno, but I thought it was interesting that producing content is cheaper than licensing it.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Right, it's about broadcast windows.  When you make a production, you have a number of broadcast windows pre-sold.  The network that you most closely associated with it gets the first window, and has exclusivity for some period of time, like two years.  A show might have several other windows pre-sold before it goes into syndication and can be broadcast by many others.  Netflix gets it much later.  <br><br>What I have always found fascinating is that those of us who only use Netflix and are happy to wait several years for the content to filter down, need &quot;suckers&quot; to pay cable rates for new content.  Somebody has to pay for cable so that AMC can make the walking dead and breaking bad.  This is precisely why Netflix has taken their handsome war chest and started making original content.  That stuff is way more expensive to them but they have no choice.  They are going to put cable companies out of business.  They are canibalizing their own source of content, they need a business that doesn't depend on them.  In the long term, it will be interesting to see if they can hold their price point when they have to produce a significant amount of their own content.  I suspect the business model depends on the fact that cable/broadcast television is full of fat.  They make hundreds of pilots and hope one of them works.  Netflix uses data to figure out what people actually watch.  The ratio of failures to successes for Netflix original content is off the charts.  It's sort of like the Moneyball of TV.  The old guard used some combination of bad statistics (Nielsen ratings) and withcraft to greenlight new shows.  So naturally most of them suck.</p>		</li>
