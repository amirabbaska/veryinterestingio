			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. People on this thread are really overthinking it. It's quite simple. When network content is brand new it is at its peak value. you pay a cable company to watch any brand new content or live content that is currently airing. The next day Hulu can acquire the rights to stream the new episodes but they are still very costly because the episodes are still new so they air commercials like cable does. A full year later when the episode has become very cheap Netflix acquires the rights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is what people always forget when they complain about hulu charging a subscription fee and still having commercials. By having the commercials I'm able to watch a new episode of a show the next day instead of waiting X amount of time for the entire season to be on Netflix. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People, myself included, understand this fact. What I don't understand is why Hulu doesn't offer a tiered service, allowing me to pay more to not watch commercials. Hell, I'd pay just to not see the <em>same</em> commercial multiple times after I already stated the commercial isn't relevant!</p>
<p>I used to like Hulu because they had fewer commercials, meaning I spent less than a full hour watching a show. Now the commercial breaks are expanding and loading issues are resulting in my spending more than an hour watching an hour-long episode. This is unacceptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By having an internet connection and a p2p client I can have episodes the next day without commercials.</p>
<p>There should be SOME way of paying for them without ads through Hulu. My time is precious and I will not happily waste it with commercials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true; networks have no right to set the prices for cable companies. They actually probably pay less for the content then Netflix does.</p>
<p>Assuming a cable company is licensed by the FCC and has signal retransmission consent, all it needs to do is follow the statutory prescription of 17 USC ยง 111. </p>
<p>Netflix is not, by definition, a cable company, so it bargains for its content in a free market.</p>
<p>The major reasoning behind this is that Congress instituted a statutory license to enable the cable market to grow. Not only does it cost a ton to invest in the infrastructure to carry a cable signal (probably where the costs for cable come from, since after all, Netflix already has it's distribution channels set up through the Internet), but cable companies, at the time, played a very important public communications role by bringing broadcast signals to rural areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hulu is just the large corporations coming together to build a Netflix competitor, but not doing as well of a job.  I know that the content costs more, but it's coming from the parent companies.  As far as I'm aware, content isn't price controlled so the companies wouldn't have to license it to Hulu for the same price as they would to Netflix, so Hulu could have the advantage of cheaper prices due to the fact that they are owned by major studios.  I tried Hulu Plus, didn't like it, then found out that they are just the major studios.  So now I dislike them even more based on principle.  The major studios aren't evil.  They make plenty of good content.  My problem is that they try to charge too much for me, and most of that is to probably support the monster of a legacy company that they've grown into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people, me included, don't want to watch partial TV seasons. I often wait until a series <em>ends</em> so I can watch it straight through and follow the multi-show, multi-season story arcs that run through the best ones. <em>Breaking Bad</em> is an example.</p>
<p>Edit: Point being, offering entire seasons to watch <em>sans</em> commercials is one reason I subscribe to Netflix and only have the most basic cable offering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a lot of where I'm at. I've stopped watching TV shows on TV (sports aside) because I binge-watch. Even if I didn't binge-watch, I'd want to be able to consume a full series in a relatively short amount of time compared to the years it takes.</p>
<p>There are a few series I like that are currently split between two half seasons (a winter and a summer) and it drives me insane-- Netflix doesn't even get the new season until both the winter AND summer halves have ended. I've simply stopped trying to keep up with any shows that aren't completely over.</p>
<p>In some ways, I think Netflix has ruined a lot of us-- many of my friends and I would watch shows each week as they came out, but now? If we can't watch all at once, it's not worth watching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why I won't watch Game of Thrones yet, despite how much people insist I should be watching it now.  It sorta drives me nuts that I watched the Walking Dead before it finished cuz now I got months to wait before the next episode and its driving me nuts.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And they do zero sports. Sports are a huge bastion of cable companies because everyone wants to watch them and they have to be watched quickly. Many people won't even timeshift a game until the next day because the results will already be blasted all over the news. So they wind up sitting through the commercials. There are very few ways left to get people to sit through commercials and sports is probably the biggest one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly...</p>
<p>I think it's a <em>bad</em> show but I can't get enough of it. I can't explain why I like it, at all, and I probably wouldn't recommend it to someone without telling them that I think it's a bad show.</p>
<p>Yet, I still binge watched both seasons when they were put up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hemlock Grove could've been awesome. As it stands, it's <em>okay.</em> The acting is what kills it. Bill Skarsgรฅrd, specifically, is insufferable. I get that Roman is supposed to be an apathetic, dejected teenager, but Bill delivers every line like he personally is an apathetic, dejected teenager being forced to act on a show he doesn't like. This is especially obvious in any scene Roman is supposed to show emotion, where instead Bill just twists his face a little bit and gives a slightly exaggerated version of his normal delivery.</p>
<p>On the upside: Landon Liboiron, Madeleine Martin (even though I think Shelley is a distraction more than anything else), and Famke Janssen are all phenomenal. Just not good enough, in my opinion, to make up for Bill.</p>
<p>I love Twin Peaks. I love Dark Shadows. I even enjoyed Tim Burton's reimagining of Dark Shadows. I'm the ideal audience for Hemlock Grove, and I wanted so bad to love it. What a pity.</p></div>		</li>
