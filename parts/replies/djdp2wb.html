<p>The toys may use something different, like an induction coil, but the basic principle is the same - they extract more current over a shorter time.</p>

<p>Electric fly swatters and portable Geiger-MÃ¼ller tubes usually make use of high voltage cascades or charge pumps fed by oscillators. Their functional principle is slightly counter-intuitive (at least in my opinion). They work by transporting charge through a ladder-shaped circuit consisting of capacitors and diodes, creating a series of capacitors that in total result in a much higher voltage than the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only partially true.</p>
<p>Capacitors don't increase voltage.   To raise voltage you need to use a boost circuit (for DC) or windings (for AC).</p>
<p>9v behind a 10Ah 1C cell still won't pass a lot of current because the voltage isn't enough to overcome human resistance.</p>
<p>If your body is say ~4MOhm from one hand to another then a 9000mV cell will pass 0.00225mA of current which is why you don't feel it.</p>
<p>edit:  I just measured myself from thumb to thumb at 1.6MOhm.  So feel free to multiply that current by 3x.  It's still a tiny tiny amount of current.</p></div>		</li>
