I can imagine an exasperated news reporter each night rattling off the details leaving many an uninformed viewer thinking the world is quite literally coming to an end.  &quot;In other news, scientists are currently monitoring 7 red-zone active super volcanoes each of which will cause civilization ending destruction when they erupt.  Good luck everybody!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
