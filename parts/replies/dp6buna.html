			<div class="markdown"><p>this is such an honest answer.  I wish more people who know a lot about science would talk about things in these kinds of terms with full admission of what we know or don't know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what do we KNOW?  people talk about what they know all the time.  It's really what they believe to be true.  The dangerous thinking is when people stubbornly cling to what they &quot;know' when evidence mounts up pointing another way.</p>
<p>Nobody likes being &quot;wrong&quot; - but in science, and much of life, if we admit that what we &quot;know&quot; is based on what we believe to be true, we can all be more honest.  But that's hard...or it wouldn't be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the scientific mindset is more fairly characterized as &quot;based on the explanation that seems to best fit the currently available evidence&quot; rather than &quot;based on what we believe.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, sadly, there are some so-called scientists who are guilty of not actually applying a scientific mindset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's science: The amount we don't know is infinity.</p>
<p>Like CERN came out recently (last week?) and admitted according to their models and the experiments they've completed, they universe shouldn't exist. Something is still funky in the standard model because we haven't found an asymmetry yet, so nothing would keep the proto-universe from annihilating itself in a matter-antimatter reaction the instant it formed according to our current theories and best guesses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem i see frequently is that when scientists are honestly opening up about things they do not know 100%, this sounds to non-scientific folks like nothing is more than a bet, or a simple opinion.</p>
<p>Take the examples of climate change or vaccinations. The moment you say that climate change is a scientific theory, some people hear that it's just an idea that has the same value and weight as the video they watched on youtube.</p>
<p>I do not have a solution for that. I agree with you that scientists should never hide what they do not know, but it's becoming more and more dangerous for society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And continental drift/plate tectonics are recent enough that older geology professors talk about it being the &quot;new thing&quot; when they were in college. Just confirmed to everyone's general satisfaction. I spoke to one who's advisor was the guy that convinced the us military to map the ocean floor during WWII, which showed the bands from polarity shifts spreading out to either side of the mid ocean ridges. Apparently said advisor took a boat to where he figured a ridge would be, and stepped out into shallow water in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to prove the existence of the mid ocean ridges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plate Tectonics wasn't even accepted until at least the '50s. When it was proposed in the '30s geologists didn't like it because there wasn't any proposed mechanism, and the dude that came up with it was a random meteorologist. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Heck, Even continental drift (aka plate tectonics today) is barely more than 100 years old.  We're as sure as we can be, until we learn more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of continental drift is hundreds of years old, although it wasn't until Alfred Wegener published his work in 1915 that a serious attempt to argue for it with global evidence was used. </p>
<p>Plate Tectonics is much younger (it celebrated its 60th anniversary this year), and is the overarching theory of the rigid plates which shuffle about over the mantle, thus giving the mechanism for continental drift which Wegener required so desperately. Plate tectonics naturally came later as it requires geophysical evidence from the solid Earth (that earthquake seismology coming in handy again), and an understanding of the seafloor, which is irritatingly covered with several thousand metres of water. </p></div>		</li>
