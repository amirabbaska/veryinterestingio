			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful telling people your dog is part wolf. In America if your dog bites someone and you claim it's part wolf the dog can be put down so it can be tested for rabies. Rabies vaccines are approved for dogs but not wolves. The only way to test for rabies is to dissect the brain. r/dogs has threads on this subject every now and then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if your &quot;hybrid&quot; bites anyone for any reason and the police find out you've at any time claimed your dog is a hybrid, whether it really is or not and even if it's up to date on its vaccinations, they would be obligated to test it for rabies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, how did the vet know? People always ask us if our dog is part wolf because he's huge - I don't think he is really (now that I see that link on hybrids I <em>really</em> don't think so, unless he's only very tiny part wolf) but how can you be sure short of a DNA test?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really wanted the brain dissection thing to be out of date. I had to believe we found a better way by now. We haven't, and you are right. Worse, out of the 120,000 a year only 6% are positive for rabies. Poor guys.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of those 120,000 will be wild bats and raccoons. Domesticated dogs are virtually never put down for brain testing, especially if the bite was provoked and the dog was appropriately immunized as a pup. In almost all cases, a 10 day observation period is sufficient. This is because an infected dog can only transfer rabies after becoming symptomatic and most dogs with rabies will die within 10 days of onset of symptoms. Thus, if a dog was truly infectious when it bit you, it really should almost always be dead by day 10 and at the very least have begun to show clinical symptoms in that time period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just popping in to remind everyone: Most dogs are NOT like this. In general dogs need proper training and naturally the proper temperament to be a successful guard dog. Don't go out and get a large dog just because you need security or think it's cool, unless you are willing to do the extensive training necessary!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>He knows the tricks, won't do one unless I have a treat in my hand.</p>
<p>If I'm taking too long to go through the routine of tricks he'll do them all back to back to back to back to back without me telling him.</p>
<p>Like I'll ask him to shake hands, then the other, he'll just like high five me with both his paws and then be like, bitch give me my treat now.</p></div>		</li>
