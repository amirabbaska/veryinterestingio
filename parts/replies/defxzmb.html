			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, Tony Hawk's longevity especially in the competitive world is truly remarkable. Most professional skateboarders, unfortunately, wash out over time. There is constant pressure to do bigger and more dangerous tricks, and unlike in a lot of other professional sports, being a professional skateboarder doesn't really pay that well on average as most of your income will come from sponsorships (that don't really pay that well) and winning contests (which a lot of professional skateboarders choose not to compete in for various reasons). The wear and tear skateboarding does to your body, coupled with the fact that you're not exactly rolling in it means a lot of pros call it quits after 5-10 years. Whereas Hawk was professionally active for well over two decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I realize this is an ELI5 on how Hawk got so famous, but he was also deeply humble and loved seeing others succeed in the sport he loved so much.</p>
<p>I will always remember the day when him and Sal were commentating the x-games best trick and lost their minds over Bob Burnquist's run: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZFeHUdEQ1Zs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ZFeHUdEQ1Zs</a></p>
<p>Tony was famous for some flashy tricks, but he LOVED watching people pull some of the most technical stuff and he's just so overjoyed to see other skaters do amazing things. It's not just that he was great or an ambassador, but he truly loved it and it showed so clearly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Had chills watching that video and I didn't even know what was going on. There's nothing like sports on this planet, the purest form of entertainment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely the same, but Bob has always been my favorite and i was losing my shit too, it wasn't even that run it was his failing on it the previous runs and the buildup to that, I was losing my shit too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Activision about a series of skateboarding video games with his name on it. Those games reached demographics that would never touch a skateboard in real life and Hawk's name was front and center.</p>

<p>Yep, that's how I first heard about Tony Hawk... his first N64 title was pretty cool, even though I have never skateboarded or followed it. After playing that game a fair amount my brothers and I watched the X-Games a few times and Tony was always doing something pretty neat on there, and if they ever interviewed him all I remember is he seemed like a decent guy.</p></div>		</li>
