			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it would depend on the vacuum you're pulling.  At the highest vacuums achievable I doubt it.  We use turbomolecular pumps which are basically fans running at thousands of rpm's.  They are effective up to around 10^-12 torr.  Around that range you have to start using capture pumps.  So basically at a certain point fans don't really work anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In another line of inquiry about your 'common' fan in this vacuum chamber. I don't think your fan would work for long anyway.</p>
<p>In space <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/" target="_blank">getting rid of heat is a challenge </a>. When you are creating a vacuum you are kind of creating a little bit of space here on Earth. Your fans motor remains cool by the air it is pushing moving over it. As the air becomes more rarefied it will no longer have enough convection to carry the heat away. It will still take a long time for it to overheat because the blades are no longer pushing the weight of the air and the friction of the bearings will the primary heat generation source.</p>

<p>Uhm, wouldn't the fan spin faster without air resistance, putting increased friction into the ball bearings?</p>
<p>In other words, would running a fan in a vacuum decrease the wattage of the fan at all?  If not, then the heat build up shifts, but does not slow down.  The fan would actually die faster, not slower, due to decreased air resistance.  Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be an issue in space, but here on earth the fan would be connected to the walls of the chamber somehow and could conduct the heat away from the fan and into the surrounding air.  We have plenty of fans running in ultra high vacuum environments and they don't overheat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually use diaphragm pumps that work on that principle but they can't get to a very low vacuum.  One issue is that for that to work the two surfaces would have to have 100% contact with absolutely no air molecules anywhere in between them.  That's pretty much impossible.  Even if you could achieve that somehow though, the materials will still outgas some, and you have no means of pumping out the molecules, so your vacuum would gradually degrade.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue: The materials that make a useful diaphragm will be either slightly permeable, or slightly off-gassing themselves.  While fine for moderate vacuum, they are inherently unsuited for hard vacuums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because sealing something like that to keep any decent level of vacuum would be insanely difficult. It's tough enough using really good vacuum fittings like conflat fittings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably possible, but I imagine it'd be hard to perfectly seal the moving walls. Also, it would be near impossible to place things in the chamber. </p></div>		</li>
