			<div class="markdown"><p>Just saying that you can add additional context to your question in the text box that follows it. Some subreddits (notably AskReddit) don't allow it, but we do - that way, more people will see your clarification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the basic idea is that an object will keep whatever velocity it has (aka has a net 0 acceleration) until some outside force like gravity or maybe even just some dust particles in the way change its velocity. In space (and everywhere) there is always gravity acting on everything with mass. In order for an object to speed up, something needs to give it energy. Maybe the object is heading towards a black hole, which is pulling it harder the closer it gets. So let's say you strap on a little engine that somehow can generate infinite energy at will. As you try to accelerate an object closer and closer to the speed of light, space will literally resist it more, and the energy required to speed it up gets higher and higher. In order to actually accelerate mass to the speed of light it is proposed you would need an infinite amount of energy. This is where the cosmic speed limit, c, the speed of light comes from. Light is massless, and anything with mass can only at best come close to c with finite energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. They don't slow down, there is no force acting on them.</p>
<p>You can experience 1 unit of time, or 1 unit of speed, or any ratio between. No matter how fast you move, the time you experience and the speed you experience always adds up to 1.</p>
<p>Since you need to experience time in order to accelerate, you can never truly reach 1 full unit of speed. Light travels at a speed of 1, this is because the nature of light is not to experience time, this is because light has no mass. No mass = no time, 0 time means 1 speed.</p>
<p>It turns out 1 unit of speed = 299,792,458 m/s however this strange number only reflects on our choices for the meter and the second. The &quot;size&quot; of a meter and the &quot;duration&quot; of a second are arbitrary. The speed of light is absolute.</p></div>		</li>
