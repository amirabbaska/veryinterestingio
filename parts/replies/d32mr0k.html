			<div class="markdown"><p>Periscopes are the correct answer. Having visited several of the sites, as well as being involved in the explosives field, I have been in many bunkers which use mirrors for viewing detonations from much closer than you would think is feasible. </p>
<p>-edit- the periscopes are not the type you would see on a submarine. They are larger mirror arrays that sit behind extremely thick bulletproof glass. They survive because of the sacrificial glass layers stopping fragmentation, as well as diverting blast over pressure. Some of the blast wave does affect the solid materials such as the glass and the bunker, however they can tolerate the shock since they aren't fleshy meat bags.</p>
<p>TLDR: Solid objects suffer less from blast overpressure than fleshy meat bags with hollow winds sacs in their chest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it surprises a lot of people... all you really need to protect you from a nuke is a few feet of sand. If you've got 6 feet of sand over your head, it'd basically have to hit you directly to kill you. 10 - 20 feet and it'd have to be a <strong>really</strong> big nuke. </p>
<p>Fallout's a different problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can survive pretty close to the explosion range in an underground bunker, as long as your entrance is fortified enough you'll be fine. You could probably even watch someone get Terminator Skeletoned in-front of your periscope.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is getting out, along with (in weapons of war) the intense radioactivity, but again all of these things are survivable at a close distance, it just costs A LOT to fortify a bunker against closer and closer radius's </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about being that close. We are talking more like a few hundred yards from many many thousands of pounds of conventional (non-nuclear) detonations. Safe distance without the bunker worked out to be something like 2.7 miles away. I can't attest to much for the sites used for filming nuclear tests. The bunkers we got to visit were for personnel, and we're still rather far from the detonation sites. Of course this was for later tests. The earliest test such as the Trinity Device we done with people out in the open, miles and miles away, watching the detonation with nothing but tinted goggles for their eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man when they shot the revolver, I thought to myself; they should enlarge it, delete the gun, remove the water, turn the background black, and add some stars. You would then have the special effects for the next Star Wars movie of a tie fighter blowing up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How come that hollow point out of the revolver didn't tumble as it went through the water, but the handgun round (.45?) and the 7.62 did? Is it because the revolver round had higher velocity than the Iger two?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some of the Mythbusters scenes you can see that they have a concrete block to protect their cameras from the blast and a mirror to allow the cameras to look at the blast. I guess the mirror gets destroyed but the cameras (hopefully) survives and just needs its image mirrored in post production. However they still have a consumption of video cameras as you can see missing angles when they repeat the blasts or you can see a camera in one angle but never see any footage from that cameras angle. I guess they lost some cameras in the nuclear tests as well and only show us the ones that survived.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or, you can build a really sturdy building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People often overestimate how &quot;sturdy&quot; such a building would need to be.</p>
<p>In Hiroshima, there was a public lavatory less than 500 meters (~520 yards) away from the hypocenter. It survived the explosion, and is today used once again as a public lavatory.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yUWW0yQ.jpg" target="_blank">Picture proof</a></p>
<p>The bomb used in Hiroshima was comparably small, of course, but still: a strong concrete building a few hundred meters away from an a-bomb can easily survive the explosion. Even if people inside of the building might not.</p></div>		</li>
