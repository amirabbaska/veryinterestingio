			<div class="markdown"><p>What you &quot;see&quot; is the left over photons that enter your eyes that only fall within the visible spectrum of light which has <em>NOT</em> been absorbed by anything else. That's what the rods/cones in our retinas are activated by to send electrical impulses to our brain for our brain to construct an image of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This analogy is good but a bit incomplete. I'll add that the walls don't PERFECTLY absorb the light that hits it in the same way that a high pressure water hose sprayed at a sponge isn't sucked all away. Droplets (photons) get shot off in all directions - this is the mechanism of how we actually see light when it hits objects because reflected photons hit our eyes - and those bounced photons are absorbed after a few additional collisions with the room's walls.</p>
<p>Also a minor fact - the light's energy gets transformed into heat energy, so the light just turns into ever-so-slightly warmer walls in that room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No real perceivable difference other than a tiny bit more heat created if you don't &quot;instantly&quot; close the door. Very few photons aren't absorbed so almost all of them get converted to heat instantly, and none reflect back outward through whatever mechanism you used to let the light in before sealing the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so suppose you have two kids rooms, one pink and the other blue. In the final fraction of this extremely short amount of time, would those rooms turn more pink and blue respectively? And likewise, would it take longer for the light to vanish in a bright colored room than it would a dark colored room? Given light refraction and all that. And how about the input of the light source, does that then also impact the speed? </p></div>		</li>
