			<div class="markdown"><p>That probably warrants it's own question since the mechanics of a metal spring are pretty different than the mechanics of what are basically strings. Like the cables technically exhibit some &quot;spring&quot; behavior in the way it twists, sort of how it bends and strethes, but since strings aren't rigid and don't stretch nearly as much as slinkies, and aren't coiled (which changes the dynamics) it's just a very different problem.</p>
<p>I think you should make a new post, that's a really insightful and interesting question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens here is the slinky gets bent into a horseshoe. when this happens, it is pretty easy for one tip of the slinky to get threaded through the other coil. From there, the springyness twists the slinky around itself and ends up with two attached coils.</p>
<p>Sorry, if this doesn't make sense, I can't find a slinky to take example pictures of.</p></div>		</li>
