			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one a few days ago form just above my lip. It hurt so damn bad. You know what I had to do. My wife gets so angry when I do it and warns me about scars (and possible infections). BUT fuck it, it hurts. I wash my hands and take care of it. Plus I am nearly 40 and don't care if my face has blemishes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a pimple, and the infection (pus) is not at the surface of your skin, take a ball of tissue and run it under the hottest tap water and place it on the pimple for a minute or two. The infection will rise further to the surface of your skin, making it easier to pop and give you less of a scar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's nearly a white-head then really popping it isn't that big a deal. It's when they're  just red and inflamed and there's not even any fluid in it and people start digging that's the real issue. </p>
<p>If it's hurting, that means there's a lot of internal pressure, and it's probably doing some damage just by being there. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>- wow why is this getting so many upvotes lol, please visit r/skincareaddiction if you want to learn more about proper skin care, they will also tell you not to pop, which I agree generally, if you absolutely must, using a sterile lancet is ideal, but most of us are truly lazy animals driven by the need to self-groom. </p>
<p>Most of your basic pimple woes will be solved with a chemical exfoliant (a retinol, benzyl peroxide, salicylic acid or an alpha-hydroxy acid like lactic acid, choose one), and regular moisturizing and gentle cleansing. You really only need 3 products and water to have happy skin. </p>
<p>If you have severe skin issues like chronic cystic acne please consider seeing a dermatologist! </p></div>		</li>

<p>The blood supply that feeds that part of the skin drains into the arteries that feed your brain, so if you get an infection in that part of your skin, it can seed bacteria into your brain's sinuses and lead to meningitis. </p>
<p>I mean, it's extremly rare, but still a large enough risk that any dermatolgist worth his salt will tell you to avoid fucking around with any pimples or cuts on that part of your face. If you skin is broken or you have a pimple there, just wash it with soap and water and leave it the fuck alone. Even at a 1/10,000 chance, you don't want to be the person who dies of meningitis because you squeezed a zit on your upper lip</p></div>		</li>
