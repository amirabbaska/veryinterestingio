<p>I've always asked myself the &quot;enamel rebuilding&quot; question. I would see sensodyne ads on TV for enamel rebuilding toothpaste, but I can never find it in the store. I always assumed it just fell under their &quot;pronamel&quot; line. Now this makes so much sense.</p>
<p>Do you have any literature on the effectiveness of Novamin? I am strongly considering switching toothpastes now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Based on the results of this in vitro investigation it appears that NovaMin has a higher capability to enhance enamel resistance against caries development by altering its surface microhardness when compared to Topex fluoride tooth paste.&quot;

<p>&quot;A total of 60 sound human freshly extracted teeth were subjected to a pH-cycling protocol.&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I decided to get Novamin toothpaste when I read about it on reddit some time ago.<br />
If the dentists in the US lobbied for exclusive rights to use it and for a ban of general sales, it must work</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sensodyne Repair and Protect in Canada also has Novamin.</p>
<p>I found it much more effective for temperature sensitivity issues than the previous Sensodyne product I was using. </p></div>		</li>
