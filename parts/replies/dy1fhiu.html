			<div class="markdown"><p>Didn't America also kind of &quot;throw off&quot; the British initially by not firing in Gentleman's Warefare and choosing more guerilla tactics?</p>
<p>Or is that a myth I picked up a few years ago?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. In many theaters of the war, the US did fight in the more conventional manners of the times, but the US also did a lot of things that were viewed as ungentlemanly. Washington's victory at Trenton and Princeton, for example, we're surprise attacks during the Christmas holiday. In the South especially, Americans took to hit-and-run; the south also had a pretty serious problem of loyalist clashes with revolutionaries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. More in the fact that the British soldiers were far from home in a huge land, where every bush and barn became a threat. When the population revolted, Britain just couldn’t project the power to the New World. And let us not forget the French as a rather big thorn in their side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fewer than 25% were supportive of the war, and most of that 25% weren't fighters. So it wasn't every barn became a threat, it was a collapse in command chains, supply, and most importantly moral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were some battles where the Americans fought the British with the traditional line volleys that were common in that time but also chose to fight the more guerilla type of war. This is not to say that the British did not adapt to these tactics, they were probably the best trained and ran army in the world at the time.
As the war went on, the British Army adapted their fighting tactics to combat the more 'Indian' style of fighting of the Americans. I learned in one of my college classes about the American Revolution that the British Army was incredibly adaptive even during battle and could change from the lined volley fire to spread out lines of two man teams at a moments notice to make American volley or guerilla fire less effective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of America's success is other countries conveniently fighting each other. We got independence because England was busy and we were able to get the help of their enemy, France, who basically carried the war. Then we got a good deal on a lot of land from France when France needed money cause they were busy fighting in Europe again.</p>
<p>For a long time, we were chilling on our own continent, expanding, developing internally, and sipping on tea in response to everything going on in Europe that was none of our business.</p>
<p>Then we joined a foreign world war late and got to sit at the winner's table. Then we joined a foreign world war late and got to sit at the winner's table <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>And by that point we were so far above everyone else except the Soviet Union... and then it broke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you left out a great number of conflicts. It's not like the US spent the 19th century &quot;chilling on our own continent&quot; and ignoring the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Putting aside the conflicts fought in North America (and there were a bunch), during the 19th century the US participated in fifteen conflicts and wars, of various sizes and intensities, all across the globe.</p></div>		</li>
