<p>I think you've just clued me in on what it was on one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. I'm going to have to try this for myself. (Some of the other ingredients were black beans and chicken)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, though, five large red onions will give you enough onion jam for four sandwiches or burgers. Slice them thin so they don’t take 12 hours. It’s easy to cook them too fast, so be careful you don’t burn them. Start with medium low, the lid off, and salt them right away. The salt helps draw out the liquid. When they’re cooking down and looking less soupy, put the lid on and turn the heat to very low. Stir occasionally. You can add a little water if it seems like they’re getting too dry and will burn before they cook down.
You’re looking for a long period of cooking where they kind of gum up on the bottom of the pan without browning. Like Oh shit I forgot to stir it, Oh, it’s fine.</p>
<p>After a few hours you can add some garlic cloves -- you want the garlic to get mushable but not disintegrate. Towards the end, when you’re getting tired of waiting, you take off the lid to hurry them along. You can add some balsamic vinegar or honey or both at that point. Don’t add any extra salt until they’re done and you’re absolutely sure it’s needed.</p>
<p>Don’t add baking soda. It’s nasty.</p>
<p>You can make a huge batch and freeze some. Just put it in a ziploc and squeeze out the air. Then it’s best if you heat it up with a little more balsamic vinegar.</p>
<p>My favorite use would be on a burger with bacon and blue cheese. Good luck with your sandwich! I make a lot of sandwiches with leftover roasted chicken, two or three times a week. I’ll have to try something with onion jam and black beans. (Speaking of, Rosarita makes nice seasoned black beans, which around here is stocked on the shelves with the Mexican food, and not with the other canned beans. They make the best back bean patties.)</p></div>		</li>
