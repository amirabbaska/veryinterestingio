<p>The first comment is &quot;sloths are bags of intestines&quot;. Even so there are plenty of animals that would still eat it.</p>
<p>Obviously the major factors are</p>
<p>1: too big for aerial/arboreal predators</p>
<p>2: too high for ground predators</p>
<p>3: camouflaged and adapted to spend as little time on the ground as possible, so the odd jaguar that might be capable of climbing a tree to get to it rarely finds one</p></div>		</li>
