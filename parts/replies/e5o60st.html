			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck, take two balloons filled with air, poke one down where the rubber is thick around nozzle and the other in the main body of the balloon. On the one where the rubber is thicker the balloon will slowly deflate, while on the other the escaping air through the stretched balloon will cause the hole to tear itself bigger until it's big enough for the air to all escape quickly. </p>
<p>The size of the hole is only as important as the strength of the material the hole is in. This hole was drilled through metal so the metal wasn't going anywhere to allow the hole to expand (that said, I doubt there'd be much of the ISS's inner surfaces that'd be thin and flimsy enough to rupture from the air like a balloon skin, even if the pressure was higher inside)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, so the bursting of the balloon is essentially caused by a chain reaction? As the hole gets larger, more air can be sucked out, widening the hole, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hole was roughly 2x2mm. A portal-type door is roughly 24x48 inches. Iirc, they said it would take a week to evacuate the station of air with the small hole. Given that timeline, the ratio of the surface areas of the two holes,  and the number of seconds in a week, also assuming the two volumes are equal, a door-sized hole would evacuate in about 9 seconds. Does that track with what you saw in the movie?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the reasons balloons and airships lasted as long as they did into the 20th century (WWII). Shoot a bunch of holes in it, the thing will still stay up for hours. Even hydrogen balloons were surprisingly difficult to kill (hydrogen burns, but not in the absence of oxygen, and hydrogen balloons typically had little oxygen in the bladders). </p></div>		</li>
