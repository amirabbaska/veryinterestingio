<p>They also have to be the same model (You can't combine a GTX 1080 with a GTX 970, for example)</p>

<p>Are there other ways of combining GPUs? I've seen a youtuber list his specs as:</p>
<p>GPU1: GTX 980</p>
<p>GPU2: GTX 680</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you can have two separate cards work independently. SLI is only if you want two cards working for a single output.</p>
<p>The YouTuber you've seen likely has a dual monitor setup where the 980 is for his main screen and the 680 is for the second screen.</p></div>		</li>
