			<div class="markdown"><p>You can derive an equation describing the propagation of gravitational waves from the Einstein field equations. These equations describe how matter and energy &quot;bend&quot; spacetime. The wave equation contains a constant that is the wave's velocity. It turns out to be the speed of light. </p>
<p>A much more heuristic particle physics derivation works by noting that if the particle mediating gravitational interactions were massive, we wouldn't get Newton's 1/r^2 force law. Instead we'd find an extra exponential suppression. Since this is not present, the graviton must be massless and must therefore travel at the speed of light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>History question - when someone comes up with an equation like Einstein's Field Equations - would they normally figure out a lot of the implications before they publish?  As in, would Einstein have been like &quot;Well, we have this equation that I've shown mathematically works, and I noticed while I was working that it also tells me that gravity travels at C!  Isnt' that interesting?&quot;  Or would Einstein work out his equation and publish it, and then someone else would make the next leap (Or Einstein would later make the leap) to rework it to show the propagation of gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does gravitons &quot;shine&quot; from any matter in all directions or is it simply an information transfer between all pairs of particles in the universe?
All that gravity information must despite being massless have some sort of energy (like photons). Where does this energy come from? From what I know even sufficient amounts of energy without mass can create a black hole (bend spacetime). So will enough gravitons fizzing through our galaxy affect the curvature of spacetime as a sideeffect? Gravity affecting itself? Could that explain some aspects of dark matter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are trying to say, but EM waves are propagated by photons the same as visible light is, whereas gravitational waves are not.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at Wikipedia, the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank">speed of light</a>&quot; seems like a default speed in our universe in general, unless something is slowed down by having a mass or moving through a medium (or possibly something else).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not exactly the default, instead everything moves at the speed of light <em>c</em>, yes everything, including you, but everything moves through space AND time. You can imagine it as a vector of constant size (<em>c</em>) in a grid <em>x,y</em> where <em>x</em> is space and <em>y</em> is time. When you are standing still, your vector is pointing up so that you only move in the time dimension. When you rocket yourself into space, just walking on earth, you simply rotate the vector such that you are now moving both through space and time, and the faster you move through space, the less you move through time (that's why if you go very fast, close to speed of light and get back to earth you are younger than the people who stayed on earth and the reason is because you were moving in time slower than they did). When you all your speed is spent in space (the vector is pointing right), then you don't experience time anymore. </p>
<p>Now for some reason which is unclear to me there is a relationship between mass and speed. The photon being a massless particule (it doesn't weight anything) travels  full speed in space only. From its point of view there is no such thing as beginning or end, its entire lifetime is a dot, it doesn't experience time, it doesn't get old, it just is. </p>
<p>So it is exactly that <em>c</em> is the &quot;default&quot; speed as if there could be other speed. <em>c</em> is the speed at which everything is moving and the photon or graviton are simply moving through space only and not through time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a large mass undergoing some sudden change in acceleration; the &quot;news&quot; about where the mass is now located spreads outwards at the speed of light, affecting everything in the range that's been reached.</p>
<p>But, space is expanding - every distance is gradually getting larger, creating new space in between every pair of points. The more space there is right now between you and a distant object, the more new space is being created in that gap, and the faster the distance between you is growing as a result. Neither you nor the object is necessarily <em>moving</em> exactly, you're just being carried away from each other, like ants on the surface of an inflating balloon.</p>
<p>Pushed to the limit, there are regions of the universe so far away that enough new space is being created in between us to carry that region away from ours faster than light travels. A photon trying to travel from here to there will keep going continuously without ever &quot;cutting off&quot;, but enough <em>new</em> space is created in the gap that it's trying to cross that it never actually arrives.</p>
<p>The same happens with the gravity; its effects keeps spreading into new space at the speed of light but <em>more</em> space keeps appearing in its way, keeping it from reaching us. There's no fixed point where it stops, but it still won't reach everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A bit off topic, but does this mean the distance between earth and the sun is growing? </p>
<hr />
<p><em>edit</em>: <a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2727/" target="_blank">Found</a> my own answer, leaving it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Space is expanding and it’s carrying the galaxies along with it for the ride.  They're all receding from us, and we think they're being pushed apart by a force that we call dark energy, and this is currently accelerating the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>The larger the distance between bodies, the stronger they push to drive them apart.  Conversely, gravity - which we’re a bit more used to - is a property of matter, and it’s a pulling force, so that opposes the expansion, and the gravitational pull is stronger the more mass that’s there, and depends on how close you are to it.</p>
<p>So, <strong>whether the pull of gravity, or the push of dark energy dominates over a given region of the universe, depends on how much mass is there, and how widely separated it is.  If they're far apart, the push of the dark energy wins, but if they're close together, gravity is going to dominate.</strong></p>
<p>In astronomical terms, our solar system is absolutely tiny.  The planets and the sun, and all the constituents of our solar system, are very close together, and there’s no question that gravity wins in that circumstance. </p>
<p>Even on the scales of the galaxy, gravity is the dominating force.  Even between groups or clusters of galaxies, gravity is gluing them together. <strong>You're only going to get this expansion of space on the very largest scales, where you have sufficient space that the dark energy can dominate.</strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone explained it to me like this: it's like taking a rubber band and placing an ant on it. As the ant starts walking towards one end, you stretch the rubber band. The ant never reaches the end because the rubber band stretches faster than the ant walks. Gravity keeps moving through spacetime but space keeps expanding and at enough distance, the expansion is too great for gravity to overcome. So, yes. At some point, the gravity from an object is too far away and it would &quot;cut off&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if i'm remembering Physics 5a correctly- the force between two masses is</p>
<p>G x mass1 x mass2 / distance ^2</p>
<p>G being the magic # &quot;Gravitational constant&quot;</p>
<p>so the bigger the masses, the bigger the force (proportionally)
but the further the distance, the force drops by the square of the distance.</p>
<p>two masses 2 meters apart is ¼ the force of the same masses 1 meter apart</p>
<p>so.. there's no 'cut off' per se - but yes, it becomes under perception at some point, but never 'gone'.</p></div>		</li>
