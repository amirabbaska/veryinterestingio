			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think he means the &quot;swith&quot; to have a strict binary on/off state, it's probably more of a focus shifting towards internal/external stimuli. He says that basic needs of the body (like hunger/thirst etc) surely require 24/7 &quot;monitoring&quot;.</p>
<p>However, during the night &quot;computational&quot; resources occupied by conscious before are now used to fine-tune internal organs. He claims (and that is where it becomes weird because I never heard of such effects in humans) that sleep deprived rats promtly develop severe digestive tract disfunctions long before any significant changes in the brain can be observed. He also thinks that it's the main why reason people in stress and not enough sleep often suffer from peptic ulcer disease.</p>
<p>Another controversial claim is that overall brain activity during the sleep is almost the same as during the day. I recall I heard quite the opposite and this is one of the reason I hesitated to accept this view and made the post here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the digestive tract issues, I recently <a href="https://vanwinkles.com/how-microbiomes-effect-our-sleep" target="_blank">read about</a> how our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198018/" target="_blank">body chemistry changes</a> when we sleep and that has an <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146643" target="_blank">effect on our microbiome</a>. While it's certainly possible that the brain might process signals from inside the body and use that information to regulate certain aspects of our digestive system, while asleep, there is also the contributing factor that the chemicals in our body change while we are asleep as a part of being asleep, not as a response to &quot;internal stimuli&quot;, and that the various microorganisms within us can be affected by those chemical changes.  </p>
<p>It is an interesting thought, and I am very glad you posted it. It makes me consider, since when we are sick, breastfeeding (which has it's own input/altered-output immune thing going on that is awesome), recovering from medical procedures, etc., we do require so much more sleep. I know that a lot of energy goes into recovering but I hadn't ever thought that there might be computational responses involved instead of a more automated physiological response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks to me like the chemical/neural processes are indeed complimentary in the brain during sleep, one leading to another and one depending on another. So it's possible that all versions in the thread and some more of unnamed ones are true to some extent at the same time!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That statement right there. There have been no causative links between psychological stress and PUD because that sort of stress is a difficult variable to quantify and measure. And that doesn't even get into genetics, lifestyle, or known risk factors of PUD (ie, H. pylori, chronic NSAID use). </p>
<p>This guy's &quot;hypotheses&quot; just don't really mesh with what we know about human biology in general. It would indicate a secondary system running in parallel to all of the different metabolic processes responding to changing environments from second to second. And as /u/pianobutter said, there are issues with the journals he's published in, his format, and lack of basic editing. His &quot;hypotheses&quot; just don't measure up when weighed with or against so much of what we do know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just can not think of a way to link those two pieces of evidence to what he is claiming. For him to cite evidence that stress leads to ulcers is completely irrelevant. Stress, via the HPA axis, releases cortisol. Cortisol, or the stress hormone as some call it, moves blood away from the gastrointestinal tract and more towards the muscles. Chronic prolonged stress can lead to adrenal fatigue. So, intestinal issues due to stress are caused by the bodies autonomic response to a stressor and the subsequent effects of the response, and not because the brain failed to &quot;switch&quot; the computational resources. Does sleep help reverse the effects of stress/sleep deprivation? Yes of course! But I can't see how it would be correct to link that evidence to a computational switch. </p>
<p>As for the second claim, it too is false. The brains energy consumption remains relatively constant. Now different areas of the brain may use more areas than others, however the overall energy consumption of the brain stays steady. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As stated by you, the second statement is true, not false. According to OP, that theory also claims a stable brain activity  through all day. If we spend less energy processing external stimuli, why couldn't we use it for internal ones?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree that this is not a commonly accepted theory, I think you are a little quick on the draw with your counter evidence.</p>
<p>We do in fact know that external stimuli are suppressed during sleep. The fact that this suppression can be overcome is irrelevant. Consider the visual cortex's role in mental imagery: when visualizing, visual cortex &quot;switches&quot; to the purpose of representing a scene that does not exist externally -- but a salient external stimulus will still grab your attention (and cause you to stop visualizing). Switches in the brain are &quot;soft&quot; in that they never suppress 100% of activity.</p>
<p>Now, the theory still seems unlikely to me because visual cortex has evolved to represent visual stimuli, so it seems to me that it would be pretty useless for gastrointestinal stimuli. But it's still an interesting theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean imagining here or &quot;daydreaming&quot; where you visualize a scene you are not actually present in. Contrary to what may seem obvious, further visual cortex areas/higher level brain areas are most active during these tasks. Now this does not say that early visual cortex areas do not play any role at all, it just implies that those processes occur at higher level brain areas and it primarily by the lower levels of the visual cortex.</p></div>		</li>
