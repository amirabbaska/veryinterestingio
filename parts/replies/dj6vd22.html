			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so sure. I was pretty sure that if we're talking about prolonged physical exertion, 'Breaking through the wall', getting ones 'second wind' etc represents  switching from primarily anaerobic energy system (lots of painful lactic acid and oxygen debt)  to a primarily aerobic  (oxygen hungry) metabolic energy system. Once the switch is mostly complete (and oxygen and fat are your primary  fuel sources) you reach an equilibrium, with less oxygen debt and 'pain'  - and you can just 'go'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but you're putting alot of stress on your body.  Not just muscle tears and such but also you don't need your heart rate to be like 150-200+ bpm just because you want to lose weight.  You'll want to save that stress for actually rescuing your wife from a fire</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you actually <em>read</em> the article you linked?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Metabolic Switching:</strong> When non-aerobic glycogen metabolism is insufficient to meet energy demands, physiologic mechanisms utilize alternative sources of energy such as fatty acids and proteins via aerobic respiration.</p>
