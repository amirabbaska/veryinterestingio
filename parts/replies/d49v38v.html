			<div class="markdown"><p>haha, you think that's expensive? a DOMESTIC postcard in Denmark costs $4 using the postal system. International is $6. FOR A POSTCARD!</p>
<p>It's cheaper, faster and more reliable to ship it as a package with any other courier service.</p></div>		</li>

But how much do you pay for shipping when shopping from American websites? I tried to buy $25 USD dollar pants once and the cheapest shipping option was ~$80 USD.
And this was when $1 CAD = $0.68 USD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our postal system is certainly not ok currently, but that's a long story.</p>
<p>I can't say much about shipping prices, as I've never shopped from US websites. There's toll and import VAT on everything from outside EU, and even if the toll is low, there's a handling fee (from the postal service) for processing it. So it's a gamble to guess the total price.</p>
<p>It's easier to find a local distributor of American products.</p></div>		</li>
