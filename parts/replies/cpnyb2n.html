			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my suspicion also. Also, I've seen an increase in boxes that advertise toys, but require you to mail in to get it. This is much less expensive for the company because very few people will actually follow through.</p></div>		</li>

There might still be some at my mom's house, if you ever feel nostalgic and want one, I'd be happy to mail it to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saved up a ton of boxtops for a Mighty Max toy, then asked my dad to send them out.</p>
<p>Roughly four months later, I finally asked my dad how long it had been since we sent in the boxtops, because I felt like I'd been sooooo patient! </p>
<p>The next day my mail-in toy &quot;arrived&quot;- I'm pretty sure what actually happened was that my dad forgot to mail them in, felt bad that I remembered, and just bought me a toy from the store. But at least I got my (vaguely Cthulhu-esque) toy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the same for a watch. It was probably around 10 proofs of purchase as well. I sent them off and came home every day for several weeks wondering if I my watch came in... I Never got a damn thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. i was so excited a few weeks ago at walmart; i saw some brand of cereal advertising a &quot;free book&quot;. after looking over said product, it turned out to be an annoying mail-in. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably right but I find it hard to believe that price is the reason. Usually toys nowadays are made of nothing more than cardboard with things printed on them or a molded plastic piece so there's not really any cost there. Also the price of cereal has shot up tremendously since I was a kid. That used to be the cheap food, not so much anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time McDonalds has a toy, it isn't McDonalds who is paying to put it in there (unless it's a McDonalds toy; Ronald, Grimace, etc). It's paid for by the movie or TV show. Cereal works the same way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also the cost of:</p>
<p>Having a machine to drop the toy in the box</p>
<p>Sending the box of cereal along the conveyor belt to the toy dropping machine</p>
<p>Dealing with occasional errant toy drops that dont correctly make it into the box</p>
<p>The extra volume of cereal that is displaced by the toy, and the impression the customer gets based on the difference between the expected volume of cereal in the box vs the actual cereal plus toy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that last point most cereal bags contain a large volume of air to cushion the cereal from crushing during transport, and make the box look like it contains more on the shelf. Nothing is displaced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you not seen &quot;how it's made&quot;?  The toy insertion is just a simple dispenser at the end just before the box is closed.  No special effort required. I think it's more a matter of return on investment.  They probably did some testing and discovered that the gifts simply did not increase sales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More 'occam's razer' theory I prorpose: It's more cost effective to offer freebies via internet codes and promotions rather than just giving away free product to people without gathering any information on them.</p>
<p>This is the same reason why pepsi and coke don't give those 1/6 freebies on the bottle caps anymore. etc</p></div>		</li>
