			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Moths resting on the underside of leaves in the daytime is a common example. They'll still fly if disturbed. I've seen globe skimmer dragonflies go to sleep on brick walls in India at dusk and often they don't react even if picked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This really depends on the moth. Large silk moths will remain idle, even when touched. They will remain on your hand even, but while vibrating their wings or flopping around to warm their thoracic muscles. Only after can they fly away. This is not so much a diurnality issue, though, but rather that these large insects prioritize the conservation of energy for reproduction instead of flying away. In light of this, these moths thus ofte rely on large eye spots for defense.</p>
<p>That being said, this is probably one of a few exceptions, however.</p></div>		</li>
