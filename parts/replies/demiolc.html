			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a full bladder for me (some of my friends have it too) causes sexual arousal and more intense orgasms and squirting. So we may not have prostates, but a full bladder puts pressure on our sexual organs too. The first orgasm I ever had was when I was a 15-year old virgin and was locked out of the house waiting for my dad who was late getting home. I had chugged a bunch of water after basketball practice, so I sat on the front stoop, shaking my leg desperately trying not to pee my pants. It was a very intense pressure/panic/moaning experience.</p></div>		</li>
