			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Somebody linked the Wikipedia article for that and I read through it. I have experienced that, but this is a different feeling. </p>
<p>A lot of times it happens without me even thinking about anything. I'll pass an 18 wheeler going the opposite direction at night, will get the shiver down my spine, and then I'll have the &quot;if we would have collided that would have been instant death for me&quot; thoughts. </p>
<p>It's as though my subconscious perceived a potential danger and sent a jolt down my spine before I thought of it consciously. </p>
<p>What makes me curious though is that it doesn't happen every time. Passing vehicles on the highway is a very common occurrence, I do it every day. Every once in a while though a random vehicle will trigger the shiver. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it's like your fight or flight mode. Your brain senses danger or death and immediately triggers a response. Who knows, maybe that's the feeling of slight amounts of adrenaline being released. I have no idea how any of that works by the way. </p></div>		</li>
