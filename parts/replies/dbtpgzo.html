<p>IIRC this is actually still happening in Sweden and nordic countries. Due to the weight of the ice during the ice age the ground was pressed down and it's still slowly rising now when it's gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple math. The known area volume of the oceans is considered and the known area volume of the atmosphere is considered. Since gasses that occupy a known space have a predictable pressure as a function of altitude, all you need to do is replace the oceans area volume with the current atmospheric one in the formula. Pick a depth, run it though the formula and you will get how much atmospheric pressure you'd have at a specific depth. I think Crash Course Physics did an episode on this IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I'm understanding this correctly you move the 1atm line down 2600 meters, so if you wanted to see how pressure would change at a specific altitude you would just check what the pressure currently is 2600 meters higher?</p>
<p>So for example, Denver at 1610 m above sea level would have a pressure equal to 4210 m above sea level?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the wind would be terribly destructive. We're talking about a hard vacuum with a volume large enough to contain a sizable fraction of the atmosphere. I believe the wind far from the ocean areas couldn't exceed mach 1, but where atmosphere is falling into vacuum I'm not sure that that holds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not out of your reach, since you can write coherent text. You just need to practice it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help. </p>

<p>If you have problems with basic arithmetic, just practice that. Once that is nailed, comes the more difficult task of using it intelligently. For learning that I'd suggest reading some <a href="https://www.what-if.xkcd.com" target="_blank">what ifs</a>. Those are interesting and illuminating wrt. doing back-of-the-envelope stuff. Then read some what if questions and try to come up with answers yourself. Then you can write answers like the above. </p>
<p>One thing, though. You can learn this in a few hours time. It's somewhat like learning an instrument. It takes practice and some level of dedication, so first figure out if you want it enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as hard as some make it out to be. You probably just had a garbage teacher. Math is really useful so I think it'd be worth your while to give yourself a crash course. The internet has tons of resources so just do some searching and avail yourself. Make sure to watch some videos too since reading often makes people more confused.</p></div>		</li>
