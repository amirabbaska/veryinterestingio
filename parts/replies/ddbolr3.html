<p>He posted an aftermath video after chugging a bottle of vodka so you get to see him trashed. Just because he's alive now doesn't mean his brain isn't melted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal sorry for this. A friend chug the majority of a fifth of vodka in less than a minute. We were all impressed of course. Less than 2 minutes later he gets a look on his face and books it to the bathroom. He rallied but he was rough for the rest of the night.</p></div>		</li>
