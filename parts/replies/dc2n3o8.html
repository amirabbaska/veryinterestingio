			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. But just as /u/NawtAGoodNinja writes: it is only a likely way it could have happened - not confirmed - based on guesses informed by our knowledge on evolution. And it is with good reason that we cannot pinpoint a clear source, since we don't possess the means that would allow us to confirm much about the psychology of the men and women living in the pre-historic past, nor the source or causes for how their psychology developed. For that we would need a living cave man or even just the brain of one. Most educated guess are based on anthropological discoveries and what the skulls of pre-historic man can tell us about the development of the brain. I would be wary of anyone claiming to know the source of any such psychological traits and their development.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's said that during pregnancy, the offspring goes through traces of the evolutionary cycle during that time. Is it possible to &quot;stop&quot; that process and form an &quot;old&quot; organism from this? It obviously wouldn't be the same, but would it be similar enough for certain aspects?</p></div>		</li>
