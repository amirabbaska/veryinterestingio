			<div class="markdown"><p>This is getting there but isn't entirely accurate. It's true that when you initially take a big breath and hold it at sea level the % oxygen in that air will be 21% (the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is 21% regardless of your altitude). Total atmospheric pressure at sea level is 760mmHg, 760mmHg x 0.21 (percentage of oxygen in atmosphere) gives a pO2 as ~160mmHg. This is more than enough pressure to have that oxygen diffuse to an area of lower partial pressure (in this case the venous blood coming into the lungs, which has a low pO2 due to metabolism). The amount of oxygen dissolved in your blood <a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/72solubility-141014022518-conversion-gate01/95/solubility-11-638.jpg?cb=1413255199" target="_blank">will be proportional to the pO2 of the air you breath in</a> (or in the case of holding your breath, the pO2 of the air in your lungs). If you continue to hold your breath, the oxygen will dissolve into your blood and be carried to tissues where it is used in metabolism (and essentially &quot;removed&quot;), decreasing the <em>total oxygen content</em> in the air in your lungs and in turn decreases the <em>partial pressure</em> of oxygen in your lungs. Important to note here the total pressure will remain roughly the same because as the oxygen is used up, CO2 comes out of the blood and into the air in the lungs. O2 and CO2 essentially &quot;swap&quot;</p>
<p>Let's say you go up to altitude of 35,000 ft (10,679m). <a href="https://www.avs.org/AVS/files/c7/c7edaedb-95b2-438f-adfb-36de54f87b9e.pdf" target="_blank">At this height, total atmospheric pressure is only 179mmHg</a>. Doing the same calculation as above (% of oxygen in the air doesn't change), 179x0.21 = 37.6mmHg for pO2. This is a lot lower! A pO2 of 40mmHg is not compatible with life for any long period of time.</p>
<p>Partial pressures will determine how much oxygen will dissolve into the blood from the air, but the amount of dissolved oxygen in the blood is only a small fraction of the <em>total</em> amount of oxygen in the blood. The bulk of oxygen is carried by hemoglobin. Your hemoglobin can't bind to oxygen that isn't dissolving into the blood though, so that's why partial pressures matter. When you completely cut off O2 supply, you actually have a few minutes before the <em>total</em> oxygen content in the blood drops to a damaging level - both from the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin and the oxygen that remains in the lungs (which can still diffuse into the blood).</p>
<p>That was a bit of a rant, hope it makes some sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting, any idea what they proportion is between dissolved and bound to hemoglobin O2? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping nobody would ask that question :-) The answer is somewhat more complicated, and to be honest I don't yet understand the intricacies as well (I'll get there eventually), but <a href="http://www.cvphysiology.com/Microcirculation/M002" target="_blank">this site gives a fairly good overview explanation</a>. The thing to keep in mind is that the amount of oxygen that binds to hemoglobin is affected by a number of things, including temp, acidity of the blood, pO2, PCO2, and a few other things that are more detailed than it's worth to explain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks.  I also read somewhere that when holding your breath, the discomfort you feel isn't down to a lack of oxygen but increasing levels of CO2 in your lungs.  Is this correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is true, although it is from increased CO2 levels throughout your body rather than just your lungs. Your body does somewhat increase the drive to breath when oxygen levels decrease, but by far how fast you breath (and the 'urge' to breath when you hold your breath) is regulated by CO2 levels</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is consistent with what /u/AllWeNeedIsPropofol is saying. I think I am underestimating how fast your reach that 0.1 bar threshold. It's pretty terrifying that you can deplete your O2 blood in a few seconds if you cut off all supply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how starting in a pressurized environment would affect this but the effect of low pressure is apparent in Mt Everest's &quot;death zone&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that people spend way more time near the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen after proper acclimatization. So, while there is probably a &quot;TUC&quot; for slow changes it is significantly different from the numbers listed in OP's link.</p></div>		</li>
