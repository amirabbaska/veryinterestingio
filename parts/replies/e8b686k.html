			<div class="markdown"><p>Also point out that there are two different issues here.</p>
<p>The pain is one
The systemic response (nausea vomiting lightheaded ness) is different.   Much of this is a response to the large catecholamine release that triggered, much like people throwing up before a big performance or before going to war.   Lightheaded ness could also be hypotension.  Point being it’s massively complex when dealing with response to large hormone release, and this may account for different responses between sexes, although I’ve never read that anywhere.  </p>
<p>Diabetics also feel heart attacks differently </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they don't always experience heart attacks differently, but diabetics and the elderly can often present with some of the non-specific symptoms listed above, such as abdominal pain, back pain, neck pain, feeling faint/dizzy, sweating, breathlessness among others</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diabetics can get disease of the nervous system which affects the way they perceive pain. They don’t suffer specific symptoms for a heart attack but they’re more likely to have atypical symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among other factors, nerve damage is common in diabetics, so central chest/arm/jaw/back pain might not be experienced. Add in that sweating profusely, and lightheadedness can easily be confused with glycaemic complications, it can be very easy to miss a subtle MI in a patient with advanced diabetes. </p>
<p>As an EMT, if I had a diabetic patient who was overweight, sedentary, middle aged, feeling generally unwell, I would certainly perform a diagnostic ECG even without cardiac symptoms, and would have a low bar for taking such a patient in to A&amp;E.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons, maybe, that we don't know is because it took so long to pay attention to women in the first place. I started working in Colossal Pharma in the early 80s and, at that time, clinical trials were conducted with males, period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. In ems they use verbiage like ‘women have abnormal symptoms for heart attacks.’ This is only because they don’t present the same that men do and men were basically the standard that it was all based off of. Luckily one of my instructors pointed this out while we were going through cardiac and he stated that ‘women don’t present abnormally for women, they just present differently than men’.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about men and women present sex-specific symptoms instead of describing everything in relation to men? I'm in the legal field where men are usually the &quot;standard&quot; gender but reading your post even made me cringe. &quot;Abnormal?!&quot; Really...?</p></div>		</li>
