			<div class="markdown"><p>just adding on to this, higher metabolism results in more oxidation activity in the body, contributing to free radicals, DNA damage, telomere degradation and &quot;aging&quot;. This is my basic understanding of it.</p>
<p>Basically the ELI5 explanation is that the higher your metabolism, the more damage that is done to your DNA and the more rapidly you age. Animals like Tortoises live long because of their very low metabolism, and Greenland sharks are even lower because they live in ice cold waters and are cold blooded (warm blooded animals like whales, while living in similar environments, still have to maintain high metabolisms to generate body heat)</p></div>		</li>
