			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The classic example of the &quot;visual disorder&quot; analogy falling apart is a glass of water and ice. It looks more disordered than a glass of water, but it has far less entropy because it partially consists of a lower-temperature phase. (The lower-temperature phase is always the lower-entropy state.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always understood it as the order of the microstates. Ice has less entropy than water because the ice crystals are more ordered. Is that over simplified?</p></div>		</li>
