			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off of this comment. Does anyone have an fun stories about how down to earth their significant others are and how they bought their rings out of a vending machine? Preferably with some sort of paranoid rambling about the New World Order of the diamond industry thrown in. Thanks in advance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I, myself, would have loved a quarter-machine ring. Just something simple to symbolize our love. I was told I deserved more and what I got was a BIG shiny thing. Does that count?</p>
<p>Also, for an anniversary, I got a mineralized dinosaur bone and meteorite ring. Best. Husband. <strong>EVER.</strong></p></div>		</li>
