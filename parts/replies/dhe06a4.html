			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the input. What if we extend the discussion to active optics, or a system in which we put work into? Would it then be possible without filtering then amplifying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could try for active phase compensation by taking a small part of the incoming light to measure the phase fluctuations and uses a piezo-mounted mirror to compensate for it.</p>
<p>This will only work for light that is reasonably close to being monochromatic (which unfiltered sunlight is not) and will only be loss-less in the classical limit, where you can use an arbitrarily small amount of power from the incoming light to determine the phase-evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was getting at by specifying passive optics - if you put energy into the system you could amplify the light light (say by stimulated emission) and wind up with a brighter beam at the end. But that is kind of cheating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really correct. Polarized light does not need to be a pure state. You can write a density matrix which only has support in the block for (say) left-circular-polarized light for some distribution of k vectors, but lacks phase coherence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose you could imagine a pulsed light signal that is unpolarized. You then split the pulsed light into two orthogonal polarized beams, rotate them to the same plane, introduce a time delay, and finally use some sort of very fast beam steering device to interleave the pulses along a single path. So you end up with a beam that pulses twice as fast but is linearly polarized. But this example doesn't seem to be in the spirit of the OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, my statement was a kinematical one (describing the state of the electromagnetic field), not a dynamical one (describing how to change the state of the electromagnetic field). So my statement says nothing about passive or active, linear or nonlinear optics, and what they can do to the electromagnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its polarisation state is pure though. The state doesn't have to describe all degrees of freedom of the system. Tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom will then return a pure state of polarisation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? Where does this claim come from?</p>
<p>Whether you start with a pure state or a mixed state, if you partial trace over some degrees of freedom, you generically get a mixed state in the remaining degrees of freedom. The only way to end up with a pure state afterwards is this: if the Hilbert space is split into two components A and B, and we are partial tracing over one of the two components, then we must start with a pure state, <em>and</em> there must be no correlations between A and B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was simplifying the argument a bit and imagining more of a toy model of monochromatic light instead of sunlight. Polarized sunlight is not a pure state. However, polarized sunlight still has a lower entropy than unpolarized sunlight, since unpolarized blackbody radiation maximizes the entropy for a given energy density. So the argument still holds. </p></div>		</li>
