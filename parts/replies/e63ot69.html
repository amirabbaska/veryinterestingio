			<div class="markdown"><p>Polar bodies are actually the process of meiosis. Most every cell division is equal in everything. Equal dna split equal organelle split equal cytoplasm split except for egg cells. The final egg cell is visible with the naked eye because it has so much cytoplasm. The remaining cells are called polar bodies. Each having DNA but not normally large enough for fertilization and are just there. But sometimes they may not separate from a fully mature egg cell. I graduated with twins that were initially thought to be identical but later found out to be polar twins. The DNA was vary close but slight differences but not enough to be fraternal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I simplified a bit -- there are actually 3 polar bodies cast off for every egg cell.  </p>
<p>I also edited my comment a bit to reflect that the egg has 23 pairs of <em>identical</em> sister chromatids at fertilization -- so the chromosomes that get removed are identical to mom's chromosomes that stay behind.   </p>
<p>Interesting story about your polar body twins!  I learned something today.  So these twins don't share 100% of their DNA like identical twins, and don't share about 50% like fraternal twins.  Instead they share about 75% --  they're identical in terms of mom's DNA but fraternal with respect to dad's DNA.  Thanks for the info.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is not how this works. Polar bodies are formed during meiosis in female gametes. They are not a product of fertilization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The final step of female meiosis doesn't occur until fertilisation. Oogenesis is really split up, and starts with mitosis to create a primary oocyte, which enters prophase I at the end of the first trimester.  Meiosis I happens at ovulation (creates first polar body) and meiosis II happens at fertilisation, creating a mature egg and the second polar body.</p></div>		</li>
