<p>The Victorians were <em>obsessed</em> with bowels. They were convinced the intestine couldn't turn food into shit by itself, but needed regular intervention...kids were typically given a laxative dose every day if they didn't need it, and a massive one if they did.</p>
<p>I think they may have thought shit was an evil poison and the bowel had to be cleaned of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how right that is, but I want to at least add some context to this claim. Laxatives were <em>very</em> desireable in Europe (especially northern Europe) between 1600 and 1900. The Chinese rhubarb for example, was an extremely common laxative up until around 1900. I've read this Fun^^^^not ^^^^sure ^^^^it's ^^^^a fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until The Rhubarb Triangle started in the 1870s, most rhubarb came from China. In 1839, the imperial Chinese commissioner Lin Zexu wrote a letter to Queen Victoria warning that, unless the British stopped supplying opium to China, he would cut off rhubarb supplies to Britain, killing everyone through mass constipation. It seems that the Queen never had the letter translated, and so remained unaware of the danger. In the event, the British sent an army from India to force the Chinese to accept British opium imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why everyone would die &quot;through mass constipation&quot; if they stopped supplying rhubarb was because, since for most of the year northern Europeans couldn't get fresh vegetables, they ate a lot of preserved (dried, salted) foods which isn't very good for digestion.</p>
<p>So the Victorians didn't get their bowel obsession from nowhere. Constipation was one of the most common ailments of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it was also about social stigma regarding eating foods that were for poor people. Read Ben Franklin's Dialogue with Gout. People liked to eat meats and certain types of vegetables. It's kinda hard to believe that they wouldn't have had access to oats, that'll get your bowels moving in no time. It was just seen as a poor food reserved for peasants and/or animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grammas all had castor oil in the medicine cabinet, and epsom salts. My mom said her mom gave her and her siblings enemas as a cure-all for who knows what. That would be enough to shut my sphincter for like, forever. That generation really liked bare behinds- belts on a bare butt, by dad, and enemas from mom. Yucko. We babyboomers still were whacked on bare behinds (to not cry was was something to brag about on the playground), but if enemas and castor oil were still being used 50-60 years ago, no one I know talked about it. Seems almost like some weird pedo-sex thing, now, looking at yours kids bm's past toilet training days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people in that era were afraid of spermatorrhea. They believed that masturbating/sex without the intention of procreation would waste a mans sperm and he wouldn't have any left for when he needed it. To help suppress desire, the world came up with many ways to make society less sexy. John Kellogg introduced fibre cereal so that you could poop instead of think about sex. The bland food thing is also true. This is also when bed skirts came along so men wouldn't think about women's legs, etc etc.
Crazy times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait....bed skirts were meant to replace thoughts of a female skirt? I think if anything, the word &quot;skirt&quot; automatically makes you think of a female's skirt. And honestly, where is the logic in that??? how does a bed skirt distract you from thinking about a woman's legs?????? NOTHING MAKES SENSE!</p>
<p>Honestly, it just sounds like a movie where the entire cast is on shrooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition there was a recent (1990's?) study that found a correlation between healthy people and people who ate breakfast. Conclusion: breakfast is good for your health and skipping it is bad. This study is often cited by people who promote breakfast foods.</p>
<p>However it's likely that health-conscious people are simply more likely to eat breakfast (perhaps due to the marketing), while the real health benefits come from their overall diet and exercise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are far more recent studies that demonstrate this correlation, it's often repeated. There's not enough evidence to link it to causation.</p>
<p>I'd say breakfast is as important as any other meal, and whichever meal you eat first is breakfast, as one <em>breaks</em> their <em>fast</em> by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I've heard it put (from a book I recently read) is that our body's peak in cortisone production in the morning for the purpose of giving us a bit of extra blood sugar via stored glycogen in the liver being converted to glucose. We have a natural get up and go available. That said, if you're hungry, then go ahead and eat a modest breakfast with a mix of protein, healthy fats, and unrefined carbs sooner rather than later. If you're not hungry then eat a later &quot;breakfast&quot;. Wow, it's like commonsense should guide our diet...</p></div>		</li>
