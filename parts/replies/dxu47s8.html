			<div class="markdown"><p>The only issue with the cortical homunculus is it only counts nerve endings, and doesn't deal with the other half of the picture: the thickness of your skin in those areas.</p>
<p>The cortical homunculus shows the hands are larger than just about anything else, and this leads budding pre-med students to eagerly share with their friends the info on how &quot;the hands are the most nerve sensative part of the entire body!&quot; ...but that's simply not true. Your finger tips have some of the thickest skin on your body because of how much abrasion they go through as you're constantly grabbing or holding things. Since the skin in so much thicker in your fingers, your actual touch sensativity is quite dimished in the fingertips despite the cortical homunculus showing the fingers the largest.</p>
<p>The actual most sensative part of your body is your eye, followed by your lips and your tongue. </p>
<p>Not all touch is considered equal though. While your lips and tongue have <em>incredibly</em> detailed pressure and texture sensation, the back of your hand is actually more sensative to heat (despite the back of your hand being fairly terribly at texture and pressure sensation). Likewise, the most heat sensative part of your entire body are your facial cheeks, despite once again, being less texture and pressure sensative than your lips. And following this trend when it comes to sensativity to pain, second only to the eye are the genitals, which are exorbitantly sensative to pain, despite having a far below average sensativity to heat and texture compared to things like your lips or your cheeks. Though, all that being said, the lips are also extremly sensative to pain, which circles back to explaining why pimples on the lips hurt so much.</p>
<p>Anyway, compared to the lips, tongue, gentals, eyes, etc... your fingers and hands aren't even in the running when it comes to being sensative to touch. Yet anyone who first sees the cortical homunculus thinks the hands are the king of touch.</p></div>		</li>
