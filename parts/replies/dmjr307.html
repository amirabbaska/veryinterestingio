			<div class="markdown"><p>When I get migraines I get so sensitive to sound that I swear I can hear things like my eyes moving. It sounds like I have air bubbles around my eyeballs that 'pop' and squish around. I can hear my neck and jaw creaking, and my muscles tensing like iron cable or something... It's a really harsh metallic sound. That's all on top of a constant static buzz and clicking that I'm pretty sure comes from nowhere. I get the visual auras and flashes too, plus weird tastes and smells. I'm pretty sure I could handle the pain and nausea if it weren't for everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the weird sensitive hearing without the migraine and the air pockets in eye sockets thing is exactly how I'd describe the sound. I don't hear my muscles tense but I hear my joints creak when I move and they sound kind of hollow but also like a heavy old wooden door. And my heartbeat randomly starts playing in my ears at times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah the heartbeat thing is scary! I usually always get the airpocket eye on the right side, and it's always the right side that is more sensitive to light and sound. I'll usually get visual flashing or glows, or auditory clicks and buzzes without pain and nausea, and I'm pretty decent at being functional through them. When it's everything is when I'm pretty much out of commission for a few days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's pretty bad, and it can sometimes takes a few days to recover from an especially bad one. Luckily they aren't too common :) I get a full blown, no holds barred migraine once a year or so.</p>
<p>Edit: and generally I get some warnings before hand. Actually had a really bad one yesterday (right in the middle of moving house, which was super convenient. /s) The past few days I've had visual auras and periods of nausea so I knew I'd be useless. Spent yesterday curled in bed/around a toilet, and I'm pretty much fine today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that there's a room that's so quiet that no one can stay more than 45 minutes in it because your body adjusts to how quiet it is and you can start hear your body making all these noises and it eventually gets so loud it becomes unbearable. </p>
<p>But, this could totally be an urban legend type of thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called an anechoic chamber. They're used to do things like test radios on aircraft. Even leaning your head inside of two panels used to line the walls of a chamber is super weird. One second you're hearing everyday chatter, lean in and everything instantly goes quiet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't even remember life without tinnitus. It's minor but it's there. I miss complete silence, even if just out in nature with no wind blowing or anything. But especially in a room designed to disallow sound, that sounds like it's be an awesome experience without (hell, even with) tinnitus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately not quite true, anechoic chambers can definitely feel uncomfortable for some people but at least the guy from <del>vsauce</del> Veritasium <a href="https://youtu.be/mXVGIb3bzHI" target="_blank">lasted more than 45 minutes no problem.</a> It actually sounds kinda nice to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I mean I don't see how isolation tanks/sensory deprivation chambers would exist if someone couldn't last 45 minutes in silence.</p>
<p>They not only remove light and sound (albeit the water sounds if you're not perfectly still), but also feeling almost since the water is body temperature.</p>
<p>The idea is to isolate everything but just your thoughts (even those, too, if you want to meditate more traditionally), and people will pay triple digits a session to spend hours in them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time at the end of a very long dat of partying with substances including LSD, marijuana, and alcohol, I was trying to sleep and I could hear my eyeballs moving. If that weren't enough I was seeing shadows move and thought my friends were messing with me. I was paranoid about those shadows to the point where I layed awake, watching a corner where a hallway connected for several hours. I was on my stomach with my arms under me ready to pounce on something that moved by that corner. My whole body was tense and I even had a little butt wiggle going when I though I saw something. Picture an 18 Y/O M crouched like a lion on a couch staring intently at a corner for several hours. This story has gotten far too long and I fear that will dissuade people from reading it. </p></div>		</li>
