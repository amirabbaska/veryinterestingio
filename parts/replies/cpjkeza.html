			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really know anything about this topic, but if there was more than one force that interacts with dark matter but not normal matter, would there be any way to distinguish them?</p>
<p>I'm thinking of a math problem with multiple variables, but we have no way of knowing that X is actually multiple variables. So then we'd try solving for X but have a lot of problems because sometimes X would be Y or Z and we'd still be working on the problem as though there was only an X.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any field, regardless of whether it interacts with normal matter, will always have some kind of energy density.  Energy interacts with gravity.  In principle, ANY force is detectable this way.  In practise, it is very possible that the energy density is so low that we cannot build instruments capable of detecting its gravitational effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if I reverse that idea.  Does that mean we could look at dark matter itself as an energy normal matter doesn't interact with?</p></div>		</li>

Also collisions between nuclei and electrons would be more complicated. This would've been obvious in particle accelerator experiments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Higgs boson, and its accompanying Field, were not verified until we 'pinged' it hard enough, with a high energy energy/force to 'knock' a particle free of the field. Since we do not &quot;know&quot; the associated energies for Dark Matter, or the associated fields/particles that it would represent than how can we know if we have particle accelerators powerful to 'ping' it, or sensors sensitive enough to detect? </p></div>		</li>

<p>And we <em>know</em>, because our current model of leptons not carrying the color charge, are confirmed by a few decades of experimental observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're unified at high energies, but the meaningful excitations at low energies split into different types that behave very differently. The weak force is not mediated by the photon, but by the W and Z bosons, which (as an example of a difference) have mass.</p></div>		</li>
