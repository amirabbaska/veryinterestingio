			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, about 3 days ago I shipped a package with UPS. They said it will arrive on the 21st, but no guarantees. I said, what about after the 21st, &quot;Will it arrive by Christmas?&quot; They said they couldn't guarantee that either. After paying the extra fee to guarantee it, I got to thinking that I paid extra for my package to be shipped at the same time had I not &quot;guaranteed&quot; it. So I wanted to know what I was paying extra for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You paid for queue priority.</p>
<p>When the system gets jammed up and a shipping hub can't process all of the packages it received that day, the packages that didn't pay for a time guarantee get left behind and they try to send them out the next day.</p>
<p>Then you repeat.  Maybe the next day is even worse.  So your package sits there again.</p>
<p>UPS, FedEx, etc. try to guess how many packages they'll have to process based on previous patterns, but guesses can always be wrong.  They are somewhat at the mercy of what the collective whole of the country's holiday shoppers decide to do.  Will the increased success of Kickstarter result in more packages this year?  What if Amazon suddenly advertises free shipping for the holidays to win people over from retail?  Stuff like that.  That's why the sales rep couldn't give you a definite &quot;Probably&quot; when you asked.  The collective public might do something unexpected, and if it's really bad a non-guaranteed package could sit in a facility for a week, waiting for a time when they won't have to purchase expensive alternative shipping options on short notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was estimated to be on the 21st, it was highly likely to arrive by the 25th shipped regularly. Like 99.9% chance. I could see it coming in on the 22-23 though. </p>
<p>And like another guy said, you're paying for queue priority. They know your package is more high dollar and that if it's not there on time, they lost money on it, so if a plane goes out, they're going to be sure it gets on the next one available. The others will wait if the plane/truck is full and go with the next one. So hypothetically, you could get bumped on each leg of the trip. But they're pretty good at adjusting for Christmas rush. </p></div>		</li>
