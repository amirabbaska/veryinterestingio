			<div class="markdown"><p>One of major things that helped me quit my near decade long opiate addiction was this. I'd identify the thoughts trying to rationalize using, and I gave &quot;that person&quot; a name. It's Tony. So now when I get cravings I stop trying to rationalize because I can recognize that &quot;Tony&quot; is trying to come out. And then I can tell Tony that his ideas are fucking stupid. Then it goes away. It was a lot harder dealing with those thoughts when I attributed it to myself because that makes me internally try to convince myself to use, but I can tell Tony in my head why his ideas suck (equivalent to telling on myself or seeking a support group) as it's easier to talk other people down then yourself. </p>
<p>I never knew this was already a concept. I am going to have to read this book now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think you can definitely personify the other, or the shadow self. I’ve done similar where that part of my mind is played by someone else and I imagine explaining to them why this idea of theirs is bad (even though it’s my own idea). </p>
<p>And I also think this is the basis of the image of the devil on one shoulder and angel on the other shoulder. People can personify the shadow self as an inherently evil person and personify the self as an inherently good person. And both the angel and the devil are telling you what to do, and the trick is to figure out which one is which. Which I think is part of OP’s question, but I’ll be damned if I can give an ELI5 of that haha</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like “I’m not normally like that! I just fuckin had the urge to help this old lady across the street. Oh well, back to kicking puppies”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading a bunch of SCPs I started treating my depression like an anomaly. Specifically, I pretend depression is a side effect of travelling between universes. I pretend I can't control my ability to jump from one universe to a nearly identical one but this one is not my own so I feel estranged from the universe around me. It's stupid and it doesn't change anything, but it personally helps me like crazy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Once we recognize that the self-that-we-want-to-be and the self-that-we-don't-want-to-be are the two parts of our whole, then we can begin to get ourselves in order enough to make the shadow self disappear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disappear isn't really the right word for it. You can't make your shadow disappear anymore than you can make yourself disappear. You can suppress it, but a stressful enough situation can cause it to burst forth, which is almost always detrimental. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6VRWX1Sz5s" target="_blank">Here's a little insight into the matter.</a></p>
<p>It's a scary thing to recognize that you have a part of yourself that is not entirely under control. But it exists, so denying it is dangerous. Recognizing it and incorporating it is always a better option, it'll give you a better idea of what you're actually capable of, both good and evil. Which gives you a better idea of what people are capable of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i dig it. disappear isn't a 100% appropriate term because there are elements of the shadow self at all time. i think the idea though is to shine your conscious attention onto the parts of you that feel out of your control and alien (or shadow) to yourself and - like you said - incorporate them into your self (in the jungian sense of the term). in other words, take the things that if you let them control would make you a bad person and to embrace them and turn them into what makes you a good person. </p>
<p>yeah, that's like fucking right on.</p>
<p>it reminds me of a quote from a leprous song , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGM36PkUcpQ&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLyt7DNYOuW7jmTlL9LcF8SISAUeivePzS" target="_blank">coal</a>. &quot;watch it burn, even though you fear. it might just turn into more coal.&quot;</p>
<p>the way i interpret that is to say, you take some that's a raging fire and give it all of your attention and it turns back into a usable fuel. this is all psychoanalytically speaking of course, definitely not factually true.</p></div>		</li>
