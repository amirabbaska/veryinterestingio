			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually just took a knife sharpening class. It was awesome. Probably the least intuitive thing I learned is that you want to hone as far back as you realistically expect the blade to contact the cut surface. So if you're honing a carving chisel, for example, you polish about an inch back from the cutting edge to a mirror finish. I figured it only mattered to polish the very tip. But I did as I was told and was rewarded with a chisel that cuts through wood like butter.</p>
<p>Apparently the smoother the surface, the less friction is applied to the wood that's pressing behind the cut. So you can go thin, but it also helps to go smooth even for a thick blade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this may be a morbid question but would a wire be a good replacement for the guillotine blade? I assume if it's thick enough to pass through bone but thin enough to pass through with little friction it could be even more effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the hypothetical &quot;science fiction&quot; answer.  I believe it was the movie Johnny Mnemonic that had a bad guy with a bionic implant &quot;wire sword&quot;.  The premise was that the wire was a chain of molecules or atoms, something preposterously thin.  And it was carbon nano-tubes or similar so preposterously strong.  It was... Obi-wan forgive me... cooler than a light saber.  And, in theory more effective than a light saber.  Not using plasma or heat anything it cut would not cauterize.  Nor was it glowie, in fact it wouldn't even be visible.  Please do not take this response as a suggestion that you watch Johnny Mnemonic though.  </p>
<p>Currently, I don't think we have a material able to to the trick.  Steel Wire, when stretched taut, and thin enough to cut, is still too fragile and will break easily.  Spider web, which has tensile strength (ability to be pulled without breaking) much stronger than steel, is no match for our leathery hide.  And I'm sadly ignorant of the possibility of carbon nano-tubes.  </p>
<p>Wire only becomes good when you are taking into account surface friction.  This is an issue for cheese.  Not so much for a neck.  </p>
<p>Also, there is no need for a replacement for a guillotine.  It is a very effectively designed machine for its purpose.  It removed heads from shoulders reliably, cheaply, and with little maintenance or training for hundreds of years.  I believe the last person to experience the kiss of Messr. Guillotine's invention was in the 1970s.  The man (and victim of his own invention) designed it to be scientifically effective 200 years prior.  I'd say it'd be one of my top choices for a sure fire. quick, clean death.  Better than hanging, firing squad, gas chamber, electrocution, lethal injection, or many others.  There has been speculation that you are still alive for a period of time after the chop, but that is based on eye movement, and facial expression changes.  Very possible, but hard to verify for obvious reasons.  And these reports, or speculation, never admit it is a long period of time.  Still, in all, I'd say about as painless as you can get without having a 2km diameter asteroid dropped on your condo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can skip the film. Johnny Mnemonic was a short story by the cyberpunk great, William Gibson. Even if the film isn't worth watching, the story is worth reading. Monomolecular filament isn't used as a sword, but more of a whip. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lethal injection... I thought it was just something that puts the deathrow prisoner to sleep?  Something like being tied down and then injected with 3 needles.  The first makes them unconscious, the second stops the heart and the third stops the brain.  (Learned from that other side of youtube)</p>
<p>Am I missing something here in that I would pick lethal injection instead of guillotine?  Well not 'pick' persay - I'm just a nerd too curious for my own good.  But hey, a quick death over a slow and painful one in any scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would theoretically work well, but isn't nearly as practical.</p>
<p>A big heavy blade is easy and cost effective to make, requires very little maintenance, lasts a long time, and also generates the force required to make the cut.</p>
<p>Creating wire strong enough to cut through bone may be expensive and difficult (especially during the times guillotines were first used). It would have to be kept taut, which would probably mean re-tightening it every so often. It is far more likely to corrode/rust and break down fairly quickly. As such, it'd have to be replaced more regularly. And you'd have to generate the force by some other means.</p>
<p>A wire should work, but a blade makes many times more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The thin nature of a steel wire used to cut cheese and such like that is useful in cutting things that don't really fight back. However, we have hard bones in our necks, so cutting that off would take some work and would break the wire if it's too thin, and just break the neck if it's too thick. You can cut your skin to the bone pretty easily on these kinds of wires, but it's very difficult for it to get through the bone.</p></div>		</li>
