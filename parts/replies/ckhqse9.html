<p>But what about receptor density?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point, although I would very be surprised if caffeine had no long-lasting impacts on brain function. For instance, although it is a very different type of stimulant, amphetamine has shown long term sensitization. <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/21/9579.full.pdf" target="_blank">Individuals who are dosed only <em>once</em> will show a much stronger response to the drug even YEARS later</a>. This indicates that there is still much for us to learn about the brain's responses to the drugs we ingest.</p>
<p>EDIT: brain, not bran.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely agree.  This is true for almost all psychoactive drugs including alcohol.  The subtle effects linger long after the acute withdrawl period.  It is incorrect to believe that just because you don't have a headache anymore, your mental state has returned to baseline.  It is also impossible for someone to self-evaluate cognitive and psychological changes.  Just like when someone is mentally ill and they are the last ones to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  When I stopped caffeine more than 20 years ago, I consumed the equivalent of 25+ cups of coffee per day.  Headaches and shakes were all fine with a couple of weeks, and it took probably two years before I stopped feeling tired all day.</p>
<p>I've had people tell me that I would probably be fine if I started it again, but I'm pretty certain I'd fall into the same patterns.  I've often wondered how much of that is would be physiological versus situational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point attempts to insinuate that these two EXTREMELY different drugs are somehow linked in cause/effect, simply due to them both being stimulants, which is just silly, if not intentionally misleading.  Your second statement is something even the most ignorant of us know, I.E. &quot;Right now we do not know everything about drugs, so further research will be helpful.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not what I was claiming at all, which I tried to make clear by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, although it is a very different type of stimulant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Except people in this thread seem to be stating with confidence that once the drug is out of your system, it is as if you have never ingested any at all. Which I am trying to point out is unsupported, and is overtly incorrect in other cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the brain create more adenosine receptors whilst in the grips of caffeine? And when you go off of caffeine the receptors go down in number? That is sort of creepy. How does the brain kill these receptors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body isn't creating or destroying receptors. Physiologically, regulation doesn't occur through the number of receptors we have, it's whether they're activated or not. In general, an agonist binds to a receptor, this activating it and triggering the accompanying physiological change. An antagonist limits the ability of the agonist to do that. Levels of those chemicals are regulated, not levels of receptors themselves.</p>
<p>In the case of caffeine, it disrupts the normal activation of adenosine receptors by their agonist (adenosine) resulting in less activation. With the caffeine gone, free adenosine can bind to and activate the receptors freely. The disappearance of the antagonist results in a short period of receptor sensitivity - where the receptors don't increase in number, but rather are more sensitive to the agonist. In somewhat un-scientific terms, they essentially are activated more often/more easily.  Eventually the body gets used to the lack of antagonist and the receptor sensitivity goes back to normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that makes more sense now. It takes me one day of getting tired and sleeping the entire day, then I'm off of it, with no headache. Or I can decrease the dosage over a week and I'm off of it. In general I find it easy to not be addicted to things. FWIW, I need caffeine to function, even after years of not using it, I wasn't productive, I'm a natural turtle. Other people I know are high strung and cannot handle caffeine and don't need it. Is there some sort of physiology unique to me that allows for easily kicking caffeine?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's certainly false. There are changes in the actual concentration of adenosine receptors with both exposure to caffeine and sleep deprivation.</p>
