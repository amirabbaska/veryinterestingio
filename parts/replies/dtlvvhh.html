			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense! Thank you. Since it’s involuntary how are we able to control them? Aka stop them vs a muscle spasm where we can’t do anything to make it stop</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can try placing your fingers at the bottom of your sternum, and tensing the muscles there. If you can hold it through the next hiccup, it will often stop them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A simple trick is to bear down like when you are trying to pass a hard stool. This stimulates the diaphragm and can reboot it so to speak. Bearing down for about 10 to 15 seconds should do the trick. </p>
<p>My favorite way to dispense of hiccups though is to take a deep breath and hold it while taking 10 gulps of water. It essentially is doing the same thing as what I said above, but this technique offers you the pleasure of life sustaining water as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried sugar once with a little doubt. Let sit on tongue to dissolve a little, then swallow it slowly. Might just be me but it sure does the trick for me every time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to understand this, can you explain why if I eat bread (usually dry) sometimes, it triggers hiccups. I can then turn them off by drinking water. The throat seem a distant connection from the diaphragm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current thoughts on this are that irritation to the throat, esophagus, and.or stomach cause the brain to react by sending signals back down. These signals can also be sent down the nearby phrenic nerve which controls the diaphragm.  Another thought is that the stomach can get irritated by certain foods or swollen by swallowing too much air with a particular food, which causes it to press on the diaphragm and make that start spasming.</p></div>		</li>
