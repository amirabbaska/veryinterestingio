<p>especially once you know the characters and their idiosyncrasies</p>

<p>I think this is a major part, in sitcoms the jokes might not be so funny on themselves, they are funny because of who they come from, and if you dont know the character you dont really get the jokes or at least they dont seem so funny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stick with. You will be glad you did. After you finish the last season, go back and watch the first couple of episodes again. It's almost like watching a different show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first season feels a lot like a mediocre spin off of The Office.  The show moves away from that and finds it's own style and humor in the second and third seasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of my Star Trek TNG initiation. The first episode is movie-length and boring. In fact, I've heard from the majority of fans that <em>the entire first season</em> is meh. And I was soo not into the villain they introduced in that first episode --</p>
<p>-- then that villain became one of my favorite characters and the show really hooked me. I'm glad I gave it a chance. I personally like when people tell me the direction a show will go, especially if it's got more than a couple seasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You see, I don't get that about TNG. I was actually hooked from the very first episode. But it took me <em>years</em> to finally get around to watching any of it, because people told me it was so slow to start, and I didn't want that much of a time investment (7 seasons!) in something I probably wouldn't like. But after watching, I don't get the whole &quot;growing the beard&quot; trope everyone harps on about. TNG was great from the start, IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had friends that wouldn't shut up about &quot;chuck&quot; . Finally I gave it a go, and turned it off after 20 minutes.  They insisted, and now I'm in season 3, and the show's grown on me.</p>
<p>I think all shows take a few episodes/1st season for actors to find their character's place in the show.</p></div>		</li>
