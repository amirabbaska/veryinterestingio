Further, they are looking to create the fetus ex-vito, in an artificial womb rather than using an Asian elephant female as a surrogate since they are endangered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it is, theoretically, possible, DNA from scratch would be amazingly difficult.  DNA (DioxyRibo Nucleic Acid) is composed of cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine.  The four materials on their own require fabricating, not including the other elements of the DNA sequence.  It is difficult, but as follows is a quote from Craig Venter :
“<em>In 2010 Craig Venter announced that his research group had sequenced and re-synthesized the genome of a small bacterium, creating what he called “the first self-replicating species we’ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer.” Later, Venter announced DNA synthesis was like “3D printing” organisms, and that they were working on a “fax machine” to copy life on Mars.”</em></p>
