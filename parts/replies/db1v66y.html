			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested in your description of electrons existing at a point then having their vibrations radiate out through the orbital like a drum being hit.</p>
<p>I've read that electrons are &quot;point excitations in an all-permeating electric field, as are all elementary particles an excitation of a corresponding field.&quot; In this description would it be accurate to think of an electron as being a string of continuous disturbances within an orbital, whose individual corresponding waves combine to form our traditional description of an electron? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would certainly one way of describing wave particle duality, but differs from the most commonly used Copenhagen interpretation. I'd advise you to read up on both wave particle duality and the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics if you want more info.</p>
<p>Given that we don't actually know what is going on at that level for sure though, we can't really talk about accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are disturbances in the electron field, not the electric field. And they're not totally pointlike, they're a bit spread out precisely because they are like waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of trying to understand an electron in an atom, I think it helps to first look at how it behaves unbounded to an atom. Due to wave-particle duality, all matter exhibits wave-like properties (interference, propagation, etc). The lighter the particle, the more we can see observe wave-like behavior. The behavior of this wave is fully described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation" target="_blank">Schrödinger wave equation</a></p>
<p>Under the classical picture of an atom, you have a ball orbiting a nucleus. It is orbiting as if it were confined by the electric potential field (the nucleus is positively-charged, the electron negatively charged, so there's attraction). Just as a satellite orbiting the earth is negligable in mass compared to the earth, the electron is super-light compared to the nucleus, so we can simplify the force of the nucleus with a &quot;potential field&quot;. You could imagine this potential field as if were a valley, and the electron rolling around within it.</p>
<p>At this point, we bring back the wave nature of matter. Under the Schrödinger wave equation, the particle can be described by a &quot;wavefunction&quot;, which is a function on space which happens to be a square root of the probability of finding it at that point? Why square root? Because the wavefunction itself is complex-valued (which has an imaginary and real component). One classical approximation of a point-like particle would be a Gaussian wavefunction (bell curve), with its velocity encoded by the complex value. This might be easier to visualize than it is to describe, so I recommend loading the &quot;Harmonic oscillator&quot; setup in this applet to see for yourself (requires Java): <a href="http://www.falstad.com/qm1d/" target="_blank">http://www.falstad.com/qm1d/</a> . Another thing to understand is that the reason it's &quot;quantum&quot; mechanics, is that the energies of stable configurations, &quot;solutions&quot; to the wave equation only exist at discrete energy levels. This results in the orbital configurations of the atom when you solve for the potential field of a nucleus in 3 dimensions. Another applet can help visualize these orbital configurations: <a href="http://www.falstad.com/qmatom/" target="_blank">http://www.falstad.com/qmatom/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that the nodes are located where these f(r) = 0. </p>
<p>It seems there's confusion in this thread. While the nodes have wavefunction = 0, whereas the pictures you see in chemistry textbooks are surfaces of constant probability. Usually, it's the surface within which ~90% of the probability is. Some people will refer to the various loopy parts as <em>lobes</em>, which I believe is what you mean to describe in this post. </p></div>		</li>
