			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. I stopped buying bags because of how much longer the head lasts. Plus, a head of lettuce is only 99 cents at my grocery store, compared to $3+ for a bag. Waste of money IMO. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, I suppose rip-quick rinse-spin takes about 10 seconds as opposed to the 3 required for just opening it and taking it out of the bag. But really it is always going to be a lot less than the slicing cucumber/tomato/onion and then mixing it all together part. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it better to peel off what I need and then chop it, or can I just keep chopping off lettuce parallel to the stem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most obvious answer which everybody seems to be overlooking. Lettuce with the stem still attached is a living plant that will still survive for some time. If planted in water it may even grow.</p>
<p>Compared to what is effectively a bag of dead leaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once again, the simplest and most correct answer is not the top comment.</p>
<p>You don't need a futuristic vacuum fridge or an ice water bath to keep your lettuce fresh. Just buy a head or two instead of precut, prewashed, prepackaged salad mix. It's cheaper, fresher and keeps much longer. And all you have to do is tear a few leaves off and give them a rinse - it's barely more work than opening a bag.</p></div>		</li>
