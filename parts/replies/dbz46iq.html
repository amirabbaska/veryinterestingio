			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best response to what I think OP is really asking. Silver and white are the same color in the sense that both reflect all visible wavelengths. They differ in whether the reflection is primarily specular (light bounces off the surface at a precise angle) or diffuse (light that hits the surface bounces off in random directions). </p>
<p>A white object also reflects the exact* colors of objects around it, but they all get mixed so the effective color you see when the source of light is white light is white. A white object illuminated only by red light appears red.</p>
<p>*nothing is exact of course, but in the spirit of the original question, a white object can have as uniform a reflectance spectrum as a mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in those terms, I'd say silver is an extremely glossy white. Glossy meaning there is some specular reflection (as I described above - it's the kind of behavior you need to see a reflected image of yourself or your surroundings, as opposed to diffuse reflection). White because only a small portion of the light is absorbed rather than being reflected/scattered. At least if you're describing a mirror as &quot;silver&quot; as OP did, you're talking about ~95% reflected light for a typical, clean bathroom mirror. Gray and black are similar to white in that there is little to no dependence on the wavelength, but different in that less light is reflected (or more is absorbed) across all wavelengths. You are correct that you can have a glossy gray, though, and maybe silver would still be the best term for that (a darkened mirror I guess?). </p>
<p>It's similar to &quot;metallic&quot; shades. A metallic red may have the same reflectance spectrum as a matte red, but affects the direction of reflected light more like a mirror and less like a rough surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, mirrors are silver coloured, as historically they were basically a thin layer of silver protected by a glass plane. Later on we started to use cheaper metals like aluminium and chrome, but the principle is the same. </p>
<p>So depending on the mirror, I'd say they are chrome/aluminium coloured. </p>
<p>Silver is still not really a colour though :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's funny about this is how mirrors are best at reflecting green light, so even if we deem them silver, if we were to go by the color they reflect best, they'd be green</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is something our brains can perceive, even though technically the light we see is from the reflected objects and not the mirror. Hence it <em>is</em> silver in the more general sense of perception of surfaces.</p></div>		</li>
