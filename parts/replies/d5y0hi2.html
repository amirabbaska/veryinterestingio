			<div class="markdown"><p>Both should have frozen water. And with your species ability of Photosynthesis it would be an excellent food source for the more advanced Tardigrade. My idea was that tardigrades would have to eat eachother to survive but at some point there wouldn't be enough energy for them to survive, with ChroococcidiopsisÂ there wouldn't be an energy issue as your gets its energy like plants </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a photosynthetic extremophile bacteria know to have excellent resistance to radiation and desiccation. Given that Mars' atmosphere is primarily CO2, we could use these bacteria to turn that CO2 into biomass, which can then be fed to other more advanced organisms. The CO2 conversion would also be useful for making the atmosphere more breathable, since they would release oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'd have some basis on Earth ecosystems, but yes. Very different. You'd have hand selected animals and plants. And the lower gravity would absolutely lead to different evolutionary changes probably even starting after a few generations (because adapting to the new gravity would have HUGE selection pressure). You'd also see a lot of radiation resistance - at least before we had a full atmosphere up and running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a very interesting evolutionary laboratory. I wonder how long it would take for those organisms to become noticeably differentiated from their earth-born ancestors, to the point where we'd consider the Martian organisms as a different species.</p></div>		</li>
