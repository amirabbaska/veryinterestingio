			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly suspect that if you started to go on a crazy spending spree, you'd find all of those cards locked long before you reach 100k.</p>
<p>That you have credit line right now on all of those cards does not mean they'll let you use it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. They give you a credit line because they are fine with you using it in full. In fact, they <em>want</em> you to use it in full, because the typical scenario in that case - you don't pay it back immediately, and start paying large interest rates monthly, that is their big source of income. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of creditors will go after the surviving family members with repeated calls, letters and threats claiming they must cover the debt. The survivors don't have a legal obligation to pay--it's not their debt--but they often do pay either out of ignorance of their rights or because they feel that it's the right thing to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you still had the proceeds from the sale, it would be part of your estate.  If you didn't, you might find it difficult to go into debt without any assets.</p>
<p>After that, it all comes down to intent.  If you did this to defraud a lender, especially if you sold at well below market value and continued to use your property as though you owned it, that would be evidence of fraudulent intent.</p></div>		</li>
