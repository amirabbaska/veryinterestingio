<p>There is a segment of the population that would say, &quot;well if a little is OK, a little more here and there can't be that bad.&quot; or similar rationalizing. Saying things like, &quot;my doctor said it's OK!&quot;.</p>
<p>Since drinking while pregnant isn't particularly beneficial (I believe one study found that 1 glass of wine a week while pregnant had some mild benefits), it's much safer and better for everyone to just say no drinking while pregnant.</p></div>		</li>
