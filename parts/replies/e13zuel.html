With different languages, you’ll have different diets, possibly different races, different regions on the globe, etc. I wonder if it’s a language thing, or more like a regional (lending itself to a dietary or some other odd detail) or some other odd minute detail.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You basically name one of the main problems scientists face in everything they do: Whatever you want to research, it most likely has many different variables that all have an influence on the quantity your research deals with. So, in the best case scenario, you find a way to hold all variables (e.g. in physics or chemistry the temperature, pressure, volume, density and so on) at a constant, maybe even known value and look at your quantity of interest while changing one and only one variable. Only then can you be certain about any correlation between two measured variables.<br />
Sadly, life is so complex, most of the times you can't even know how many variables exist that can possibly change what you're interested in.<br />
But, yeah, I too would like to know an answer to what you're asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even then, sometimes it is the combination of the variables that creates the outcome... so you isolate down to one variable and get an outcome, but if it were two specific variables, it would be entirely different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, one huge factor that most people fail to account for is different categorizations: at what level is something called a speech impediment? Is that a meaningful phrase for them? Would someone seek help for it in their culture or hide it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ex speech therapist here - it’s mainly nature. We know there’s a very strong hereditary factor - even if the parent has successfully treated theirs and the kid is never exposed to it while growing up. That said, psychology plays a big part in how strongly it can present, and making a child super aware of their speech and adding pressure can make things worse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, stammering is caused by a multitude of factors outside of the linguistic variables as well as the interactions with these factors. Things like anxiety and listener response to stammering can also play a part in the development of a stammer. Additionally I believe that our lecturer on the topic said that if the child’s receptive language outstrips their expressive language ability, they are more likely to have a stammer, however causal direction was not indicated. </p>
<p>It’s a very complex phenomenon from a Speech and Language Therapy point of view. </p></div>		</li>
