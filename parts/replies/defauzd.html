			<div class="markdown"><p>Has there ever been a case where a particularly well-designed virus was able to...uh...I guess &quot;break out&quot; of the sandboxed container/virtual machine via some unknown exploit and manage to infect the computer itself? Or is that kind of compartmentalization software basically hermetic, for all technological purposes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible, but very difficult to accomplish depending on how isolated the VMs are. If the VMS are networked, then a virus can propagate from host to host as normal. If not, then the malware needs to be intentionally programmed to be virtualization &quot;aware&quot; and exploit the underlying hypervisor, and the ability to do that will also be dependent on whether you're using a type 1 or 2 hypervisor. </p></div>		</li>
