			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the glass transition is a reasonable analogue. It's not really a phase transition, properties are continuous (although their derivative might not be), and there's still much discussion on structural differences, if any, between supercooled liquid and glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glasses are really interesting, but I would be careful about using it as an analogy. Since they're ergodicity-breaking and non-equilibrium materials, I'm not so sure it would be a good idea to even describe them with the word phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they clearly are a phase distinct from either the liquid and the crystal. It's just that, like any metastable or non-equilibrium phase, you have to consider the kenetics of the system. If we don't consider glasses to be a phase then things like martensite or trydimide wouldn't be either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of this, melting points usually aren't at a specific temperature and occur over a range of temperatures. This is due to the stronger intermolecular forces (IMF) in solids as opposed to liquids. Since IMFs are so much weaker in liquids, it's a lot easier to break intermolecular bonds resulting in much more precise boiling points. The point I'm getting at is the phase change from solid to liquid is very different than going from liquid to gas. Liquid to solid transitions occur much more slowly because the molecules aren't moving as fast. (Source third year biochem student)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on the type of solid. An ordered crystalline solid and a liquid have different symmetries, so there must always be a phase transition separating the two phases.</p></div>		</li>
