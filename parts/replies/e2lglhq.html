			<div class="markdown"><p>Those were the commonly used names for battery sizes when I was growing up in Germany in the 80s. Especially &quot;Mono&quot;, &quot;Baby&quot;, and &quot;Mignon&quot;. These were the names/sizes printed on the packaging when buying them; or printed on the packaging of electronic items where they told you which batteries the product needed.</p>
<p>And I never could remember which was which - I mean how could you. How is &quot;Baby&quot; not the smallest size?</p>
<p>Anyway, I was so glad batteries were later simply labelled AA and AAA, because that made sense; and the other sizes were rarely used any longer.</p>
<p>Today, I am back in an even worse position. More and more poducts require button cells these days, and I'll be damned if I can remember all the effing numbers. They are mostly CR-somethings, but I now have to write the numbers down because otherwise I am sure to buy the wrong one.</p></div>		</li>
