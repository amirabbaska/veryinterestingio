			<p>Solid response. So basically the marine life in the shallower water is definately affected. This raises another question for someone out there. Were there any documented cases of large animals (sharks, whales, etc...) washed up on shore during the indian ocean tsunami? </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, many deep sea creatures that haven't been documented before have been washed up during tsunamis. I can't say for sure if they aren't hoaxes.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fun fact!  The straits of Messina, the narrow stretch of water that separates Sicily from the rest of Italy, is known for its treacherous waters (if you're familiar with the Greek myth of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis" target="_blank">Charybdis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla" target="_blank">Scylla</a>, they resided in the strait).  It was also known as a door to Hades, because of the hellish creatures that often appear in those waters.  What the ancient Greeks did not know, however, was that due to the geography of the strait, massive internal waves (like surface waves, but underwater) regularly travel through it.  The amplitude of the wave is so large that any abyssal fauna trapped in it will be lifted up to the surface, at which point they cannot fight the increased buoyancy of their gas bladders and become stranded on the surface.</p>		</li>

			<p>Small correction: In deep water, &quot;normal&quot; (ie. surface gravity) waves move water particles in circles, which get exponentially smaller with depth, mostly fading out by the time you get to about one wavelength in depth. As you move into shallower water these circles stretch into ellipses which get flatter as you approach the bottom (at the bottom movement is only horizontal), and as you get near breaking, the water particles no longer travel in closed trajectories, instead gradually creeping in the direction of wave motion near the surface, and opposed to it near the bottom.</p>		</li>

			<p>Breaking waves (and especially after breaking) are difficult to model analytically, and it gets worse when you start to include air, which plays a major role. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics" target="_blank">This is best done on computers</a>, in particular Lattice Boltzmann can do a good job of dealing with the complex fluid/air boundary.</p>		</li>

			<p>As a remark to the breaking of the tsunami wave: the breaking occurs when the wave becomes too steep (ratio of wave height and length). Due to the extreme wavelength of a tsunami wave of many kilometers, the steepness is very low. The tsunami wave therefore does not break as it approaches the coast and maintains a lot of energy as it flushes onto the land. This is also a reason tsunamis are so destructive.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hey, /u/Davecasa and /u/hodyoaten, thanks for those answers!  I had a followup question along the lines of &quot;Well, would tsunamis and rogue waves pretty much mostly affect anything near the surface, but not have much or any affect on things that are deeper?&quot;, and y'all answered that perfectly.</p>		</li>
