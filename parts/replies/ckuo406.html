			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid response. So basically the marine life in the shallower water is definately affected. This raises another question for someone out there. Were there any documented cases of large animals (sharks, whales, etc...) washed up on shore during the indian ocean tsunami? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many deep sea creatures that haven't been documented before have been washed up during tsunamis. I can't say for sure if they aren't hoaxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction: In deep water, &quot;normal&quot; (ie. surface gravity) waves move water particles in circles, which get exponentially smaller with depth, mostly fading out by the time you get to about one wavelength in depth. As you move into shallower water these circles stretch into ellipses which get flatter as you approach the bottom (at the bottom movement is only horizontal), and as you get near breaking, the water particles no longer travel in closed trajectories, instead gradually creeping in the direction of wave motion near the surface, and opposed to it near the bottom.</p></div>		</li>
