			<div class="markdown"><p>but that time in the convection zone can be neglected when talking about the time photons take from the core to the surface. The transport in the convection zone is on the order of days, while the transport below is in the order of thousands of years.  </p>
<p>edit: bla bli blub, i should never trust my memory. Its not days. But the it is still 5 orders of magnitudes faster. See comment below for a reference.</p></div>		</li>

not days but still much much shorter.<br />
I don't have a non paywall link right now, but here you can see that the diffusive timescale in the convective zone is 10^5 orders faster than the thermal one. Also the mixing time scale is on the order of months.
