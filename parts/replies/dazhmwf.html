			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, this can be bypassed by one of two ways (depending on the country). You can store the bulk of your fortune in places like the Cayman Islands or Switzerland. You can then pass the money on over there without the knowledge of your government, and your government cannot tax what they do not know you have. Additionally, these countries are tax havens, and their banks will refuse to acknowledge that their account holders have accounts, thereby providing no legal basis to tax those funds.</p>
<p>The second method is much simpler and is perfectly legal (for the most part). Before you die, you just hand over your money and assets, generally as a series of gifts (each &quot;gift&quot; is still subject to the non-taxable threshold of $<del>5.45 Million</del>14k per year). <del>You can sell your estate and companies to your child for a dollar, and nobody can force you to charge more than that.</del> Another way of doing this is to set up a Trust Fund, which will pay out a stipend to the recipient for a predetermined amount of time (usually their whole life), but will legally belong to the person who set it up and be managed by a board of Trustees, even after they die. The recipient of the stipend will usually only end up paying capital gains tax (which is lower than income tax), thereby paying less taxes overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't sell a business for less than it's fair market value to a family member without IRS scrutiny. If they determine you've under charged they apply the gift tax to the amount you under charged. </p>
<p>Also gifting your assets does nothing to reduce your estate tax because the amount you are allowed to gift in your lifetime is equal to the overall estate tax exemption of <em>about</em> 5.4 million. </p>
<p>The real answer to OPs question is:</p>
<p>There are a number of transactions that a wealthy individual or family can take which over time will reduce their exposure to the estate, gift, and generation skipping tax system. They are complex and if you're interested I'll post some examples. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other, more creative ways to get your wealth back. For instance I've heard of people gifting each of their grand children a trust containing the maximum gift amount each year, with the only stipulation being that they must use every dime to take out a one year life insurance policy on the gifter. The payout on these term insurance policies are enormous and the estate tax is pretty much nullified by the insurance payout.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The rates are pretty comparable to normal income tax right now</p>

<p>Except that it is double taxation - they have already been taxed on income, so its about double normal income tax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. If your estate is ONLY cash savings then yes you're getting fucked. </p>
<p>But if you're bill gates or mark zuckerberg then the vast majority of your wealth was capital appreciation which was never taxed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people miss this point. Trump has likely never paid taxes because of his real estate holdings and &quot;non cash losses&quot; like depreciation. All the while his holdings have grown exponentially in value. Now they will be able to be passed off to the kids tax free. Trump never paid tax on their appreciation in value and instead of a &quot;sale&quot; happening at death where the appreciation would be taxed it will instead flow tax free to the next generation. Who could then simply take out an 80% mortgage on the value and pocket the money while never paying a dime on the property as long as they don't sell it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you turn it from stock into cash, the gain is taxed as long-term capital gains.</p>
<p>It's a smaller tax rate than personal income tax but still taxed (20% vs. 39.6% marginal top bracket)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By that logic, everything is double taxation. I paid income tax, used the remaining (already taxed money) to pay someone for services and now they have to pay income tax on the money that I was already taxed for. Money is always taxed when it changes hands, that's how taxes work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL some countries still have death taxes. Australia got rid of them on account of the way they adversely effected the passing on of rural family businesses. </p>
<p>Ultimately, those businesses tend to be asset rich but money poor, as a result, family businesses were having to sell land to pay the estate tax - and there is a certain point where forcing the sale of land makes the farm unviable.</p></div>		</li>
