			<p>I was in a really bad car accident, both of my ankles were crushed, my hip was dislocated, and I was pinned under the dashboard. I didn't feel the pain of either injuries, in fact I tried to push myself out from underneath the dashboard and was confused as to why I couldn't move the whole entire bottom left of my body.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup. Cracked my head open because I bashed it against a concrete pool deck (I was a dumb kid). Had to get 8 stitches. Thought I had just bruised myself until I reached up and felt blood.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's why suffering makes such a slippery metric for measuring moral wrongs. A paper cut can hurt worse then a broken bone. An overweight food addict suffers more then a far needier African kid if they miss a meal. Somewhere someone almost goes into shock from getting sprayed with cold water, elsewhere someone willingly gets into a lake of similar temperature for recreation. One person feels deeply upset when you question their religion, another one is relieved that the insults being thrown aren't rocks (this time). What goes on in someones mind, while important, is poor grounds for basing fairness or law. That's why things like liable laws, hate crimes, religious sensitivity, sensitive political correct terms, etc are so contentious.</p>		</li>
