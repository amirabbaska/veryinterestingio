			<div class="markdown"><p>So, just to get this straight, you're saying that the attraction between two Chloride ions is less than the attraction to water molecules that surround it in solution, so that's why it is unlikely that they will form Cl2?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 Cl- ions not only repel each other but if you were able to magically force them next to each other, they would not react. They are &quot;stable&quot; (aka unreactive). They are no longer in the game anymore. </p>
<p>Also 2Cl- --&gt; Cl2 cannot happen but 2Cl --&gt; Cl2 can. Its a very small difference but its a very distinct one that you need to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hydration energy of a single (gaseous) chloride ion is -378 kJ/mol. The bond enthalpy of molecular chlorine is -243. So the ion-dipole interactions in water are more energetically favorable than the formation of a covalent bond between two chlorine atoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OPs question</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would have to change in order to make the Cl- form covalent bonds and become Cl2?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't need a catalyst. Catalysts don't make reactions more thermodynamically favourable they increase the reaction rates. You'd have to provide enough energy to pull away the electrons from the Cl- ions to produce Cl (or more formally Cl2) i.e. oxidation. Electrolysis is one way to do this in a controlled manner. At an anode in a solution containing Cl- ions, chlorine gas is produced.</p>
<p>Although the chlorine will readily form hypochlorous acid in the water. If the solution is alkali in nature, as is common with the electrolysis of alkali metal salts like NaCl, then bleach (chlorates) will form.</p></div>		</li>
