			<div class="markdown"><p>So would it be true to say gifs are a wasteful resource? If you are making a gif for the purpose of having a &quot;short video&quot; would you say that it's an inefficient solution. It just  seems like with all the smart technology now a days gifs are behind the curve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gif format was supposed to be a method to send several pictures in one package so if you wanted to send ten pictures, you'd send just one file instead of ten.</p>
<p>The thing was that, if you plaid them sequentially, you could have animation, so in the early web days they started using them for that and they stuck.</p>
<p>There are some more technical issues at play, like for instance, is technically more complicated to insert a video than a gif. Also gifs are always gifs, videos can be mp4, webm, ogv, etc. Mobile devices usually don't autoplay videos but do gifs. Having multiple videos reproducing at the same time in the same webpage can give problems too. These all are things that are being ironed right now in current generation browsers and devices, but it's taking a while.</p>
<p>But deffinately yeah, gifs are not only behind the curve, they never were intended for this purpose on the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="/sweetiebook" target="_blank"></a> Yes, gifs are outdated, if possible use gifv or webm, smaller size and can be smoother in framerate •If an animation•</p>
<p><a href="/scootapoint2" target="_blank"></a> Gifs still have use, like in compatablity terms, but if you have the choice of gifv/webm or gif, choose gifv/webm</p></div>		</li>
