			<div class="markdown"><p>The original Polaroid film came as a roll, and the emulsion was very soft, so prints could scratch easily. </p>
<p>Polaroid supplied a stick of a waxy gel that you would spread on the print as a surface hardener.  That gel took time to dry, which was why people originally would wave/shake the picture.</p>
<p>The SX-70 film, with no peeling, had to have its chemistry modified to deal with the cooling effect of being waved, as people couldn't be trained to stop doing that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With some models, you could snap a pic then shut off the camera before it spit the film out. Turn it back on, take another pic for a cool double exposure trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooo, that's cool. I've never heard of that. It wouldn't turn out over-exposed and washed out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure. It took some practice to get it just right. Turning off the flash helped a lot.  The best application was for taking ghost pictures.  You could make someone transparent sitting on a couch or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine you'd get similar effects to a regular film double exposure. I used to know the math to get two roughly proper exposures, I think it was something like first photo around 2 stop under and then 1.5stops under for the second </p></div>		</li>
