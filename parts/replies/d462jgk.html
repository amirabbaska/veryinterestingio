			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this for anyone that doesn't know: a polar orbit is an orbit that passes over the poles i.e. <a href="http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter5/graphics/polar_orbit_schem.jpg" target="_blank">it doesn't really go east or west, just north or south</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's on a 51.6 degree inclination. When NASA and the Russian space programme negotiated the placement of the ISS, 51.6 degrees was chosen as a compromise.</p>
<p>1) It allows both Russia and Cape Caneveral to launch to it efficiently-ish (Cape normally launches at 28 degrees as its latitude is 28 degrees. Russia launches from 46 degrees so its ideal inclination would be 46 degrees. The reason they use 51.6 is covered in point 2)
2) The rocket launches from Russia don't pass over China and risk diplomatic incidents.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just looked it up to be exact, and it's got an inclination of 51.6 degrees; pretty far from 90, but still pretty high. That's to accommodate the Russians when they launch from Kazakhstan/Russia.</p>
<p>I've heard (but I'm not actually sure) that the ISS was originally planned to be used as a sort of checkpoint for deep space missions, but they needed funding from the Russians, so it ended up being a high-inclination orbit that made those missions impractical. If somebody could confirm or deny that I'd be grateful.</p></div>		</li>
