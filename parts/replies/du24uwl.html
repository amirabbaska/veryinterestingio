			<div class="markdown"><p>This is entirely dependant on the mentality you have toward something. If you allow yourself to have the mentality that these tasks are positive, and see the positive outcome of when they are complete, as well as have small tasks set toward reaching a goal, your brain can easily flood you with the positive chemicals. After some time you can make it to where you seek out tasks that benefit you in the future rather than now as the form of pleasure. Perspective changes everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a question that itself suffered from overwhelming valuation by a human, this is a fine point to make.</p>
<p>It can take a lot of learning and studying to be all manner of terrible human being.</p>
<p>A videogame can impart learning and studying much faster, that expands the empathetic considerations of terrible human beings.</p>
<p>Terrible human beings can still use those lessons for bad.</p>
<p>Or for teaching students that their videogames are confusing distractions, because the teacher doesn't understand this manner of human artifact in any educational way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TV is more living vicariously through others. Rather than having to live a week to accomplish a goal, you can watch a character on TV accomplish all the goals you have for a month in a few hours. Thanks to empathy, our brains can make us feel the satisfaction of someone else's win as though it was our own. We have a bad habit of watching someone do something good, thinking 'hey I'd do that in their situation too', then feeling the mental reward like we really had jsut done that our selves.</p>
<p>The nature of TV programs compounds experiences someone might have once in a lifetime, multiple times into a few hours of TV. Your brain would rather sit there and reward itself for what it thinks it would do, than dredge through real life waiting for the opportunity to act the way you think you would have in the situation on TV.</p>
<p>Long story short, its easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that most of the things we learn, we aren't particularly interested in or don't know what we are going gain from the knowledge. Schools force us to learn a lot of stuff we don't want to learn about because it's part of the requirements for passing education. </p>
<p>I'm sure everybody would study a lot harder if there was more flexibility in what we could learn. And we were told why we are learning whatever in certain cases, so we could make a goal out of the course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breaking from the source is almost always necessary. It's also important to recognize that because of brain chemistry, it's going to suck for a little bit. This is why self-determination is always so important, and why you hear people all the time talk about how they tried to quick some addiction several times, but didn't until <em>they</em> were the ones that wanted it. If getting better is something that the person wants, that can give them the willpower to make it through the few sucky days before they're able to return to &quot;normal.&quot; </p>
<p>To help get through the sucky days, doing healthy stimulating activities is good. Exercise is one of the best things someone can do as it directly releases endorphins, as well as eating healthy and accomplishing needed tasks. Doing these things sucks for someone overcoming a psychological addiction because they won't feel a lot of joy from doing them at first, but that's where the willpower comes in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no expertise on specifics, but I can tell you it may not be enough to just take a break from media - I think you need to REPLACE it with something both rewarding and productive. Exercise is a great start, as several here have said, but start thinking beyond that, unless you are a fitness buff.</p>
<p>I've taken a number of long breaks from fun things like video games, television and fandom, and my life didn't really get any better, nor did I regain the creativity and motivation I had in youth. The one thing that inspired me to take up new interests was actually Reddit... and now I'm addicted to this. FML.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A break from media is definitely a good place to start. It would give you a good sense of what equalized brain chemistry felt like, and more importantly let you know how much different that is from how you normally feel, so you know how much, if at all, you might need to limit yourself later.</p>
<p>Long term it's important to establish healthy use habits for all of these stimuli. As well, and this will sound really corny, mindfulness meditation can help. It's pretty popular in some cognitive psychology circles that have grown recently.</p></div>		</li>
