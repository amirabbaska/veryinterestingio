			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for answering... I understand your point when you say, &quot;If you tried to divide 1 by 0, that's impossible because you can't divide by something that isn't there.&quot; but in the case of 0/0 you are dividing nothing by nothing, so isn't it possible that the answer also could be nothing? I am still confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying an answer is zero isn't the same thing as saying it can't be done.  Dividing is the process of splitting something into equal, but smaller parts.  When I divide 3 apples into 2 groups- I have 1.5 apples in each group.  Division is a verb.  You can't divide anything into zero groups.  Even zero.  </p>
<p>You actually can't eat zero apples either.  It's meaningless logically.  You can not eat.  But you can't eat zero.  </p>
<p>Also, if you allow zero to be divided by zero, it creates problems down the road.  If 0รท0 = 0 and 1รท0 = 0, then 0=1... which can't be true</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you can have nothing, but you can't divide by nothing, if that makes sense?  </p>
<p>You can divide &quot;nothing&quot; into whatever you want and still have &quot;nothing&quot;.  But you can't have a &quot;nothing&quot; group.  You can't divide by nothing because you wouldn't be doing anything at all.  My apples example still applies even if there isn't anything to divide.  </p></div>		</li>
