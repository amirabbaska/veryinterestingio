			<div class="markdown"><p>The NPR doesn't really explain it in detail. What the NPR does explain is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>States will have more control over education in their state</li>
<li>Teachers won't be evaluated <strong>solely</strong> based off student test scores -- this is a <strong>BIG</strong> change because teachers <del>were</del> <strong>could be</strong> pressured into marking up their students in order for the school administration to receive funding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking into it has led me here to this [<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/the-bloated-rhetoric-of-no-child-left-behinds-demise/419688/" target="_blank">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/the-bloated-rhetoric-of-no-child-left-behinds-demise/419688/</a>] :</p>
<ul>
<li>States have more control</li>
<li>Annual testing is still required, but 95% of students must participate.
<ul>
<li>Must &quot;disaggregate data based on studentsâ€™ race, income, and disability status&quot; (basically states that the grade results are <em>categorized</em> <strong>EDIT</strong> - Thanks /u/Xaxxon)</li>
<li>Can use other factors on top of scores to assess performance, and</li>
<li>Details on how testing is performed and results are interpreted are left up to the states.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>$250 million in annual funding to early-childhood education</li>
<li>More money towards proven strategies that actually help kids learn</li>
</ul>
<p>I also read over this guy [www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/The_Every_Child_Achieves_Act_of_2015--summary.pdf] :</p>
<ul>
<li>Grades 3-8 will require two tests, reading and math, per year, but once <del>per year</del> in high school</li>
<li><strong>YAY</strong> - science tests given three times between grades 3 and 12 (should be every year, IMO)</li>
<li>Grants for low performing schools identified by the state</li>
<li>More funding for professional development and teachers (not likely to see any increase in salary)</li>
<li>States are NOT required to develop and implement teacher evaluation systems, but they are given the option</li>
<li>Requirements of the school districts to measure English language proficiency</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funding for lower performing schools is, in my opinion, the single biggest improvement. The idea that funding was not increased for poor performers is kinda like telling a starving person that they can't eat dinner until the put on some weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, but this is a difficult thing to implement though. It &quot;can&quot; incentivize schools to actually do worse in some sense. I don't see this as something that would actually happen (especially on a wide enough scale to matter). The bigger issue is that you also want to reward the schools that do well. Again, I'm not saying this is bad, just that it's hard to balance so that it works as intended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funding for low performing schools was very much there in NCLB.  This is not a change.  This funding is very problematic.  As soon as the school 'improves' the funding stops.  So, a low performing big school gets an extra million dollars, and they go out and hire ten new teachers.  They then do better, the money evaporates, and there's no funding to continue paying those extra teachers.  They are laid off, performance drops again, rinse, repeat.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It means to break data out into categories.  Aggregating would be to lump them all together.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how I feel about this. Doesn't this mean that kids from less fortunate backgrounds will be given leniency? I understand the thinking behind it, but it seems to be students should be evaluated objectively on whether or not they know the material. At the end of the day, all that really matters is whether they've learned anything or not.</p>
<p>Now, if it's to provide benefits to those from lower incomes, that's different, but then I don't understand how grades has an affect on it at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not necessarily true. States have to develop their own teacher accountability standards which can (and probably will) include tests. But those standards now have to include other factors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not going to pretend like I understand education policy haha so I have a question:
I have a friend who teaches in a bad high school in inner city Philadelphia. He said it is really sad because the entire district has no funding and no one gives a shit about these kids. He feels like he isn't really helping these kids as much as he wishes he could. Will this bill help with that problem somewhat? Will they get more funding? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly but doubtful, and I would bet if anything they will get less funding. This bill is putting the onus on the state and local governments on how to divvy and assign funding. From what I have seen, the federal government usually does a better job at directing funding to poorer performing schools. Unfortunately the parents of the better schools are usually more active than those of poorer performing schools and so the squeaky wheel gets the grease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funding problems are often state-funding problems.  Many states have funding based off of local property taxes, which hurts poorer areas.  Some have a baseline funding level based off of COLA regardless of local tax intake, which makes it more equitable.</p>
<p>Federal money is there to <em>supplement</em> for socioeconomically disadvantaged students (Title I) and English Learners (title III), but it isn't enough in some states where poorer districts get the shaft.  One thing this new law does is remove some of the strings on this federal funding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>States and districts must provide technical assistance to help consistently low performing schools develop a comprehensive improvement plan, assess and address resource equity, and offer comprehensive learning supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<p>ESSA authorizes several funding streams to:</p>
<ul>
<li>implement multi-tiered systems of support (e.g. pbis) to address student learning behavior, and mental health</li>
<li>expand access to school mental and behavioral health services
improve school safety and crisis response</li>
<li>create trauma informed environments</li>
<li>improve family/school/community collaboration</li>
<li>provide professional development on evidence based early identification and intervention methods</li>
<li>improve early literacy services</li>
