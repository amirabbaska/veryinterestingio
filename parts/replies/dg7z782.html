			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This is why athletes sometimes choose to train at high altitudes. When a lower amount of oxygen is avalaible, the kidneys produce more erythropoetin (EPO) in order to supply the tissues of the body with sufficient amounts of oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about people like my son whose O2 sats are consistently ~88% because of heart defects?  Do the kidneys know that 88% is normal, and only trigger making more when it goes below that?  Or is something else at play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's amazing! Do you through what mechanism would the body get rid of extra RBC? Let's say I lived in high altitude for a month and then returned back down.. do cells routinely die and the body simply replaces less?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep! RBCs usually live for only 120 days, as they do not have a nucleus. the spleen filters and tosses the worn out cells, but recycles their iron components! </p></div>		</li>
