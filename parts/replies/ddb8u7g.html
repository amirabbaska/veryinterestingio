<p>(Horrible as in unqualified, unpopular, no experience, no reason at all really)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh no, that's not a &quot;check and balance&quot; that is the American people having voted in enough of one party over the other making the 2nd party ineffective because the American people willed it to be that way. What you are talking about is having a set amount of senators and congressman per party that cannot be altered thus enforcing &quot;check and balance&quot; and that is horrible because it completely removes the American people from the process and further impedes 3rd party.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no I'm talking about if Congress doesn't do their job and just does what the President wants them to do. They just approve whatever the President says even if it's an objectively and provably wrong idea. </p>
<p>IF</p>
<p>Who can stop Congress from doing this? Only voters right? So you're saying that once you get elected to Congress for 2-4 years, you are under no legal obligation to actually uphold your oath during that tenure? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you think they are horrible doesn't make it a constitutional problem. The Republicans won control of the presidency and the Senate according to the established rules in the Constitution. The president can pick anybody he wants. If he can convince the Senate to approve them then the system is working as designed. In a democracy people you disagree with will sometimes get their way. Want it your way? Convince enough people to vote for candidates you agree with. You get another chance in 2018.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Why would they be &quot;supposed to block it&quot; when the representatives of the people think it is a good appointment? If you personally think it is a bad appointment, or a minority of voters think it is a bad call, your views not being followed is democracy in action. That is how it is supposed to work.</p></div>		</li>
