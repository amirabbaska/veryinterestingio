			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard a podcast about Blackstone and Colony Capital doing this and that's what got me thinking.  It sounded like they would have no reason to ever sell a property as long as there are renters looking for a place to live, so it seemed like over a long enough time-scale it could happen, but it sounds like the numbers don't add up, the market it just too big, and that at some point the creation of new supply would act as a release valve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also need to take into account the present value of cash flows; as long as the PV is higher than the selling price of the house, then yes it is better to hold.   But cash inflows in the future are always worth less than money inflows today, due to risk, inflation, and opportunity cost of not having the cash today.  There are many cases that it's better to sell and take the cash today than have future cash flows.</p>
<p>Basically take all future rent receipts growing at a certain percentage, minus expected expenses (property tax, management), then discounted at an appropriate rate (to account for market risk and opportunity cost).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is super interesting and totally counterintuitive to me, but most things in economics and finance are.  In my hypothetical a guaranteed cashflow, even if it's smallish, is the ideal outcome.  But from reading all the comments it sounds like I am overestimating the inelasticity of demand, and the uncertainty of that cash flow in the future.  Basically your sentence &quot;But cash inflows in the future are always worth less than money inflows today, due to risk, inflation, and opportunity cost of not having the cash today&quot; is blowing my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For private equity companies though, they are always looking for their exit opportunity, because ultimately, they are managing other people's money, and those people will want their money back at some point. Imagine if the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board put $200m in a Blackstone fund, Blackstone went out and did all the steps outline in the posts above, and then a few years down the line, the CPPIB will say 'hey, it's been 5 years, like to have my money back now to pay out to my pensioners' (this is a very simplified example). </p>
<p>So there are other reasons why a PE fund would want to sell out, not necessarily economic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I didn't think about the private equity exit strategy.  In my hypothetical, I pictured the PE head just holding on to those properties forever as a permanent form of cash flow for the rest of his life and his descendants, which sounds like isn't very realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're kind of right, if they could have a controlling interest so to speak in the housing of an area they could raise the rent until the local industries were forced to raise wages or one of them would go out of business, right? People would either move in together or move to another place and work at other jobs. This is why company housing is a thing and can be very exploitative.</p></div>		</li>

The magic number of competitors required is 5.<br />
If you have five or more competitors there's not enough cooperation to accomplish that without someone breaking ranks and gaining market-share by undercutting the colluders.  </p>
<p>So if you wanted government policy designed for free-markets you would put in a poison-pill that triggers once there are 4 or fewer players in a field. e.g. Taxes are jacked-up to 4:50%, 3:65%, 2:80%, 1:100%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting. The number of telcos, national banks, railroads, media conglomerates is right around there. </p>

<p>Or you just declare that if a company or group of companies controls that market to that degree, they become a regulated utility or are nationalized. I would rather find a way to encourage new entrants but in the case of things like telecom networks, water supplies or railroads, you really don't want that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this an experimental result? Prima facie it seems like even in a group of 2, one person could betray the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Undercutting to gain market share is difficult in this housing scenario. If 10 companies own a city the effect of one cutting its prices will be that his housing gets rented out really fast, but if demand is significant the others will not need to cut their prices. And the undercutter will probably raise his price again. </p></div>		</li>
