			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're current-limiting your voltage source, then you're likely not hitting the full 16kV output. </p>
<p>The way current-limiting works is to scale down the output voltage until the maximum current limit is reached. So you're really limiting your voltage as well. </p>
<p>Once you increase the current limit, it allows a higher voltage to be reached and sustained. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inductance mixed with the current comes into play. Opening the switch doesn't make the magnetic field vanish and the current won't instantaneously stop. The result is this continuing current builds up massive amounts of charge at the switch, until the voltage exceeds that required to arc. The higher inductance the circuit, the more arcing you get. </p>
<p>On top of that, once an arc starts high current ionizes the air better or even vaporizes the metal in the case of shorts. A high current arc sustaines itself better and over a further distance.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the electrical industry, there are switches that are designed explicitly for this task. Over the past few years, the organization I worked with deployed new switchgear for our site. 3 of the units are manually operated mechanical switches (switching 250kW @ 2400V 3 phase). The switches themselves are inside a sealed metal tank, that is presurized with SF<em><em>6</em></em>. This prevents any arcing, due to the high breakdown voltage.</p>
<p>The main new switchgear in our generating station uses vacuum breakers, so the contacts of the switches are inside glass vacuum bottles and are actuated magnetically. </p>
<p>This is all done to prevent that kind of arcing.</p></div>		</li>
