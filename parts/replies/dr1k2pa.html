</blockquote>
<p>This is likely the whole reason they wound up being domesticated from such an early point of human history, with evidence of early domestication efforts of felines as early as neolithic times in the middle east.</p>
<p>It's been posited that the symbiotic relationship between cats and humans started in tandem with agriculture; as humans began to practice agriculture and stockpile grain their settlements attracted rodents and other pests in large numbers. These then in turn attracted small feline species like the African wild cat to the settlements, setting the stage for their adoption into human society as a form of pest control. </p>
<p>Their effectiveness at this role has likely become pronounced with time and selective breeding from humans, though I couldn't comment on how big a deal this is as I haven't got nearly as much of an idea of how actively humans selectively bred cats rather than dogs, who demonstrate a wide range of morphology and behaviour as a result of human programs of artificial selection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasnt so much selective breeding by humans as it was, cats best at hunting and living near human settlements thrived the best and therefore the behaviour became dominant completely separate from human intervention. Cats generally werent kept as &quot;pets&quot; they were just a symbiotic member of the community that contributed to the safety of foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Now egypt during the pharaohs, and the middle east after the formation of islam, had a much more involved relationahip with the development of cats in their region, but this was more a reaction to their integral nature to civilization, rather than a facilitator for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, i've heard this argument falls short. Dogs had already been domesticated by that point, and are far easier to train. While a cat will kill a few rats for fun, a dog will do it all day every day because doing its job is fun for it. I can see cats behaviour being a reason we let it live next to us, but i'm willing to bet we domesticated it because awww.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember some years ago NPR started bringing this up and was advising to keep your cats inside.  I had absolutely no idea about it and thought that sounded like sound advice.  Most cat owners I knew were practically livid about it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I love cats and when I adopt one for myself it will be strictly inside only. I live in Australia where they are a severe threat to our native wildlife. Yet when you tell someone they should maybe keep their cat inside they get so defensive. It's not natural. It's so sad for Fluffy. Fluffy has natural instincts.
Cats aren't indigenous to Australia so them being here isn't 'natural'. </p>
<p>As if a well fed cat getting some entertainment is more important than the lives of thousands of birds? I don't get it. There are plenty of ways to provide stimulus for inside cats. Then their cat gets hit by a car or cat flu or something. Indoor cats have much longer lifespans on average too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The <a href="http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/lyalls-wren" target="_blank">Lyall's Wren</a> was a small filghtless bird that was downright friendly towards cats. There is a popular folklore that the entire species was made extinct by a single Lighthouse keeper's cat, but it was in fact a population of feral cats that killed it off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there evidence that the hunting of songbirds by domestic cats are generally a threat to the ecosystem or are the cats merely acting as the apex predator keeping the bird populations in check?</p>
<p>The numbers you quote sound very large, but without context in relations to the total populations of these birds and/or their reproductive rates, the numbers could very easily be misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just had this discussion in a cat group I'm in on Facebook. People think a cat bite isn't a big deal  because cats are so cute and lovely.  Injured people ignore others urging them to go to the emergency room right away. Cat teeth deliver a very aggressive and fast replicating bacteria <em>close to the bone</em>, risking osteomyelitis. Treatment for osteomyelitis can involve long term antibiotics, wound debridement (scraping all the infected tissue off its insanely painful), and amputation. If you're ever bitten you need an xray to look for bone chipping and an IV antibiotic, preferably before the swelling starts (you have about 6 hours before it gets bad enough moving your hand feels like you're being crucified).</p>
<p>Cats are predators and don't eat us simply because we are way bigger than them. Doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. They love the thrill of the hunt and are built to kill! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying cats don't kill and eat their owners because we're bigger and stronger than them just isn't really true considering many people around the world own big cats like cougers, jaguars, lions etc who do not attack or attempt to kill their owners. If your domestic cat was bigger it wouldn't really try to kill you. It might hurt you accidently when its playing but really domestic cats are soft handed and extra tolerant around kids and babies so theyre intelligent enough to withhold their strength when theyre around their weaker and smaller companions. Domestic cats are even known to live in harmony with mice and birds if it sees them as family and not food so again your point is mute.</p></div>		</li>
