			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem being that at some points you have to have breaks in the hull. These would be things like the gasket around the propeller shaft, water intakes for cooling systems or desalinization to produce fresh water for use onboard, overboard discharges, and any other openings for utility items that are near or below the water line. Also, metal hulls are made of sheets that are welded together, and all ships flex to some extent while moving through the ocean. The metal also expands and contracts with temperature changes, so the older a ship gets the more likely it is that the hull will develop cracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was specifically referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_pinaster" target="_blank">Maritime Pine</a>, which, while not as water-resistant as cedar (no other wood is), is nonetheless quite a bit more suitable for shipboard use than, say, beech. Oak is obviously best where available, but the question refers to ancient times, which means the Mediterranean, where oak was less common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me If I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that oak, unless it's specifically a really tight-grained white oak, is typically a poor choice due to its porous grain structure, it's weight, and it's tendency to quickly succumb to rot. Maybe it's a case of knotty pine, where the oak they used to have and the oak they have now aren't really the Same? </p></div>		</li>
