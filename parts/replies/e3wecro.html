			<div class="markdown"><p>That usually doesn't matter, though.  Though there are some ways that seem to play tricks on it, Kirchhoff's law states that absorbance and emissivity should be the same quantity, which lets them cancel out when finding the equilibrium temperature.  High reflectivity or transparency are mostly about changing the rate of thermal transport more than the final equilibrium temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works out to an average between the light and dark side.  The earth is the temperature that it is in large part because the atmosphere allows it to maintain the heat absorbed during the day and radiate it at night - effectively doubling the surface area that is in thermal equilibrium with the energy coming from the sun.</p></div>		</li>
