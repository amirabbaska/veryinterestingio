			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the camera man not see/be effected by any of this?  a 90 minute movie, for example, is not uncommon to have well over 130 minutes of actual usuable footage that is cut down by something NOT restricted in time.  </p>
<p>TV shows film, say, 35 minutes of show regardless, but it is the editor that sees the pressure of making it fit, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the job of the dop and the writer and director to give enough actual unable footage to the editor. It's à misconception that there is super amounts of extra footage. Each scène is carefully timed to understand runtime. What you see as extra footage is the différent shots taken for each scène. If there was actually as much discperancy then the final output would be very disconnected honestly </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't think of any film production camera roles with 'primary' in off the top of my head - it's usually 'First' something, because you might also have a 'Second', as in Camera Operator, First Assistant Camera, Second Assistant Camera - unless they just refer to the Camera Operator as the primary camera operator.</p></div>		</li>
