			<div class="markdown"><p>An excellent answer. Too many people out there don't realize that sometimes these are legal terms explicitly used to trigger certain procedures that must be followed.</p>
<p>For example, in the US one will sometimes hear that something is declared as a &quot;state of emergency&quot;. That is done to make sure certain things are done in accordance with specific legal requirements, such as allowing federal resources to be used, securing funding for emergency operations, etc.</p>
<p>Sure, &quot;terrorism&quot; has a definition people generally agree means &quot;makes people afraid&quot; or some such, but that has nothing to do with legally defining what the next steps will be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because it is easy to step down an investigation, but much harder to ramp one up. Treating an explosion of undetermined, but suspicious, origin as a terrorist bombing means that any possible evidence recovered will be handled and logged in accordance with evidentiary procedure. Explosives experts will be among the first people combing through the debris, looking for any of the components of the explosive device.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not true at all. There can be an attack with an explosion, a possible bomb, or a weapon of mass destruction that will be handled in the same way. </p>
<p>Terrorism refers to the people behind an attack, and their motivations. It has nothing to do with their method of attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the attack can be of many different origins, but by investigating it as a terrorist bombing, rather than simply a targeted murder or random act of violence, it alerts the intelligence community.  They use their resources to help identify the group responsible for the attack, if it was in fact a terrorist attack.  That's why the type of the bombing matters.  Because treating it as a terrorist bombing brings in the maximum resources and covers things a standard criminal investigation wouldn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So instead of terrorist bombing, he should say criminal act? Because I see what he means, a mishandled canister of pressurized gas will make a big boom, just like an actual explosive but you want to treat it as an intentional explosion as opposed to an accidental one. So I think he used the wrong term when he said 'terrorist bombing' as opposed to criminal act involving explosives which a terrorist bomb would fall under but so would a car bomb that the mafia, or any criminal org, left for someone in particular. Although my example is an assassination involving explosives, which by definition can be an act of terrorism, I think his main point is sound. Especially if you consider the mob example, a mob car bomb would need to have the FBI involved but a foreign actor, like ISIS, would also require intelligence agencies like the NSA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good ELI5. I think you hit the nail on the head with the explanation. I'd also like to add that I do think &quot;modern times&quot; have changed the expectation though, similar to &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; ideology having diminished in the eyes of many.</p></div>		</li>
