			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've always wanted to know but feel weird asking on the internet: on crime shows like CSI there is ALWAYS someone saying the murderer tried to clean up the blood but didn't clean it right so they find the blood with the black light... how do you actually clean up blood and bodily fluids, alcohol?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for hiding the evidence but I can talk to cleaning up blood. The problem with bleach / peroxide is it's obvious something was there and probably left blood in the cracks of the subfloor. It also bleaches fabric. </p>
<ul>
<li>Dab dry as much as possible.</li>
<li>Cold water only. Hot water will make it impossible. Ice water even.</li>
<li>Scrub with soap and cold water, rinse several times. Salt can be used as an abrasive.</li>
<li>1/4 hydrogen peroxide and water soak. Rinse. Scrub with hydrogen peroxide soaked cloth. </li>
<li>If no hydrogen peroxide bleach can be used as well, about 1/4 bleach. You have a larger chance of damaging fabric.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that alcohol above around 70% is actually not a disinfectant. This is because you need some water in order to rupture membranes and viral coats. Also, alcohol is not sporicidal so it will not kill bacterial or fungal spores. Therefore, it's not a complete full spectrum disinfectant.   </p>
<p>Note, alcohol is great at getting permanent marker off of non-porous surfaces. We use it all the time in the lab. Write on glass with a sharpie, then wipe it off with a paper towel with alcohol on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to add a caveat, I'm sure you're aware of but still think should be stated for others.</p>
<p>Do <em>NOT</em> mix the various cleaners. Mixing the Ammonia with Bleach is very dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: ammonia plus bleach gives you either chlorine gas (highly toxic), chloramine gas (highly toxic) or hydrazine gas (highly toxic and explosive) depending on the ratio you mix them in.</p></div>		</li>
