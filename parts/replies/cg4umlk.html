<p>That article describes the various pockets of stopped inflation as a multiverse. I had thought that in multiverse theories universes were separated by higher dimensions, such as in Brane theory.  However in this inflation context, it seems to mean pockets of our own space-time that are just causally separated from us by vast distances.  Was I wrong before, or does &quot;multiverse&quot; refer to both kinds of situations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the root problem is a failure to define &quot;universe&quot; universally among scientists. I would count all these little &quot;bubbles of causally connected regions&quot; and the space-like connections between them as &quot;one&quot; universe. Others would call each bubble a &quot;universe&quot; within the multiverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, &quot;multiverse&quot; is used for all kinds of things. It can be the different pockets of non-inflating space in eternal inflation, or it can be the different worlds of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics (if that's your take on it), or it can be braneworld stuff like you're talking about. There have even been <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2011/05/26/are-many-worlds-and-the-multiverse-the-same-idea/" target="_blank">proposals that the differences between these kinds of things are not as distinct as we might otherwise think</a>. Max Tegmark has a pretty good conceptual hierarchy of multiverses laid out <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html" target="_blank">here</a>. (He thinks they <em>all</em> exist, which is crazy, but then again he says it's crazy too, and crazy â‰  wrong, I suppose.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see the word used to refer to both all the time.  Also commonly used to describe the many-worlds interpretations of quantum mechanics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  I'm still trying to piece this together from all the comments.</p>
<p>So is our observable universe really just a small piece of the &quot;entire&quot; universe, which stopped inflating, and now just slowly expanding? </p>
<p>Is the reason why our universe appears flat is because we're so spread out so much from the initial inflation, maybe like our observable universe is like a little puddle on the surface of the earth (being the entire universe)?  Wouldn't that imply then that the entire universe isn't really flat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it clear that eternal inflation is actually implied/confirmed by this observational result? Or should that aspect still be considered unproven?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup: Does that mean that the fact that our observable universe is uniform just happenstance based on our location and that we could just as easily be located close enough to one of these inflation fields that we could observe it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the points against inflation is that it is hard to get the universe to stop inflating. However, this tensor-to-scalar value constrains inflationary models and should give us a better picture of what exactly is going on during inflation.</p></div>		</li>
