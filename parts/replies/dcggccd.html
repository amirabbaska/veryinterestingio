<p>It's like comparing IW engine to idTech3 engine. The former at its creation was based on iT3, but highly modified.</p>
<p>The only reason it doesn't have its own name is because Valve won't allow them to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unreal Engine used to be used by A LOT more companies during the 360/PS3 generation. There were so many more studios that were less established, so it made sense to buy middleware like Havok/PhysX and Unreal/idTech. But most of those studios have closed and the ones that remain have either been using Unreal already (BioWare) or have developed their own in-house engine a long time ago (Bethesda).</p>
<p>It's a huge undertaking to switch engines, so many engines are constantly updated sprawling monsters. Bethesda's engine is still based on the one they used for Oblivion, Bungie is still developing with a highly updated Halo engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Unreal4 engine has some great things going for it,  but in my opinion,  a few Achilles heels that really stop it working and taking off bigger.  Firstly they are trying to take on Unity and go mass market.  He you look at the trailers for Unreal4,  Blueprints,  demos etc,  you think,  holy shit,  I'm going the unreal route,  this thing is awesome!  However,  delve a bit deeper and you realise its not all that great.  </p>
<p>The image quality is great,  which is mainly down to being native 32 bit,   great integration of even better image filters such as AO,  eye adaption, flares, bloom,  that kind of thing.  </p>
<p>The downsides?   The UI, in general, is very poor and looks amateur IMO.  BluePrints and C++ don't integrate well.   Blueprints  looks great but no one really knows how to use them before ue4 and c++ is a great language but harder to work with,  harder to learn and more time to consume to write.  There's also far fewer apps available that push UE4 forward from the community.  </p>
<p>Then there is Unity.  Doesn't look as good out the box but you can get close,  if not a little further in some respects.  Great asset store to get you going.  You can basically buy premade games and tweak them.   Everything is C# which is more widely used,  easier to pick up and for the creative types,  more widely used already.  </p>
<p>So Unreal kind of fails on both sides.  Big studios won't use it as its still expensive.  Medium studios won't use it as C++ is more expensive to write for.   Small studio cant takes advantage of the graphics as its more about having awesome assets that make a great image rather than just the render engine.</p>
<p>UE4 has gathered a lot of traction in the visualisation field, however, replacing Vray and pre-rendered movies.  However even here it's not perfect.  Poor touch controls for interactive and a lighting engine that not up there with Vray.  </p>
<p>Unity has done really well holding its own and has pushed image quality a lot recently,  although UE4 probably still wins.  The thing is,  AAA image quality is no longer everyones cup of team.  Low poly style games have rocketed.  Its about creativity now rather than just amazing graphics and Unity is great for this.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What? Have you even used UE4??</p>
<p>Native 32-bit? What, in bit depth? MS-Paint can do that..
In executable? It's 64 bit...</p>
<p>The UI is fine, similar to Unity in some ways with a hell of a lot of extra features.</p>
<p>Blueprints and C++ integrate fully, you just have to enable it in your C++ routines...</p>
<p>C++ is harder to learn, yes, but Unity has a pretty ancient version of C# with some broken features (e.g. if you even <em>look</em> at foreach you'll trigger garbage collection).</p>
<p>Big and small studios use UE4, FF 15 was written in it for a start, it's <em>far</em> easier to &quot;take advantage of the graphics&quot; as an indie developer as UE4 actually has a shader node editor, you have to purchase it separately in Unity.</p>
<p>Touch controls depend on who coded them, not on the engine.</p>
<p>VRay is a ray tracer, UE4 is not. V-Ray could take hours to draw <em>one</em> frame because it's so accurate, UE4 is for real time.</p>
<p>UE4 can do low poly fine, it'll draw whatever asset you give it.</p>
<p>You can be as creative in UE4 as Unity, that's what blueprints is for, fast prototying and coding so simple a monkey could do it.</p>
<p>Both UE4 and Unity are good engines, both used widely, and pretty much all of what you've written is incomplete or incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to answer above,  and just FYI,  you are coming across quite aggressive ?  </p>
<p>What? Have you even used UE4??  Yes,  I was actually trying to switch to it but hit roadblocks.
Native 32-bit? What, in bit depth? MS-Paint can do that. In executable? It's 64 bit...  32-bit image depth.<br />
The UI is fine, similar to Unity in some ways with a hell of a lot of extra features.  -  Each to their own I guess,   coming from Max, Maya, Nuke, and the high-end pre-rendered world,  unreal looks like a toy.<br />
Blueprints and C++ integrate fully, you just have to enable it in your C++ routines...  Probably not my area of expertise so I will pass on this one.<br />
C++ is harder to learn, yes, but Unity has a pretty ancient version of C# with some broken features (e.g. if you even look at for each you'll trigger garbage collection).   Although I agree,  and C++ allows for far more,  its not something creatives use so isn't really great for small dev teams.
Big and small studios use UE4, FF 15 was written in it for a start, it's far easier to &quot;take advantage of the graphics&quot; as an indie developer as UE4 actually has a shader node editor, you have to purchase it separately in Unity.  Its annoying Unity has no integrated node shader editor but harder forge isn't much and personally I found it much nicer to use than unreal.<br />
Touch controls depend on who coded them, not on the engine.
VRay is a ray tracer, UE4 is not. V-Ray could take hours to draw one frame because it's so accurate, UE4 is for real time.  Again ill pass,  at the time I read lots of posts from arch vis people using for pre vis they were annoyed at a lack of multi-gesture support in unreal and stayed with unity for that specific reason.
UE4 can do low poly fine, it'll draw whatever asset you give it.
You can be as creative in UE4 as Unity, that's what blueprints is for, fast prototyping and coding so simple a monkey could do it.    I never said it couldn't,   however, if you go that route,  you don't really need ue4 to make that style game look good.
Both UE4 and Unity are good engines, both used widely and pretty much all of what you've written is incomplete or incorrect.  -  obviously, wouldnt agree but each to their own.  Some people confuse opinions with facts.  Everything we both have written is opinions.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean here.</p>
<p>Blueprint is more documented than Unreal C++ (see: Unreal YouTube channel), and the UI is designed for high-dpi multi-monitor setups.</p>
<p>And C++ is <em>waaaay</em> more widely used in AAA game development than C#. Almost every AAA game development engine has been written in C++.</p></div>		</li>
