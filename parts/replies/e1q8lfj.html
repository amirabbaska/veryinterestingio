			<div class="markdown"><p>I do stairmaster a lot too. Difference is that, on the machine, you can lean a lot more than with real stairs. I'm a deliveryman, and often carry things to third floor apartments, which is fun and more challenging. Much respect to movers. I could never do it with furniture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats a great point. I would try not to  bend and lean on the machine but I def used my arms for support so its def easier to do the stair master than actually climb the stairs of a corridor. Yeah movers and people who remove/install tile floors seem to have the toughest jobs!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Delivery guy here, when we pull up to a stop and see that it is a third floor stop that's when the cussing starts lol. 100 pound headboards by yourself aren't any fun and this summer heat just drains you.</p></div>		</li>
