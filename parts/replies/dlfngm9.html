			<div class="markdown"><p>A really interesting overlap here is the spine. Both orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons can sub-specialize in the spine, depending on the fellowship program, and different hospitals seem to favour different paths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh there's two parts to the spine:</p>
<ol>
<li>The vertebrae (bones)</li>
<li>The cord</li>
</ol>
<p>Orthos work on #1.  Neurosurgeons work on #2.  When a spinal cord surgery requires more room to operate (bones need to be removed) the neurosurgeon doesn't do it, they bring in an orthopedic surgeon to do it.</p>
<p>Where you're right about overlap is when you start dealing with the nerves leaving the spinal cord.  Impacted nerves are often operated on by both specialties.  From what I recall who does it usually is who you as a patient saw first.  If pain, usually a neurosurgeon.  If impacted motor function, orthopedic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also sooooo many specialists within ophthalmology. Retina specialists, cornea specialists, ocular-plastics (which includes lids of all sorts, tear ducts, bumps and lumps and filler injections), strabismus (lazy eye) specialists, low vision specialists, glaucoma specialists, neuro-ophthalmologists, and pediatric ophthalmologists. And don't get me started on how many people can't tell the difference between opticians, optometrists, and ophthalmologists. I went 25 years without ever having an eye exam. Now I work at an ophthalmology practice and I'm sure I'm still missing sub-specialties. Was totally fascinating the first time I had to help a patient (of our corneal specialist) get artificial tears made from his own blood (aka autologous serum tears. Weird crazy science shit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the upper airway anatomy is the cause of snoring, it can generally be improves by surgery.  A physical exam and sometimes a sleep study can pinpoint the problem.   If the septal bone ( separates left and tight aides of the nose) is crooked and/ or the turbinate tissues in the nose are too large, they cause mouth breathing and often snoring. </p>
<p>Some people overuse OTC afrin type nasal sprays to shrink the turbinates for a few hours. Unfortunately, over time, the turbinates rebound to be bigger or less responsive </p>
<p>Obesity contributes to snoring by crowding the airway. </p>
<p>Lax palate and long uvula (punching bag at the back of the mouth) can cause snoring and can be surgically corrected. </p>
<p>Turning on your side  or using  a CPAP machine opens up  crowded tissue</p></div>		</li>
