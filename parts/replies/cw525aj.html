			<div class="markdown"><p>1) I think the odds are pretty good! The main concern is safety and whether there will be any unforeseen side effects.
2) I completely agree on your concern here, but I think the critique should be directed towards the media. The problem is that the media wants to sell news papers. We have been very careful in our press releases going out from UBC and UCPH saying that our potential new treatment will take 2-4 years before first human dose.
3) Well, it is a merge between two different research fields - Parasitology and Cancer biology. In our case, we brought expertise together in Malaria research from UCPH and Cancer Research from my lab at UBC.
4) I am definitely proud, but I also have a strong feeling to get on with the next phases of these studies. This is just the beginning and we can use this technology for diagnostics, but also for immunotherapy applications. This is all something that we are working hard on now.
Thank you for your questions. Mads</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there,
what you are saying is true, the VAR2CSA by itself is not toxic it is used as a vessel to deliver drugs.
