			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I did a project on lithium ion batteries this semester and saw something about the use of nickel-sulfide iron-sulfide alloys being used in electrodes to prevent dendrites from forming which is why I ask</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dendrites are only a major problem for Li-ion batteries that have a lithium metal anode (or an anode with a negative-enough potential to permit lithium metal plating), and there are currently no commercially-available batteries with this chemistry.</p>
<p>In the case of dendrite formation, the problem is that dendrites can short the battery, leading to catastrophic failure.  This is not the same as a gradual degradation/loss of capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy only has to increase in a closed system though. As soon as you connect something that drains the battery or something that charges it, your system is not isolated anymore.
Sure nothing ever happens perfectly and there will be increase in entropy in the battery but technically it wouldn't have to occur in the battery itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not due to entropy. Entropy is why you put 100wh in and can only get 90wh out. Degradation is due to other processes. Saying entropy is too reductionist and like saying things wear and break due to entropy.</p></div>		</li>
