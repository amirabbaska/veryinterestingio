			<div class="markdown"><p>I really hope so. In my country, it’s 44 hours. My working hours officially starts at 9am till 7pm. That sums up to 50 hours a week. But how’s it legal? Let me break it down for you.<br />
 <br />
1 hour lunch break x 5 = 5 hours
15mins tea break x 5 = 1 hour 15mins
Resulting in 50 - 6 hours and 15mins = 43 hours and 45mins.<br />
 <br />
This all doesn’t matter anyway because no one leaves work at 7pm, and we all have our lunch at our desks. And the 15mins tea break? Hah! I guess you can account all the bathroom breaks that we take. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in government contracting and we had to account for our lunches (making up the time by staying later).</p>
<p>So people usually took 30 min lunches and left at 5:30pm.  I think this is much better than having a mandated 1hr lunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know that expression &quot;9 to 5&quot; as a reference for the work day? That came about back when employers paid for a lunch break. Then, in the march for increased Job Creator profits, employers stopped paying for lunch breaks, so &quot;9 to 5&quot; became &quot;9 to 6.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some places that do. Some only give 1 hour total break, half hour unpaid with 2 15min paid. Some do 1 hr unpaid still with 2 15 min paid. A few do all breaks unpaid and fewer still allow all breaks to be paid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it frustrating enough that lunch has to be taken off the clock, and often workers are expected to work through it, but a 15 minute break as well?  Nah, &quot;fuck you, pay me&quot; as they say.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm referring to the expectation that employees work through lunch. Not any enforceable thing. Of course a call to OSHA could shut that practice down in most places but the HR monkeys always say &quot;employees are required to take a lunch&quot; while the supervisors are talking about frequent &quot;working lunches&quot; because they and most their team members are bad at time management. Meanwhile, I'm just getting annoyed at this kind of peer pressure being put on me and only working through lunch if I'm &quot;in the zone&quot; on a project and don't want to step away from my computer while I'm making magic happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My work day is 6:30 am to 3:00 pm, but I never get out at 3:00. I'm in an unusual position of being salaried for anything under 75 hours in a two week period and getting OT for anything beyond that. Additionally I take call, which is 75% of what my salaried pay works out to when adjusted for hourly pay (75% to stay home, if I get called in you add OT to that). It's actually a pretty nice system. Downfall is when I put in 90 hours in a week and don't care about the money cause I'm too tired and it's difficult to decipher my paycheck at times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weirdly my workplace is 35, including two paid 15 min coffee breaks and 1hr unpaid lunch daily. So I'm there for 8 hours, but only working 6.5, while getting paid for 7. This is at a university in British Columbia, and it's the only place I've seen or heard of that does things this way around here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meanwhile on the railroad my lunch is paid, the. If I don't physically goto lunch I'm paid an arbitration and fuethmore if I don't goto lunch and then work more than 10 hours it becomes a &quot;double lunch&quot;.</p>
<p>Some jobs never &quot;goto lunch&quot;, you end up eating it on the engine which isn't a lunch facility.  So you get your paid arbitration and your normal hourly rate.
Most days they pay me $84.37 to eat my lunch on my engine because we're stopped waiting for a signal or another train or something.</p>
<p>So if you work your maximum of 264 days a year and never goto lunch  and work more than 10 hours they pay us $22,273.68 just for lunch.</p>
<p>Some of people will probably say some bullshit about unions driving up prices...</p>
<p>Truth is this is just the tip of the iceberg of railroad arbitraries and the railroads still make insane income s in the billions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bit more to it than that. I did some research on this a couple years ago and found studies from early 20th century that point at 40hrs being a good compromise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going below 40 hours doesn't really gain you more productivity per hour</li>
<li>Going above 40 hours decreases your average productivity per hour (you start to see diminishing returns)</li>
<li>Somewhere around 60-70 hours you reach max overall productivity <em>per week</em> (meaning going beyond that you become less productive)</li>
</ul>
<p>There was also some mention of 40 hours being the max &quot;sustainable&quot; work load, looking at productivity per hour across a number of months, which means you might have a good short term compromise at 50 hrs per week but that will lead to long term degradation in performance.</p>
<p>I'm not sure, but I want to say Ford was one of the driving forces behind some of this research. The studies I saw were all focused on blue collar jobs, I'm not sure how it translates to white collar jobs.</p></div>		</li>
