			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I almost never use a blow dryer so I have a couple of tricks up my sleeve. Get a microfiber towel and don't rub your hair with it, just wrap it around your hair like a turban for 5 to 15 minutes (depending on how long and dense your hair is) and then procceed to brush it with a wide comb. If not, use a conditioner on the shower and brush it there and do the same towel-turban trick once you get out. </p>
<p>Remember not to rub your hair with the towel, according to my hair stylist that can damage and tangle your hair; so just take the excess water off from your hair by applying pressure with your hands (don't twist it!) before putting the towel on. Voilà! It won't dry <em>instantly</em> but it will take way less time to dry than usual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some oil based products that provide smoothing and help displace water. My favorite is Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum. Using just a little bit will improve drying time. Otherwise, blow-drying while aiming at the roots is your best bet. Any exposure to air will help.</p>
<p>With thick and coarse hair you often experience issues much like a forrest floor with multiple trees.... Low sunlight, low wind. If you don't want to blow-dry, keep brushing exposing new &quot;pockets&quot; of moisture.</p>
<p>Good luck! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here except my hair is almost down to my waist. Here's what I do: Squeeze (but don't twist) from roots to tips with a super dry fresh towel that's been in 90 degree celsius laundry in the past week (it takes several laundry rounds for a new towel to get the proper rough dryness and absorbance). Brush, mosh, apply hairdryer for three minutes, brush, mosh again.</p>
<p>This gets the hair to separate into very thin bunches increasing the total surface area which in turn makes drying faster. From here it's maybe five more minutes of hairdryer or twenty minutes of waiting and it's mostly dry.</p>
<p>If I just mosh after shower instead, it takes like two hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the case for a lot of people with coarse and dense hair. I'm not trying to be funny, but you could consider purchasing a hood dryer for at home use. Predrying is amazing. </p></div>		</li>
