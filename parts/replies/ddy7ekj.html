			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. It is the only comment that addresses pressure in any capacity, which is the real issue here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_effective_pressure" target="_blank">The pressure pushing on the piston even has its own name</a>. </p>
<p>If the load is greater than the pressure of the expanding gases pushing on the piston the engine stop turning. /u/thephantom1492 describes the engine operating under light load, under governing action, and under stall. Readers should find his answer satisfactory. </p></div>		</li>
