			<div class="markdown"><p>Added to this, lenses are relatively small and optimally shaped to deflect impact.  Phone screens, on the other hand, are quite large and are shaped to provide even coverage of an LCD screen.</p>
<p>A better question would be &quot;Why can my eyeglasses take constant dropping and abuse while my watch's screen is so delicate?&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lucky! My glasses got scratched to hell and back just by cleaning with a lens cloth too frequently. But they're a magnet to dust, water marks, and smudges, so it's annoying not to constantly keep them clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember if I have the scratch resistant coating or the anti-glare coating. I also splurged and went with the transition (darkening) lenses for the first time, so hopefully scratches don't affect that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most Glasses aren't actually plastic at all, unless they're just reading glasses. People who wear glasses all day/ every day almost always get Polycarbonate lenses, which is way lighter and more durable than plastic. And if OP says their glasses take a lot of abuse, (mine do too, lol) they're probably polycarbonate. </p></div>		</li>
