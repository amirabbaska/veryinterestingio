			<div class="markdown"><p>Great history and all that shit, but I think its also important to mention the significance of the number 60, with 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, and also the importance of 12 with the day being 2 12 hour halves. It might make more intuitive sense to someone to break a full day into 10 or 20 hours. This seems smart at first since we think of 10 as a nice round number, but 10 is bad for creating smaller units out of.</p>
<p>Half of 10 is easy, 1/3 of 10 creates a repeating decimal, 1/4 of 10 isn't so bad but still creates a decimal. 10 simply does not have that many factors, just 1, 2, 5 and 10.</p>
<p>12 has the factors 1, 2, 3 ,4, 6 and 12 so 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 1/6 of 12 are all simple whole numbers to compute.</p>
<p>60 is even better, not only does 60 have the factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 but it even has the <em>consecutive</em> factors 1-6 so its easy to compute 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 and 1/6 of 60 without any decimals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>to the point where it's not even measured by observations based on the earth and sun, but by the distance light travels in a vacuum or how many vibrations a cesium atom makes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're kind of backwards on the light speed in a vacuum one. The oscillations in a Cesium atom is what determines how long a second is. The speed of light in a vacuum is used to define length, not time- a meter is defined as the amount of distance light travels in 1/c seconds, where a second is defined by the aforementioned Cesium and c is defined as 299,792,458 m/s.</p></div>		</li>
