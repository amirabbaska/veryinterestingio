			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it was the basis of his paper &quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot; during the time when Einstein was pumping out ground breaking theories every few months.</p>
<p>Don't quote me on this, but it didn't become &quot;Special Relativity&quot; until after Einstein came up with General Relativity... it was called Special Relativity to differentiate the two, &quot;This is a special case of relativity where spacetime is flat.&quot; Although, truth be told, I'm having trouble verifying that with a half hearted google search.</p></div>		</li>
