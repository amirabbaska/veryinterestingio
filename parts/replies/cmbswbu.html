			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind while thinking about this is that the electrons floating around in this 'empty space' orbit the nucleus at an absurdly fast speed. They're moving at something like 1/100th the speed of light, and orbit the nucleus more than a quadrillion times every second. </p>
<p>So, while technically the space is empty at any given instance, over the course of a millisecond there is probably an electron there at some point.
EDIT:Electrons don't even occupy single points, due to their wave-like properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't &quot;orbit&quot; as we think of planets or anything. Their wavefunctions are distributed around the nucleus. There's a fundamental difference. In reality, the electrons occupy all of that space around the nucleus. So while they have little mass, they take up a lot of space. This means that the &quot;empty space&quot; concept in an atom isn't actually true. It's an oversimplification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the &quot;shape&quot; of an electron isn't really a valid thing to talk about, as much as the uh... frequency of an electron?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you're not wrong, but to be fair it all depends on context and anything you say in a single paragraph is going to be an oversimplification. Unfortunately, matter and energy at these scales acts very differently than anything a common person is accustomed to dealing with so trying to express it with words is always imprecise. These are all just models we use to comprehend the phenomena a little more intuitively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there was the whole procession of cosmological models, and then when people started to probe matter, looking for the sources and exact mechanisms of electricity and magnetism, they found atoms. Which look like little balls. So when they started to shoot atoms with atoms, and later atoms with atomic nuclei, and then later with electrons .. they found scattering. So it turned out that there is something in the atom after all, it's not undividable (as the name atomos means that in Greek, tomo- comes up in acrotomophilia for example :) ).</p>
<p>And thus there are the whole procession of atom models (the Bohr model for example), and electron models. And then came Heisenberg, Schr√∂edinger, Plank and the whole bunch of famous physicists and the quantum revolution if you will. And then things are just getting crazier and crazier with new models (string theory, which actually means anything after quantumchromodynamics (QCD) and quantumelectrodyanmics (QED) (that is anything post Standard Model).</p>
<p>And if you think about it, the Higgs is just getting validated, a pretty insane part of the SM, and it turns out quite right. Who knows which part of the contemporary models we think are completely out there will become standard physics after a few decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, they've actually taken a picture of what a hydrogen atom looks like, aka the electron cloud.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/science/researchers-capture-image-of-hydrogen-atoms-electron-orbital-for-first-time-1556448/" target="_blank">See here</a></p>
<p>Electrons have energy states.  When you add energy, you can excite the electron up to another 'orbit' and when it takes a quantum leap back down to the original orbit, it emits a photon of light.</p>
<p>Schrodenger's cat paradox simply states that for some quantum events, the act of measuring the event changes the event.  If you measure an electron's position, you lose the electron's momentum information and vice versa.  Schrodenger posited (as a joke or thought experiment) that if you had a cat that lived or died based on a quantum event, until you open the box and look at the cat, the cat is both alive and dead, lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, though detailed correctly, is not Schrodinger's Cat Paradox, that is Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Schrodinger's Cat details the uncertainty of knowing the state of an unobserved object because not all factors are known.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there actually little gaps of absolutely nothing between the atoms. And within the atoms &quot;Solid nucleus&quot; there are still, even smaller gaps between the particles that make that up. its hard to grasp how nothing can be between them, but it is true. Its called the nuclear forces, which are the strongest of all forces (physical, magnetic, electric, etc). Its almost like magic honestly.. but atoms repel each other from getting to a point where they actually touch with such incredible force that not even our strongest mechanical machines could overcome it.. even a powerfull steel hydrolic press crushing metal, the atoms in the metals are not actually touching despite being crushed together.. that is how strong these forces are. Its what makes a nuclear bomb so powerfull.. we basically release that force. </p>
<p>Shoving two atoms together is not impossible tho, IF you did succeed to &quot;Shove&quot; too atoms together and get rid of the space between, youd be doing what is known as Nuclear fusion, which so far is only possible at the center of large stars like our sun due to the crushing gravitational force of all that mass on the atoms in the center</p></div>		</li>
