<p>Chance of re breaking it after the cast is off is high for humans. At least until they rehab. For a horse that doesn't know to hold back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My baby girl hurt her leg and was on stall rest for two weeks and that was hell on earth for both her and myself. She was miserable and kept hurting herself by wanting to play and run around. Sadly with these animals you can't explain it to them and I had her on this medication to keep all the blood flowing in her legs and we were continually checking for heat and swelling. It was not an easy couple weeks. But she is so worth it!</p></div>		</li>
