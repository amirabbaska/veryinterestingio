			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do that differently though. In germany only the family gets informed and only the first name and the first letter of the second name apears in media. </p>
<p>Its to protect the supposed convict from false allegations.</p>
<p>But even after conviction the name only rarely gets published. To make it easier to redeem the convict. Imagine screwing up once and having that stigma<del>ta</del> your entire life.</p>
<p>Edit: Also pictures only get published with consent of the person on trial. </p>
<p>Edit 2: Holy fuck this shit blew up. Please stop asking me question about law. I only know what I learned in school.</p>
<p>Edit 3: The system has a very easy work around. Foreign media still publishes the name. It's just so the news and papers don't get plastered with the persons face and name just to get better rating / sell more copies. Trials are also mostly open to public and there is no name censorment there. The trial also gets documented word by word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like it - one of the biggest problems with arrests in America is &quot;guilty by public opinion&quot;. Simply getting arrested can cost you your job, your kids, and just about everything you work to build. If you are later found not guilty or the DA doesn't indict, you are still fucked - your job will never turn a blind eye to a wrongful or incorrect arrest. So, even if you are completely innocent of whatever you were arrested for, you suffer almost all of the same consequences except the trial and prison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeaj, people dont stop and question their perception. In a perfect world, people would look at it like, okay this person was arrested for x. But an arrest isnt a conviction. People really perceive it like this though - They were arrested must be fuilty. People need to question their perception.</p></div>		</li>

Instead, it helps degrade our already shaky understanding of innocent until proven guilty and you know, that whole pesky due process thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be accomplished without making every person on the planet have access to arrest records and mugshots. An overly accessible arrest record and pending trial destroys someone's ability to keep and obtain employment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like more of an issue with your locale. Where I'm at, the amount of second chamce employment has skyrocketed in the past 5 years. Its common for felonious workera to be making $13/hr+  and some even get more cushy jobs, but in those cases there is usually another connection (just like many great jobs, its who you know that matters). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um.... I work in strategic HR and I can tell you with certainty that discriminating against an arrest that old for a crime you weren’t convicted of is illegal (so it won’t even be reported in 90% of background checks).  Also, finance managers generally do not give a shit about drug charges.  There’s either something missing in your resume, or you’re psycing yourself out and your worries about the arrest are leaking into other aspects of your presentation.</p></div>		</li>
