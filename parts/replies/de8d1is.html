			<div class="markdown"><p>Because only one machine in the public network directly connects to the internet. When you use McDonald's free Wifi service, you're not directly connected to the internet: you're connected to McDonald's network which itself is connected to the internet, and can route requests from you to the internet and vice-versa.</p>
<p>As such, if, say, Google notices someone from a given IP address has done something really really naughty, it will tell it to the cops who will only be able to notice that the request comes from McDonald. But whose computer on McDonald's network exactly? Unless McDonald's keeps track of everything going on in its network and was smart enough to check your identity before letting you access the internet via its network, it will be hard to tell.</p></div>		</li>
