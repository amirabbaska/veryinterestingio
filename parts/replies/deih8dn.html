			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why the customer's power in a market economy is to not give business to companies that make unrealistic estimates for costs in money and time. They will go under and the stronger company will survive. Argument above works from a customer's perspective as well though. An assessed late fee is capital the customer cant spend on other services. If i was a bank i would make late fees a forced savings mechanism that they can still use as a basis for capital investment but that gets returned to the customer after some period of time.</p></div>		</li>
