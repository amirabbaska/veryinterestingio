			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot of new trucks that come with a vinyl-like material instead of carpet. And you may think it is the base model versions. But it's actually the high end models. I presume it is because a truck is generally used for work, which will see muddy work boots and makes cleaning literally impossible. The same reason work trucks have leather seats, or at least vinyl seats. </p>
<p>Sound deadening isn't as large of an issue anymore because many vehicles have an undercoating on the chassis and underside of the body that deadens the sound. </p></div>		</li>
