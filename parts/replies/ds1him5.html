			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah if you're interested in this, I recommend looking up Eratosthenes' demonstration of the Earth's curvature. He not only proved that the Earth was round, he estimated the circumference and was only off by a few miles. This was all around 200 BC.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How were ancient people able to know the exact time of noon each day?</p>
<p>Is it using a sundial? I'm a bit confused on how a sundial is much different from the post you mentioned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example can be seen in the movie Castaway.  After living on that island for several years, Tom Hanks' character has drawn an analemma on the wall of the cave he lives in.  It may not be based on the noon sun, but the principle behind it is the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;STONEHENGE &amp; THE SUN
It is noticed ( since 18th century ) that the horseshoe of great trilithons and the horseshoe of 19 bluestones opened up in the direction of the midsummer sunrise. It was quickly surmised that the monument must have been deliberately oriented and planned so that on midsummer's morning the sun rose directly over the Heel Stone and the first rays shone into the center of the monument between the open arms of the horseshoe arrangement.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
