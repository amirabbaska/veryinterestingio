			<div class="markdown"><p>I was born in the US in 1986 and my entire life has been an experience of a long slow decline. It's really sad to watch, and it's also really sad how many people can't connect the pieces of why it is happening, and instead blame it on a scapegoat that the media has told them to blame it on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the most direct answer is income inequality. The rich are richer than ever and the poor are more poor than they've been in a long time. This is causing everything to fall apart. </p>
<p>As for why that's happening... I'd say it's just a natural oscillation throughout history, the pendulum of inequality swings back and forth. I expect in 20-40 years we'll see another period that was like the 70s and 80s in terms of economic prosperity for the average person. </p>
<p>As for the mechanisms of how that's happening, I think our privatized central banking system is a key part of this. The gov't has to borrow money from the central banks instead of creating it itself, which would be interest-free. Instead it has to borrow at interest. There's more debt owed than money exists. This debt burden gives the banks more control over the government. </p>
<p>Combined with lobbying/bribing, the corporations have subverted our legal system and twisted it to their own ends. This has also ruined and consolidated the media, which as in turn ruined the culture. In America there is very little culture other than  corporate culture that espouses corporate values. Unsurprisingly, this leaves us in a morally bankrupt position, but boy does it make those corporations wealthy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from your generation and my experience is the complete opposite. People are doing way better now. Sure, basic living supplies are a little more expensive, but the price of non-essential goods and services have gone down in relation to wages. I'm talking about electronics, cars, flights, clothes...etc. These things make our lives way easier, and as long as basic goods remain affordable (which they are for most), the future isn't all gloom and doom.</p>
<p>Remember paying a full month's wage to buy a basic camcorder in time for your children's birth? Such a thing would not even be possible today when even middle class middle schoolers have iPhones with better recording quality. Remember when even nice cars didn't use to come with seat belts and air bags? Those were dark times.</p></div>		</li>
