			<p>Hey I'm from the Uk and can say with some certainty that although the US seems further down the rabbit hole, the rest of us are tumbling not far behind.</p>		</li>

			<p>I guess that's the problem with Pax Americana. We're forcing everyone to follow our lead. </p>		</li>

			<p>From the US it seems like the UK is falling off a cliff. We don't have internet censors (yet) like you guys do</p>		</li>

			<p>I was born in the US in 1986 and my entire life has been an experience of a long slow decline. It's really sad to watch, and it's also really sad how many people can't connect the pieces of why it is happening, and instead blame it on a scapegoat that the media has told them to blame it on.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why is it happening? Is there any accurate explanation for Europe as well? I have days in which I wonder why everything is falling apart.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think the most direct answer is income inequality. The rich are richer than ever and the poor are more poor than they've been in a long time. This is causing everything to fall apart. <br><br>As for why that's happening... I'd say it's just a natural oscillation throughout history, the pendulum of inequality swings back and forth. I expect in 20-40 years we'll see another period that was like the 70s and 80s in terms of economic prosperity for the average person. <br><br>As for the mechanisms of how that's happening, I think our privatized central banking system is a key part of this. The gov't has to borrow money from the central banks instead of creating it itself, which would be interest-free. Instead it has to borrow at interest. There's more debt owed than money exists. This debt burden gives the banks more control over the government. <br><br>Combined with lobbying/bribing, the corporations have subverted our legal system and twisted it to their own ends. This has also ruined and consolidated the media, which as in turn ruined the culture. In America there is very little culture other than  corporate culture that espouses corporate values. Unsurprisingly, this leaves us in a morally bankrupt position, but boy does it make those corporations wealthy. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think the neoliberalism/neoconservatism bug spread to the EU as well, but it was on a delayed schedule. Thatcher in the UK aligned with Reagan, but the rest of Europe is delayed on the track America is moving down, but it does seem like the same track. I don't really know much about the EU situation though, to be honest, so I can't really give a comprehensive answer. </p>		</li>
