			<p>Hey I'm from the Uk and can say with some certainty that although the US seems further down the rabbit hole, the rest of us are tumbling not far behind.</p>		</li>

			<p>I guess that's the problem with Pax Americana. We're forcing everyone to follow our lead. </p>		</li>

			<p>I was born in the US in 1986 and my entire life has been an experience of a long slow decline. It's really sad to watch, and it's also really sad how many people can't connect the pieces of why it is happening, and instead blame it on a scapegoat that the media has told them to blame it on.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why is it happening? Is there any accurate explanation for Europe as well? I have days in which I wonder why everything is falling apart.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think the most direct answer is income inequality. The rich are richer than ever and the poor are more poor than they've been in a long time. This is causing everything to fall apart. <br><br>As for why that's happening... I'd say it's just a natural oscillation throughout history, the pendulum of inequality swings back and forth. I expect in 20-40 years we'll see another period that was like the 70s and 80s in terms of economic prosperity for the average person. <br><br>As for the mechanisms of how that's happening, I think our privatized central banking system is a key part of this. The gov't has to borrow money from the central banks instead of creating it itself, which would be interest-free. Instead it has to borrow at interest. There's more debt owed than money exists. This debt burden gives the banks more control over the government. <br><br>Combined with lobbying/bribing, the corporations have subverted our legal system and twisted it to their own ends. This has also ruined and consolidated the media, which as in turn ruined the culture. In America there is very little culture other than  corporate culture that espouses corporate values. Unsurprisingly, this leaves us in a morally bankrupt position, but boy does it make those corporations wealthy. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think the neoliberalism/neoconservatism bug spread to the EU as well, but it was on a delayed schedule. Thatcher in the UK aligned with Reagan, but the rest of Europe is delayed on the track America is moving down, but it does seem like the same track. I don't really know much about the EU situation though, to be honest, so I can't really give a comprehensive answer. </p>		</li>

			<p>As a GenXer, I agree. We seen the last of a great American economy with CAFTA, NAFTA and other &quot;deals&quot; in recent decades. Greed, like cocaine, can be an addiction that is never satisfied.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm from your generation and my experience is the complete opposite. People are doing way better now. Sure, basic living supplies are a little more expensive, but the price of non-essential goods and services have gone down in relation to wages. I'm talking about electronics, cars, flights, clothes...etc. These things make our lives way easier, and as long as basic goods remain affordable (which they are for most), the future isn't all gloom and doom.<br><br>Remember paying a full month's wage to buy a basic camcorder in time for your children's birth? Such a thing would not even be possible today when even middle class middle schoolers have iPhones with better recording quality. Remember when even nice cars didn't use to come with seat belts and air bags? Those were dark times.</p>		</li>

			<p>This to me shows the classical self-centric thinking of an American. I come from a ex-Soviet country, I live in the US right now I can say with 100% certainty i'm much better off right now. There area lot of countries out there who are much much more fucked right now.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, of course; the Soviet Union was a cesspool and that is why it is so sad to see that Putin wants to bring it back.  But remember, America used to be the greatest country in the world with the highest standard of living.  Now, America is a second rate country; sure, it's better than it was in the Soviet Union, but that's really not saying much.  Is America better off than it was 40 years ago?  Absolutely not.  We have the greed of the Baby Boomers to thank for this meteoric fall into the toilet, they are the ones who took the country that their parents gave them and destroyed it.  I was reading in another post that the Millenials are the cheapest generation, well, they should extend that principle of frugality to caring for the Baby Boomers in their elder years, and let them subside off of cat food.  Thanks to them, there's no more money left for their care.</p>		</li>

			<p>Would you mind expanding on this ? I'm genuinely curious. I was born in 1994, so this world is all I've known. </p>		</li>
