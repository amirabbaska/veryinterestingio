			<div class="markdown"><p>It's caused by the difference in the notion of the vacuum in a quantum field theory under transforming to an accelerated frame.</p>
<p>Basically, you can compute the ground state of a quantum field near an observer &quot;far away&quot; from (1) nothing and (2) a black hole. For the latter, the observer feels an effective gravitational acceleration, so it's like computing the ground state for an observer accelerating constantly. But you can show that accelerating a quantum field is equivalent to performing what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogoliubov_transformation" target="_blank">Bogoliubov transformation</a>, which leads to a final state with a thermal bath of particles of the quantum field in question.</p>
<p>I've never seen a calculation of Hawking radiation which resembles the &quot;virtual particle&quot; heuristic, so I'm not really sure why Hawking used it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always assumed  antiparticle exists as much as any decay-process mediator in a Feynman diagram. For the process to work, though, the antiparticle that falls in has to have negative energy, which may or may not have a physical meaning. It's all just complex probability amplitudes in the end, and we separate virtual particles into a separate category mainly to match our classical intuition anyway. </p></div>		</li>
