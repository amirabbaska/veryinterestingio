			<div class="markdown"><p>My baby had meconium in the womb, among a dozen other complications during my wife's labor. He had a really rough birth, and ended up in the NICU for several days. Seeing sick babies in the NICU, or even reading about it, still gives me anxiety and just makes me feel bad in general.  Not the &quot;aww poor baby&quot; bad, but like genuinely upset, and I'm not an emotional person.</p>
<p>Come to find out, from reading about emergency rooms, that people who visit family in the ICU can get PTSD. I visited my brother who was in a coma in an ICU for around a month, he didn't make it, but I didn't feel any PTSD from that.</p>
<p>But my infant son being in an NICU with a tube down his throat, and attached to all these devices was really rough. To put you on edge even more their heart monitor is attached the their feet, and if it gets a little loose everything flat lines and an alarm goes off.</p>
<p>But the worst of all was him not breathing when he was born (cord around neck), being blue, and having to be resuscitated. Luckily my wife didn't see that part because they (obviously) had to immediately take him away.</p>
<p>I don't care how stoic someone thinks they are seeing your baby in conditions like that is terrifying, and is still the worst experience of my life. My wife was really bad off for a month or so. Luckily we are all doing great now. Our baby boy is 6 and 1/2 months old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter and I spent a total of one month in the hospital and NICU. She nearly died during birth and was 8 weeks early. I didn't get to see her for almost 18 hours and the first pic I saw was her with tubes and wires, she was beautiful but so scary to look at. I couldn't drive by the hospital without getting extremely emotional for about a year because it left me so mentally ragged and I developed serious PPD. I am currently pregnant with our second and I'm terrified of it all happening again.</p>
<p>But our daughter is 3 now and absolutely perfect, and this pregnancy is also going much better than my first, so I have hope things will be ok. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So sorry you had to go through that. Ours was only in NICU for 3 days. And yeah, I don't know what was the worst image: a baby being born blue and not breathing or when you first see them with the tube down their throat and cords everywhere. Both images got seared into my memory, and I don't have good emotions when I remember them.</p>
<p>I hope this pregnancy and labor go smoothly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hated the NICU. I swear their cord slipped off once every hour which wouldn't have been a big deal if Baby A wasn't having Brady's. Bah. He gave us heart attacks. My husband was holding him after he ate one time and he fell asleep so deep you couldn't see he was breathing. It looked like he died except the monitor was saying he was fine. My husband was freaking out and I was looking confused as to why he was panicking about a sleeping baby (I had Baby B in my arms across the room). </p>
<p>Plus seeing them all in the cords is heartbreaking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a dad thing to make sure a sleeping baby is breathing. I still do it whenever I walk past his room when he is asleep. When he was a couple months old and first started sleeping long stretches I would wake up and check on him because I was used to him getting up every 3 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, sorry you had to experience it too. My wife asked how he was, and I straight up lied to her and said he looked fine. I told her later, after we finally got him home from the hospital, how bad it really was. She was glad I lied to her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of incorrect statements here:
-roughly 20% of deliveries will be complicated by meconium. Fetal stress can be associated, but thus is actually a minority of cases and meconium = distress is an outdated concept. The further along the pregnancy, the more likely it is to occur
-meconium aspiration is essentially a chemical pneumonitis (think a chemical burn in the lungs), although secondary infection can be very serious, hence the antibiotics many have mentioned. It typically happens shortly after delivery, so we don't generally stimulate the neonate to cry until we've had a chance to suction baby--however we no longer suction as the head is delivering, nor do we routinely suction the trachea, as was the case even a few years ago, as most kids won't need it and there is a risk for complications with this
-for the OP's question, most of this is blood and skin cells that the baby has swallowed, as well as GI secretions
-urine production in pregnancy is much more of a factor. Oligohydramnios (low fluid) can have a variety of causes, of varying severity, from placental failure to maternal dehydration. The cause is often more important than the amount of fluid present. Anhydramnios is a complete lack of fluid, which is what you see with Potter's sequence, although Potter's generally is used in reference to renal agenesis (no kidney development) which is universally fatal, often before delivery due to the many associated anomalies. Urinary obstruction is a completely different process, and doesn't lead to Potter's, although can sometimes lead to renal damage and failure, and if it's a urethral obstruction can lead to bladder rupture.
-the fetus is constantly swallowing it's own urine in normal situations. The respiratory tract is generally filled with secretions from the respiratory tract, however.
-again back to the OP's question, the kidneys are filtering the blood stream for the fetus, however since most of this is then swallowed it's not a very efficient system. Keep in mind, however, that all of this blood is also flowing back to the placenta, which does most of the filtering work. So while poop is common with normal development, and urine is necessary for normal development  (primarily for the padding it provides), neither is a significant component in waste management as they are after birth</p>
<p>Source: over a dozen years of obstetrical practice, including managing several patients with Potter's and thousands of kids with meconium (the vast majority of which did not need to have any specialty care)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to chime in that I agree with you, but I don't have any credentials. Our daughter was born a little under 2 weeks ago. She was 4 days late, and upon birth meconium was found in the amniotic fluid. She was whisked away by NICU folks for a few moments to make sure she was ok, but otherwise she was fine. The checks took less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The delivery doctor told us that it is extremely common in births that occur after the expected due date, and while it is something they need to check (hence NICU being on hand), it isn't exactly a major concern.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually fetuses do not breath amniotic fluid.  This is a common misconception even among healthcare workers.  Fetal lungs are filled with their own fetal lung fluid.  This fluid has higher chloride concentrations than amniotic fluid.  The reason the higher concentration is important is because toward the end of the pregnancy when the fetus is practicing breathing the fetal lung fluid can be whisked out of the lungs instead of amniotic fluid entering the lungs.  After birth the lung fluid is absorbed by the lymphatic system for clearance- the baby doesn't have to cough it up and it doesn't need to be suctioned out.  When amniotic fluid is aspirated it can cause a pneumonia and if it's particulate with vernix it can cause a pneumothorax.  As you are also aware- if the fluid is particulate with meconium and aspirated the baby can develop problems too.  Just to add, presence of meconium in amniotic fluid is not always a sign of fetal distress.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What other factors may cause it? Also, do you have any sources you're basing your opinions on (distress vs. non-distress causes)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm kind of a fetal physiology geek so my opinion is based on years of reading and observation.  It would be super nice if me to provide you with tons of food resources, but I lack time right now.  I'll try and expand on a few things for your consideration.</p>
<p>When we talk about distress causing a fetus to expel meconium before birth it is an indication that there is an interruption in the oxygen pathway somewhere causing lack of oxygen to the fetus.  This can happen for many different reasons.  A few examples would be a poor placenta, a compressed umbilical cord, a sick mother or anything that would impair gas exchange to the fetus.  So imagine this scenario- you have a fetus not getting sufficient oxygen and not clearing it's own carbon dioxide.  As the fetus becomes more asphyxiated it's brain starts being effected- we call this encephalopathy.  Just like when an animal or person releases it's bowels at death, the anal sphincter relaxes.  This is a super simplified explanation, mind you.  There is a progression of responses by the fetus before we get to this point.</p>
<p>To go further- if the carbon dioxide in the blood were to raise to high enough levels the fetus will gasp just as a dying person or animal will gasp at death. This gasping of the fetus could potentially allow amniotic fluid with meconium into the fetal lungs- causing meconium aspiration syndrome.  Now, it used to be thought that the baby would pull meconium into its lungs from its mouth at birth with the first breath.  With this idea- babies would not be stimulated at birth and if time allowed someone would look in the back of the baby's mouth- put a tube below it's vocal cords, and attempt to suction any present meconium below the vocal cords in an attempt to prevent meconium aspiration syndrome.  To be clear, it is possible for the baby to suck in a wad of meconium with it's first breath, but not very likely.</p>
<p>So what about the other healthy babies with meconium?  Well, it is possible for a mature fetus to just poop.  If you look at the literature, the percentages for babies with meconium stained fluid are all over the board- you may read 6 or 10% or you may read as high as 25%. Let's for a minute take the low number, 6%.  If meconium stained fluid were from distress alone we would be saying 6% of births are to babies so severally asphyxiated at birth their brains were effected.  </p>
<p>I'm going to go off on a random tangent now... It's interesting to note that as ultrasound has advanced there have been instances of practitioners seeing meconium expelled in real time. What a dilemma, huh?  One case study I read documents this- and then it was noted a week later that clear fluid was found at birth.  Pathologists have written that they have seen evidence of placental uptake of meconium.  As strange as that sounds, it would make sense knowing there is a degree of transamniotic flow.  I don't understand how, but it is proposed the placenta may clean up the meconium particles... so with this idea it would make sense that seeing old meconium in amniotic fluid would suggest a placenta that wasn't performing up to par.</p></div>		</li>
