<p>It may mean some (standard) loss of hearing, but I for one am thankful for missing out on that whine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One day I walked into an empty classroom at school to do some work on the equipment and heard that noise.  At first I ignored it, but it drove me crazy.</p>
<p>It sounded like it was coming from the CRT TV in the corner, but it looked like it was off.  I hit the power button anyway, and I saw the TV make that &quot;powering off&quot; flicker and the noise went away.  </p>
<p>That was the first time I knew 100% that it was not just some trick of my mind.  There was absolutely no way for me to have noticed it was on if not for that sound.  I finally felt validated.</p></div>		</li>
