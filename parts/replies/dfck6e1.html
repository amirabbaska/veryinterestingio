			<div class="markdown"><p>You want it to be as clean as you can without impeding healing, so we use antiseptics on intact skin and irrigate the wound itself with plain old water or saline. Close it up, apply some topical antibiotic over the closed wound, and put on a dressing. They're all steps that are taken to prevent infection, except closing the wound, which is done purely for cosmetic reasons. </p>
<p>The antiseptic and antibiotic are a whole lot less important than just irrigating the wound with copious water under a bit of pressure. The irrigation is really what helps prevent infection. The rest is sort of icing on the cake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? :O</p>
<p>If you ignore the cosmetic reasons, would it be better to leave it open? Or does it just not make a difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer to that. I bet there are studies, but I'm on my phone and I'm not going to spend time looking it up right now, sorry ;)</p>
<p>What I can tell you is that pouring alcohol on the wound will not provide effective irrigation, because pressure is important. Gotta squirt the fluid directly into the wound at around 10 psi. A syringe hooked to an 18g angiocath works best for this but anything where you can generate gentle pressure is fine. In other words, not a flask.</p>
<p>As long as you can get medical attention relatively soon, there's no urgency to dumping alcohol on the wound either. If you're gonna be tromping around in the woods for a while, dumping the alcohol doesn't do much good because you're still out in the field and likely to re-contaminate.</p>
<p>All in, my best bet is that it wouldn't help much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a small scrape, it is probably fine, though a scrape has a low risk of infection anyway. </p>
<p>For a larger wound, the exposed tissue is far more susceptible to damage by alcohol than pathogenic bacteria, so unless you wash them away, you're probably in a worse place than you started. This all depends, of course. If there's dirt in the wound and whiskey is the only thing you've got, I'd probably mix whiskey 50:50 with clear stream water, let it sit a bit to sterilize it and hopefully have enough water to irrigate. Better yet boil it and let it cool. </p></div>		</li>
