Worth noting that among hearing individuals the rates of each of those is much lower (she cites 15% and 5%, respectively).</p>
<p>Is this the same as reading for deaf individuals, I would say kind of but not really. Part of the hallucination is that it is communicative, the &quot;voices&quot; speak, and it would make sense that for most individuals they would speak in the schizophrenic's native language. If a sign language is the native language, you might well expect some kind of visual/tactile hallucination. In the same way for a native signer when they read you might expect them to be referencing their native language.</p>
<p>But it's a bit complicated because deaf individuals often have wildly different experiences in learning language. I think <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-are-deaf-people-taught-to-read" target="_blank">this Quora post</a> on how deaf individuals are taught to read gives some good insight. An important thing to keep in mind is that sign language is not generally a transliteration of a spoken language. You can't, for example, take an English sentence, convert each word into an American Sign Language sign, and then sign them in order to get an ASL sentence. Doesn't work that way because ASL is it's own language with it's own grammar which differs quite substantially from spoken English. For someone profoundly deaf, with no exposure to spoken English, learning to read is not just a process of mapping written words to meanings, but also potentially one of learning a new grammar.</p></div>		</li>
