			<div class="markdown"><p>however if someone is unconscious it's harder to tell if someone is slightly alive or mostly alive without them being conscious. If, for example, there's lots of movement, it can be almost impossible to check a pulse accurately enough. If someone is conscious you KNOW they are alive. If they aren't conscious you just have to hope they're alive</p></div>		</li>
