			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not if you look at gas powered cars alone. Gasoline engines have had pretty minimal improvements over that period, and the measurements seem to be consistent with the 2013 study (since they only tested out to 68 mph in the 2004 study). </p>
<p>Improvements in average fuel efficiency are being driven by the development of hybrid and electric vehicles, so I agree it would be nice to see data for those.</p></div>		</li>
