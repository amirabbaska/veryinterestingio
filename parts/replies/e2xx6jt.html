			<div class="markdown"><p>Have to correct you there: 23 degrees north is the tropic of Cancer, because on June 21st, when the sun is directly above it, the zodiac sign of Cancer starts. Capricorn starts on December 21st, when the sun is directly above the tropic of Capricorn, about 23 degrees south.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latitude at which the sun is directly overheard changes over the year. It moves from equator to tropic of cancer to tropic of capricorn and back. This coincides with the seasons. When the sun is directly overheard the tropic of capricorn (23 degrees south) its winter in the northern hemisphere, and when the sun moves to be over the tropic of cancer (23 degrees north) it's summer in the northern hemisphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy you get from the sun depends on proximity (more energy if you’re closer) angle of the sun (you get half as much energy if the sun is 60 degrees away from  directly overhead) and duration (longer days, more energy). In the summer, you get a lot more energy in parts of the northern hemisphere than at the equator. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effects of proximity will probably be there, but they are negligable. Earth is closest to the sun during winter. Still the coldest season, because of all the other factors that have way more effect on temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>During june (northern summer), the northern half of the earth is pointing towards the sun more; during december (northern winter), the northern half of the earth is pointing away from the sun more. The equator is the middle ring around the earth, sure, but it's actually only closest to the sun during the middle of autumn/spring, that is when the sun's place over the earth moves from north to south, or south to north.</p>
<p>Think of the sun like a bonfire, and there are a bunch of people sat near to the fire. Rather than in a circle around it, everyone is in a line going past the bonfire; some people are close to the fire and some people are further away. That's what it is like comparing the distance some parts of the earth are away from the sun.</p>
<p>During june and the rest of the northern summer months, it's like the bonfire is placed closer to one end of the line of people sitting (we'll call that the North end to make it simple), whilst during december (and the rest of the northern winter months) the bonfire is closer to the other end of the line (South). The people in the middle of the line - the equator - are always at least kinda close to the fire, and often very close, so they get a lot of warmth all year round. The people on the far ends of the line are never close to the fire, so they're usually cold (even colder when the fire moves away).</p>
<p>During the summer in the north then, when the fire is moved to the north side of the line, the people closest to the fire are actually more north than the centre of the line (north of the equator). They're getting more warmth from the fire than the centre does. In fact, for every person you go south of the bonfire, towards the centre, the heat is lower just the same as if you move the same number of people north of the bonfire. </p>
<p>On maps, the furthest north the sun (our bonfire) goes is called the Tropic of Cancer (named after some stars). This tropic is said to be 23 degrees north (were 0 North is the equator, and 90 degrees north is the north pole). When the sun is near there in June, the most heat is being sent to 23 degrees north, and the amount of heat reaching the equator (0 degrees north) is the same as the heat reaching a spot on the opposite side of the tropic of cancer, 46 degrees north. </p>
<p>This isn't the only effect of our earth being tilted. As the year moves towards June, the days get longer in the north and shorter in the south. Looking back at our bonfire scenario, we can say that the people sitting there for the warmth can only sit there for a certain amount of time. The people in the centre of the line (the equator) are usually always allowed to be there for about half a day (daytime is around half a day on the equator all year round). The people closer to the ends of the line can either stay a lot longer (during summer, our daytime is longer each day) or have to leave a lot sooner (during winter, our daytime is shorter each day).</p>
<p>The result of this is that during June, when the bonfire is closer to the North end, AND the people on the North end get to stay by the fire longer each day, they get a lot more heat than the people in the centre of the line who are not allowed to stay as long as the people in the north. </p>
<p>For the people in the centre of the line, throughout the year they can expect to usually be kinda close to the bonfire and usually get about the same amount of time by the fire, so things don't change a lot. For the people half way towards the ends instead, the time they get by the fire is high when it's closer and low when it's further away, meaning there is a lot of difference in the weather they get. These half-way-to-the-edge places are called temperate climates, with warm summers and cold winters, and things can get quite extreme for them if everything happens in the right, or wrong, way. Right now, because of how the air is sitting in parts of the world, there are a lot of these &quot;extremes&quot; going on.</p>
<p><strong>In short: It's all about how close a place is to the fire (the sun) and how long they're being exposed to the fire each day (length of daytime) compared to the centre (equator).</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a minor correction: the main factor is the angle, not the distance.</p>
<p>Imagine a light shooting into a perpendicular surface. Now jmagine turning the paper closer to parallel to the light. The more the angle faces away from the light source, the more of an area the light's going to cover. It'll go from a circle on the surface to an oval getting longer and longer. So the light is more concetrated where the surface is perpedicular to the source and less where it's more parallel. The north pole isn't cold because it's half an Earth diameter farther away than the equator, it's cold because it's virtually parallel to the sun and gets barely any light. And seasons are goverened by how much different latitudes face the sun.</p></div>		</li>
