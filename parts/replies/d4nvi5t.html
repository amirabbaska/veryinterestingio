			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't Dark Souls 3 have the character's foot higher if one's on a stair or not? I know movement is the same speed, but the feet will change vertical position independently. Which makes for some weird behavior when idle animation slightly moves the foot causing it to jerk up and down as it's not entirely sure of a foot is on a stair or not.</p></div>		</li>
