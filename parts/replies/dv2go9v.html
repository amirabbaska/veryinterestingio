			<div class="markdown"><p>So when I have sleep paralysis, am I actually awake? Actually what I mean is are my eyes actually open? Am I actually seeing what I’m looking at and my body still thinks I’m asleep so that’s why I can’t move? Or are my eyes still closed and I’m just dreaming/hallucinating my entire room around me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always try and make this simple for my patients during consultation. If anyone has any tips to help me refine the explanation that would be excellent.</p>
<p>Sleep paralysis occurs during a stage of sleep known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During REM sleep is where the highest concentration of largely emotional dreaming occurs. As an adaptation, we essentially have our ability to operate our muscles blocked during this period. This lack of muscle tone in REM sleep is known as REM atonia. </p>
<p>Sleep paralysis is when someone moves from REM sleep to wake, but REM atonia continues and in some patients the dream-state also continues. This occurs frequently in patients who have a sleep disorder that wakes them from REM. In patients with sleep-disordered breathing, this is a simple process; an apnoea (breath-hold) wakes them. In patients with something called narcolepsy there is a different underlying cause; they tend to have abnormally swift REM sleep onset and much more disturbed nocturnal sleep. </p>
<p>In either case, it is not well understood why people remain in this semi-REM stage of sleep. There's not a lot of information as to why some patients suffer with the paralysis and not the hallucinations. We do know that these events are much more common in narcolepsy which is a disorder characterised by a lack of control of sleep-wake state. </p>
<p>We don't often catch sleep paralysis during our sleep studies, but the studies I have scored the patients' eyes are closed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you've seen cats and dogs moving and twitching during a particularly active dream whilst in REM sleep right? Is that what we do in REM sleep, or do they not have access to their skeletal muscles blocked in the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I learned in my neuropsychology course:</p>
<p>There is an area of your brain that essentially locks your body down while you sleep to minimize movement so you don't harm yourself.</p>
<p>During REM sleep we see this area most active and there are those who have little enough activation that they act out their dreams. There are one or two instances I can recall of someone murdering their spouse while they both were asleep, but this is extremely rare.</p>
<p>However, if you wake up during a REM stage, your brain sometimes takes seconds to minutes registering this before it hits the unlock button.</p>
<p>Some people consistently have this problem, leading to sleep paralysis. The aspects of hallucination make sense in that they still may be dreaming partly or fully while &quot;awake&quot; and also paralyzed.</p>
<p>It's thought that nearly all reports of alien abductions and the like are the results of this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sleep paralysis is an inaccurate label for the experience that has simply caught on as a broad descriptor in common language. &quot;Night terrors&quot; is another term sometimes used for this experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleep paralysis <strong>is</strong> a defnied thing and <strong>not</strong> as you say a broad descripter in common language and interchangable with night terrors.</p>
<p>Sleep paralysis is widely recognised in the medical field and refers to the specific sensation of :</p>
<p>&quot;during awakening or falling asleep, a person is aware but unable to move&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis</a></p>
<p>There are tons of sources and studies on this, which pertain to this specific phenomena.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27486325" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27486325</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156892/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156892/</a></p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>These all describe the phenomena with similar and well defined terminology:</p>
<p>&quot;Sleep paralysis (SP) is characterized by a discrete period of time during which voluntary muscle movement is inhibited, yet ocular and respiratory movements are intact and ones sensorium remains clear&quot;</p>
<p>Night terrors on the other hand completely different and are associated with excess movement, such as thrashing about and are usually not remembered the next morning. So basically the complete opposite to sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>&quot;A child having night terrors may scream and thrash around, and may not recognise you if you try to comfort them. This behaviour occurs on waking abruptly from deep, non-dream sleep.</p>
<p>Your child won't be fully awake during these episodes and will have no memory of it the next morning.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/newosis is correct - sleep paralysis and night terrors are distinct phenomena that take place during different stages of sleep (REM vs. N3) and have totally different manifestations. The OP made them sound more similar than they are. In fact I don't think night terrors would even be classified as hypnagogia because they occur during the deepest sleep stage, while hypnagogic phenomena like sleep paralysis and hallucinations occur during sleep onset.</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, in Oliver Sacks' book <em>Hallucinations</em> he talks about how the term &quot;nightmare&quot; most likely originated as a term for sleep paralysis, not as a general term for bad dreams. The earliest uses of &quot;nightmare&quot; refer to the feeling of overwhelming dread and chest pressure often experienced during sleep paralysis, equating the feeling with someone sitting on the person's chest - being &quot;ridden by the night hag/mare.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I get what they are saying. That's it's an incorrect labelling of the same group of related phenomena. I just wanted to make it clear that they are very separate and defined things which I did not feel OP did.</p></div>		</li>
