<p>The monochromatic-ness is easy to achieve, just use a source which produces only one wavelength of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you explain that more in depth? You say &quot;easy to achieve&quot;, but I fear that is a realitive term. Is there a machine that produces one wavelength light sources? Do you just get a incandescent light bulb and put a filter on it? </p>
<p>Could you explain it like I'm a... 15 year old kid with a public school education grasp on everything? Ha! </p>
<p>Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stained glass prepared with certain metallic dyes actually converts sunlight into something that is sufficiently monochromatic for some basic experiments.</p>
<p>Monochromacy could also be achieved by passing sunlight through prisms to split into various colors, and then using a physical barrier to only allow a small band to pass on to the rest of the experiment.</p>
<p>Both of these methods were in use by the 17th century. Naturally, they suffer from limited brightness. The tighter your band of wavelengths was, the dimmer your light became.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there. Ultrafast laser scientist checking in here.</p>
<p>Coherent light does not have to be monochromatic. As long as broad spectrum light has a well defined phase relation between the different colors, then those colors are coherent with each other.</p>
<p>Two examples of this: pulsed laser systems, and frequency doubled/tripled/etc light.</p>
<p>A pulsed laser is a broad spectrum laser where all of the many frequencies/colors have a well-defined phase relationship which allows those colors to be coherent and interfere. It also allows us to create lasers with ultrashort pulses down to 10^-15 seconds.</p>
<p>Frequency doubled light generated by a non-linear crystal (a BBO crystal for example) also has a well defined phase relation with the undoubled light. These two well separated colors are coherent and can interfere with each other in a predictable way long after the frequency doubled light was made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here you run into the difference between repetition rate and pulse width. Repetition rate carries data, the pulse being there or not (as controlled by an optical switch) is your 1 or 0. Ultrafast lasers tend to have rep rates of like 80 MHz or so, way slower than typical data transmission. Even if you wanted to use ultrashort pulses for data transmission and you had a time between pulses that was close to the pulse width, standard detectors can't even measure 10^-12 seconds, let alone 10^-15. You'd just have a DC signal as far as the detectors were concerned. If we had such detectors and switches, then data transmission would basically be given by the wavelength separation, which is hundreds of THz. Impossible to detect, but that's how fast it would be. </p>
<p>So yeah, no reason to pursue few-cycle pulses as far as communications are concerned, but they certainly have a bunch of applications re:nonlinear optics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, although I’m literate in the answers people have given to my OP, this happens to be pretty close to some of the stuff I really studied hard back in school.  </p>
<p>Mr. Ultrafast laser scientist mentioned that his specialized lasers are rather broad spectrum.  For fiber optics, the wavelengths chosen are dominated by what frequencies propagate through the fiber with the least loss which happens to be an infrared frequency just over 1000nm.  The shorter (more “blue”) the wavelength the more losses due to the same scattering principles that make the sky and ocean look blue.  More losses means a weaker signal at the other end of the fiber, and for long distance communications, more signal boosting is necessary per unit of distance.</p>
<p>Wavelength selection isn’t only dominated by losses though.  Originally our fiber optics networks modulated a single optical signal per fiber, but some clever people figured out how to pack multiple signals on a fiber by “frequency multiplexing.”  This fascinating trick is kind of like how your radio has multiple signals coming into it that can be tuned into with the tuner, but with modulated light sources at ever so subtly different “colors.”  </p>
<p>But those “colors” are dominated by the need to limit losses so they pack these signal wavelengths as close together as possible at that sweet spot just over 1000nm, and these individual signals, to remain distinct need to be very tight in their individual wavelength.  </p>
<p>Which is a long but fascinating explanation of some of the significant reasons why frequency coherence (monochromatic signals rather than broad spectrum) is a big deal in fiber optics.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. There are two types of coherence, spatial coherence and temporal coherence. The two slit experiment requires spatial coherence, not temporal coherence. You're jumbling them together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that temporal coherence only matters in experiments where you're mixing signals emitted at different times (e.g. heterodyne detection of Doppler shifts) or when you're mode-locking lasers. For most interferometric experiments, the signals mixed have been emitted at the same time, so spatial coherence is the only thing that matters</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly true. The one place I would disagree is looking at speckle. You can't see speckle if you lack temporal coherence. That is a spatial interference, but the temporal coherence allows you to observe it.</p></div>		</li>
