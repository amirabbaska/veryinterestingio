			<div class="markdown"><p>No matter where you sit in the universe, the expansion looks the same. Distant galaxies are receding more quickly than the nearer ones, as though you're sitting at the center. That's not how an explosion with an <em>actual</em> center would look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you could actually find a centre to the surface of last scattering though. It would be an arbitrary point (or shell rather) - someone in a different frame of reference would have a slightly different surface of last scattering - but it would be the origin of everything in the observable universe, no?</p>
<p>You'd expect that centre would be at the observer, but since we're moving at 371 km/s relative to the CMB we're not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you migght get this wrong. It's not that masses (like galaxies) are moving away from each other. They still attract each other and will merge eventually. SPACE ITSELF is expanding. Think of the old example of a balloon with dots being blown up and the balloon skin as space. There is no center and the dots are not moving away from each other. From our point of view they and their distances to each other grow but not because the dots are moving. The surface (&quot;space&quot;) they are painted on expands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So with the balloon skin, surface area, in two dimensions, is increasing with expanding volume, three dimensions, inside the balloon. Perhaps there is a similar accumulation of fourth-dimensional energy/matter that is causing an analogous expansion of our universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the expansion effect is minuscule at the atomic level, but what is happening with this extra space that gets created?</p>
<p>Say a Planck space is created inside the proton of a hydrogen atom.  Do the quarks just attract to each other to close the newly created space?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not true. Our super cluster is not gravitationally linked to other super clusters. Our Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy will collide, as will others in their respective super clusters. But galaxies from seperate super clusters will never collide. The expansion of space, on the scale of super clusters, is stronger than the effects of gravity and overcome it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The commonly held idea is that the &quot;center&quot; is not in the universe at all. The idea is that the universe is like the surface of an inflating beach ball, but three dimensional and expanding through four dimensional space instead. The middle point isn't findable in our universe because everything is on the edge of expansion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No need to go to very large scales or invoke any exotic physics to get different expansion rates at different locations.</p>
<p>As you say the expansion rate depends on the average over all the stuff included in the region of interest and the data shows that if you go to large enough scales it's about the same everywhere. But applying this principle can have non trivial effects in modified theories of gravity even on small scales. There are currently satellites planned that will test for these &quot;fifth force&quot; effects in Earth's orbit.</p>
<p>But more to the point there's about a 3 sigma (characterized as &quot;evidence&quot; as opposed to a &quot;detection&quot; which would be 5 sigma) tension between the best local measurement of the expansion rate (from the Hubble Space Telescope) and the best &quot;average over everything&quot; we've gotten from the Planck satellite (which measured the Cosmic Microwave Background). A popular explanation is that this is just a statistical fluke, that we just happen to be living in a 3 sigma overdensity, but other possible explanations include the effect of massive neutrinos, or dynamical dark energy. The data is not at a stage where we can say for sure, people gossip about internal inconsistencies in the datasets and between various datasets which would help relieve the tension. But the next stage of surveys will be accurate enough to say for sure in the next 10 years or so.</p></div>		</li>
