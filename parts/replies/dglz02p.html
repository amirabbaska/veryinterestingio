			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think he's saying that you are constantly slowing to match the exact distance from your destination. In which I mean I don't think he is counting 1/2km or 1/4km. I think for the entire first km you are traveling 100km/h. For the entire 2nd km you are traveling 99km/h, etc. etc. etc. all the way to 1km to go and for that last km you are traveling 1km/h. You will reach your destination 1 hour from that point. If you are constantly slowing (100, 99.9, 99.8, 99.7, etc) then you are on a smooth curve that approaches but never reaches zero. I also read the question as changing your speed every 10km. I'm not sure what OP meant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Side note: at any given moment, he is only an hour away... though he'll always be an 'hour away'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's impossible to slow down that perfectly to match up with the distance.  100km/h, 99.99999km/h, 99.99998 km/h, 99.99997km/h, etc, etc......  And to what decimal place do we measure? We need the OP to clarify what he is really asking. </p></div>		</li>
