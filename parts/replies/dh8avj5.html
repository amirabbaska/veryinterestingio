			<div class="markdown"><p>I was never a good enough bowler to appreciate the difference. All I know is I spent a lot of time stressing over those keeping our lanes usable since we had the draw of being the only real wood house left in our area. We didn't make enough money to replace the lanes in the foreseeable future either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a subtle difference if you're not on the lanes a lot. The biggest difference is (and this may have changed with some new tech) is that the synthetic lanes seemed a bit softer, so the ball wouldn't have the same reaction when it contacts the boards and heads down the lane. Also the sound of the ball traveling downlane is very different. </p></div>		</li>
