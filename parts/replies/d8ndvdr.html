			<p>They can be triggered manually just by shorting the two running rails together (although this may depend on the system used). <br><br>In fact, many trains carried (and some still carry) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit#Track_circuit_clips" target="_blank">track circuit clips</a> so that in the event of an accident train crew can short-circuit track on adjacent lines to turn signals to red or alert signalling staff or equipment.  If part of a train has derailed and is hanging over the track going in the opposite direction, this can prevent a collision.</p>		</li>

			<p>Shorting out the tracks is actually an effective way to signal for help if you're lost in a remote region and come across some active tracks. You can tell if they're active by seeing if the tops are rusted over or shiny. </p>		</li>

			<p>More questions than answersâ€¦<br><br>How would this signal for help in any case? At best, you're causing a traffic block. You could just wait for traffic to come by instead. <br><br>What does the rusted indicate over the shiny?</p>		</li>

			<p>Some one will be sent to see what's going on with the tracks.<br><br>Rusted means they are unused, shiny means trains are using the line.</p>		</li>

			<p>Quickly, too. Railroads don't mess around with service disruptions since every day of downtime costs so much. An old wooden rail bridge burned down, and they had a new bridge built and in service, 20 days later. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/edmonton/mayerthorpe-s-cn-trestle-bridge-rebuilt-after-major-fire-1.3586555" target="_blank">http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/edmonton/mayerthorpe-s-cn-trestle-bridge-rebuilt-after-major-fire-1.3586555</a></p>		</li>

			<p>The railroad company monitors their infrastructure.  If something other than a train is completing the track circuit, they're going to send someone out to investigate and clear it.<br><br>As for the shininess of the rails, shiny rails are kept that way by the regular passage of trains.  Rusted rails haven't seen much traffic lately (n.b. &quot;not much traffic&quot; and &quot;no traffic&quot; are very different things...don't assume that rusted rails are out of use).</p>		</li>

			<p>It depends on what you have on hand and what's around. If you got stranded in your car, you should really have some jumper cables...or depending how desperate you are, any internal wiring. Any exposed metal would be great.<br><br>If you've recently seen a fence, you could try ripping up a section of it...but it probably won't be easy without a multi tool to snip wires.<br><br>If you don't have any metal laying around, I hope you have water or a body of water around. Anything wet will work, but your clothes will probably work best because they've been steeping in your delicious, conductive electrolytes. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Not around here - they have a pickup truck with train wheels that they can raise or lower so they can just drive via road to the nearest rail intersection and hop onto the rail right there.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road-rail_vehicle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road-rail_vehicle</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Wow.  I wonder if presidential motorcades or other VIP / materials transport teams specifically avoid railroad crossings because of this.  My brain immediately went to how easy it would then be to trick the signal into coming down and stopping traffic and how that could be a really bad thing in certain cases.  I mean you can check train schedules, but if some dude can signal it to come down that easily, that's something you would avoid with a VIP transport.  Some action movie material right there: Divert VIP via traffic accident to alternate route that has a rail road crossing gate, activate said gate, VIP stuck.  <br>  <br>Are there any safeguards to prevent this and/or do you know if they specifically avoid crossings for this very reason? </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not for certain, but we do have private security and homeland security as well as the police watch the rails constantly, because billions of dollars worth of goods and materials are transported daily.  <br><br>I believe there is no fail proof for that part of it because in our industry we believe it's better to let the arms sit down just in case it got a false false reading (if that makes sense).  <br><br>KCS and all other trains companies have what's called a timetable that the update from time to time that if followed to the letter would allow you to know exactly how far each train is from each other at any given moment and where everybody is.  Each train is scheduled with many different ideas in mind. <br><br>Tl;dr they probably do avoid train crossings for that reason as well as simply a waste of time if they have to stop at one, and it is better to have the arms down, just in case a train actually is coming so there is no fail safe for that, other than constant monitoring of the tracks.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's usually a Blackhawk helicopter or 2 doing circles around whatever area the president is in when he does visits. They would be able to see if there was a train coming or if something weird was up and they would take appropriate action to check it out. I imagine they just put a halt to train traffic while the prez is in the area. They would be aware of trains going through the area. Usually the fire department has a schedule too. It's a cool scenario but would be hard to pull off when you have a small army and air support protecting you.</p>		</li>
