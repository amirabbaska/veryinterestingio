			<div class="markdown"><p>The object is irrelevant. It works for balls, drones, and maybe more obvious and visible to everyone, people. </p>
<p>If you have cruise control on traveling in a straight line you'll notice you don't have to do much 'work' to sit up straight. However if someone accelerated to merge on a highway, slams on the breaks, or makes a sharp turn, your body will shift in your seat. This is your body 'veering off' just as another object would</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this doesn't work with a balloon because the air pressure increases towards the back of he car (because air is moving to the back) during acceleration which counteracts the balloon moving to the back of the car. The difference is the objects you listed wouldn't be so affected by air pressure. </p>
<p>Edit: After some quick research it appears the balloon will actually move FORWARD under acceleration due to this effect.</p></div>		</li>

It's not like we're creating vacuums every time we hit the gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the drone is flying, so people I guess might be wondering whether the air inside the car is moving in a manner that makes a floating object in the car move in any kind of different manner than a ball, since the ball isn't in the air very long.</p>
<p>I too was wondering if perhaps very slowly the drone would drift in one direction or the other, depending on how airtight the car's interior is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why go for a bus? </p>
<p>We're all, all 7 billion of us, on something that is moving very, VERY fast, in multiple directions (circling and spinning). Earth. </p>
<p>If I gently toss a ball up in the air, will it fly abruptly into space at several hundred kmph? Or will it, to our perspective, go up and then come back down? </p>
<p>A lot of these &quot;object in motion alongside other object in motion&quot; questions are resolved quite easily when you remember that Earth is a gigantic object in dizzying levels of motion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do indeed. We even have clocks sensitive enough to detect the time dilation for just going in particularly fast jets. But in terms of questions about two objects moving, from a human-level-perspective as opposed to a scientific, theoretical, or machine-level perspective, knowing that we are on a fast-moving object that spins, vibrates, travels, and spirals, shorthand answers most of these &quot;showerthought&quot; type questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's a totally adequate explanation, I think many people would have difficulty understanding the concept at that scale. The motion of the earth isn't really perceivable by anyone who's just standing on it (excluding sight obviously). The motion of a car is way more relatable to people.</p></div>		</li>
