			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Afaik gravity used to &quot;pull&quot; the water together so they can safely propel themself by applying force to the water. Without gravity to &quot;pull&quot; the water together, how much would their swimming be affected? </p>
<p>Sorry, English is my third language, I hope that made sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that surface tension holds the water together in a bubble, and withing that bubble water has its normal density- as far as the fish is concerned Its on earth, except the lack of gravity means there is no &quot;up&quot;; so the fosh can swim normally, it's just a little confused. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the swimming action of the fish in a free-floating bubble of water would probably cause the bubble to start flying apart, causing the fish to freak out, making the bubble fly apart faster.  Unless I'm imagining a larger fish than you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine the fish were in full enclosures in order to avoid them splashing little droplets of water everywhere. If I were designing this experiment I would put them in sealed glass containers with no air bubbles...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they prevent the water from becoming too mixed with the air? Seems like at a certain point gills wouldn't work while sucking in bubbles.</p>
<p>Edit: perhaps a 0g modification of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocyclone" target="_blank">hydrocyclone</a> ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just water bubbles in zero-g. It looks like their food is collecting on the surface of those since there is no 'up' for the food to go to. The surface of the bubbles still makes a threshold between air and water that the food can 'stick' to.</p></div>		</li>
