			<div class="markdown"><p>In England, there are really about 5 predominant lawn and sports surface grasses. We have some of the same in the Northern and Midwestern Climates (cool season grasses) of the US, though there are some nuances. One being that hard fescue and Kentucky bluegrass (smooth meadow grass for the Englishmen) predominate in lawn swards of the cool season climates of the US. These two grasses are more course and generally abrasive compared to the dominant lawn grasses of England - fine fescue and perennial ryegrass being the majority, with bluegrass and hard fescue, as well as random others. It just so happens that the lack of freezing temperatures in England favors the fine fescue and ryegrass, whereas the bluegrass and hard fescue are more freeze tolerant as well as tolerant of snow and ice cover. So the course texture also corresponds to higher silicate content, though they're probably more related to coevolutionary traits that reduce herbivory. That said, in the southern US and other warm-season climates, bermudagrass, zoysia grass, Kikuya, St. Augustinegrass, Centipedegrass, and carpetgrass predominate in lawns. Bermuda is most common in sports surfaces but is often overseeded with the cool season grass perennial ryegrass. With the exception of perennial ryegrass, all warm-season grasses are more itchy (anecdotal evidence only) than their cool-season counterparts. Again, this is likely an anti-herbivory mechanism left over from evolution under grazing pressure, but I don't think anyone's ever looked into it. They too are higher in silicone, but probably they have a higher lignin content, which makes them more rigid and &quot;sharp&quot; and thus more likely to cut you. Some people do have legitimate grass allergies, but even the rest of us suffer from itching when in close contact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a very excellent and complete answer. Perennial ryegrass is probably one of the softest grasses I have ever felt and it grows all over the island. However, I doubt it could withstand the extreme weather of the midwest US, which is why we rely on zoysia (a pointy-scratchy son of a bee). Also people don't realize that grasses have some of the highest silica content of plantae. That defo adds to the irritation; however I have found just as much silica in ryegrass as some higher silica accumulators. I have also found that, no matter how bad the grass feels in the US, it is nothing compared to the varieties they use in Australia. Cocksfoot (Cynodon dactylon) is super unpleasant to walk on and it easily pulled up by fucking birds. </p></div>		</li>
