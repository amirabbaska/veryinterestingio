<p>This is significantly more than I expected, considering we're usually talking about kilobars when expressing pressures at crustal to mantle depth. Did you mean megapascals to gigapascals or is pressure really significantly higher in magma chambers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, great summary and very similar to the case of releasing built up strain along fault lines. Only difference is that we are actually performing that experiment in Oklahoma and elsewhere, just unintentionally through waste water injection and fracking. It is fascinating science that will lead to greater understanding of both natural and human induced earthquakes, but it would be so much more fruitful if we could pry all the injection data from the companies.</p></div>		</li>
