			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-is-facebook-messenger-a-separate-app-2014-11" target="_blank">Corroborated here</a>, it's to unclutter the experience of using social/messenger.</p>
<p>Though as a software engineer the decision makes sense because you once had a team of (let's guess) 500 doing the &quot;app.&quot; Now you have two teams of 250 doing an app. Smaller teams communicate better just because of the reduced bandwidth required. A smaller team is more focused and probably more knowledgeable about the problem domain than a larger team. The people doing the status update part of the app may not see the value in stickers and push back. Welp, now they're over there on their app and the people who understand messaging can add stickers because the scope of the product has shrunk.</p></div>		</li>
