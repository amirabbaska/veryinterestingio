			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation of the ox made the usage of the word alpha so much clearer to me. I've always known alpha meant &quot;beginning&quot; or &quot;first&quot;, like alpha wolf, but I didn't know it meant the literal first in that sense. Alpha was instead derived from something significant to a culture. The evolution of language really is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Greek &quot;Alpha&quot; comes from the Phoenician/proto-Semitic &quot;Alef&quot; -- the usage of it as meaning &quot;first&quot; is likewise a derived concept, and is intertwined with the order of the letters -- something that should have been mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In Phoenician-Semitic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals" target="_blank">Abjad numerals</a>, continuing into modern Arabic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals" target="_blank">Greek numerals</a> and then Hebrew numerology, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria" target="_blank">Gematria</a>, the letters themselves are assigned numbers based on their position in the alphabet.</p>
<p>Simply put, Alif/Aleph/Alpha is 1, Ba/Bet/Beta is 2, Gim/Gimel/Gamma is 3, and so on...</p>
<p>So one can assume that since the position of these languages' letters were the basis of their respective number-systems, the order was &quot;fixed&quot; very early.</p>
<p>So, too, was the phrase &quot;the Alpha and the Omega&quot; (Greek's first letter to last letter) translated into Christianity as a metaphor for &quot;the beginning and the end.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Technical point: an &quot;ox&quot; is a castrated male bovine. </p>
<p>Bovines were the first large creatures to be domesticated. </p>
<p>That's obviously what you meant, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Bovine&quot; is from the Latin &quot;Bos&quot; which translates directly to &quot;ox&quot; -- so you might have it slightly backwards.</p></div>		</li>
