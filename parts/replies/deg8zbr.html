			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend has ocd and his dog has it too. It's def a learned behavior. She takes treats and toys somewhere else, making sure it is in the right spot and even with her nose in relation to the other treats and toys. She will then put it back to where it was and repeat this over and over. My friend has done nothing to discourage it. Is there something I can do? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A behaviorlist would be best to consult. If this were me, on an isolated island etc -- I'd put this 'on queue' with positive reinforcement. Clicker and treats. Get it really enforced. Get it on stimuli control to where dog does it only when asked.  Then never give command. </p>
<p>In the middle I would teach a super strong default behavior that can not be executed while doing the undesired behavior. Maybe a 'go to bed' combined with 'head on ground'.  This I would start super rewarding. Make it rain compared to the undesired behavior.  You want both to be locked in and only offered on request -- but default should be the new OCD. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dogs also turn heads away, yawn, shake their heads, or scratch to help relieve stress. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most common appeasement signal is the &quot;nose lick&quot;.</p>
<p>It's a useful thing to know when reading &quot;dog language&quot; in many situations</p></div>		</li>
