			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically Jurassic Park, but instead of Dinosaurs, it's filled with native flora and fauna. They have erected a fence around an old reservoir and the surrounding bush to keep out any invasive species (such as rats) which allows the area to slowly revert back to how New Zealand may have been before any human contact.</p>
<p>There's a museum building which covers a lot of NZ's natural history and then you can just wander around the beautiful park and hopefully catch a glimpse of a Tuatara. If you visit Wellington (WLTN? I still can't quite grasp the Kiwis insistence on the shortening of their cities names!), I would definitely recommend it. Pop into the Planetarium on your way back to the cable car, like most things in NZ, it's small but perfectly formed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A source is something that can be checked by others to verify what you're saying is true/accurate - saying 'source: I just know it bro, trust me' really isn't useful.</p>
