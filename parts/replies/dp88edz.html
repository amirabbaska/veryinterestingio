			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a foreign object, such a metal fragmentation, be rejected by the body if it were fully embedded in a ligament? I know that there are many examples of it being pushed out of other tissues over a period of years. I might not be using the proper terminology, this isn’t my area of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh wow.  I thought the donor organ's cells were replaced with host cells over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: apparently I didn't read your post carefully enough - you state that the method is currently being used.</p>
<p>Several years ago, biomedical engineers at the University of Minnesota came up with a way to strip a donor heart down to its extracellular matrix and insert the patient's own stem cells to literally grow their own heart for them pre-transplant. I haven't kept up with the story, so I don't know how widespread the method is in medical practice. IIRC, there have also been some successful steps toward 3D printing extracellular matrices for various organs. That's exciting, because it would significantly reduce the demand for doner organs (you'd basically only need them for emergency scenarios where there is no time to grow a new organ) and shorten waitlists dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the organ and where the cells that repair damage actually come from.<br />
Muscles usually repair themselves so a heart will stay mostly donor cells.  </p>
<p>It would get more complex in a pregnant mother.  Developing fetuses release stem cells that settle in the mother's tissues.  If she had an organ transplant earlier in life, one organ could have three sets of DNA among its cells.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a colleague who had a heart transplant as a child. By the time I met her, the heart was expiring because it was now too small for her, it hadn’t grown. Are there different types of surgery where one transplant will grow and another wont?</p></div>		</li>
