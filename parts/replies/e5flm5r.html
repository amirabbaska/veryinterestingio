			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are correct. There are very likely planets we will never detect by the transit method. To my understanding an object needs to be relatively close to produce detectable &quot;wobble&quot;  but I don't know much about that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to be close or we have to have very good telescopes to pick up the wobble of a more distant planet.  I'm not sure if there will be some fundamental limit or if we can just keep building arbitrarily larger telescopes to see smaller and more distant planets. I believe the latter is true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not just very likely, but almost certain, as it requires the star, its planet, and us to be coplanar, and it's safe to say the vast majority of exoplanets do not meet this criterion. </p>
<p>AFAIK, the wobble method has a similar weakness. The spatial change is too slight to directly detect at range, and what we're actually looking at is the blue/red shift of the light as it wobbles toward or away from us, respectively. In principle, as long as <em>some</em> component of the star's wobble is toward us (i.e. it's ecliptic is not orthogonal to our line of sight), there should be some shift. Now the vast majority of exoplanets are, in principle, detectable, and it becomes an issue of signal strength.</p>
<p>Another attribute shared by both methods is that they're most sensitive to large planets near their stars (occultation is affected by relative radius and relative distance; wobble is affected by relative mass and absolute distance from the parent body). For reference, though, Jupiter is sufficiently massive that, despite its distance from the sun, the pair's barycenter is actually outside the sun, meaning it induces a significant wobble. It would likely be one of the first observations an alien astronomer would make about our system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several methods for detecting exoplanets. The method mentioned in OP's question is just one of those, and it is limited to planets large enough to reduce the light of a star by a noticeable and detectable amount. We can also look for &quot;wobbles&quot; in a star, or anomalies in the orbit of an exoplanet that has already been discovered due to orbital resonance with another undiscovered exoplanet. Rings or gaps in the protoplanetary disk surrounding a young star could also be indicative of an exoplanet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, because we measure the wobble by observing the tiny Doppler shift in the star's light, and not the star's sideways movement in the sky (which is as of now beyond our capabilities), the &quot;wobble&quot; method is also most likely to find planets that orbit their star closer to edge-on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Gaia is able to detect exoplanets by the astrometric method, and is expected to discover about 20,000 of them. We're just waiting for it to finish collecting data </p>
