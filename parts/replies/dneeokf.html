<p>It's not the estrogen that affects hair growth, it's the lower amount of testosterone. People with ovaries have less body hair than people with testicles because they have less testosterone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The downvotes are probably because you did not answer the question and even say as much in your post. There is zero biological imperative for women to shave so I'm pretty mystified by your answer. There are crucial benefits to having body hair that women ignore for the sake of being considered attractive. It is 100% about companies making money by shifting their audience's perception of beauty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally get your overall argument. But shouldn't we just prefer lighter/less hair and not actually <em>no</em> hair? why does society take it to the extreme of NO body hair, when a naturally hairless person is most likely a child who has not reached sexual maturity, since body hair comes with puberty? There are exceptions of course, but generally speaking, you get body hair when you hit puberty, even if it is light or sparse it's still there in great enough quantities that you can see the difference between a shaved and unshaved leg.</p>
<p>Also: for anyone trying birth control pills to reduce body hair, set your expectations low. My doctors said that it prevents the &quot;birth&quot; of more follicles but doesn't reduce the amount of hair your body already grows. In my experience, that's true. Didnt make me less hairy, I just also didn't get MORE hairy.</p></div>		</li>
