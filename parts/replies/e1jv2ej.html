<p>What does this mean though? Do you mean that it tastes like normal water, because most people would say water has no taste but I disagree, tap water tastes distinctly like tap water. Or do you mean it tastes very different than tap water?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It used to have a really low level of minerals so was almost pure water. I quite liked that it didn’t taste of anything. </p>
<p>When it launched in the UK I was disappointed to find it was totally different to the US version and simply copied what Evian and other bottled waters here offered. </p></div>		</li>
