<p><a href="http://bigdonsboys.com/strength/kirill_sarychev/images/06_05_350_kirill_sarychev_011.jpg" target="_blank">No, they don't.  Here's Kirill Sarychev, current bench press world record holder.</a>  <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thefitworldblog.com/wp-content/uploads/unnamed4.jpg?resize=730%2C550" target="_blank">Blaine Sumner is a bit softer than Kirill, and he's no where near extremely fat.</a></p>
<p>And, when you get into lower weight classes, it's even more unlikely that a successful competitor is going to be fat.  They have to have the most favorable body composition for strength in their weight range, meaning excess fat is a liability.  </p>
<p>Leverages have less to do with extreme cases of ROM limitation--which is a fairly uneducated take on the matter--and more to do with where muscles tie into bones in relation to limb length.  Extra fat isn't doing anyone any favors in raw powerlifting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leverages don't make as much of a difference for some people as others. Because everyone is different. Imagine someone who is identical to me in height, lbm, and overall weight. If we both gain 10 lbs, he may gain most that fat on his thigh/shoulders/arms, where I may gain most of it on my waist. Yes, at some point, it can become an impedance, but I don't get why people are talking about things from an extreme standpoint. Practically speaking, more fat @ the same lean body mass means you are stronger. Without considering fat, leverages absolutely account for strength in many ways. That is why for some can bench more relative to their deadlift/squat, or vice versa. Fat considering, it also does help a lot. I'm getting lost in the order of my replies, but see one of my replies that breaks down how much more I can squat with 10 extra lbs of fat. Because I store most of my fat around my waist at 10-18% body fat, I can make some small strength gains on bench and deadlift on a cut, while my squat takes an immediate large hit. Before anyone cries that it's an anecdote, I know I'm not a lone in this.</p></div>		</li>
