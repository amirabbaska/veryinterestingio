			<div class="markdown"><p>Light-dark cycle definitely has a huge effect on the circadian rhythm, mediated via the light-sensitive production of the &quot;sleep hormone&quot; melatonin. Also it is psychologically stressful when the whole rest of the society lives in a different rhythm than you do. Plus the difference is small enough that the phases only sync every five weeks or so.</p>
<p>It is theoretized that the natural circadian cycle of night owls is longer than 24 hours, and similarly shorter than that in early birds. Anecdotally, I think it would be awesome to have 40 minutes longer days, I feel it would much better match my internal rhythm :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add to this that there were some experiments done on the subject.  In one experiment, subjects were put in a sealed room with no information from the outside world about time (not even a clock).  They got to control the lighting and could go to sleep or wake up whenever they wished.</p>
<p>Subjects varied in how long their waking cycles took -- with some having a 24 hour cycle and others ending up with a longer or shorter cycle (the longest was 30 hours).  The subjects were fine with whatever cycle they ended up settling on and didn't feel tired or jetlagged in the cases where their cycle wasn't 24 hours.</p>
<p>Here is the study:

<p>Based on this research I think humans could easily tolerate a slightly longer day/night cycle on Mars, <em>if they were living on Mars</em>.</p>
<p>Really the thing that resets your rhythm is light exposure.  The NASA scientists that had trouble maintaining a Martian day cycle were probably feeling jet lagged because they still were on Earth, experiencing the Sun from Earth, which threw a huge monkey-wrench into the works for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Navy on a Submarine, we stood watches six hours on and twelve hours off. In my attempts to adjust to either a 18 or 36 hour day I first attempted to sleep twelve hours and stay awake twenty four. A third if the day for a sleep cycle- seemed to make sense to me. However, no one consulted me in the scheduling of drills which were &quot;all hands on deck&quot; affairs. So my adaptation was to stand my six hour watch and then go to bed..... and keep going back to bed until I had accomplished six hours sleep. Then I would get up and go about my day. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Citation?  What kind of issues?</p>
<p>I've seen reports from studies on removing circadian cues that indicated that people drifted quite far from a 24 hour cycle.  I wouldn't expect adding 40 minutes would have much effect at all.  Well, other than the significant difficulty of being out of synch with the sun and everyone else, neither of which should be an issue for people actually on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you considered that you'd be adding 40 min every day, not just once?  So someone working on &quot;Mars time&quot; would basically be moving one time zone east every day.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Over on r/space (I think) one of the rover crew mentioned that they stopped working to Mars time after a while because the shifts were grim.  Curiosity can take 2-3 days of instructions at a time, so it doesn't need timely attention.  </p>
<p>But that wasn't a problem with the long Martian sol, it was absolutely a problem with a work schedule that didn't sync with anybody's life schedule.  Doesn't apply to personnel actually on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the length of time, it's that they were perpetually desynched not only with the Earthside day-night cycle, but with the cycle they'd experienced the previous day. Constantly reinforced jet-lag.</p>
<p>Put them in a cave with an artificial Martian-length light cycle, and don't let them go outside, and they'd most likely be fine.</p></div>		</li>
