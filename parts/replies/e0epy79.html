			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and yes. Depends on how bad the sunburn is. A first degree burn probably hasn't caused damage to the nerves (although there may be some damage). A second degree burn probably has, as it is a deeper burn.</p>
<p>Your nerves are more active if they're warmer (the opposite being less 'feeling' when cold), so the inflammation can make the nerves even more sensitive. This can be in addition to damaged nerves.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is to use sunscreen if you're gonna spend any significant length of time in the sun (more than 15 minutes on a Summer day is a good rule of thumb), and repeated application if you're out for hours at a time. Don't forget to protect your lips with an SPF balm, too! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains a lot.  I got a sunburn back in the early 80s.  I was black and purple with little blisters covering my skin.   I couldn't take a warm bath so i spent most days shivering in cool water.  I could never figure out if i was cold or hot though.  It was a very odd feeling i still remember to this day.    Yes i learned my lesson.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe actual aloe vera sap helps (as in from the actual plant), though I do not know by what amount it helps or by what method.</p>
<p>I am sure that it would not hinder the healing process though. And a numbing agent of some kind should not either, but on that much surface area it may pose other health risks.</p></div>		</li>
