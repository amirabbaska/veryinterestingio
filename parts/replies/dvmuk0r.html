			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s my good old college try. OP, please let me know if my metaphors or oversimplification are off base. </p>
<p>“First of all, a hallmark principal of receptor biology is that different ligands will have different downstream effects on gene expression, even if they bind to and activate the same receptor (binding to the same receptor is based on structure of the ligand, and ligands will also differ in their binding affinity). This is thought to be due to recruitment of different cofactors upon receptor activation that take that receptor to the DNA response element encoded for by that steroid receptor. The different cofactors cause different regions of the response element to be bound to and transcribed.”</p>
<p>TRANSLATION: So interactions between cells and chemicals usually involve two guys: ligand and receptor. Ligands are another word for chemicals that can connect to cells. Receptors are where those ligands connect. He was saying that a fundamental concept to keep in mind is that you can have a bunch of different effects happen from the same ligand binding to the same receptor. So estrogen can do a bunch of different stuff, even if it’s interacting in the exact same way. It’s like someone knocking on your door, but getting a different response depending on who is closest to the door when the knock happens or how many people go to answer (people=cofactors). </p>
<p>“The other issue is that you're citing human studies, presumably in adults, in which most humans probably don't consume enough phytoestrogens to produce a stable biological effect. Most gene expression from steroid receptor signaling comes on hours after receptor binding, and typically disappears within a few days (most receptors have ways to inactivate themselves after being active for a while). If you aren't constantly or itermittantly exposed to those chemicals like something like pthalates or BPA, then you may not have a long term effect.”</p>
<p>TRANSLATION: You’re studies aren’t that great. You usually need a shit ton of non-stop exposure to kick off some real long term effects. Occasionally consuming some phytoestrogens through some soy products just isn’t enough to change you long term. </p>
<p>“A 3rd point for consideration is developmental stage of exposure. Most endocrine disruptors will only cause massive and or permanent reproductive toxicity if the exposure happened early in development (such as in utero or early childhood), before cell types have fully matured and differentiated. For example, lead is well known to hinder neurodevelopment and reduce IQ later in life as an adult if the fetus or child is exposed, but an adult exposed to lead will not experience any permanent reduction in IQ. There may be other consequences to endocrine disruption in adults (many of them are also carcinogens or can alter immunity or cause oxidative stress short term), but they won't be as severe as an equivalent developmental exposure.”</p>
<p>TRANSLATION: Also keep in mind that chemicals like this are waaaay more likely to change you when you’re a fetus than when you’re fully grown. It’s like poking your finger in wet playdoh vs poking a hardened clay playdoh figurine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Did you come up with this, because this is a brilliant analogy cell biology teachers should use.  Too often we think, oh, ligand/protein/hormone activates cell receptor ---&gt; cell does this. But really, the state of the cell and what cofactors it is producing currently to accept that signal, changes what that signal means to the cell and what it will ultimately do from receiving the signal.</p>
<p>I would love an example from someone smarter than I where the same cell will accept the same signaling protein/ligand/hormone, but will do something completely different because of the cofactors it produced to respond to it.  What is that different response it will have and what causes the cell to create the different cofactors in each case. And ultimately, how does each different response benefit the cell as opposed to other response available to it.</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>The same molecule can cause a different reaction in different people, even if that molecule binds to the same receptor in every person.  This is because, ultimately, what genes are expressed depend both on what receptors are bound and what other factors are present in the cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We might not see the effect of some chemical exposures if the exposures are small or don't happen very often.</p>
</li>
<li>The effect of chemical exposures depends on how old we are.  If you expose a fetus and an adult to lead, you'll see way different effects on their IQ.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like xenoestrogens are in literally everything in the environment: the petrochemicals from refineries, BPAs, foods.  To the point where (allegedly) young women are entering puberty earlier.  How come estrogen is such a common and seemingly easily-reproduced hormone, but we don't see or hear anything about xenotestosterones in the environment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit harder for me to answer as my expertise is more in thyroid hormone signaling, but in my anecdotal opinion, I do not believe that the androgen receptor (the receptor that testosterone binds to) is as well studied as the estrogen receptor, not do I think the media has been as vocal about it. For example, a chemical that turns frogs and fish female or cause puberty in females at age 8 is more likely to scare someone and get them to click a story link than an article about how prenatal exposure to pthalates can delay testicular descent.</p>
<p>Part of this is due to environmental justice. Estrogen signaling disruption in humans (in epidemiology studies) is well studied because   women are more likely to be exposed to them through cosmetics compared to men (specifically black/latino women that have a culturally induced greater exposure burden that goes beyond a simple socioeconomic explanation). That type of research has real world and immediate applications to public health interventions. </p>
<p>I should also mention that endocrine disrupting chemicals are very broad in what they can do. A shit ton of chemicals that we call xenoestrogens will also bind to or antagonize the androgen receptor, or several other endocrine receptor like thyroid, progesterone, or glucocorticoid. Beyond those direct effects, there are indirect effects too. If one toxicant binds to the estrogen receptor, it could lower the expression of the androgen receptor, or create proteins that will go and degrade existing androgen receptors in the nucleus, so it will have an effect on androgen signaling even if it doesn't directly act on the receptor itself. And then we're also exposed to mixtures of these things, not single chemicals, so then it gets even crazier trying to figure out whats going on, so its easy to look at an obvious health outcome like fertility, behaviour, rate of maturation, or immune function rather than figuring out the details of a specific receptor mediated mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I’m sure you know, there has been a dramatic decline in men’s hormonal health in the past several decades. Large reduction in sperm count, serum testosterone, grip strength, etc. And as you must know even better, loss of testosterone is very detrimental to the physical and mental health of men. If this generalized decline has been caused by the abundance of xenoestrogens in the environment, as seems plausible, then there is a huge potential for public health benefits in researching it. So why doesn’t it get attention and funding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As per your third point, is the &quot;threat&quot;, roughly speaking, to the hormonal balances of unborn and very young children a real and quantifiable thing then? Are the parents who themselves consume soy products during pregnancy, and then feed the child soy products ACTUALLY producing feminized sons and hyperfeminized daughters? Is that even how this external estrogen would influence girls as they grow up?</p>
<p>I'm probably misunderstanding something, so excuse my ignorance. Should hopeful parents be avoiding soy products for the duration of the pregnancy and afterwards not feed the child soy products during early childhood in order to not upset the hormonal balance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good question and we're honestly not entirely sure if the changes in developmental toxicity are always dependent on changes in hormone balance, that is to say, some studies have removed those hormones from the equation in rats and found that the chemicals can still cause an effect.</p>
<p>Besides that, the evidence as far as I can say in terms of phytoestrogens in humans isn't entirely conclusive. We have little bits of studies that show adverse effects from phytoestrogens during pregnancy or fed to infants, but we don't always know what will happen to them when they grow up (because that takes a long time to study and this field is still kind of new). We also don't have enough info for full risk assessment of those chemicals (ie. the EPA can't provide policy recommendations without a shit ton of information). There are also gene-environment interactions: ie. some people get exposed but never get sick because their genetics make them less inherently susceptible, though we do know that epigenetic programming during early life development is highly responsive to environmental exposures. Also, as cell types are dividing and differentiating from stem cells during development, a change to their gene expression regulation by a chemical can cause a permanent change in the number or function of that cell type as the organism continues to mature. Essentially its a long-winded way of describing the developmental origins of health and disease, we know that our exposures early in life can make a difference later in life, though it can be difficult to really say why that happens.</p>
<p>As a scientist I'd say its probably best to be safe and lower your consumption of estrogenic compounds during pregnancy, but we don't have enough information to say for certain how much to avoid or how much it will matter later in life.</p>
<p>Other chemicals are more well studied in the comntext of early life development.  In terms of feminization in humans, a favorite paper I like to mention is a study in which they looked at urinary concentrations of pthalates in pregnant mothers and found that women with high pthalate concentrations had male children with a reduced distance between the base of the penis and anus, suggesting pthalates can feminize the child.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Some xenoestrogens are considered unsafe enough that they're banned in certain countries. BPA is one of these, and pthalates and BPA tend to be specifically forbidden from baby products.</p>
<p>On a more hypothetical note, I often wonder if soy-filled vegan diets influence childhood development. </p></div>		</li>
