			<div class="markdown"><p>Am engineer, MS focus on decision-making methods in design, currently taking class on statistics that used this example within the first week.... Can confirm. </p>
<p>It's just Bayes' Rule and Conditional Probability. Pretty basic stuff where probability is concerned and is usually taught within the first few segments of any decent course on probability - though I didn't really get it until I was exposed to it the 2nd or 3rd time due to how unintuitive it is. </p></div>		</li>

<p>P(A) is given (1/10000) and P(B|A) as well (0.99). The only part you have to calculate is P(B), i.e. the probability that a test is positive. That is
P(B)=P(A)P(B|A)+P(AC)P(B|AC).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you go through this derivation? Been a while since I've done this stuff and can't see how you go from Bayes Theorem with P(A|B) on the left to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean P(B)=P(A)P(B|A)+P(AC)P(B|AC)? This follows from the definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability" target="_blank">conditional probability</a>. The definition of conditional probability says that P(B|A)=P(A and B)/P(A) and P(B|AC)=P(AC and B)/P(AC), 'and' is the intersection of two sets (sorry, don't know how to tex on reddit). Rearranging you get</p>
<p>P(A and B)= P(B|A)P(A)</p>
<p>P(AC and B)=P(B|AC)P(AC)</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the sets 'A and B' and 'AC and B' are disjoint and that the union of both sets is 'B'. Therefore we get</p>
<p>P(B)=P(A and B)+P(AC and B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|AC)P(AC).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Read up on conditional probability and followed along until that.</p></div>		</li>
