			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting to me. I've often wondered if Panthalassa really existed as one unending super ocean or if there were other continents there that we just don't know about because the plates they were on were fully subducted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could that <em>happen?</em> Could a whole continental plate just subduct into the earth and never be seen again? Would we have any way of knowing it happened, or be able to recover fossils / other information from the lost continent?</p></div>		</li>

The Wave Watcher's Companion: Ocean Waves, Stadium Waves, and All the Rest of Life's Undulations by Gavin Pretor-Pinney. It's very accessible, and surprisingly entertaining.</p></div>		</li>
