			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, depends on how you feel about game mode/etc and the nature of the game. Some turn based thing won't matter. Something with actual reflexes, like an action-RPG(Say... Borderlands 1) Game mode might help.</p>
<p>In the one TV I had with that option, turning off and on game mode didn't do much for latency. Of course, I have dyspraxia so my relfexes and shit are slow as hell. :P I kept it off because I didn't like how it made my DVDs and OTA TV look, though. My TV was fairly low end so the processing kinda sucked I guess?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're playing something like dark souls or any rpg with a focus on combat you'll want it on so you can see what the enemies are doing sooner and thus react faster. Turn based RPGs and such are probably better with it off.</p></div>		</li>
