So much of your body's biochemistry is predetermined genetically that it's really unfair to people diagnosed with depression because in some cases due to their receptor cohort there is no effective drug therapy for them. Like I said earlier, everyone has different moods that predispose them to &quot;being turned on&quot;. While some people may get &quot;horny&quot; when stressed, stress may have the opposite effect on others, and the same is true of just about every mood there is. It's why we see sadomasochism being an interesting point of observation; pain is generally an aversive stimulus however for some people it literally leads to their reward centers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the autonomic nervous system consists of two parts, parasympathetic, and sympathetic. </p>
<p>the two main divisions of the nervous system other than that is autonomic and somatic or voluntary. Pretty much the only things you have conscious control over is your somatic nervous system, which is a fancy way to pretty much say the skeletal muscles. </p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system is subdivided into P:rest/digest, and S:fight or flight.</p></div>		</li>
