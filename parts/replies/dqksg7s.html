			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of it. But the reactor was in an unstable configuration caused by early reactor poisoning and a series of poor decisions based in it. They were doomed once they started the test.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s not entirely true. They were not doomed until the operator tripped the reactor. If the situation had been realized the operator could have slowly maneuvered the plant back into a safe operating regime. Sadly due to the control rod design and positive void coefficient the reactor went prompt supercritical when it was tripped.</p></div>		</li>
