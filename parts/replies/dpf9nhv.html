<p>In the stomach and small intestine, the food and drink you've consumed is mixed and ground together. It will be pretty liquid and mashed together. The small intestine absorbs many of the nutrients. The &quot;poop consistency&quot; happens in the large intestine, which continues the absorption of nutrients and absorbs much of the water, turning what's left into feces. </p></div>		</li>
