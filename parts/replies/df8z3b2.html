<p>Library school isn't JUST shushing and cat petting.</p>

<p>Please tell me though that there are plenty of courses in shushing and cat petting, at least a minor concentration.  I could totally do that.</p>
<p>I also know how to put my hair up in a bun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom was a librarian before the requirement for Master's degrees began, and she got her masters in Administration rather than library science.  According to her the reason they did this is because every library used to have its own librarian, but school systems are now adopting a new policy of one librarian per district.  The rest of the library workers are para-professionals who get paid even less than teachers.</p>
<p>tl;dr: education budget cuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not that accurate. Not only do you have to have a masters degree to be a librarian, to be a school librarian, you have to have a teaching certificate and a school librarian certificate too. In many schools, the trend now is that they are sending a specific teacher to grad school to get their MSLS while they work in the library. </p>
<p>I have worked in an academic library for 3 years and switched out of Info Science last semester in grad school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the insight. Are you sure this isn't a rule/law/regulation just for your area or school district or something? Just looking for clarification. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it is accurate.  They aren't librarians, they're library workers.  I'm not sure you realize what &quot;paraprofessional&quot; means.  There is ONE librarian per school district in this part of Texas.  The rest of them are library aides.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I feel most jobs should be apprenticeships. Maybe take some kind of skills and aptitude exam or maybe let younger people try out different jobs on some type of trial basis. This college system is old and outdated and needs to be changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's quite expensive in the US, but if you think college is expensive, let me explain your suggestion...</p>
<p>Admittedly there could be some fields where this might be a reasonable course of action, but as I recall it often ends up costing about $20k for training of a new employee. That's a lot for someone that has no experience, no knowledge, and possibly no desire to work in the field. Sure, some hires meet that criteria after a full degree, but as is that's basically being applied to everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works all over Europe. Especially Germany and Austria. The way they do it is actually allow teenagers who aren't that good in school and don't wish to graduate to go to university to instead start their apprenticeships around 14/15. They earn very little money. Very very little. But they are basically still living at home and have no more costs than everyone else their age who is still at school. </p>
<p>They complete their apprenticeships within a few years and had zero costs. Which is obviously great because it's done for car mechanics, hairdressers, carpenters, plumbers, masons, anything really. These jobs don't make you rich. Wasting money on university would be ludicrous. </p>
<p>Yes, their employers are swallowing the costs of training them but they have additional cheap staff that they can train to be good at the exact things they need to be good at. It works incredibly well.</p>
<p>I was actually quite shocked when I moved to the US at 15 and one of my friends told me she was going to college to learn how to be a hairdresser. Sounds dumb to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you could give a tax write off for corporations hiring on through an education or apprenticeship sponsorship program. Something has to get better. I think university is not needed with the amount of data we have at our fingertips right now. If university is supposed to teach people how to think I feel for the most part they have failed. Who knows with all these technical applications we have recently made. I mean the training limits of VR for teaching and hopefully augmented reality are endless. We will find a way. Not sure how much longer this old and outdated  indoctrination system will be around for.</p></div>		</li>
