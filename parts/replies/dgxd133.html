			<div class="markdown"><p>When ice is frozen, it forms a crystal lattice of lowest energy. When you introduce defects to that crystal lattice, the lattice is higher energy and therefore has a lower melting point. The cloudiness is due to dissolved whatever in the ice, so cloudy ice has more defects and a lower melting point.</p>
<p>Though much more slowly is probably an exaggeration. I don't know the melting point range for clear ice vs cloudy ice off hand, but I'd be surprised if it was more than a couple of degrees celsius, and the vast majority of energy used when melting something goes into actually melting, not getting the thing to melting temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clear ice melts slower not because cloudy ice melts at a higher temperature, but because there's more actual ice in a given volume of clear ice than cloudy ice. Some of the volume of cloudy ice is air, which obviously doesn't need to melt, and so sucks up much less heat than the melting ice. </p>
<p>It really is the just old Q=mC[deltaT] equation at work. There's more mass of ice in clear than cloudy. </p></div>		</li>
