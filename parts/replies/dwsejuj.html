			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a question we are still working on in this area! Big components of a self-sustaining oyster population are the production, settlement, and survival of oyster larvae. Oysters, like other sessile marine species, have a bipartite lifecycle where they spent their youth as larvae in the water column before settling out in their adult form on their permanent substrate. Successful settlement is a dance between reproduction, larval survival, and appropriate substrate for the larvae to land on. At the moment, there is very low recruitment in the NY Harbor, which could be a result of a lack of substrate (i.e. no reefs!) or issues with reproduction or larval survival. Part of our research seeks to answer how these factors might interplay to result in successful and sustainable reefs.</p></div>		</li>
