			<div class="markdown"><p>It's estimated that 80&#37; of total plastic marine debris comes from land-based sources (plastic bags, bottles, packaging, industrial waste etc.). The remaining 20&#37; comes from ocean-based sources (i.e. fishing fleets). Fishing gear specifically was around 10&#37; of total plastic debris.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716310154" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716310154" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716310154</a></a></p>
<p>In specific environments, however, fishing fleets have a higher impact. For example, in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it's estimated 46&#37; of material is fishing nets because of intensive fishing activity in the Pacific.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said that developed countries with little mismanaged plastic waste should commit to broader action like improving the waste situation in developing countries.
So do you think that banning or taxing  plastic straws or bags is a bad idea, as it doesn't really address the main problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea. But my worry is that it distracts from the high-impact changes we need globally to properly solve the issue. Sometimes I think they can lull us into a false sense of significant progress, such that we don't note the big interventions needed to get to the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>If they're additional to our other global efforts then sure, we should definitely do them. But if they're a substitute then they make little difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer! A follow up question: How is plastic waste mismanaged in a developed country (like Germany)? If I buy a plastic bag or use a plastic straw and throw it in a bin (maybe even a special bin for plastic) - how does this plastic get into the water system? I believe that our disposal companies can and will not throw that stuff into the rivers...</p></div>		</li>
