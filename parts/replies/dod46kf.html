<p>Really good stuff, thanks for sharing!</p>
<p>Oh... Know anything good about energy and plasma weapons? I'm a fan of LRAD type stuff, my favorite is not a weapon but a developing defensive tool, the Plasma Acoustic Shield System. </p>
<p>PASS uses synchronized photo-pulse detonation to create miniature in air explosions as a defensive/ distraction tool. Pics show one mounted on a Humvee, I'm excited to see where this goes if the public is ever allowed to see the fully developed tech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor quibble:  plastic explosives are not used in nuclear weapons.  It has to be rigid, like TNT, HMX, or RDX, because the explosives have to be machined to a very precise shape in order to turn the multiple spherical shockwave created by the initiators into an imploding planar wave (ie, one that is the shame shape as the nuclear fuel)--otherwise, the fuel gets squeezed into a &quot;star burst&quot; shape, and &quot;squirts&quot; out at the points of the &quot;Star burst,&quot; resulting in a dirty bomb, or at best a nuclear fizzle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct term is polymer bonded explosive (PBX). These can be  quite rigid and dimensionally stable or more elastic, depending on the binder. Most modern weapons only use a two-point detonation system.</p></div>		</li>
