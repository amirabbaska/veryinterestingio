			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really have any interesting visualizations of the stuff I've been currently working on I'm afraid. Most of what I end up using is in the form of various plots and graphs. The group I work with has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SXSCollaboration" target="_blank">Youtube page</a> with some simulations of black hole and neutron star stuff from the past several years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where can I find some information about the current status of simulating neutron stars? The last I heard about this (which was years ago) it seemed like the field was very much in its infancy and that getting an equation of state for neutron stars was considered a holy grail. I'd love to know what has happened since then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, finding the equation of state for neutron stars is one of the big unknowns currently and a lot of work is being put into trying to narrow down what it could be. The detection of a binary neutron star merger by LIGO (which is currently down for upgrades until sometime early next year) has greatly helped to push neutron star modeling past pure simulation and has given actual observational data to help in this area. At the moment, many neutron star simulations simply use a wide variety of proposed equations of state with the hope that future observational data will rule out some of these.</p></div>		</li>
