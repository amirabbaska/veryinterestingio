Fast forward a year and they started dating and eventually got married. Chemistry is a funny thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm of a similar mindset - I tend to spend time figuring out how to qualify my statements and ensure that what I say is precise. It's something that I picked up in college, and I'm a very literal person. I hate statements of guarantees because I know that, even if extremely unlikely, something could happen. There are no certainties, but some things are more certain than others.</p>
<p>There are people who I simply can't stand, but I think the key to dealing with it is to understand that they simply don't know who you are, and they don't see the world through the same lens as you. I have a coworker who I can't stand - she has limited interaction with me, what little interaction there has been has always been dismissive or confrontational, and I have never seen her apologize to anyone for anything she says, even when it's blatantly offensive. But I also know that she's extremely defensive and constantly under pressure, and when she starts working with people, she realizes that they're not out to get her, and she opens up. Same time, a part of it is that she is indeed rude - she needs to work on social ethics and etiquette. Unfortunately, with her, non-apology is self-reinforcing: she says something because she feels threatened, does not apologize, person becomes more openly hostile with her, she clamps down on her defensiveness (or the person does not become more openly hostile, and she doesn't realize that what she said was wrong). She sees the world through a different lens than me - she's not detail oriented, she doesn't care about precision, she solves her problems directly and bluntly. I can see why large groups, be they companies or societies, want different kinds of people like this - different mindsets for different problems. </p>
<p>I think the reason that we dislike people who don't share our personality, our way of thinking about things, is that we like to think that we've optimized our personality to deal with problems (for example, my becoming more precise with my language in college), and we have trouble accepting that many problems can have multiple solutions. We cannot see how their approach would resolve the problem we're looking at, until they actually go through with it, whilst we see how our approach would solve that same problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit this resonates well with me. </p>
<p>About the spineless indecisivness, I haven't been able to figure out who's &quot;right&quot; about this. I mean, if I'm in fact 97% sure of something, is it really wrong of them to think that I'm indicisive? Perhaps I could pretend to be sure from say 80% and upwards, maybe that would be more efficient and natural when communicating at work for instance? I don't know. </p>
<p>To me it makes sense to try to articulate precisely how and how well I understand something. The problem is I kind of expect others to do the same, but a lot of people don't. I know someone who at all times is 100% sure that her current view of things is correct, but that view may change at any time. I feel it makes communication hard when she does not acknowledge the fact that she may be wrong, and then suddenly accepts some new stance on the matter without recognizing that she did. It's great that she does change her view, but I find her bit challenging to communicate with. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm the problem, I really don't know. Communication is hard ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How to deal with it in a work setting when you're responsible for problem solving is something I struggle with. Like you said, if I'm 80% sure of something and I'm in charge of making the call, that's good enough for me. If it's a team decision, I will always voice whatever concerns I have with a particular decision, even if I think it's the right one. Then again, if I'm in charge of making the call and I think something could go wrong, isn't it better to voice your concerns and prepare people for what could possibly go wrong? My opinion on that changes nearly daily. </p></div>		</li>
