			<div class="markdown"><p>Cystic Fibrosis is another example. Homozygous for CF = bad. But heterozygous for CF seems to have a protective benefit against Cholera. More specifically, it's protective against the lethal effects of diarrhea. It's thought that this is how it came to be such a prevalent mutation in some populations, because people without one CF allele would be more prone to die from Cholera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. My professor from quite a few years back had laid the hypothesis a possessed a single CF allele had better water retention and wasted/lost less fluids than normal people. I'm not in research anymore, but I've always wondered what that hypothesis would eventually develop into. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also suggestions that being a CF carrier (i.e. not a sufferer) also protects against tuberculosis. 1/25 Europeans are CF carriers (most don't realise). Tuberculosis has been one of the biggest killers over the last 500 years (and still is) ..</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I had no clue. Makes me want to check! My baby got tested for all of that stuff when he was born, so I know he's not a carrier. That doesn't exclude me from being a carrier, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this piqued my interest, as I had not heard that before (I'm a carrier for CF Delta F508). It looks like a there's a drug that operates in the same way HIV does, that may potentially help CF patients. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a certain point of view, there's an interpretation of how the Black Plague helped the 50% of Europe who survived it (from <a href="http://www.livescience.com/2497-black-death-changed-world.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/2497-black-death-changed-world.html</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social effects of the plague were felt immediately after the worst outbreaks petered out. Those who survived benefited from an extreme labor shortage, so serfs once tied to the land now had a choice of whom to work for. Lords had to make conditions better and more attractive or risk leaving their land untended, leading to wage increases across the board.</p>
<p>The taste of better living conditions for the poor would not be forgotten. A few decades later, when lords tried to revert back to the old ways, there were peasant revolts throughout Europe and the lower classes maintained their new freedoms and better pay.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church and Jewish populations in Europe did not fare so well.</p>
<p>Distrust in God and the church, already in poor standing due to recent Papal scandals, grew as people realized that religion could do nothing to stop the spread of the disease and their family's suffering. So many priests died, too, that church services in many areas simply ceased. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting - that's a very different interpretation of the question because it addresses how a disease affected humanity overall.  I was trying to think of examples of how a disease directly benefitted the health of the individual.</p>
<p>Very interesting contribution, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is another example - Edward Jenner using cow pox to cure small pox. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For many years, he had heard the tales that dairymaids were protected from smallpox naturally after having suffered from cowpox. Pondering this, Jenner concluded that cowpox not only protected against smallpox but also could be transmitted from one person to another as a deliberate mechanism of protection. In May 1796, Edward Jenner found a young dairymaid, Sarah Nelms, who had fresh cowpox lesions on her hands and arms (Figure â€‹(Figure33). On May 14, 1796, using matter from Nelms' lesions, he inoculated an 8-year-old boy, James Phipps. Subsequently, the boy developed mild fever and discomfort in the axillae. Nine days after the procedure he felt cold and had lost his appetite, but on the next day he was much better. In July 1796, Jenner inoculated the boy again, this time with matter from a fresh smallpox lesion. No disease developed, and Jenner concluded that protection was complete.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what makes the question in the OP one of the most interesting I've seen on AskScience in recent times. It's such a simple question, yet open to many different interpretations. From the word 'disease' (bacterial, viral, genetic disorder?) to 'beneficial' (directly benificial, or benificial in the long term?) and 'humans' (the individual or humanity as a whole?), it seems like every answer in this thread interprets the question in its own way. I guess not surprisingly we even have an answer about semantics.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for this ramble, I just really love this question!</p></div>		</li>
