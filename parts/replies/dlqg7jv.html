<p>Edit: this was something a friend of mine brought up too. &quot;It's like hitting your head against a wall when you could just buy a hammer and have the same success with no pain. You're fuckin stubborn like an ox sometimes.&quot;  That mostly relates to me trying to play my favorite hearthstone decks against the current meta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for something like that ! For example, when my bus is late, but I don't know for how long, I will wait thinking five minutes waiting is no big deal. By the time I have waited twenty minutes, I think I might as well walk home because it won't take so long and waiting for the bus for I don't know how long is a waste, but I have waited and wasted twenty minutes already, so I might just wait five minutes more. </p></div>		</li>
