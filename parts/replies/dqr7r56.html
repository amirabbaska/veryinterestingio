No, they're not bound.
No other properties I can think of.
The integers are arbitrary, they might have a function, such as changing say, how many things appear on screen that a user can decide, but they have no other patterns or anything like that.</p>
<p>I've looked at Cantor's pairing function, however I thought that was limited to 2 or 3 values, and even then the size of the number it generates can be a little too big. I've also looked at Szudzik's function too.</p></div>		</li>
