<p>The last time I had a progress bar on a project we made it start filling at a certain rate, then halve in speed every time it filled half the remaining bar so it would never complete. When everything was ready we took down the progress bar and started the app. We never had a complaint about it in the 5 years it was in production and people were usually happy that the process finished early ;).</p>

<p>Zeno's fucking paradox...</p>
<p>I think the amount of complaints you get would depend on how big the file you're downloading is. If the thing downloads in under 2 mins, no one is going to care if it is accurate. If we're talking like a 10 min+ download, then yeah a bad loading bar might lead to complaints. For example, I've had so many damn programs get to 99% in like 5 mins and then stay there for another 2 mins... That's the type of shit people will complain about. It makes them think something has gone wrong, when in reality the loading bar probably just sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Downloading files is easy to make an accurate progress bar: bytes received / bytes total. </p>
<p>For the 99% issue, it's usually because the progress bar was originally meant for something easy to measure (eg copying files), but then a finishing step is added that can't be measured (eg run a command). So the final step is given 1%, even if it sometimes take longer than the initial 99%.</p></div>		</li>
