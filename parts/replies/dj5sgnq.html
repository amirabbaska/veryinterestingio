			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I think is mostly correct. What you feel is the rate of heat transfer, not temperature directly.</p>
<p>Dipping your hand in water causes your hand to become wet and water is more thermally conductive than air. This gives you the sensation of greater heat transfer from your body to the environment, thus the cold feeling.</p>
<p>The inside of your mouth is already wet, so the rate of heat transfer is less affected by water unless the water itself is colder, but even then your hand would feel even more cold.</p></div>		</li>
