<p><a href="https://experiencelife.com/article/fiber-why-it-matters-more-than-you-think/" target="_blank">Here's an overview of how it works</a> (tl;dr fiber binds with bile salts and helps break down/remove dietary fat/remove fat from bloodstream.)<br />
There's a ton of high fiber foods - my breakfast consists of oatmeal, flaxseed meal, chia seeds and some fruit (fresh and/or dried.)  Gets me around 14g per serving - almost half of what I need.  Note: if you're not used to that much fiber you'll have some interesting side effects.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, after a night of drinking..  I mixed a container of low sugar yogurt...(40g fiber) with half a box of trader Joe's high fiber cereal (60g fiber).. Ate the whole bowl. The next day was intense.
Try to avoid 100g of fiber at one time. Especially after lots of beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oatmeal is one.<br />
I start 90% of my days with a half cup (dry before preparation) of Bobâ€™s organic quick coot steel cut oats.<br />
My bad cholesterol is around 60.<br />
I should add that I eat a generally healthy diet though and engage in regular instense cardio.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fecal incontinence is difficulty controlling bowel movements. This can be caused by numerous conditions, but many digestive disorders are caused by an inadequate diet. As an example, someone with chronic diherrea can benefit from fiber since their body is secreting a large amount of liquid into their intestines causing stool to move quickly through and out the body. Fiber absorbs water and solidifies the stool making it travel slower, digest more efficiently, and be easier to pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can if you want to. Of course there is a risk of constipation if you consume large amounts of fiber. As with any supplements, you should discuss with your doctor before taking them. You don't really need supplements of any kind if you just have a balanced diet unless you have a medical disorder or deficiency of some sort.</p></div>		</li>
