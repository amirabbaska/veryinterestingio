			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part isn't accurate. The only source of oxygen in the winter for a lake is that given off by plants. It needs to make it through the winter on a combination of the reserve oxygen and what little is produced by plants. It is very common to run out of oxygen before spring in smaller shallower lakes,  a condition known as winterkill. Often crappies and bullheads (which survive low oxygen better than most species) have extremely high populations in lakes subject to winterkill.</p></div>		</li>
