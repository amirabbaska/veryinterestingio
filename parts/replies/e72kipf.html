			<div class="markdown"><p>A fart would actually be more likely to carry you to space than a jet engine since jet engines rely on air flowing through it (no air in space and very little in the upper atmosphere) whereas a fart uses internal gas ejected as reaction mass which is how space craft actually work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disagree, a fart may more closely model current methods of reaching space, but a jet engine capable of reaching sufficient speeds before flameout to breach the Karman line in a ballistic trajectory is definitely more realistic than a fart alone leading to sufficient speeds to exit the atmosphere.
While a fart is more similar to rockets in the sense of how they work, a jet engine is more similar in that it has been known to produce a TWR of over 1. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My dad explained jets like this: It's a rocket engine, but you don't need to carry the air <em>and</em> the fuel. Suck in air, add fuel, blow it up. &quot;The air is free, so why carry it?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the original comment was right. A high-bypass turbofan jet engine produces thrust in both ways; from the fan and the jet thrust. </p>
<p>The air enters the compressor and is compressed through several stages to get to the right air density. Then fuel and and heat is added and boom, hot air mass is pushed out the back. Additionally, the turbine blades are spun by that air mass and drives the fan at the front of the engine, generating more thrust and the auxiliary electrical generator for plane systems. </p>
<p>The afterburner, if installed, takes the hot air mass flowing out the back (which also includes some unignited fuel) and adds more fuel and heat to create even more thrust. In jets it’s called an afterburner and in power it’s called supplementary firing or duct burner (and is used to generate combined cycle steam instead of thrust). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A jet engine does not have a propeller. It does incorporate a series of vanes that compress the incoming air before it is combined with fuel and ignited, but these are not propellers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aircraft mechanic here. To add to this, propellers also have a maximum speed they can move and still be effective. If you spin a prop too fast it will form a kind of a pressure bubble around it which will actually limit the amount of air it can move, so after a certain speed it doesn't matter how fast you spin it, you won't be gaining any thrust.</p>
<p>A way you can get around this is with a turbo prop engine, which combines both a jet engine and a propeller.  Instead of producing thrust  like a normal jet engine, a turbo prop is used to spin a propeller at a constant speed, then by adjusting the angle of the propeller you can speed up and slow down all without having to increase the power to the engine. One of the side effects of this is they are extremely fuel efficient compared to both prop and jet engines because you can essentially run it on idle the whole time and still fly at top speed. You can't quite reach jet speeds, but you can out do any normal prop driven aircraft.</p>
<p>As a side note, turbo props are used in almost all modern helicopters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to rain on your parade but there’s a lot of unintentional misinformation here.</p>
<p>What you are attempting to describe is a constant-speed propeller.</p>
<p>Fixed pitch props usually get stuck just shy of the speed of sound, this is the pressure bubble you are describing.</p>
<p>With a fixed pitch blade you have a couple options.  Pick one that is efficient at cruise speed and lose thrust due to inefficiency during takeoff and climb, or pick one that gives you excellent thrust at low speeds and be unable to cruise at high speeds because there isn’t enough “bite.”</p>
<p>A constant speed propeller allows you to adjust blade angle during flight, so you can achieve best thrust at low speeds and beat efficiency at high speeds, while keeping the engine operating at peak torque.</p>
<p>This is used quite commonly in both piston and turbine applications, so implying it exists only on turboprops is a bit odd for an A&amp;P.</p>
<p>As for flying at cruise speed with the engine at idle, not sure where you got that information but it is decidedly incorrect.  Regardless of blade configuration, to develop thrust to maintain a climb OR cruise you need power.  Neither a turbine or piston engine will generate the sort of power you need for cruise flight while idling.</p>
<p>The laws of physics pretty much guarantee that the faster you go, the more power you require to offset the increase in parasitic drag.  At cruise you are burning tons of fuel, though likely less than during climb out.  That’s said, a constant speed prop will allow you to burn LESS fuel at a given airspeed than a fixed pitch prop because it can operate more efficiently within the power-band.</p>
<p>A constant speed prop isn’t really used to speed up or slow down the aircraft, that would be your engine power settings.  What you set as a pilot is the prop rpm, which is then maintained by fancy hydraulics within the propeller assembly.  Adding power increases rpm and thrust, but the blade will adjust to maintain rpm, and take a larger bite out of the air as a result.  A low rpm high power setting is a good way to blow up an engine.</p>
<p>The last note of turbo props being used in helicopters isn’t entirely incorrect, but it’s a strange way to word things.  Helicopters are similar to turboprops in that they use a turbine to power the rotor assembly, but that’s pretty much where the similarities end.</p>

<p>You probably already know this, but some constant-speed propeller assemblies used an electric motor to change prop pitch rather than hydraulics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another difference with regards to speed: If you are going slow, you want to create a wide, relatively slow air strem, if you go fast, it's better to have it narrow and fast.</p>
<p>This is why helicopters have a huge rotor, slow aircraft use a propeller, most civilian jets use turbofan and jet fighters use a turbojet.</p></div>		</li>
