			<p>Valid point. But this is how they maintain warmth. We learned that during winter mother you have to increase the forage content in cattle diet. Things like straw, hay, and grass. These have more lignin and cellulose which can only be digested by microbes. But they still have to do a lot of work to break them down and this results in a lot of heat produced. The opposite is true for heat. You have to cut back on forage so they don't over heat. I'm in Texas so this is critical for us because, I think, at least 70% of the year we are above the optimal temperature for digestion. </p>		</li>
