			<div class="markdown"><p>As an odd hypothetical, the only place I can imagine all of this eroded sand ending up is to be distributed evenly across the surface...which in turn implies given enough time it would migrate into the valleys and create a near-perfect sphere. Ignoring metoric activity, anyway.</p>
<p>If that happened, any substantial water table above the sand sand would necessarily flood the entire planet, kind of like that first tidal planet in <em>Interstellar</em>. There would be no dry land except perhaps a narrow range where either tidal forces from Phobos/Deimos would pull the water table beneath the surface at points...or a perpetual wetlands covered in several inches or feet of water.</p>
<p>So, if indeed such erosion ever happened (hypothetically, in the far off future humans will likely never see), terraforming would necessarily involve moving land to reform islands or continents above the water table. Or turning into fish-people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the risk of detracting from the main point, would a tidal planet like the one in interstellar even be possible? With my basic understanding of waves, you wouldn't get a &quot;wave&quot; as seen, but instead the water would just &quot;rise&quot; like a bathtub being filled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting some cursory thought into it, although improbable I don't think it's impossible.</p>
<p>For one, the gravitational forces large enough to create waves of that size may also contribute to some very active plate tectonics like Europa. Which would then cause tidal waves. I admit this isn't the explanation given in the film, however.</p>
<p>Additionally, a planet of a sufficiently larger radius/density and a close enough moon might be able to generate a tide differential of that magnitude. Combined with a much faster lunar orbital period, you could feasibly have huge pulls of water moving that quickly across the surface of a planet. The gravity is 130% stronger so the planet's size/density is plausible. And any sufficiently large and long wave will probably take a similar bore-like shape rather than merely filling in or forming gentle arcs and troughs. Water can only maintain a relatively flat-like shape beneath a certain elevation differential...past that and particularly in the face of rapid, violent displacement, it takes on the wave-like shape.</p>
<p>I actually just took a detour to the wiki and apparently an author Kip Thorne found some scientifically viable ways of explaining it. Basically the waves are perpetually fixed in a football shape pointed toward Gargantua due to tidal locking, but because of some natural  rocking you could have the planet shifting beneath the waves and knocking you into deeper waters. It would still explain the largely stagnant, knee-high waters at non-wave points. Still kind of shaky.</p></div>		</li>
