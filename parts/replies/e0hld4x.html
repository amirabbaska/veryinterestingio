			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a cellular bone researcher. If someone worked out how to deposit calcium compounds into microabrasions on teeth enamel completely chemically without using the body's cells, then any trademark would very quickly be removed. That kind of technology would completely revolutionise the way we treat teeth and bone disorders. What's far more likely is that there haven't been extensive tests beyond &quot;this is safe for human consumption&quot; and they're &quot;postulating&quot; its effects based on preliminary results. Skin care, hair care, and toothpaste companies are absolutely notorious for doing this, and the vast majority of their research is purely making sure the product is safe, and then finding a hook that'll get them a patent or trademark based on pilot study level results. Most of the time, no further results are ever seen, and the brand will eventually shift onto the next trend in the industry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's insoluble.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, the point of fluoride is to transform some of the hydroxyapatite in your tissue into fluoroapatite, which is more resistant to acid, wear, etc.</p>
<p>Probably the reaction happens extremely slowly in solution (unless maybe the diatoms form nucleation points for precipitation), but is fairly rapid if/when/where collagen fibers are exposed on the surface of your teeth, due to the physics/chemistry discussed <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2875" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not much unless you invite some sulfuric acid, at which point it would be <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2004/03/03/things_i_wont_touch_1" target="_blank">party time</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a naturally occurring mineral, so shouldn't be much harm there. It's just that its formation means that the calcium and fluorine that are meant to be acting separately on your teeth will just end up as microscopic rocks in your spit.</p></div>		</li>
