			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in addition to all of that (which frankly was a great explanation), since aging is part of the question not only does fluidity change in the vestibular process, but aging affects cerebellum processing speed and reaction just by default of aging. Add into this the picture of aging sort of comorbidities, you have the gauging system you describe getting slightly off, coupled with general aging muscle atrophy/weakness, and cns slow down in processing. Sort of like a domino of increasing the problems with balance as we age. </p>
<p>The young person trips and the cns responds accordingly to get the muscles actively fighting the loss of balance. But as everything gets weakened the effect gets worse. That increase in delay from fall/loss of balance sensation to brain to muscle response, leads to a greater lag in response. If the individual is actually falling that means less time to respond to the fall, which may mean the “point of no return” - I am going to hit the ground - is more likely to happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t have to be over (maybe)! The same thing happened to me, and Dramamine has been a life saver. Didn’t feel the least bit sick after taking it and riding rides. Also, I don’t know if you get carsick, but I get carsick immediately if I’m the backseat (I don’t even have to be doing anything).  </p>
<p>I recently took a 5 hour ride in the backseat and I was reading a book, doing crosswords on my phone, watching videos, things that would normally have me puking in seconds. Dramamine is AWESOME. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>25 seems extremely young to have such degradation. I'm 28 and have had no issues and have known people well into their 50s who enjoy roller coasters. Perhaps see a doctor?</p>
<p>I know some are naturally more likely to get motion sickness to begin with.  Ill get it if I'm trying to read in a car, or often on fair ground rides that spin you all to hell for no apparent reason. 25 is just shortly after all your systems start to decline, so you shouldn't be seeing that much change over say 10 years ago</p></div>		</li>
