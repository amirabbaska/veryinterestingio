			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true, I work in Kansas in an extremely specialized role. There is really only one employer here for me. If I lost my job or decided to gett another one I would have to sell my house, damage many of my relationships, and roll the dice on a big move. </p>
<p>I started by living here before I was in the workforce, but if I were from somewhere coastal I certainly wouldn't come here on purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I moved to KC from the west coast as a fiber tech... and because of a woman I met in college. When I changed careers, I left friends and a relationship to pursue my happiness. </p>
<p>Kansas wasn't anywhere I ever saw myself living being a man from the Seirras, but I was lucky enough to have something it was so hard to let go of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in RTP (Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill)  There are many tech companies around here. Just on my small road, there is an AT&amp;T office and Microsoft Office. Also in the general area, we have SAS, Citrix, Red Hat, Lenovo, Cisco, Oracle, IBM, CA, Google, Cree, Epic Games, eTIX... and the list goes on. I believe this area is going to continue growing out of control as a tech hub.</p></div>		</li>

I contracted for a major medical imaging company [software developer]. Also the headquarters of news publishers, plenty of startups, national non-profits like the AKC.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Add that in with the much cheaper price-of-living, access to great universities (Duke, UNC, NC State) for talent. Good schools around the area, and plenty to do (more in a spread out suburbia as opposed to a NY sky-line). Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill are all close by and each have there different feel. In between the mountains and beach for long weekends (2 hours to Wilmington). For a while been in the top cities for singles (#1 a couple years ago, haven't checked recently).</p>
<p>It'd take a lot for me to move at this point - great, great place to live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm...and the list goes on? I've recently been enlightened to the fact RTP is one of the top IT places alongsice Austin, Ca, and ?Boston?,  and am hoping the industry really is gigantic
(fresh IT grad hunting for entry level IT, and RTP isn't too far from the southeast where i'm currently at unlike Cali)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the curious, <em>sic</em> means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sic erat scriptum, &quot;thus was it written&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I always think of it as 'spelling in citation', as it's usually used that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this was a great answer but was surprised as well when I saw <em>sic</em>. I questioned my understanding of the word and had to Google it. Glad you posted. </p>
<p>What does <em>sp</em> mean? Too lazy to Google it as I've already met my daily quota of looking up definitions. K thx bye. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're editing/correcting someone else's work, you'd circle their spelling error and write &quot;sp&quot; next to it to let them know they spelled it wrong.</p>
<p>If you mark your own text with a &quot;(sp?)&quot; you're basically acknowledging that you may have spelled it incorrectly but aren't sure.</p>
<p>The former they teach in school (or at least they did about thirty years ago), while the latter I think has just crept into common usage.</p></div>		</li>
