			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiologist here. I can attest to there being far more knowledge about the human body than anyone can master. We in radiology deal only with diagnosis, not (much) treatment. Even when only dealing with imaging we had to specialize and sub-specialize to be experts in our fields. We even split a few decades ago (radiation oncology was once &quot;therapeutic radiology&quot; but there was too much knowledge to master in both fields). We are currently splitting again into diagnostic and interventional radiology at the training level. </p>
<p>Similarly, EENT split into ophthalmology and ENT. Surgery split into orthopedics, plastics, general, gynecologic, thoracic, etc.  Surgeons can't master <em>all</em> procedures. Even general surgeons are not  &quot;general&quot; surgeons; they are mostly abdominal surgeons who further specialize into colorectal, hepatobiliary, transplant...</p>
<p>You get the idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And ENT is now split into multiple subspecialties:
otologists concentrate on the ear
rhinologists concentrate on the nose
laryngologists concentrate on the larynx
(other major subspecialities within ent include skull base surgery, head and neck surgery, facial plastic surgery, pediatrics)
It is impossible to track all of the advances rapidly taking place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I study the brain and sometimes, when I want to procrastinate, I remind myself that I'm just a brain looking at a screen showing an average of blood flow to brains while <em>they</em> looked at a screen, and my brain can't always comprehend what exactly these brains were doing in just this one teeny tiny task, so can a brain ever truly know itself?  But what does it mean for a brain to &quot;know itself&quot;--obviously it's not just (or not at all?) to know where blood flows during dumbed-down games or while flashing pictures of faces or or or...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A system cannot contain itself. But, a system can fully contain the models used to run the system.</p>
<p>So you could never fully understand yourself or others, but you could theoretically contain the knowledge and processing power to understand any part of yourself/others at a given moment.</p>
<p>Also: augmentation. Maybe the brain can't hack it, so if we hack it maybe it can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while ago I had a really interesting conversation with an orthopaedist who also had an engineering degree relating to prosthetics, implants, etc. (I'm a mechanical engineering student, we had a long, very interesting conversation)</p>
<p>His take is that medical knowledge has advanced beyond the ability of a human doctor to have mastery of everything in their field, pretty much regardless of specialty. He was saying that doctors need to start thinking/operating more like engineers.</p>
<p>Most engineers have a pretty good working knowledge of everything in their field, just from familiarity. However, engineering is more about knowing how to approach problems and do your research to find a solution. You can't just know everything about what you're going to end up designing, there will always be some aspect that you're going to need to read up on.</p>
<p>This guy (researcher/professor at Penn) was saying that doctors need to focus more on how they approach diagnoses/surgeries/etc. and less on trying to learn everything in their field, because it's impossible unless you become so specialized as to be mostly useless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But even then the &quot;engineer&quot; doctors still need an enormous knowledge base. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We're so specialized that one person will spend twelve years in school and only be comfortable being an expert in feet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question!  </p>
<p>1). My practice was rural so most of the big advances happened in large centers and I only had oblique knowledge of them. The one that astounded me is still being developed and I am not sure I really understand it, but here goes. Malignant melanoma is a horrible cancer that is very difficult to manage because 2 of the approaches, chemo and radiation,  do not help. Instead of three approaches, there was only surgery when I trained in the 80's. And it was HUGE surgery. A small  cancerous mole ideally had up to 2 1/2 inches of skin removed around it. A 5&quot; defect then had to be grafted. And still people died of metastases in the brain or liver years later. </p>
<p>If I understand monoclonal antibodies correctly, a person's melanoma or other cancer cells can be injected into, say, a mouse, and the mouse would form antibodies to that cancer which could then be used in treatment.   </p>
<p>Another advance is in the cosmetic realm. The Japanese are doing thyroid removal via armpit incisions to avoid a neck scar.  Breast implants can be rolled and placed through a tube inserted through a belly button incision, then inflated after placement. </p>
<p>2). My favorite operation, though I feel horrible that it ever needs to be done, is facial reconstruction. Seatbelts for front seat car passengers and catchers masks on rodeo bull riders have reduced the number I see.  </p>
<p>All the bones of the face can be reassembled and plated or wired back in position with out obvious scarring.  The forehead and brows can be approached through a bicoronal (ear to ear over the skull crown- my apologies to the squeamish) by peeling the frontal scalp and forehead skin down. This scar is invisible unless the patient goes bald.  </p>
<p>The mid face can be fixed through incision under the upper lip inside the mouth.</p>
<p>The lower face can be repaired through an incision behind, and in the shadow of, the lower jawbone. </p>
<p>3).  I loved doing all kinds of surgery but there are some that are less satisfying than others. Kids get head and neck cancers, and removing them and watching the suffering of the little ones and their families is devastating. </p>
<p>Spending 3 hours to plate and wire a massively broken jaw in the middle of the night to have the (usually) addicted patient remove all my handiwork in his garage with pliers the next day because he cant tolerate the delayed gratification involved in a 6 week blender diet is pretty frustrating. </p>
<p>Clarification Addendum:  patients who remove their own wires are usually alcohol or other drug addicted </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So you &quot;deglove&quot; the forehead down to the eyes, fix the underlying issue then stick the forehead back, and things heal up fine? That's actually pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Do you do all three areas separately if you need a full face reconstruction, or do you just peel off the entire face and do everything at once?</p>
