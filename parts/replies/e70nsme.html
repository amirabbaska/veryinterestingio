			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the subject of the question isn't exactly nocebo. Nocebo is an adverse effect that appears when anticipating that the treatment will cause it. OP suggested the lack of therapeutic effect (or diminished) because the patient anticipates no effect will happen. This is interesting and I don't even know if it is studied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that was just a poor example. What he means is that despite there being many natural sources of MSG people only demonstrate the symptoms when it is called out as an ingredient. It has, after all, been repeatedly proven to be a myth that it has any effect other than can be had from salt. It is a salt.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those people. It takes an enormous amount of anesthesia to knock me out. Doctors don't believe it when I tell them in advance, but when I'm there still awake when I should be out they do. The idea that this is tied to feeling pain is interesting since this is a HUGE, GIGANTIC, ENORMOUS fear of mine. I know I can do a Google search, but what's a good LEGITIMATE link to follow for more information on this effect. Maybe I can help myself somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Empirically, we observe people in a dental setting that heightened anxiety, pre-disposition to pain, past painful experiences do shape the perception of how they think the LA should work. Often, if extreme enough, they can get numb (meaning their sensory apparatus are objectively knocked out) but they can still feel pain. </p>
<p>The old practical advice among dentists to our younger colleagues is don't mess with a hot tooth, it will not get numb no matter how much LA is used. Compounded with beware the anxious patient with a raging toothache, calming them down or even sedating them with Diazepam prior to the appt can have an equal or greater effect on the LA effectiveness than the dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have the same problem, and I go in for injections and minor surgery under anesthesia about every two weeks or a month due to my chronic pain from multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>I warned the anesthesiologist when I first went in, maybe two years ago?  I didn't fall asleep, but my mouth was numb and I couldn't talk properly, thank $deity they saw me swallow and heard me grunt!  Since then, they've tried a bunch of &quot;new and old tricks&quot; to get me knocked out enough they can operate without me flipping out or remembering what happened (<em>huge</em> fear of mine).  Very long story <em>much</em> shorter: they started giving me a <em>bunch</em> of <a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/versed-midazolam-342907" target="_blank">Versed, prior to doing the surgery</a>.  It's my new favorite thing.  It has the &quot;double benefit&quot; of not only calming you down, but it also makes you <em>forget</em>!  </p>
<p>They anesthesiologist decided that because it helps the propofol work on me, he's got it in my chart to administer a minimum of 3.5mg prior to him seeing me in pre-op, then he decides based on how calm (or not) whether to give me more before he tries knocking me out.  Usually he does about 4-4.5mg, and only once did he do 5mg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had surgery and was so glad when they gave me the versed pre-op. Except nothing happened. Nothing happened with the second dose either. Versed usually hits me hard and fast. No clue why it didnt affect me at all recently. They ended up having to put me under with high doses of ketamine bc I have anesthesia issues. I always tell them, but they never believe me.</p></div>		</li>
