			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only correct if your definition of &quot;big&quot; is defined by mass. I think OP meant &quot;big&quot; in the sense of the radius of the objects. A black hole with a radius of 100km is going to be FAR more massive than say a solid rock planet with a radius of 1000km. Essentially, OP is asking something like how would a 1000km planet would fit in a 100km black hole. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If the matter that is about to enter the black hole is bigger than the black hole... THEN IT's ALREADY ANOTHER BLACK HOLE!</p>

<p>Even then, black holes aren't necessarily more massive than other objects. A 10 solar mass black hole is both smaller and less massive than a 20 solar mass star. It's just much more dense.</p></div>		</li>
