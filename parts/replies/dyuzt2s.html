			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazed this isnt higher up. Cant use infrared or uv because the atmosphere is opque to those frequencies. Not enough xrays and higher to be useful. Radio waves are too fat. Leaves visible doesnt it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I replied to another comment some snakes do utilise a part of the IR spectrum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes</a> . In the other end we find many animals using part of the ultraviolet spectrum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy</a> for example the kestrel is capable of detecting vole urine markings thanks to seeing in the UV part of the spectrum <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/373425a0" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/373425a0</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but those are fairly unusual. Visible light is still evolutionâ€™s low hanging fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't include the IR sensing of snakes, since the original question related to seeing, and that's more like feeling, but from the graph, you can see that the there is a significant amount of IR that does get through.</p>
<p>Since warm blooded animals are essentially self contained light sources (a bit like an anglerfish), you could develop vision just to detect that. It's a bit trickier when you're warm blooded, since your own radiation would normally drown out the signal. You'd probably need to develop some sort of cooling for the system. That valley of atmospheric transparency at around 10 micrometers is right around the same wavelength as the peak black body radiation of a human.</p>
<p>Certainly, there's advantages to broadening the spectrum, but we grabbed this general area because it was what was available.</p>
<p>Other posters have highlighted the fact that when these systems developed, they were underwater, which makes those lower frequencies even less visible.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water#/media/File:Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png" target="_blank">Absorbtion</a> for water. As you can see, in that environment (underwater), the 10 micrometer range is no longer useful.</p></div>		</li>
