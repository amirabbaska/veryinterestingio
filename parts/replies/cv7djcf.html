<p>How is it that GM is only paying 2 billion for killing almost 200 people, and VW may have to pay 9x that for fudging some numbers? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The VW thing isn't close to being settled at this point.  They face fines up to $37.5k per vehicle, so $18 billion is their likely cap, based on currently available info.  However, there's a difference between what GM and VW did here.  GM suffered from a defect in the ignition system that caused problems.  They eventually issued a recall, and for anyone who didn't suffer an accident from the ignition system failure it was nothing more than a free repair.  Divide $2 billion by 200 deaths and that's $10 million per death.</p>
<p>VW, on the other hand, deliberately set out to break the law and conceal that from the federal government.  This situation isn't the result of an unfortunate defect, it is the result of intentional lawbreaking.  While nobody has been killed by this, the owners of every one of the 482k affected vehicles will suffer a loss from this.  For starters, for a number of years they thought that they were driving a &quot;clean diesel&quot; vehicle that was actually putting out up to 40x the amount of pollutants permitted by law.  Secondly, when they get the recall fix applied to their car they will suffer decreased performance, decreased fuel economy, and potentially increased maintenance costs to the emissions systems.  Thirdly, because of the situation they will likely suffer a decrease in the resale value of their vehicle.  Every owner of one of these vehicles will be taking some form of financial loss from it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... I have got to say that this seems far worse than what GM did.  Even if GM tried to cover up or downplay their error, the error was still unintentional.  To build the car to deliberately break the law though... that is crazy.  Honestly, I am completely blown away that a big company would try something so utterly illegal in the US.</p>
<p>I'll be really curious to see where the investigation leads.  While on its face it does look deliberate, VW might not have actually known.  I could envision a solitary engineer or a single team writing the code to get the damn thing to pass and not telling anyone.  I am dying to know if this was a known conspiracy to break the law within the company, or a loan team or engineer.</p>
<p>Regardless, I personally think that someone should go to jail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive been thinking about this, and I don't think it's possible there was rogue engineering going on. The cars wouldn't have been legally certified if that algorithm that detected that the car was being smog-tested didn't work perfectly. There had to be a coordination with marketing somewhere because the cars' brand image was so closely linked to MPG and environmentally sound tech. And there had to be a lot of spec and design work on top of the coding, because German engineers. And then it was all handed off who knows how many times, because there had to be some turnover on the various teams over 7 years of perpetrating this fraud.  I actually think people should go to jail for this, and it should be easy to figure out who from the paper trail. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  Someone already posted on this forum that their local VW dealer was not accepting TDIs as trade-ins until the situation was resolved.  If someone has one that they really need to sell and no dealers will take it, then you might score a deal as the option of last resort.  But probably not, because if they can hold on for a few months instead of panicking then they probably will know what the fix is and people will start buying them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, private party prices may go up.  VW has stopped selling all 2015 and 2016 models TDIs in the U.S. until this is resolved, so with a drop in supply you could see a price jump.  Personally, I think that anyone who buys a TDI today needs their head checked.  The smart move is to wait and see exactly what impact the fix that VW is working on will have on the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it also has to do with the fact that there are clear well defined fines for messing with emissions. Think of it like a speeding ticket. You get caught there is a clear fine. Sure you can go to court and negotiate a reduction in the fine but it is a clear fine. Same thing here. There is a clear fine per infraction. When you take into account that each vehicle sold was another infraction, it adds up quick. </p>
<p>With GM it wasn't a blatant cheating to break the law.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because GM made a mistake that no one anticipated, related to heavy weight on a key ring that could disengage the ignition suddenly and lock the car. No one figured out this was going on for literally years, least of all GM.</p>
<p>That is an engineering mistake, totally different from what VW did. VW didn't make a mistake at all, they very purposefully and intentionally cheated the government testing. The whole reason the fines are so high is that the hope is by having exorbitant penalties for cheating it will be a disincentive to cheat.</p></div>		</li>
