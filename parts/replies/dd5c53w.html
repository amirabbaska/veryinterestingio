<p>I don't think a call is any more important than signing the petition online... unless you are donor or well known (for courtesy's sake).</p>

<p>i've generally heard that calls are considered more important, because it means there's a higher level of engagement (ie, they'll turn out to vote).</p>
<p>it's really easy to sign a petition, a bit harder to call, and a hand written letter even better,so that gets weighted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all eventually get put on a tally sheet.  'More engaging' might be true to a point, but unless its a ballot measure (OP didn't say) signing a petition (name, address, phone etc) has the same 'weight' as calling.  It increments the 'yay' or 'nay' column by one.</p></div>		</li>
