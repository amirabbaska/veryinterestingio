			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, the outer layer works as something like a porous membrane. Hot water expands this 'outer layer' allowing more water to get in, while cold water needs more time to get through this 'outer layer'. It might work, hypothetically. But could you really scrape the thin, hard outer layer of rice, pasta, and etc.? You can't.</p></div>		</li>
