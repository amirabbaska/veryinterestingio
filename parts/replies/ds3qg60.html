<p>What's amazing is that they were doing this in the late 60's. GPS wouldn't come online until the early 80's. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coupled with a <a href="http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/" target="_blank">Kalman Filter</a> and some sensor fusion you can get some pretty damn accurate state estimation.  Inertial guidance is still used everywhere even in the age of GPS because combining the two estimation methods can get you a better estimate than either one working on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking this, considering there are small commercial jammers which when fitted in cars can jam signals for a kilometre or more, it shouldn't be that difficult to design one that does it on a much larger scale. I suppose it would be used as a way of calibrating and double checking when and if available, but unlikely to be the primary source of navigation.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the ongoing storyline in big bang with their quantum guidance system, they specifically talk about its use in missiles and being a small accurate gyroscope, essentially the holy grail of guidance systems. </p></div>		</li>
