			<div class="markdown"><p>It's generally been a position you only get after rising through the ranks for decades. There were times were the position could be gained through political connections, nepotism, or even outright bought, but most of the time people were old by the time the had that much power or money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just me, but if I was in the position to buy the Pope-hood, rather than being Pope myself, I'd have my son do it. Or grandson if he were old enough. Seems like a better way to secure your policies and beliefs for a longer period. And if you can squeeze 40+ years out of a young Pope, you'd have a good chance to influence a culture shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pope is supposed to be <em>the</em> authority on the Catholic bible. What he says goes because he is supposed to have read and studied the Bible more than any person in the Vatican. Way back the title of Pope was more synonymous with being the ear of God. People believed that the Pope could personally speak to God and God spoke to him. This allowed the Pope's of past to wield the fear of a wrathful God, preaching fire and brimstone to the populace and scaring the publunc into obedience. At his disposal are thousands of priests ready and eager to do God's work, some so eager that breaking a few commandments to do it was not an issue.</p></div>		</li>
