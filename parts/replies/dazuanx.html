			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a fad diet, like avoiding carbs, avoiding fats, avoiding other things than fats, etc. that are supposed to be healthier and magically lead to weight loss. Some people got it in their heads that everything is better as nature supplies it, and some other people extended that to cooking. There's absolutely no scientific basis behind it, and it'll die off as soon as the next fad hits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, but I thought humans developed longer guts not shorter so we could absorb more nutrients from our higher energy diet? This is why we tend to have a much longer time between eating something and it making its way out the other side. Also since our food is cooked it is less likely to harbour bacteria that will cause us harm so it is safer to keep it inside longer, unlike say a dog that has a very short digestive tract because they tend to eat rotten meat and need to get it through quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up neurocysticercosis on Wikipedia. That's just one of a million horrible things you can get from eating raw meat regardless of whether it's fresh. Don't do it unless it's from a reliable source.</p></div>		</li>
