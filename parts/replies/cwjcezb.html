			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't save very much energy. Some time ago I did the math on this and found that freezing 1 liter of water from room temperature to -20C costs less than one penny worth of electricity. The cost of cooling food from, say, 70C to a standard refrigeration temperature of about 2C would probably be in the same ballpark, per weight of food (and it's not often you're refrigerating more than a few kilograms of food at once anyway). Also, as I recall, the more other cold stuff you already have in the fridge, the more energy-efficient it'll be to cool a new item placed in the fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A refrigerator can cool itself to the point of literally freezing itself to death if it's thermostat were to deem it necessary. Putting half a warm sandwich in it will initially raise the internal temperature but it won't take long for the unit to counteract that change. Opening the door will likely cause more cooling loss than the hot food you opened the door for. Obviously I am describing the situation most people would run into. Very few of us will be bringing home a steaming hot vat of clam chowder as restaurant leftovers, in which case you probably already know what to do since you are apparently operating a soup kitchen out of your home. </p>
<p>Just to provide credibility, I am an HVAC technician for the Air Force. Refrigerators are kinda my thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific heat of water is over 4 times the specific heat of air, and 20 cubic feet of air has the same mass as about 24.4 ounces of water. Cooling all of the air in your average household fridge from room temperature would use less energy than cooling an 8 oz glass of water from the same temperature. I doubt opening a fridge uses nearly as much energy as cooling the food.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main reason people sometimes do this is if the food is still hot to the extent it would warm up the rest of the fridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, people do it because otherwise the item will produce a lot of condensation leaving your food with puddles of water.</p></div>		</li>
