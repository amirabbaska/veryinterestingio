			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that the high standards for FCC certification were created in response to some very public incidents involving RF interference causing problems.  For example, if you had a pacemaker in the late 70s / early 80s, a microwave oven could make your heart stop.</p>
<p>Basically, the regulations were reasonable at the time they were written.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that once cellphones and laptops became widespread, the relevant authorities were already well aware that those devices didn't cause any problems.</p>
<p>There is very straight foward evidence for this: they didn't take away your devices when boarding the plane. With virtually everyone on the plane carring a cellphone in their pocket, they knew those rules will be broken regularly. But because everyone knew it wasn't a security risk, they didn't do anything about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't the regulations now jut still in place to keep a comfortable silence in the plane? I'd say 100+ people having 2 and half hour long cell phone conversations loud enough to be heard over jet engines would be pretty terrible for everyone involved...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weren't old GSM cell phones especially obnoxious when it came to radio interference? You could put an old GSM cell phone next to an FM radio, and you could tell it was about to ring when you heard the &quot;BZZZT-BZZZT-BZZZT BZZT-BZZT BZZT-BZZT&quot; screwing with your music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said may be true for GA but in commercial aviation the main reason they did away with rules is better shielding of aircraft components. I've been involved with the testing for the STCs and personally seen earlier model cockpit displays (not gauges) go blank from interference. Now all airlines that allow PEDs have a list of components that were found susceptible to interference and those must be of the newer variety which have been tested to show they will not be negatively affected.</p>
<p>When we're retrofitting an aircraft the very first thing we do is check p/n's and replace any not on the list.  </p></div>		</li>
