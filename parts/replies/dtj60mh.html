			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a sheep rancher and sheep definitely show little sign of disease or injury, whether they intentionally &quot;hide&quot; it or not. Sheep and cattle diseases are quite closely studied as they directly affect profitability.</p>
<p>Those with casual or hobby exposure to the sheep industry often claim that sheep die readily with little provocation. However those who keep sheep know that what actually happens is that a sheep can be in incredibly poor shape before it's apparent that it has a problem. Then it suddenly expires.</p>
<p>A good example is clostridial disease in sheep, which a sheep will usually show no symptoms of until hours before death. Upon opening up the animal the affected organs will often be already rotting or liquefied, the animal having been sick for quite some time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  In fact most prey animals don't want to look sick, so if you see one looking sick you know it was probably sick for days earlier and just trying to look tough.</p>
<p>I lost a llama that way.  He was super playful the day before... but I found him down and he wouldn't get up - It was pneumonia (common in livestock where I live now that winter weather is crazy up and down.. thanks climate change).. anyhow we got the vet out immediately but it was too late. </p>
<p>The vet even said that he likely was trying extra hard the day before to look strong and healthy rather than appearing weak.  He wouldn't have known I could have helped him and he just didn't want to get eaten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this something that could be detected with semi regular (quarterly/monthly) blood tests? I wonder if they could implement a something like human diabetes test to monitor the health sheep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately most diseases that cause large losses of sheep are preventable by vaccine these days. A common vaccine is the 8-way which covers most lethal sheep and cattle diseases together. These diseases only show up when the vaccine fails to protect an animal.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing about sheep is that an individual is only worth about $200, which is less than a vet visit. So flock health tends to be holistic and preventative rather than individual and reactive, i.e. vaccines, dewormers, vitamins and minerals, good quality feed. </p>
<p>Metabolic ills that could be considered similar to a diabetes-type syndrome are usually detected when a sheep cannot get up. At this point diagnosis and treatment again must occur within the hour or the sheep is doomed. However most can be saved with a good inventory of SQ electrolytes. Blood tests would work for vitamin and mineral status but it's considered more effective and easier just to supplement them with excess mineral.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact, though I'm sure many already know this, but it's worth pointing out that basically every one of the biggest diseases we deal with are diseases spread and maintained in animal populations. </p>

<p>Excellent post. I'd also point out, if not obvious, humans live in close proximity to animals (livestock, pets), facilitating viruses (and bacteria) jumping to a new species (us) without resistance. It's generally not in a pathogen's evolutionary interest to kill its host.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty common in cats. Since they're both predator and prey, they tend not to act sick, and merely show signs of lethargy to people paying a lot of attention. If they're VERY sick, they hide, which is why older outdoor cats sometimes just go missing and never show back up. </p></div>		</li>
