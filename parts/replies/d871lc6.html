			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely, you don't have a good sense of what's actually on pitch, and you don't <em>hear</em> it being on pitch, you just <em>think</em> it's on pitch. Or because you're much more nasally than you think, or just have a bad vocal tone that you can't perceive from inside your head. </p>
<p>Record yourself singing along to something in a way where you can clearly hear the &quot;correct&quot; pitch and your voice singing along, and play it back. See if you're actually on-pitch, and just sounding bad, or whether you're off pitch and just don't have the skill to be able to sing a pure pitch. </p>
<p>My mom, for instance, is absolutely tone-deaf. She thinks she's singing a note and she's miles off. She doesn't hear it correct in her head, she just knows it's a high note, and she's signing a high note, so it's probably close (it isn't).</p>
<p>Not everyone has perfect pitch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're talking about is sometimes called &quot;babble.&quot; People start their musical education babbling in both a rhythmic and tonal sense; that's why a lot of younger children can't easily stay on beat, or miss a beat.  It takes practice to get out of that habit, and regular practice after leaving your school's music program helps your sense of tone.</p>
<p>However, this practice also has to be focused on maintaining tone.  Think karaoke as opposed to humming absent-mindedly to the radio during your morning commute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a separate note- being able to match a pitch is not &quot;perfect pitch&quot;. Perfect pitch is being able to identify a note without a reference pitch. For example, you hear a door squeak and you can tell what note (A, B, C, etc) it was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say he just hasn't spent much effort learning to hear pitches well. Very, very few people are actually tone-deaf. Sounds like your mom can tell that a note is high or low, or that the pitch went up or down, so she isn't tone-deaf, she probably just doesn't have much natural ability and doesn't care that deeply about improving on it. Almost everyone can train their ear and their voice with time and practice, though. Your mom will never star in an opera, but I would strongly bet she could learn to carry a tune pretty well if she dedicated herself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if your radio is too loud to hear yourself sing it can be hard to sing in tune. I'm a decent singer but been a musician all my life so if anything is off key in the slightest it's like fingernails on a chalkboard to me.</p>
<p>I usually only sing a few songs each gig as I'm a guitar player not the lead singer but I generally have the sound man turn up my vocal monitor before I sing. If you can't properly hear yourself it's hard to make adjustments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you speak, you're hearing several things. You're hearing your voice from out of your mouth reflected back at you, which is the same thing everyone else hears when you speak. But you're ALSO hearing your voice reverberating inside your skull and body. This is a much deeper sound, and nobody but you can hear it. You can actually get a decent idea of what it sounds like by taking normally and plugging your ears, this partially isolates it.</p>
<p>So every single time you have spoken in your whole life, you have heard that extra deep copy of your voice layered on top of your real voice. The only way it's even <em>possible</em> to hear your own real voice the way everybody else in the world does is by recording it, so for most of human history we could never hear our own real voices.</p>
<p>It sounds strange because it's not what you're used to, it's not the voice you hear every time you open your mouth, and it's unexpected. The more you record, the more comfortable you will get with how you sound and the better you will be at understanding how to control your voice as <em>others</em> hear it instead of just how you do.</p>
<p>Or there's a problem with your recording setup, but that's a whole other can of worms. Have you tried changing the distance between your mic and mouth? Is your gain staging set up well? Are you trying to use a garbage cheap mic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your voice doesn't sound the way you perceive it to because a lot of what you're hearing of yourself is vibrations in your own body - not your voice as it would echo back to your ears</p>
<p>This explains that: <a href="https://youtu.be/eWLWOSgYlG8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/eWLWOSgYlG8</a></p>
<p>It's somewhat similar to looking at your reflection in the mirror compared to a picture of yourself</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this is why people singing have a speaker pointed right back at them.  They hear there own voice from the same source the crowd heard it from?? It's called a monitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for the monitor is so that the singer can hear themselves over the sound of the crowd, and over the sound of the other performers on the stage. Have you ever tried to sing while at a concert, or in your car with the music up really loud, and you can't hear yourself? If you can't hear yourself, you try to sing louder, which can A) wear out your voice quickly, which is bad for a 2 hour concert. or B) It can ruin the quality of your voice, which is bad for a singer, obviously. </p>
<p>It also helps to combat timing issues. A singer might have a strange sounding &quot;mix&quot; in their monitor where their voice is very loud, and the drums are loud, in order to keep time with the song, and the guitars and keys are much lower because they aren't as important to their ability to perform. It also combats sync issues caused by hearing the music as it comes out of the main speakers, travels out, bounces off the back wall, and then comes back to the stage with a delay. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my small amount of experience, when I've sung with amplification in a large space, the sound that's projected out will bounce back at you and all you can hear is your own voice, but a split second behind. It's hard to hear anything accurately. Maybe the speaker is for groups or individuals that don't have an ear piece to balance out the reverb effect?</p></div>		</li>
