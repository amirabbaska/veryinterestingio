			<div class="markdown"><p>This!  I have no interest in newer drugs because warfarin works for me. 7 years now with no issues.  I eat what I want and I drink what I want and I have zero problems with it. I can test at home. It's not an inconvenience for me at all.  I like knowing the long term effects of warfarin, and that just not knowledge we have on a lot of newer medications. </p>
<p>My mother, father, grandfather, and ridiculous amount of extended family are all doing just fine with warfarin also. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been on warfarin for 20 years. My PT/INR is very stable no matter what I eat. The only time it got really messed up is when I had a stomach bug and had diarrhea and could barely eat for a week. My doctor's office finally has a lab tech on duty 4 mornings a week, and they're 5 minutes away so blood work is easy to do now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for aged care facilities and there are a lot of residents on warfarin who have been on it for many years. As long as you can keep your diet consistent or understand vitamin K vegetables, the monitoring and INR tests aren't so bad. If anything, there is a direct method of adjusting your levels. </p>
<p>I think if you're used to it and can eat a consistent diet, the dose you are on will reflect that and be easily maintained/stable. </p></div>		</li>
