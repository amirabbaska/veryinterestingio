			<div class="markdown"><p>For the time being we have no evidence for partial nor full transits arising from Prox b.  The method we used to detect the planet was by measuring the velocity of the star, its motion towards and away from us, as the star and planet orbit around a common center of mass, the so called Doppler Wobble method.  However, to investigate if the signal we had detected was due to the activity of the star, we also observed Proxima with optical telescopes to measure any brightness changes that would indicate changing magnetic activity levels on the star.  The problem with these observations to search for transits are that the transit events only happen at very specific times, and are very short events when compared to the full orbital period of the planet.  Therefore, we did not have the measurements to detect any evidence of a transit, and to do so is one of the future lines of research we will make to better understand the planet.  Other teams have also searched for planetary transits from possible planets orbiting Proxima, and continue to do so, with no positive results published as yet!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it possible to detect and deconvolute multiple planets in a single system with this method? </p>
<p>Also, I often wonder how excited we'd be to discover a planet like Mars around another star. Similar to Earth in size and in the extended CHZ... and still... seemingly sterile. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While we wait for the team with much better insight:</p>
<p>Just from <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v536/n7617/full/nature19106.html" target="_blank">the paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No significant transit signal was found down to a depth of about 5%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That said, if the planet had Earth's density, its transit depth would be 0.5%, so it appears they weren't sensitive enough to decide whether or not it transits. (The odds of transit are only 1.5% though, so don't hold your breath.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ifweassume.com/2016/08/flares-on-proxima-cen.html" target="_blank">Complicating the search</a> for transits though is that the star <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-64YdiMtu2tI/V7zrGt3f00I/AAAAAAAACa4/HjwwQYCDOAExW4i4zjSeAw3-9EzQZYXegCLcB/s640/rate_fig.png" target="_blank">randomly flares every ~20 minutes</a> at that same 0.5% brightness, which will make it very hard to find the hidden transits if they exist.</p></div>		</li>

But not everything is going around on the same plane. Our solar system is tilted relative to the galactic plane. Not everything in our solar system orbits in the same plane either. Pluto is a good example of this since its orbit is very far from the general plane of our solar system.<br />
So everything is all jumbled up. Some planets orbit their stars so they pass in front of their stars from our perspective. Some orbit so they'll never ever pass in front of their stars from our perspective. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an extremely common belief that has no basis on reality at all. All the stars rotate around the galactic center, but their own rotational axis are essentially random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An extrasolar transit occurs when a planet's orbital plane places it between its star and Earth. From our point of view, a planet's orbit can be between zero degrees (think Saturn's rings viewed side-on) and ninety degrees (think Saturn's rings viewed from above its poles). </p>
<p>Transits are only possible when the planet's orbit is very close to zero degrees, because otherwise it will never cross the face of the star, from our perspective. (For relatively small stars with either relatively large or relatively near planets, the possible transit angle is much higher.) </p>
<p>And since orbital planes are (as far as I know) essentially distributed randomly, this means you have to measure the light from many, many stars to find transits for just a few. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best hope to figure out if the planet has an atmosphere and/or what's in it with current telescopes is if it transits. That means you can look at what the starlight looks like normally and then again when the planet transits in front. If you're super careful, you can then figure out which part of the starlight <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Sodium_in_atmosphere_of_exoplanet_HD_209458.jpg/440px-Sodium_in_atmosphere_of_exoplanet_HD_209458.jpg" target="_blank">gets absorbed</a> by the planet's atmosphere and thus what it's made of.</p>
<p>Without transits, your only real hope to get the atmosphere is to wait for us to take a direct image of the planet, which means waiting 20-40 years for the ginormous telescopes plus some currently experimental fancy instrumentation (coronagraphs). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not versed in this field. That said, my understanding is that a transit is when the planet travels between its star and (in this case) Earth. Like an eclipse, but with a planet instead of the moon.</p>
<p>My guess is that the small &quot;transit depth&quot; other posters are talking about references how little of the brightness of the sun is blocked by the planet. This is presumably due to either the relative location of the planet's orbit or due to the size/density of the planet itself.</p></div>		</li>
