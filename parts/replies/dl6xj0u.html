			<div class="markdown"><p>So I skimmed through this review as I too would like to have an answer to this question, but this review mostly talks about the effects of intoxication and the affected brain areas/systems. Maybe I misunderstood OP's question but I believe he is more interested in the long-term effects of (binge)drinking during the 18-24 age range. Questions such as: are there, and what kind of, memory deficits does consuming x amount of alcohol per week, on average result in? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm quite curious about this as well, like OP. I can, however, guarantee you one thing. If you drink enough, you definitely won't remember what happened the next day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hard part about designing a study to test that is, A, there are a ton of variables over that period of time, and B, how are you supposed to know what their memory would have been had they not drank in order to say that it declined, and C, you have to get a lot of people to help in this study.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tldr;
They don't really know how bad it is for humans but it's bad for rodents and other lab animals.  This suggests it's bad for us too, yet they don't really know and need to do more research.</p>
<p>So basically avoid binge drinking.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the review was a good summary of several studies some of which directly pertained to the question. Many of the studies were conducted on rats, so comparing that to a long term case study on humans in &quot;late adolescent&quot; (as the review defined the 18-25 age group) might give a more concrete insight. Here's a bit that pertains to the question from review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One study conducted with young adults ages 21 to 29 found that intoxicated study participants could recall items on word lists immediately after the lists were presented, but they had greater difficulty recalling the information 20 minutes later (Acheson et al. 1998). Interestingly, this effect was much more powerful in the younger subjects in this age group—that is, people in their early twenties. In addition, alcohol particularly affects the ability to form explicit memories—that is, memories of facts (e.g., names and phone numbers) or events (e.g., what the drinker did the previous night). Because different brain areas play a role in the formation of different types of memories, this pattern of alcohol-related memory impairment allows researchers to make assumptions about the brain regions that are most affected by alcohol. Thus, the pattern of memory impairment observed after intoxication is similar to that found in patients with damage to a brain area called the hippocampus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The review also mentions long term potentiation being affected after 1-2 drinks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, the study certainly suggests measurable damage, but I would be curious to see how that translates into real world impact. Alcohol consumption has been a nearly universal part of human societies for thousands of years, and it seems like massive long term harm from such small quantities of consumption would have become evident​ long before the modern era if it was significantly observable outside of controlled scientific tests.</p></div>		</li>
