			<div class="markdown"><p>Little history lesson for you all, AA guns have been used against infantry</p>
<p>There was actually a Canadian tank, the skink anti aircraft tank, which was essentially 4 AA guns mounted on a modified Sherman chassis (specifically a Canadian grizzly). It was designed to combat the Luftwaffe but was only finished in 1944. Three of them were constructed but by this time the German airforce had been almost entirely disintegrated and was no longer a threat so the Canadians sent one of the skinks to Europe to support infantry and allied troops report it being significantly effective against Germans. I guess there is something very comforting in fighting alongside a mobile armoured long range fully automatic shotgun loaded with explosive shells.</p></div>		</li>

The Soviet ZSU-23-4 has this problem. &quot;Runaway gun&quot;, they call it. Absolutely terrifying when it's &gt;900 rounds of 23mm high explosive per minute that's taking off on you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do some scary things with high explosive artillery ammunition nowadays still as well. The emergency defense of an artillery section being attacked by infantry or vehicles is to turn the cannon on them, as long as they're far enough away still (let's say minimum of 400-600 meters). The math on how long it takes the rounds to arrive on target is precise enough to make the HE rounds blow up literally right over their heads. Direct fire timed fuze HE rounds is for whatever reason called &quot;killer junior&quot; by American artillerymen. White phosphorous rounds can also be used to terrifying effect if one were so inclined. &quot;Shake and bake&quot; is a terrifying combination of HE and WP rounds. Not that a civilized person would ever use such a thing, or course...</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a really good trilogy of books about an American tank platoon in a second Korean War that was very heavily researched and included a lot of notes and input from guys who served on tanks and even from guys who commanded the US Army Forces Korea.</p>
<p>In the last book the tanks are pushing into North Korea for a counterattack and get swarmed in an ambush by irregular fighters (armed civilians) and in desperation the platoon leader launches white phosphorus at them. He mentally notes that if the press knew about this he'd get labelled a war criminal but in so desperate a moment the only alternative was to be killed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VT fuzes, pioneered by British but first manufactured by Americans were a huge innovation in both anti-air and conventional artillery for this reason. It allowed firing fragmentation anti-aircraft projectiles without needing to set a time, and to achieve excellent air bursts from conventional artillery projectiles with only a rough estimate of time. For conventional timed fuzes, an observer has to adjust height of burst and it can take multiple adjust fires before a satisfactory solution is achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My great grandfather invented a mercury based proximity fuse for flak that triggered from the plane engine ... not sure if it got much use, but he was so upset about causing loss of life that in the next war, he invented a charged system for throwing barbed wire across a line so men wouldn't have to run with a spool and basically be target practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Germans used flak guns against the 82nd and allied infantry during the battles in the Ardenne. Tanks and armor couldnt maneuver through the forest, and the Germans had secured all the roads. The only Allied option was tactical infatry inserted to upset the German air defenses and provide a diversion for the larger forces to come in after. The flak also blew up the trees, which created additional deadly shrapnel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. They were using small, mobile field artillery and a flak gun. I think at that point the Germans had adapted the timed explosive technology from flak guns and adapted it inti a smaller payload for anti-infantry. The result was a small field artillery gun that could be timed or calibrated to detonate before it hit the ground. I dont know if they had that in the Ardenne, but I know they had some field artillery that was capable of that at some point.</p></div>		</li>
