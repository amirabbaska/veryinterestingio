			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me do you one better, this method will show you where shit is fucking up.</p>
<p><strong>This Assumes You Have Windows 7</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click Start</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type REL into the Search Box - Reliability History is what we're looking for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Reliability History</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the reports, there may be a lot of reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for the red, check the technical report, and click &quot;check for solution&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>Also, if you see something consistantly fucking up (e.g. daily fuckup from software, Office for one.) then you should remove/repair/reinstall the software.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The report also shows hardware errors</strong></p>
<p>Close all open windows, programs, etc...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click Start</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Run</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type CMD &amp; press enter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type SFC /SCANNOW (Let the scan run)</p>
</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Make sure you run CMD as Administrator(even if you have Admin rights, you may have to click 'run as administrator'</p>
<p>Right click on Desktop</p>
<p>Click 'New'</p>
<p>Select Shortcut</p>
<p>Type CMD &gt; Next, Next, Okay</p>
<p>Right click CMD shortcut and select, &quot;Run as administrator&quot;</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Click Start</p>
<p>Type CMD (In search bar)</p>
<p>Right-click and select, &quot;Run as administrator&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone want to know how to fix a BSOD, Windows Recovery Loop, Registry Failure (missing system32 error) on start-up? It's simple and literally takes 5 minutes, the fix clears BSOD and startup errors 9 out of 10 times.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong> - Do you want the XP fix or the Windows 7 fix? Windows 7 handles registry backups differently than how XP manages it. Also, there's a CMD way to do it on boot with a batch file that will go through and replace the registry hives (DEFAULT, SAM, SECURITY, SOFTWARE - 9 out of 10 times just restoring the SOFTWARE &amp; SECURITY registry hive with a known previous working hive will clear your stop error. When you boot up to windows (after fixing registry) you would want to reboot (to apply the fix and make sure it boots up) and then run SFC /SCANNOW</p>
<p>REMEMBER! You can seriously fuck shit up if you do not have a clue as to how the registry works. One change can be a huge headache. Only perform work in the registry after backing up your registry in-whole. <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Manual+Registry+Restore+Windows+Xp" target="_blank">Google Works Also</a></p>
<p>And not all stop-errors mean exactly what they say, you will have stop-errors saying there's a failure in a piece of hardware, but, most of the time it's a fucked DLL and the system can't find it. What do you do? Restore the fucking registry to be sure it's software not hardware related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skimming through the comments, I don't see anyone explaining <em>why</em> this works.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why your computer will slow down over time. First, your computer has a pre-determined resource limit. Every piece of software you download could potentially eat up more and more resources. Over time you download things like Java, Adobe Reader, Google Chrome, an Anti-Virus (I recommend Microsoft Security Essentials), Skype, and various other programs. The reason that the instructions /u/WhyIsTheNamesGone works is because it tells Windows not to run those programs on start-up. This means you can still use those programs, but they wont turn on in the background when your computer first turns on (more often than not, programs like iTunes starting up in the background is more of a convenience than a hassle unless you're really limited on system resources).</p>
<p>The second reason that computers generally slow down over time is because software developers are constantly evolving their software to have more convenience and excellent features. You might be using the same three programs (Google Chrome, Microsoft Office, and Adobe Reader, let's say) over the period of 5 years, but during those 5 years those programs slowly take up more system resources. Eventually, you're the person going to an IT tech (my job) and asking why you can't install Firefox on your Power PC MacBook running OS X 10.4 or why your desktop with 516MB of RAM is running so slowly.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Your computer slows over time because of an increasing collection of small and convenient programs in the background and because software developers upgrade your programs to have more convenience features that take up more software resources</strong> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perceived Value. </p>
<p>As an independent tech for almost a decade, I have found that keeping in line with the expectations of the client is not easy. Charging too much will drive people away, but that is preferred over charging too little. Let me explain: My retail rate is $90/hr but I almost never charge that rate. Usually I charge around $60-75/hr. Problems arise when I get to $45/hr. It is what I call the 'Good Deed' realm. As we all know, 'no good deed goes unpunished', and I think the reason lies entirely in 'perceived value'. At or below this level the expectations of the client shoot through the roof, all accountability for their own actions evaporates, and blaming, violent, emotional tirades pour forth with absolutely no effort to check themselves or remember that I am a human who is trying their best to help them within the limitations of their budget. I have recorded phone messages of incoherently screaming death threats. Really. Death threats.</p>
<p>THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I CHARGE $45 OR LESS PER HOUR. <del>ALMOST</del> EVERY TIME.</p>
<p>When I charge full rates I always get personal respect and effort on the part of the client to adapt and learn. </p>
<p>So when I seem to have no sympathy, it is because I have your best interests in mind. You will value my services more if you pay more for them, and you will listen to my advice and attempt to learn something toward functional self-sustaining technology skills.</p>
<p>It's always the nice ones, too. Protect yourself: Charge full rate. Make them pay up front. Everyone will be happier. </p>
<p>Sometimes a client will be stupefied, saying, &quot;You're really going to walk out my front door with my computer and a check for $225?&quot; To which I reply, &quot;Yup. Once we start in, we are committed. See ya in a couple days and we'll sit down and spend some time getting you comfortable with your new system.&quot; I am asking them to step on the path or step off. Their financial investment will mirror their own personal commitment whether they are aware of that fact or not.</p>
<p>So, when dragging Grandma into the 21st century by converting her XP box, don't tell her Linux is free. Tell her that uncountable thousands of human hours have gone into the development of this modern operating system just so it can benefit her. Tell her that your specific and extensive training in this field, which must be monetarily compensated, is allowing you to help her. Tell her to make the check out to you personally, that your time is painfully expensive... but don't tell her that she is setting the price of her perceived value of the work you are doing. You will both be happier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, most of them are.  You see as a PC tech, I see it every day.  You can even tell them what you are doing, show them, and a month later they are back to have you do it again.</p>
<p>Remember - PC repair is aimed at those people who dont' know ANYTHING about computers, most people that know even a little bit are capable of fixing spyware and slow downs themselves.</p>
<p>I've literally had people get a tear and hug me after spending 3 minutes &quot;tuning up&quot; a PC and they gladly hand over their 50 dollars.</p>
<p>It's the same thing as paying anyone to do anthing that you don't know how to do yourself, stop trying to make it out like PC repair shops are rippign people off, they aren't, 5 minutes on google and they could do it themselves, these are stupid people that dont' even want to try themselves so they gladly pay.</p></div>		</li>
