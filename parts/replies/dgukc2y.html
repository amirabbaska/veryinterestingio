			<div class="markdown"><p>Cytokines are complex parts of the immune system. They tend to be like the ring master of a circus. They signal other immune cells to come in and can affect how strong or permeable the blood vessel wall is. In very simple terms, damage to the skin or organ --&gt; immune system cells triggered --&gt; release all sorts of stuff (cells to fight infection, cells to close a hole in the skin, modulate cancer cells, etc) including cytokines. Cytokines are absolutely fascinating! </p>
