			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all things with artificial sweetener are overly sweet. Regular coke is WAY sweeter than diet Coke, for example. I can't tolerate regular coke (unless it has booze in it).</p></div>		</li>

Of course it was gross, but after a month or so your taste buds actually get used to it and it reversed the taste effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: diet coke is actually a different flavor than coke. Coke Zero is the 0-calorie version of Coca-Cola Classic (it's not simply sweeter) whereas diet coke is the 0-calorie version of New Coke, a product made to combat the success of Pepsi when it launched.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought some pure sucralose powder to use for baking and stuff, and  took a tiny bit on my finger, dusted it off, and then tasted what remained. It was the sweetest thing I'd ever tasted and I'd almost describe it as painful (no bitter aftertaste or anything either, just pure sweetness). I'm pretty sure you would have found that to taste sweet as well. Also, have you tried Pepsi Max? I think it's the best tasting cola soft drink, including the real sugar ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you are simply less receptive to those tastes. Some people don't eat olives cause they taste bitter. They don't taste bitter to me though, but on the other hand aspartame tastes bitter-sour a second after the sweet tastes hits and Stevia taste like extremely sweet liquorice. </p>
<p>There's actually quite some variation in how people taste stuff like Cilantro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC pretty limited. They don't cause any health negatives inherently. However, people have suggested they have certain properties that can make eating right harder, even if they don't actually do anything bad to you - namely that consuming artificial sweeteners can cause you to crave actual satiation, leading to increased calorie consumption anyway because you didn't get satiation from zero calorie sweetener.</p>
<p>Personally... I dunno, I'm not inclined to agree. Switching from soda to diet soda and water flavoring (e.g., Mio) made me lose 20 pounds right quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think artificial sweeteners are great.</p>
<p>Due to evolutionary reasons we crave sweet stuff and when it's available in abundance you have to constantly fight to urge to not overeat on it.</p>
<p>With artificial sweeteners this problem does not exist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, as someone who drank loads (compared to the norm where I'm from  at least) of coke to then switching to coke zero I now feel much healthier (I made the switch some time last fall) and I was actually able to consume much less of it pretty quickly. The sugar version really messed with my mood too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a study in 1987 that suggested aspartame consumption led to an increased susceptibility to seizures in people who suffer epilepsy.</p>
<p>It's probably the only negative I agree with. A lot of epileptic people notice a link to the amount of aspartame they consume and the seizures they have.</p></div>		</li>
