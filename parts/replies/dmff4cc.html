<p>See capped bottle of beer? No bubbles. See uncapped bottle of beer? Pressure is released, bubbles! Now picture the beer as your blood. Deep water is under pressure, rising up uncaps your bottle. Bubbles! In your blood! Not yay!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen makes up almost 70 percent of the atmosphere. Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide are bound to the hemoglobin on the red blood cells for transport, so it's not really the same as free gaseous N2 (which does not bind to hemoglobin and is simply dissolved into the blood.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be because N2 is pretty inert (it doesn't react with anything) our bodies don't metabolize much nitrogen in the form of N2. O2 and CO2 are part of cellular respiration and have very high solubility in blood. So it would take very low pressure i.e high altitude to get those molecules to come out of solution.</p></div>		</li>
