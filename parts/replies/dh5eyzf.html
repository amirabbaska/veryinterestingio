<p>Pressure cookers heat water into pressurized steam, but don't really circulate it.  As steam transfers heat better than air a pressure cooker is faster than an oven for many things.</p>

<p>Technically pressure cooker still cooks food by heating water and let the water transfer heat. Since the food container is pressurized, water doesn't boil at 100°C/212°F and can be heated to a much higher temperature (while maintaining liquid state) as you increase pressure. Kind of like how oil fries food but without using oil. Steam is just by-product of heating up water, and is mainly used for increasing pressure, not heating the food.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Use &lt; 100% power to have the beam turn off/on to let the heat redistribute in the food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In higher end models it actually reduces the power output rather than turning it on/off for a &quot;lower&quot; power.</p></div>		</li>
