			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly true that &quot;only one tiny dot on a TV is on at any given time.&quot; In fact, on a CRT (cathode ray tube) the phosphors that produce light when struck by 15 kV electrons remain visibly lit for quite a while (10s of ms). This adds to the eye's &quot;persistence&quot; characteristic that makes bright flashes seem to last longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thing to do is to take a photo of a CRT television in action.(disclaimer I used a DSLR)</p>
<p>You can dial down the shutter speed to isolate the beam scanning and the persistence of the phosphor.</p>
<p>Did it some years ago and from what I remember I found it surprising at how small the illumination area is. IE the phosphor persistence is very small, only a fraction of each line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More likely the persistence appears low when the shutter speed is adjusted to capture the recent beam positions so that they appear well lit. The phosphors probably glow much longer at lower but perfectly useful levels, but you would need to be shooting an HDR shot with concurrent exposures to capture it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they were lit for 16.67 ms or more, a 60 Hz CRT would be flicker free, so tens of ms is definitely as exaggeration. (1 second / 60 = 16.67 ms) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because you always have a freshly lit bright area adjoined by a much dimmer area. For a CRT pixels are not simply lit or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Philo Farnsworth invented the technique of line-by-line dissection of an image in the 1920s.</p>
<p>The NTSC (council) came up with their eponymous standard to account for adding color to over-the-air TV signal in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Matt Parker has a good video explaining the math behind NTSC's 29.97 fps framerate (as well as what Europe did better with PAL): <a href="https://youtu.be/3GJUM6pCpew" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/3GJUM6pCpew</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the universe does care. There is an absolute minimum time interval in the universe,simply because there's a limit to the speed of light (energy) in a vacuum. Therefore time is a property of the universe, not a construct of man.</p>
<p>I don't remember the logic, but it was well-explained by a big-head (physicist) in a paper long ago.</p></div>		</li>
