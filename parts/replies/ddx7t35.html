			<div class="markdown"><p>J.K. Rowling didnt have a lot of power against the editors for the first couple books so they where changed slightly to fit American culture when they were realeased here. However, as the book's popularity took off you can see in the later editions she had gained the power to be like noope I wrote it this way and you shall sell it this way. Which way you see words like snogging in the later books. </p></div>		</li>
