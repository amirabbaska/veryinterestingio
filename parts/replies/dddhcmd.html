			<div class="markdown"><p>And why does that matter? These &quot;donations&quot; are used as a way for the contributors to affect politics. If it doesn't work they wouldn't be donating in the first place. </p>
<p>And if I were to describe a government working under this system, the word &quot;corrupted&quot; comes to mind. </p>
<p>Frankly, by your definition a bribe is LESS damaging to the overall integrity of the government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference. </p>
<p>Example A: Legislator Adam doesn't liked the idea of deregulating coal. He has said so publicly many times. Someone from Big Coal slips Adam an envelope of cash. Next week Adam publicly votes for a bill deregulating coal. </p>
<p>Example B: Legislator Bob has always been coal-friendly. He comes from a coal state. He represents coal workers. He has always publicly been pro-coal. He was to get re-elected though. Big Coal donates to Bob's campaign, which Bob can never takes for personal use. Bobs campaign goes well. Bob wins the campaign. In office Bob votes in favor of deregulating coal. </p>
<p>Adam is a bribe. Bob is not. Bob was going to vote in coal's favor regardless. The only thing that mattered was if Bob was going to be in office or not, not how he would vote. </p>
<p>As far as coal is concerned, it works. So they do it. But it still isn't a bribe.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, a bribe is a subversion of the public will. Adam acted otherwise than the people who voted him into office willed. Bob didn't do that. Bob acted exactly the way his voters wanted him to act, and they won the election. Bobs voters arent the entirty of the public, but they were the winning majority. That is the system working as expected. </p>
<p>Campaign donations are supporting a preferred candidate. How do you regulate people supporting candidates without stepping on the first amendment? The US has been wrestling with this since day one, and hasn't found an answer. </p>
<p>The only answer that I can think of, and doesn't violate the First, would be very high voter turnouts, and highly educated voters. Then even if Bobs campaign was highly funded, if Bob was a bad candidate he would still lose. Because educated voters would know that, and high turnout means they would win. The problem isn't the system, the problem is the voters. </p>
<p>Democracy in general, and the First in particular, are very idealistic ideas. They only really work with ideal voters. The only way to deal these &quot;bad voter&quot; problems are to take a &quot;practical&quot; approach to the First. Something like &quot;Campaigners, and their supporters, officially or unofficially, can no longer say anything misleading&quot;. If implemented and enforced such a rule might be nice, but its a huge violation of the First. </p></div>		</li>
