			<p>So what you are saying is that it is better to cut apart an actual human and then freeze the different types of cells individually?  Seems a lot more complicated.  They have equipment to replace organs, so in a really gross way it may work.  Like first cut out the heart and freeze it, then replace with pump to keep brain going.  Then take out lungs and freeze and put in another pump, and so on.  Then finally your brain.  This way each type of organ/cell is frozen differently.  the tricky thing is if the muscles, bones, skin can be frozen using the same freezing technique because it would be a bitch to separate those things.<br><br>Also it would suck when you unfreeze because the individual would have tons of scars on his skin.</p>		</li>
