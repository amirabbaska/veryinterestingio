			<div class="markdown"><p>The hypotheses you mention have been tested and do not come close to explaining the mass deficit. There is supposed to be more than five times as much dark matter compared to ordinary matter. A little more hydrogen here and there doesn't cut it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark doesn't just mean &quot;not giving off visible light&quot;.  In this case, it means that it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force at all.  That is not true for space dust, so dark matter must be something else.</p></div>		</li>
