			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine the issue is less about you accepting the risks and more about the rest of the population accepting it. Which they wouldn't, and rightfully so, seeing as there are an insane number of risks that could be involved (people dumping phones incorrectly resulting in radioactive pollution, some maniac buying/stealing hundreds of the things and making a dirty bomb, shoddy manufacturing giving people around you skin cancer and more).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No way to know for sure, since we have no idea what their biological/chemical makeup would be. It could kill them on contact, or they could eat the stuff. That being said, my bets would be on it not being terribly good for them, especially seeing as plutonium is a manmade element - to my knowledge it's not found in nature at all, so unless they'd deliberately modified themselves they'd be unlikely to have evolved a defense against it on their own.
Also: kind of a moot point, seeing as, although a 90 year half life may sound long, it's really not. If voyager is ever found by aliens, it's likely to be in millions or billions of years, by which time there would only be a few trace atoms remaining, if anything.</p>
<p>Edit: oops, sorry, misread your question and thought they were actively opening up the fuel source. No, it's unlikely they would be harmed by the radiation, if any, just by retrieving the goldren record. The Pu-238 is at the end of a long arm holding it away from the rest of the craft and is encased in an iridium alloy so that its radiation wouldn't interefere with the probe's instruments.</p></div>		</li>
