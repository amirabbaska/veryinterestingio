			<div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts are that those aren't space suits, worthy of full exposure to outer space.  However, if they had enough oxygen and the transfer didn't freeze them to death, they should have tried it. I think the real problem was that they thought that if any of the transfer doors, hatches failed, one crew was dead, and if it was on the rescue shuttle, then two crews would die.</p></div>		</li>
