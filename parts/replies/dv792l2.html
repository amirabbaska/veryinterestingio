			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are certain medications called “prodrugs” that need to be metabolized to produce the therapeutic compound (you ingest an inactive compound and it gets processed into the active drug in your body). If this processing is dependent on CYP3A4 (as many are), then grapefruit juice can result in too little active drug in the body for the desired effect (opposite of the toxicity from accumulation case above).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I was referring to Vyvanse being a prodrug. I do not know of any interactions with CYP3A4 or grapefruit</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just want to make sure I understand what you said there.</p>
<p>Codeine goes in, body metabolizes, you now have morphine in you (I'm assuming in <em>very</em> small doses)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cool yet slightly different type of drug like this is ibuprofen. As it is typically sold, it comes in a racemate,  and the S enantiomer is biologically active whereas the R needs to be converted by an enzyme (can’t remember the name off the top of my head) to the S to function. This gives ibuprofen a pseudo extended release action </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very informative! Thank you. </p>
<p>May I ask what the benefit is of using a prodrug instead of the original drug (e.g. codeine vs. morphine)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of reasons one might want to have the ingested compound slightly different than the therapeutic compound. </p>
<p>As others have mentioned, depending on how long the prodrug sticks around in the body (ideally a long period), it can provide an “extended release” effect (not the only way of doing this, when a drug is called “extended release” it is more typically achieved through formulation of the tablet and NOT a prodrug, but...), where one ingests a relatively high dose of prodrug, and conversion to drug is rate-limiting, meaning you can have a therapeutic dose of the active drug in the body for a long time as the body churns through converting prodrug to drug. (EDIT: this is probably the major benefit of a codeine prodrug vs morphine, as one can take a larger safe dose orally and have it be effective for an extended period as it gets turned into morphine in the body)</p>
<p>Another common reason to design a prodrug is if the therapeutic drug has a low “bioavailability”, that is has a hard time being absorbed by the body and getting to the tissue it needs to act on. An example of this could be an oral drug  that has difficulty being absorbed by the GI tract (e.g. a very polar molecule, difficulty in crossing membranes). There is significant benefit to chemically modifying this to to a prodrug that can more readily cross the barriers it encounters, and is only broken down to the therapeutic compound once it hits circulation.</p>
<p>A not so common but imo more awesome reason to use a prodrug is to minimize side-effects/toxicity outside of the tissue of interest. Some prodrugs are designed to be metabolized to drug only in the tissue of interest (so generally not the grapefruit juice counter indicated drugs, unless it was for activity in the liver). This could be important in something like cancer therapy, where you want the drug to be very toxic and potent, but not to healthy cells- so you design a drug that has no therapeutic effect until it gets where it needs to be. There is a lot of current research in this area. </p>
<p>The last and so far as I know most common reason to use a prodrug is less interesting... we found a compound that has a therapeutic effect, and it turns out that the active compound is actually a metabolite of what was being used, but it all works so who cares :P</p>
<p>TL;DR:  keep lots of drug around in a non toxic form, chemically modify a drug to get it into your body more easily, activate a drug only where it is needed, or just because </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was listening to Stuff You Should Know podcast the other day about caffeine and they alluded to the 50s when a grapefruit and coffee was standard breakfast. I didn’t really understand this until now, and quick google search confirms: grapefruits increase the effects of caffeine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less than 5% of Caffeine is metabolized by CYP3A4, 95%+ is metabolized by CYP1A2.</p>
<p>So while technically true, the effect should be negligible.</p>
<p>Smoking, however, will significantly increase the effects of caffeine through CYP1A2 inhibition.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If grapefruit inhibits CYP3A4, then I don't think the 5% of caffeine that is metabolized by CYP3A4 is related to the interaction...wouldn't the grapefruit be reducing the effects then?Seems like the interaction with caffeine which increases its effects happens via some other mechanism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: this interaction was discovered by a scientist in London Ontario. He was actually testing the effects of alcohol on pharmacological responses. However, on the first day the patients began to complain that they couldn’t keep taking shots straight without some kind of chaser, so he went into the fridge and the only thing available was grape fruit juice. On the subsequent days he came prepared with a number of other more popular chasers available. When analyzing the results, the researcher found a huge slew of the data on the first day. He put two and two together and began studying affects of grape fruit juice.</p>
