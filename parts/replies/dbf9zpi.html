			<div class="markdown"><p>His flails push the air away from him, which causes his body to move in the opposite direction. I suppose that even if he stayed motionless he would have eventually moved, because the air in the station is always circulated (so there's a very slight &quot;wind&quot; that will move him).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look closely you'll see him moving slightly as soon as the other man lets him go. It's hard to notice the constant movement when he starts flailing, but he just continues to drift in the same direction at a constant speed until he gets close enough to grab something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is <em>literally</em> swimming, just in air as opposed to water. Just as you push on water to move, he is pushing on the air (which pushes back on him) to move.</p></div>		</li>
