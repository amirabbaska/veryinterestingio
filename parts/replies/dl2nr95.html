<li>When the ATM makes a mistake, either the customer notices and cares (it ate my card, it didn't give me my money, etc.) <strong>or</strong> the bank notices and cares (it gave a customer too many bills, etc.)</li>
<li>When a ballot machine messes up... how do you know? There are ways to address looking up ballots to dispute them, but notice that any method is generally going to represent a departure from anonymous, hand-counted paper ballots.</li>

<p>So: why have we had seemingly error- and fraud-proof ATMs since the 1980s while electronic voting is such a mess?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fairness, ATMs were trivially hacked well into the late 90s for a variety of reasons, ranging from insecure cryptography design, poorly implemented cryptographic protocols, poorly implemented infrastructure, the allowance of offline withdrawals for double spending, etc...</p>
<p>If you take a look at the proceedings of Blackhat or DEFCON conferences, researchers routinely defeat the security mechanisms at use even now, they just don't typically compromise the machine for cryptographic failures. They can do this by compromising the machine and its software, not by adding on skimmers.</p>
<p>ATMs are very far from error and fraud proof; really, the premise of the question is unfounded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies state to state but for national and state level elections the laws must be standardized within the state, it's just that they're usually administered by independently elected officials that are only accountable to voters whose votes they are responsible for counting...  And those officials are part of different levels of government in different states (some are municipal, some are county, some are independent, some are mixed).</p>
<p>So qualification to vote, availability of polling, etc... can and often are regulated by the state, but some things (like the type of machines, or even option of electronic vs paper ballot) if unregulated are then left to the local official.</p>
<p>E.g. in Florida the state requires that all systems of voting or counting votes must be certified by the state before they can be used, but we allow multiple systems to be used (optical ballot and direct recording electronic [not sure if we offer others]) but in my county we vote absentee by optical scan while election day is direct recording electronic.  In other counties (smaller counties) it may be optical scan only because it's cheaper relative to the budget to purchase and maintain.</p>
<p>TLDR: voting officials are NOT just municipal level in every state, and ultimate control of voting IS regulated by the state because every form of government in the state derived their authority/legitimacy from the state constitution in some manner.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, and I never meant to imply that they were. But the officials <em>actually running elections</em> almost invariably are, so any attempt at standardization would have to be sufficiently granular to capture that level of distinction. Also, just because state governments <em>regulate</em> elections (and they all do, to be sure) doesn't mean they actually <em>pay for</em> elections. A lot of that falls on local election boards. </p>
<p>That aside, it's not exactly as if state governments are loaded with cash these days either. . . .</p></div>		</li>
