<p>Its called a digraph. Qu makes the /kw/ sound in the English language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's dodging the question. Why is Q the only letter that doesn't appear outside its digraph? </p>
<p>'Ph' is a digraph. 'Sh' is a digraph. But 'P' and 'S' show up outside their digraphs all the time in English, while Q doesn't (outside of loanwords from other languages). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In italian you actually say &quot;q&quot; as &quot;k&quot; and the following &quot;u&quot; is never silent, either. &quot;U&quot; always follows &quot;q&quot;, and we also have a single word sporting two &quot;q&quot;, &quot;soqquadro&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;disorder&quot;) where you can see the &quot;u&quot; only after the second &quot;q&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are a lot of words that have Q without a U after it, but they are mostly in Semitic languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you're wondering because you find yourself needing this information: the word 'qat' does not have a u following the q, but <em>is</em> accepted in Scrabble.</p></div>		</li>
