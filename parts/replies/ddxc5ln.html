			<div class="markdown"><p>I can attest to that. For the longest time I was unable to do math in English. I literally would think the problem and solution in Spanish. Needless to say, it was hard to follow algebra when the teacher explained all the functions in English. I had to come up with my own understanding in Spanish to get what was being used taught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also didn't notice that my thoughts were in any language until I spent a few weeks abroad speaking another language (that I already knew) more or less fluently. Once I got back to the US I noticed I was thinking (and counting or doing any math really) in the second language and it really was an eye opening experience!  That stopped after a couple of weeks though for me and I went back to 100% English. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I am Danish and married to a native English speaker, having spend a while outside Denmark and not speaking my mother tongue that often, I started to count and dream in English. One thing that has messed it all up further is that ATM we are traveling in South America and I am learning Spanish. Now I sometimes speak Danish to my wife right after I have been speaking a lot of Spanish. My mind know to switch language but gets... let's say lost in translation. </p>
<p>But still, when I really have to concentrate I think in Danish. </p></div>		</li>
