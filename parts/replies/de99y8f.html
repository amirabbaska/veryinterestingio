			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit, I forgot to include the fact that if a person's hemoglobin is low, but they're well oxygenated, they can read high. So, the monitor will say 97%, but really it's that the O2 is efficiently binding to the hemoglobin, but since there is an abnormally low level of hemoglobin (and therefore oxygen) circulating the blood system,  the person is not as well oxygenated as the monitor would indicate.</p>
<p>Basically if the hgb is at 60, there is ~50% availability of the carrier of oxygen, so you're body is only capable of delivering as much oxygen as the available hemoglobin can carry. When hemoglobin is low, it can carry the max amount of oxygen,  but that is still only 50% of what your body at optimal health could provide.</p>
<p>Alcohol has made this explanation tricky and long winded. Hopefully it makes sense I don't contraindicated myself anywhere. </p>
<p>Edit - I used the hemoglobin measurement that I use at work. Normal range for a woman is 120-160, and 140-180 for a man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, victims of smoke inhalation will give a false high reading. The hemoglobin likes carbon monoxide a whole lot more than oxygen (about 200 times more) but your body cant use it so your still oxygen deprived. It's very important to not rely on the pulse ox blindly. A fire victim will come in &quot;cherry red&quot; and the machine will tell you that their oxygen is 100%. But that's just because it can't tell that it's not O2 but CO that's bound to the hemoglobin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>most of these devices are known as &quot;pulse oximeters,&quot; and when I was in EMT training we were told that we need to remove nail polish from fingers to make sure the light can pass through. </p>
<p><em>EDIT: there are some really amazing responses to my comment that explain this is no longer the case (pulse ox should work as long as we're not talking gel polish apparently...), as well as many who suggest to turn the pulse ox 90 degrees or placing it on an ear/toe instead of the finger with nail polish. Someone even provided an awesome study someone did about pulse ox and nail polish!! (yay science!)</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally not. Brand <em>et al.</em> (2002) found that &quot;there were
neither SpO2 differences detected between nail polish
colors nor were there any differences between the
painted and the unpainted control digit across subjects&quot; (at 95), though they do note that metallic nail polishes or particularly thickly-applied polish may prevent transmission. (In such cases, though, there would be no result at all; there's not a risk of erroneous information.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is no longer the case except in rare circumstances. Also, unless the person somehow put the nail polish circumferentially around their finger you could always just turn the pulse oximeter 90 degrees and it would shine through the side of the finger. Alternatively you could use a clip that does on the ear lobe or over the nostril. Anywhere there is blood flow and is thin enough for the sensor to pass the light will work to read oxygenation.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a simple trick for that. Place the oxymeter on the side of the finger. It works fine that way and won't be affected by the nail polish. (Don't know if I'm being clear. Instead of placing the oxymeter on the nail, twist it a bit and place it on the sides of the finger.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to be pedantic, pulse oximeter  measures pulse rate and not heart rate. In some heart dysrythmias, a heart beat is not strong enough to produce a palpable pulse, which is a phenomenon called Pulsus Deficit. If you observed the patient on an EKG and palpated the pulse, or watched a pulse ox waveform, you would be able to see differences in each rate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, pulse oximeters don't work well on pts with poor perfusion. That's why you will see discrepancies with heart rate over a monitor that uses electrical signals, and the SpO2 will usually be inaccurate as well. In that case, ABG time! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Added Fun Fact: If it's a battery operated device (I.E.: the little portable ones you can get from the drug store) they can vary depending upon the charge of the battery. I had a patient who was extremely paranoid about her health (parents died young due to health issues so can't really blame her), and she called in for an appointment frantically stating her SpO2 was 73% on her monitor. I explained that it couldn't be and suggested she change the batteries in her device. She did and it showed 99%.... Health tech is neat, but sometimes it makes people think there's more going on than there actually is.</p>
<p>Just to clarify anything under 90 is bad... Under 80 and organ damage starts.</p></div>		</li>
