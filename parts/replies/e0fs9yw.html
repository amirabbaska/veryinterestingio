			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mostly right, with one important caveat. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3747" target="_blank">These Spanish physicists recently wrote a more in depth paper on this very subject, and they identified one additional key point.</a> The issue is not that the bottle moves away from the liquid. Rather by hitting the bottle you are creating an expansion/compression wave in the liquid. This sudden wave in turn leads to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation" target="_blank">cavitation</a> of gas pockets, which then quickly collapse. This collapse produces a ton of new daughter bubbles, which in turn kick start new bubbles, etc until you create a low density foam. This foam can then shoot up through the bottle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once did this with a jar of pasta sauce. The lid wasn't coming off, so I hit it with the heel of my hand, hoping to break the seal. Instead the bottom of the jar popped off, broken off right where the glass curved. Perfectly smooth break. Once I fished it out of the sauce that ended up all over the place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do it with the palm of your hand. Seems to work best when the beer is about a quarter full. You have to hit it hard (so it’s gotta be a bottle you’re holding), but not as hard as it will seem to others. It’s a neat party trick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what the beer is that could be a number of issues.</p>
<p>It could be highly carbonated and too warm to keep the co2 in solution. So you open it, and it goes from being under pressure, to only atmospheric pressure, causing a surge of co2 to come out of solution.</p>
<p>That's generally viewed as a flaw in most beers, but expected in some styles as part of the risk.</p></div>		</li>
