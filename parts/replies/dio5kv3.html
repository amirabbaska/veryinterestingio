			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see a possible solution.  Your powdery ingredients come in containers with a sort of air lock and you have an enclosed mixing bowl with matching locks.  You snap the containers into place, shake the contents out, then snap them off.  One all the dry is shaken together and swirling like a nebula, you snap in a water source or whatever to make the dough wet, eliminating the dust threat.  They could probably let it rise and bake in the same vessel so there's no mess until it's to be eaten.  </p>
<p>Edit: I'm sure there's all sorts of engineering problems I haven't thought of.  This is just a broad strokes idea.</p></div>		</li>

I can't believe that people can live up there for months without any particles or bits of this and that being created and just floating around waiting to be breathed in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yuck! I never thought about this. The crumbs on my shirt after I eat are easy to deal with because I can dust them into the floor. I can't imagine my mess floating around my face and waiting to be inhaled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read about astronauts doing something very similar with a plastic bag, cutting tomatoes inside of it to prevent the juice from spitting all around. One of their concerns and difficulties doing this was not cutting the bag itself.</p>
<p>The issue of crumbs getting dispersed is brought up frequently. As they don't fall they would stay afloat for a long time. Actually I think they would be carried away by air currents (in the ISS they have fans everywhere to guarantee proper air mixing and prevent CO2 spots from forming) and eventually reach the filters where they would be caught - this already happens to hair lost by astronauts anyway. It would be much more of an issue with liquids, like tomato juice or sauces. You don't want droplets floating around.</p>
<p>But I agree with /u/cable36wu that fire is a much bigger concern. Even though it's unlikely to happen, in the ISS they are paranoid about it because there's nowhere they can go, and the environmental control system would not be able to handle the great load of combustion products in a reasonable time. So basically even if they manage to put out the fire they would be left with an unbreathable atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fire would look crazy in space, if you let some combustible object like a lump of coal or a sheet of paper float in the middle of a room &amp; light it. it wouldn't have its typical conical properties. would it take the form of a miniature star?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do...do astronauts masturbate? Do they have a system for this? I imagine that could cause a mess if one wasn't REALLY careful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Any small particles are a problem in space because they can get in everywhere. Food preparation is generally quite messy... bits and juices going everywhere</p>
<p>That's why so much money was spent to develop pens that could write in space... graphite particles from pencils were too dangerous</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the bread thing wasn't that they were going to bake it but that they had developed a bread that doesn't make crumbs so they could simple have it up there. Currently they can only have like tortilla shells and whatnot cause they don't make many crumbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both. Cooking is a challenge because of power requirements and heat dissipation. From what I've read they'd have to use about 1/10th of the power of a regular bread-baking oven because of ISS technical limitations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though I've seen an article very recently and they are working on baking bread in space from scratch</p>

<p>To clarify this point, are you talking about <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2134009-crumb-free-bread-will-mean-iss-astronauts-can-now-bake-in-space/" target="_blank">this article</a>?  If so, it's worth noting that this isn't NASA, but <a href="http://bakein.space/" target="_blank">a German company</a> that hopes to develop an oven to cook bread in space.</p>
<p>It's an interesting concept, and I'm curious if they'll be able to meet their scheduled goal of flying the hardware next year.</p></div>		</li>
