			<div class="markdown"><p>There's even a use for theories on Unitary matrices.   U inverse = U transpose.    Well a rotational matrix (no translation or shear) is a Unitary matrix.  To compute its inverse, you only need to take the transpose of the matrix.    You can also decompose a translation/rotation into two matrices and inverse each part to optimize inverting these types of matrices. </p></div>		</li>
