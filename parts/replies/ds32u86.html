			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the ice that's floating on its own, if that melts then the water will not rise at all. The same as ice in a glass of water, if you fill it with water and ice and then ice melts. The level start does not change as it has already displaced that amount of water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the ice is trapped in above ground glaciers. We're not talking about seasonal ice formation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The arctic (north pole) is really the only place where ice is floating.  99% of the rest of the ice is in <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/icesheets.html" target="_blank">Greenland and Antarctica</a>, which are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica#/media/File:AntarcticBedrock2.jpg" target="_blank">landmasses</a>.  That's a picture of Antarctica if you removed the ice sheet.  The Antarctic sheet is much larger- its average thickness is <a href="http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/environment/sea-ice/ice-sheet" target="_blank">2.16 kilometers</a>.  Also as other people have mentioned, the water expands when it heats up.  Since the oceans are so deep that has a big effect too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought water expands when it freezes so that means it shrinks in volume when going from frozen to liquid? I am sure it will expand again when heating to high temperature, but the ocean's average temperature it's pretty low, very far from boiling. </p></div>		</li>
