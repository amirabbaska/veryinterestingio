			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an interesting sideline, the UK doesn't have strict separation of church and state (indeed it has an established church, and the head of state is also the head of that church... so you can't really get less entangled than that) but there is legislation in place to protect non-state religions and people without any beliefs, so as a juror you have the choice between:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence.&quot;</em></p>
<p>a number of similar oaths geared toward different religions, or indeed </p>
<p><em>&quot;I solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence.&quot;</em></p>
<p>For Parliamentarians the same sort of alternatives apply so you have:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I (name of Member) swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Or indeed:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I (name of Member) do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The same applies to anything where an oath is required, almost. </p>
<p>The ones that might look odd to those more familiar with strict separation are things like the oaths taken by CofE clergy, they'd both swear allegiance to the Sovereign and take an oath of canonical obedience to the Bishop (and I assume there aren't non-religious versions for obvious reasons...)</p>
<p>The second is the oath sworn by members of the armed forces:</p>
<p><em>&quot;I swear by Almighty God / do solemnly, and truly declare and affirm, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I will, as in duty bound, honestly and faithfully defend Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, in Person, Crown and Dignity against all enemies, and will observe and obey all orders of Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, and of the generals / admirals / air officers) and officers set over me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Where the source of authority is clearly the crown rather than anything else...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a note to the tradition of swearing by the bible.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:34-37 New American Standard Bible (NASB)</p>
<p>34 But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your statement be, ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no’; anything beyond these is of evil.</p>
<p>I mean it would be understandable if a religious christian did not want to swear on the bible...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, Congressman Keith Ellison, who is a Muslim, took his oath of office on a Quran. In fact it was the copy of the Quran owned by Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/163698" target="_blank">This guy</a> who is Jewish, swore in on a Hebrew Bible as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny, I live in the south and have served on jury duty 4x. One time the person wasn't sworn in on a holy book, people in the jury thought it made him seem guilty (I had to remind them how wrong this was).</p>
<p>I've heard of people instantly saying &quot;they're guilty&quot; because of the Quran usage.</p>
<p>If I was atheist or anything else non-Christian, I'd consider using a bible if it was the default which is sad and wrong.</p></div>		</li>
