<p>Some bronze alloys are stronger than many steel alloys.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chromoly (41~~) series alloys are steel alloys with, whadya know, chrome and molybdenum added to increase tensile strength for a sacrifice in cost and minor decrease in weldability.</p>
<p>They also have far higher yield and tensile strength numbers than the bronze bearing alloy that you mentioned 81,000 vs 33,000 for yield I think?</p>
<p>But yes, there are some really strong bronzes that can be made, like aluminum bronze which can get into the 80,XXX range of ultimate tensile strength if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>Anyhow, yes, it can be some strong stuff.</p>
<p>Also, golden chips when you machine. Just watch out for the 2% lead that they put in sometimes to make it so buttery to machine.</p></div>		</li>
