			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the size and shape of the pizza, of course. 8 slices is most common, but with large pizzas those slices are too big, while 16 slices make the slices too small.  So 12 slices is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Of course, if the pizza's <em>really</em> big it's probably not round, either, so all bets are off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to the base 60 part of your answer we didn't just think of it, it was based on the Babylonian numerals nearly 2000 years BC I think and most nations used their teachings. Didn't all come from the Latins though they certainly played a significant role as did the Babylonians.</p></div>		</li>
