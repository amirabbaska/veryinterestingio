			<div class="markdown"><p>We work out the distance and size independently.  Distance is calculated by the luminosity of it's Aurora. We know the strength of them and therefore how bright they should be from a close distance, we now match that to how bright they appear to us and that gives us the distance. This is the same way we measure distance of stars and other objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luminosity just defines how bright something is from a certain distance. We know the brightness because of the nature of the aurora and we can tell what the luminosity would be from a reference distance (e.g 10km), we then take the observed luminosity and extrapolate the distance from there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of ways to measure distance accurately. Depending on the scale you can use red shift, parallax, and logic. Gravity affect mass proportionally. if the thing were bigger it would have to have a certain amount more or less Mass, and therefore would be brighter or less bright accordingly.</p>
<p>You can use Peak wavelength to find temperature, use temperature to find absolute luminosity, and use the relationship between absolute luminosity and apparent luminosity to get a distance.</p></div>		</li>
