			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to agree with this, but my thinking is, after having processed the major chunk of this data, shouldn't opening the second eye be easier after a couple seconds? This should apply to the second scenario as well with the pupil contraction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, but its a continuous process - you're continually processing a stream of fresh information in real time. There's no time to catch up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I do it because the bright light is usually temporary. If I keep one eye closed, I'm still good when the bright light goes away because the closed eye is still adjusted to the dark, so I'm not rendered blind.</p>
<p>this is not a neuroscience answer though.<br />
but also... if it's about strain from extra processing, as one eye adjusts to the light, they just become more different, so it doesn't seem like the burden is going to decrease much.</p></div>		</li>
