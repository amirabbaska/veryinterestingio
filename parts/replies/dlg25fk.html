			<div class="markdown"><p>Kwashiorkor does not include calorie deficiency. Anorexics are cutting off all forms of food, so they are put under a severe caloric deficit; patients suffering from Kwashiorkor do intake sufficient calories, while being starved of protein. Proteins in your blood (mainly Albumin) is responsible for causing oncotic pressure that draws water back into your blood vessels from cells; when these proteins are absent, cells start retaining excess water, causing edema that is characteristic of these patients. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you would put in a lot of effort to not eat protein, you might get there. But I understand you are asking if someone eating vegan might have this happen accidentally from not paying attention to balance their diet? Almost certainly not.</p>
<p>A lot of a vegan diets staples contain plenty of protein. Chickpeas, beans, peas, spinach, soy products and countless more. No western vegan would accidentally eat only rice, corn and oil if they have other options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In lots of developing countries, they eat carbohydrate sybles, so have somewhat adequate caloric intake, without adequate protein intake- this causes kwashiorkor with the swollen belly. </p>
<p>An anorexic, on the other hand, has a complete nutrient deficiency. They are more likely to have a similar appearence to a child with marasmus (Google if you're brave and you'll see the difference in appearence). </p></div>		</li>
