<p>Lambert Eaton is a problem with how the interface between your nerves and muscles interface involving calcium channels, but to keep it at eli5 level: you feel muscle weakness but when you repeat the motion youre trying to do a few times it gets a bit better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is for different reasons though. </p>
<p>Arthritis is characterized by constant inflammation in the joints, so as this inflammation continuously builds up around your joints, it produces stuff that needs to be filtered out by the lymph system. But the lymphatic system does not have a heart to pump it, so in order to pump/move lymph it depends on the motion of muscles and joints. </p>
<p>Obviously at night you are not moving muscles and joints much, so the inflammation and it's byproducts build up to much greater levels than they can during the day when your lymphatic system is working to reduce them</p></div>		</li>
