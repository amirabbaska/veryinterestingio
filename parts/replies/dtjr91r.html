			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m also a CFI and your description of banking with the ailerons and yawing with the rudder to turn an airplane isn’t correct. More importantly, they give the wrong mental model of turning an airplane. I really suggest you read Stick and Rudder.</p>
<p>Ailerons definitely bank the airplane and that creates a turn. That’s true. (More details later). But, the rudder is not needed for a coordinated turn. Rudder is only needed to counteract the weird yawing forces that exist on an airplane. These forces are adverse yaw (the drag created by ailerons), drag difference between the wings, and torque (that’s too small to notice). If we didn’t have these forces, and only wanted to do coordinated turns, we wouldn’t need rudders.</p>
<p>So what turns the airplane? Not the ailerons, those just cause roll. Slam them over and you’ll go all the way around in a roll without turning a bit. Not the rudder, that will just cause a skid.</p>
<p>It’s the elevator. Elevators turn airplanes. The elevator is the only flight control that cause an airplane to enter coordinated, curved flight. </p>
<p>If your wings are level and you pull on the elevator, your flight path will curve up until you run out of extra energy. Or, you’ll go all the way around in a loop.</p>
<p>If you bank the airplane over, you’ll still curve nose up, but up is now to the left or right so you enter a turn. If you’re banked in an airplane and pull on the stick, you’ll turn faster. You can also stop any turn by pushing on the stick.</p>
<p>Really, any pilot reading this should read Stick and Rudder. It will explain it better than I can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For years flying was my life. I went to flight school, got flying jobs, then started instructing. I've had countless conversations in hangars. I've read a bunch of books.</p>
<p>Then I write my comment above. To you, it looks like another instance of people talking in detail about some topic that you don't understand. It seems like the internet is full of people who know more than you do.</p>
<p>But here's the trick: you're reading me at my absolute best. If it was <em>any other topic</em> I wouldn't have that same level of knowledge. Teaching that shit was my job for years, and I was also was lucky enough to have some very good instructors. I didn't &quot;discover&quot; a single that I wrote in my comment.</p>
<p>But ask me about cooking? No fucking clue. Electrical guitars? I like how they sound, can't say more than that. I don't know much of anything about hockey, geology, or construction, either. Any serious conversation about those topics will fly right over my head.</p>
<p>Stop comparing yourself to other people's highlight reel. There is so much to know, you're going to know nothing about almost everything for the rest of your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It's been awhile, but to your point.. What turns the airplane is the &quot;horizontal component of lift&quot; when the aircraft is banked. In a multiple choice test, that is the correct answer. Iirc</p>
<p>And stick and rudder is an awesome book.</p>
<p>All that said, I flew ultra lights for a while and the adverse yaw was so pronounced (on the ones that I flew) that turns were actually led with the rudder and the natural stability of the plane banked it even more than the ailerons could. Like most piloting things you eventually reach the point where you're doing the inputs to control the plane without really thinking about them though. But yeah, those ultralights will keep you honest with the rudder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree on HCL. To put it into control turns, the elevator decides how much lift you have and the ailerons decide how much is horizontal.</p>
<p>I've never flown one, but I heard gliders have the same behavior with rudder movement inducing roll, so little aileron is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ailerons are the outer flaps on the wings responsible for rolling/spinning, yaw is the left/right motion controlled by the rudder, pitch is the last way of moving which is up/down.</p>
<p>centrifugal force is basically what is keeping the water in the cup, the same way you stay in the seat of a roller coaster when it does loop de loops, the safty bar helps but its mostly balanced g-forces that keep you from falling out your seat.</p></div>		</li>
