			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not how hygienic, its more of how effective your saliva is. Less saliva ? more imbalance and occurrence of carries, which doesn't have to do with diet directly and could be due to a ton of reasons examples being radiotherapy, chemotherapy, certain drugs, blocked glands, genetics, congenital deformities and so on.</p>
<p>Diet also heavily affects saliva content, anti-biotic misuse and overuse also affect oral flora balance. Many other factors could lead to disturbances in salivary flow and content, while others disturb the oral environment and bacterial flora in general. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am of the belief that gum with sugar really isn't bad for one as the saliva quickly washes away the sugar and the increased saliva is very healthy for the mouth.</p>
<p>I also believe that sugar mints and the like keep a high level of sugar in the mouth and is very detrimental to oral health.</p>
<p>Any peer reviewed articles on the subject you can share?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>3 factors; the viscosity of saliva, its pH (as mentioned) and the amount of saliva released, for ex: Too little saliva or near absence of it (Xerostomy) means that oral hygiene is a lot more difficult to maintain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question. Why is it that when people talk about cleaning the vagina or ears people say that you should 'leave your body alone&quot; and not interfere with your bodies natural cleaning process but demand that we clean our teeth? Clearly humans didn't evolve brushing their teeth. Is brushing and cleaning our teeth a victorian silliness that will one day be looked on with impunity or did the mouth somehow not evolve like the rest of our body to take care of cleaning? If so why? What evidence is there that cleaning our teeth does any good?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this!   </p>
<p>Unlike other parts of the body (such as the vagina or ears), your teeth are a non-shedding surface. They don't slough off their outer layer like other parts of your body do; and because of this, they are prime real estate for bacterial biofilms (otherwise known as plaque). Due to the purposeful structure of plaque, saliva (and other anti-microbial mechanisms) cannot penetrate into plaque to kill the bacteria. However, if you brush your teeth and break up the plaque, now your saliva can get in there and do its thing.</p>
<p>To answer your question about whether we evolved brushing our teeth, there is some evidence that our oral microflora, the &quot;quality&quot; of our saliva, and our diet (our consumption of raw foods in particular) affect the suppression of biofilm formation. Considering that cavemen probably weren't using anti-microbial mouthwashes to screw with their microflora, and they also ate much more raw food than industrialized humans do - it's possible that humans didn't always need to brush their teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that if we stopped brushing our teeth and usin mouthwash and eating a more &quot;paleo&quot; diet we would eliminate the need to brush our teeth? I watched a documentary that showed that skeletons before the agricultural revolution had healthier teeth than modern day humans.</p>
<p>It doesn't real make sense that places like our vaginas would evolve self cleaning mechanisms but fundamental areas like your mouth and teeth wouldn't have the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've seen comparing the humans who never brushed their teeth with  modern humans who are required to is the Industrial Age. </p>
<p>This is the point where our diets changed and we started eating a lot more sugar and processed foods. And today it's extremely hard to avoid it as it's practically in everything now. </p>
<p>Before then the bacteria in your mouth was enough to protect your teeth. </p>
<p>I just saw a doc like 2 days ago on the topic and this guy had all these skulls in order by date and you can clearly see where our teeth health went to crap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right I saw that same thing. Some people make the argument: Old people lost all their teeth and died at younger ages. But as the documentary points out we have skeletons of older people from all the periods where humans didn't brush their teeth and all of them have as good as if not better teeth than current skeletons.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever thought to question whether brushing our teeth just like douching the vagina is actually killing the bacteria that help protect our teeth? Have there ever been any studies to this effect?</p>
<p>Also if diet is the culprit then does that mean that switching to a &quot;paleo&quot; sort of diet would eliminate the need to brush teeth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your enamel is made of hydroxyapatite, which has an OH- group in it which helps the crystal's strength. When you drink or eat anything acidic, the pH of the mouth easily drops to a point that is lower than is required to keep hydroxyapatite in solid crystal form, which is where we get demineralization of the enamel. When you put fluoride in your mouth, the F- group replaces the OH- group in hydroxyapatite and now we call it fluoroapatite. It takes quite a bit more acidity to demineralize fluoroapatite than hydroxyapatite. So there we get stronger teeth and less demineralization of the enamel (which leads to caries). Also fluoride has antimicrobial properties so that will lessen the amount of damage that bad bacteria can do to your teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dentist, doctor or in the medical profession. My understanding is this though: the most important thing you can do regarding healthy teeth and gum is mechanically clean your teeth with toothbrush and floss. I believe that toothpaste isn't necessary for this and mainly there &quot;for feels&quot; and as lubricant. A dentist may cite studies that show fluoride to have a beneficial effect but if you can't get any ... proper brushing technique and flossing is the key, not some fancy toothpaste. Also, the less sugar in your diet, the better your teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluoride is good for promoting enamel, which is obviously beneficial to most people. Otherwise, yes, I imagine the mechanical processes of brushing and flossing far outweigh the chemical ones. I recall a study (can't be bothered at this moment to find it, I'm sure google can supply) that showcased the correlation between the introduction of fluoride in public water supply versus dental health expenditure.</p></div>		</li>
