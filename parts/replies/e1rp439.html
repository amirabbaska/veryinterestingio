			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly doubt that last one. For at least as long as I've lived, pretty much every house here in the Netherlands has had regular switches in bathrooms. Never had someone die from it. So in over 30 years there have been 0 water electrocutions, seems pretty conclusive as far as experiments go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK I think it's standard regulations to either have a string switch in the bathroom, or the switch is outside the room. The second option makes no sense to me.
Edit: so apparently it's no longer the law, but a lot of electricians still do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually still is a building regulation, albeit updated. Switches in bathrooms need to be within a certain distance from sources of water, plus (unless memory fails me) must also offer an appropriate degree of ingress protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well tradition is a funny thing among craftsman.  It is less about because it has always been done that way, and more about that is the way I have always done it.  So as new techniques are taught to new tradesman then they phase out.</p>
<p>But the question I have for you is, why does the switch need to be inside the bathroom?  The only rooms in a whole house that really needs a switch in that room is the bedroom, the livingroom/family room, and kitchen.  These are the only rooms that you typically stay in long enough for the light outside to significantly change, and therefore you will need to turn on a light in a room that you were already in.  Otherwise a light switch is more suited to being outside the entrance way to a room.  The bathroom is a place where you rarely need to change the lighting while you are in the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many older houses have you been in? I'll concede that this isn't a thing in most houses built in the latter half of last century, but older houses definitely have this, especially in bathrooms that also house laundry machines.</p>
<p>This is very common in older Amsterdam houses for example. Newer building regulations have obviated the need from both a cost and safety perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for the Netherlands, but electrical codes usually require additional precautions - such as <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Leviton-15-Amp-125-Volt-Duplex-Self-Test-Slim-GFCI-Outlet-White-R72-GFNT1-0RW/205996720" target="_blank">GFCI outlets</a> - for installations which are close to a water source. Though they aren't always visible they do mean more installation work, which is one reason why (in some places, anyways) you often see light switches outside the door to a bathroom rather than inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The code in the US calls for a GFCI outlet to be on the circuit of outlets around water. That’s how we get around it. If the circuit shorts it’ll trip instantly. </p></div>		</li>
