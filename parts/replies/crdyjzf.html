			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response, that makes a lot of sense. How about on the micro scale? It seems like there would be a lot of 'blur'. So rather than an exact map of where every cell should be, it is more of a 'close enough' system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's stupid complex. You've got so many origins and proteins interacting with all the processes in the cell that it is a pretty perfect map as long as it's working correctly. Some proteins will enter the nuclei and interact directly with the DNA, activating, promoting, or deactivating different regions. Some will react with other proteins in the cell directly. Some will serve as signals that are read by the membrane proteins of the cells. Some will modify how RNA is transcribed. It's the most complicated machine you can imagine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could it be possible to have set of proteins that  tweak the gene expression in some point of body into a origin point of some other part. For example, I stick needle into the forehead of someone I don't like and that becomes origin point for genitalia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cells are capable of signaling other cells in the immediate vicinity to alter their gene expressions so that they differentiate into functionally appropriate cells for the tissue. One pathway that I know of that might interest you is the Notch pathway, which actually mediates such signaling between adjacent cells, particularly in nervous tissue (thus ensuring that cells around neurons tend to differentiate into glia, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case you're interested in slightly more information:</p>
<p>What I find fascinating is that these signaling compounds don't have to be proteins. Small molecules (organic compounds, e.g. retinoic acid) as well as mRNA (the instructions for protein construction, although this is complicated, since an mRNA gradient essentially results in a protein gradient) can also form these gradients. And, early on in development, a lot of these signals are actually defined by compounds that the mother put into the egg.</p>
<p>Also, gradients aren't the only thing acting. Amongst other things, asymmetric cell division also plays a role. If you start with one cell with determinants in it that can specify fate A and fate B, it can sequester those factors such that one of its daughter cells gets the A factor (and will become an A cell) and the other daughter gets the B factor (and will become a B cell).</p>
<p>This underlines a large topic in development: cells can either &quot;know&quot; what they are supposed to turn into without cues from other cells (autonomous), or cells can require instruction from other cells in order to turn into what they are supposed to (non autonomous).  Different organisms use different combinations of these developmental strategies (mosaic vs. regulative development).</p>
<p>Thanks for asking developmental questions, definitely got my mind churning this morning!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the cells in, for example, bones...are they influenced by combinations of certain concentrations of proteins from skin, muscle, etc? Or is the ulna influenced by combination of proteins from carpals and the humerus? So, to make that clearer, does the cell's formation and behavior depend on only similarly formed and behaving cells, or is it a combination of everything surrounding it? </p>
<p>As well, do these proteins travel through the cells themselves until a near-equal concentration is reached sort of osmotically (I'm thinking concentration differential as seen in stuff like Na+, K+, and Cl- in neurons, but without the ionic forces or active protein channels...I just can't remember the right word), or are they transported via other transport proteins (or some other vehicle)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give you a sucky answer, yes. </p>
<p>Cells are influenced by the proteins and extracellular structure of everything around them. And if you consider that a protein gradient is potentially originating from many cells away and just spreading trough the nearby cells, then they're being influenced by cells far away from them as well. </p>
<p>You're right that osmosis is part of it, but it won't be just 1:1. Cells touch other cells or liquid-filled spaces on all sides, so the osmotic pressures aren't going to be straightforward. One center cell touched by 12 surrounding cells might have 12 times the concentration of a particular protein than any of the surrounding cells. But even the it wouldn't be that simple, as each of those surrounding cells have other cells they're touching. </p>
<p>Then you have to add the fact that proteins aren't tiny permeable ions, so active and passive transportation channels and protein interactions are going to affect how proteins move between cells. You were right to consider that as part of it as well. </p>
<p>Some days I think it'd be fun to get a graduate degree and work on building computer models of all of this. The complexity is intriguing and it hurts my brain. </p>
<p>[Edit]: I realized I didn't directly answer your first questions. Other bone cells probably have more influence  in terms of number of proteins interacting just due to similarity in structure and protein productions, but they're definitely influenced by muscle, skin, blood, and everything else around them. That being said, a super-expressed protein in a muscle cell that directly targets and modifies the function of bone cells near it could be said to have &quot;more&quot; of an effect. I'm thinking ligament production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That was far from a sucky answer. I feel so edified. I understand cellular interaction<em>only</em> within the realm of neuroscience, so it was really fascinating to see that &quot;communication&quot; happens in all cells, and even helps to form them.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with you, there. If any schools nearby offered it,I'd totally go for a graduate degree in neuroscience as well, building computer models and even doing histology stuff. Money is also a factor.</p>
<p>You mention ligament production; so, a muscle cell does this &quot;super-expression&quot; thing which produces a very strongly influential protein, which in turn causes that bone cell to start forming ligaments? Is this, then, how ligaments are actually fused to bone and muscle? They're all just grown out of/into one another? So I assume it is then a similar process for any time you have a sort of &quot;tissue gradient&quot; going on (for example, areas of different kinds of skin cells such as simple squamous to cuboidal or columnar)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So your bone cells come from various stem cells. Those stem cells are induced to differentiate (decide on which cell type to become) based on specific chemical signals in addition to cell-cell interactions. In fact, a big part of how cells orient themselves is based off of rubbing against and grabbing onto each other (such as in Notch) or protein gradients like Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.</p>
<p>In fact, the latter signaling pathway (Wnt/beta-catenin) is a very early indicator for directionality of cell populations (it keeps your organs from being placed in a reversed direction like in situs inversus) as well as which cells should migrate to the front (ventrally) versus the back (dorsally).</p>
<p>On top of that, many signals are derived from what's been mentioned (such as protein gradients, where the proteins in the proximal end of your ulna or radius are sending the most signal to the nearest cells at the more distal end of the bone or the most distal part of the humerus). That said, skin signals are pretty negligible for most bone cells since there's layers and layers of various cell types beneath. For the signal to reach, it would have to go through fibroblasts, skin stem cells, fat cells, muscle cells, immune cells, and many others first (where by then, the proteins are probably already broken down). There's some major exceptions to this (like how growth hormone from your pituitary affects organs all over the place as far as growth ) but then we have to decide if we're talking about paracrine signals (where cells influence cells in their near facility ) or endocrine signals (where signals are far reaching to cells on complete other ends of the body or near them simultaneously via blood distribution) or autocrine (where the signals released influence themselves! This is a big issue in cancer). A lot of development of an organism regards paracrine signalling and a lot of endocrine regards homeostasis in a much more developed organism, but there's of course exceptions. </p>
<p>On top of that, your ulna has an incredibly diverse population of cells (from osteoblasts and osteoclasts that are directly involved with bone remodeling to immune cell and blood precursors that are just stored inside). But this makes the conversation more complicated but all relates to cell cell interaction dictating them where to go. The fundamental aspect I'm getting at here is that these directions and influences occur at the cellular level and not at the larger bone level (the hip bone doesn't influence the leg bone, but rather the microscopic cell colonies on the edge of each influence each other). </p>
<p>Your final question, the answer is basically yes. During development, everything stems from the first fusion of the egg and sperm, leading to the first cell. When it divides several times over, certain cells take precedence on dictating development in certain areas. Now, I'm only a med student, but we've been told that how those signals originate are somewhat murky and probably have to do with epigenetic changes that affect the cells protein expression early on.</p>
<p>I hope that answers part of your questions  </p></div>		</li>

<p>That was awesome. Thank you. It answered it and then some. </p>
<p>I did know that we were talking the cellular level, so, as you said, nothing from the hip is going to be reaching the arm or anything like that.</p>
<p>The differentiation you mentioned; is that how labs are able to turn a skin stem cell into a bone cell or neuron by placing the cell onto a special plate with differently textured and pressured bumps and stuff? </p>
<p>As well, I heard that Turing even did some work on an equation (or something) that would be able to determine (or predict) how a cell could differentiate. Did I mishear, or is that true? If it is, do you know anything about it?</p>
<p>Finally, can you talk more on autocrine signals?? That sounds fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister and her husband are doctors and PHDs. He said they don't really know what causes the first cells to start differentiating. I thought about it and came up with that since everything is the same except the quantity of the initial 'goo' inside that would be what would signal the cells to start differentiating differently. The original cell would split and have less or even half of some kind of important goo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With bones specifically i think the structures they form have more to do with physical stress than ICF protein gradients (at least compared to other cells).  Osteocytes themselves are buried deep in their stroma (though this probably has less effect than i think due to haversian canals and canaliculi), but as you can see from the bone shape and histology of people with muscle disorders that prevent them from standing upright that stress affects the shape and structure bones.  Counterpoint, at least half of the bone shaping process is controlled by osteoclasts which prune away bone tissue, and I know their activity is controlled by interferons and there are multiple medications that mediate their activity administered by intracellular injection.  The more i think about it the more I think morgensengel knows more about this than me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My thesis work is addressing exactly this sort of issue, but in plants.  Basically how leaves are formed from an apical meristem.  What's fun is that plant cells, unlike animal cells, cannot move.  So, you get some pretty big differences in development, but it's still all about position and chemical gradients.  Plants tend to be more about hormone gradients, but you still get highly conserved gene families doing very similar things, e.g. homeodomain.</p>
