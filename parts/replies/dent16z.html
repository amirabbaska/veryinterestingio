<p>True, Earth will always receive more energy at the equator due to angle of incidence of sunlight. I took the question to mean when there wasn't such a large difference in temperature between equator and poles, ie. during global hot-house conditions. </p>

<p>OP was asking about when plant life existed at the poles. This occurred during the late Jurassic and throughout the Cretacous, well into the breakup of Pangea. Antarctica migrated south to be more or less centred over the south pole during the Jurassic. Parts of north-eastern Russia and the Arctic Slope of Alaska were situated well within the Arctic circle during the Cretaceous, between 70° and 85° N depending on when and which part in question, definitely subjected to a polar light regime of continuous darkness for at least a few weeks if not months, which is the issue at the heart of the original question. </p></div>		</li>
