			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, fat deposits in blood vessels, or <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/atherosclerosis" target="_blank">atherosclerosis</a>, is not restricted to the morbidly obese or even the overweight. Some degree of deposition builds up over time in all of us, though it is more likely to become severe and pathological in the obese. It is this process that leads to coronary heart disease and heart attacks, which is not restricted to those with high BMIs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atherosclerosis risk can absolutely reduced by eating well and staying in shape. There are other risk factors though, such as high cholesterol and diabetes that can plague even the fittest among us. So, partially it comes down to genetics, but if you look after yourself, your risk will be minimised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a stent, which is a metal mesh which kind of squidges your arteries open again (<a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/treatments/coronary-angioplasty-and-stents" target="_blank">https://www.bhf.org.uk/heart-health/treatments/coronary-angioplasty-and-stents</a>).</p>
<p>You'll also be on a cocktail of drugs at this point usually (statins, blood pressure meds), and honestly it's best just not to get to that stage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fat is not actually lining the veins like you might imagine bacon grease in your sink would. It's literally within the walls of the blood vessels, behind the inner surface, and it's built up there by your own immune system. The Wikipedia article on atherosclerosis explains it well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i read something once about how you don’t want to dissolve/disturb the arterial fat either because pieces of it can lodge into your heart or brain and cause stroke/heart attacks.</p>
<p>but i would assume dissolving it slowly enough that pieces didn’t fall off would be fine</p></div>		</li>

<p>fat tissue also needs oxygen and nutrients</p>

<p>Didn't know this. I thought fat just sat dormant and maybe needed a bit of hydration. So if I lose more fat, my muscles can use more of my intake nutrients? </p></div>		</li>
