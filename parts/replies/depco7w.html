			<div class="markdown"><p>They are made of sturdy metal and anchored into ground so when a train moving slowly can't stop in time it will bump into them and hopefully be stopped by them. They are just solid obstacle. Sometimes they can have springs in the bumpers (it looks like in this picture they have) to absorb the impact.</p>
<p>If hovever the train si moving fast, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Train_wreck_at_Montparnasse_1895.jpg" target="_blank">well</a>.</p>
<p>There can be stops like <a href="https://www.google.sk/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aldonco.com%2Fimages%2Fcategory%2FDerails-Portable.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aldonco.com%2Fstore%2Fc%2F59-Derails.aspx&amp;docid=DCmuZJP0capBEM&amp;tbnid=pdnVEKbyGZrOoM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=500&amp;h=415&amp;bih=1110&amp;biw=1920&amp;q=train%20derail%20device&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQmISor8nSAhVFIsAKHU-3D4wQMwg2KBUwFQ&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8#h=415&amp;imgrc=pdnVEKbyGZrOoM:&amp;vet=1&amp;w=500" target="_blank">these</a> used only for cargo trains. They are designed to derail the train and it will eventually stop by simple friction.</p>
<p>If you have more room you could use trainstop with sand (or gravel) bed before the actuall stop. Cover the rails with layer of sand. They are supposed to either gently derail the train or drasticly increase the rolling resistance to the wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some are also designed to slide along the rail, and have several stoppers attached to the rail at some distance after them. So, first, just the buffer slides, then the first &quot;collar&quot; on the rail is reached, which will make for more friction and more stopping power. One by one, the &quot;collars&quot; are reached, and the train is gradually stopped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Derails can also be used for passenger service. However unlike Buffer/Bumpers, derails are moveable so are often used in areas where you don't want parked cars breaking free &amp; rolling onto the mainline. In those situations passengers cars are most likely to be empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Derails can also be used on passenger trains. While derailing a train is risky, it's better to derail a passenger train than to have it, say, try to cross an open drawbridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most Americans who know a little about railroads will recognize the term &quot;Buffer&quot; as meaning those things. But &quot;Bumper&quot; is also acceptable. According to Wikipedia the official US term is &quot;Stopblock&quot; however I've been a railfan in the US for most of my ~30 years and reading that wiki article is the first time I've heard that term... I think &quot;Bumper&quot; is the more appropriate US term.</p>
<p>The most common Track End Device in the US is the Western Cullen Hays Bumper, probably why &quot;Bumper&quot; is more commonly used. <a href="http://www.westernsafety.com/products/wch-railroadproducts/BumpingPosts.html" target="_blank">http://www.westernsafety.com/products/wch-railroadproducts/BumpingPosts.html</a></p></div>		</li>
