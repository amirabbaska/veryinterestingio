Could you build a bomb that you yourself could not disarm/prevent from detonating the way it was supposed to?              </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, as just an electronics tech who has never worked with bombs, I can think of a couple ways of keeping a circuit live enough to set off a bomb after power is removed (capacitors are a great thing), and it wouldn't be hard to design a circuit to automatically trigger the bomb if it looses power. </p>
<p>Grossly over simplified, you design a circuit that sets multiple timers when you push a button. If time detonated instead of remotely detonated, the 'big' timer is the bomb count down (which you should not have any sort of display for...), then the other timers are short (say, a minute or so, 5 if you want to feel safer) that at the end of their count down trigger various sorts of 'dead man switch' devices so that if you start messing with the bomb, it goes off. </p>
<p>Push the switch, close the cover (if applicable), coat the whole thing in an hard resin (making it harder to get at and easier to trigger a deadman sensor that's tied to movement/vibration), and leave.</p>
<p>Considering an EMP to try and knock the whole thing out? an inductive coil and some diodes to control voltage flow can act as an alternative circuit that would be powered by an EM pulse and set the bomb off. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Why not? I think a display is a great asset for the bomb makers. Obviously it doesn't have to be accurate.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys, we have 15 minutes to stop the bomb&quot; And then it explodes at the 5:00 mark, killing the technicians.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For an example of this, see the LHC dump kicker magnets.  They <em>must</em> fire to divert the beam into the beam dump or Very Bad Things will happen.  (The results would be not unlike a bomb; the energy per nominal beam is 350 MJ, equal to 167 lb of TNT.)</p>
<p>Preferably the kick is in sync with the abort gap in the beam, but right away if things are bad.</p>
<p>There are 15 kicker magnets, each powered by capacitors kept charged, and if anything goes wrong with one of them, the other 14 fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm not going to give my credentials on this, but take my word for it. . .</p>
<p>it's all relative, because when you have a SCIF inside of a secure building, inside of a base protected by armed guards, and have 3 separate networks with no connectivity between them or to the rest of the world, there is still always that one network guy who will run a patch cable between them &quot;just for now&quot;, so he can make some changes tomorrow from the other site, and some project manager who cannot remember his 14 character password which changes every 90 days, so he'll write it on a sticky note and put it on the back of his badge, which I know damned well he leaves in the console of his car overnight.</p>
<p>sooo. you do the best you can, but if people are involved, you really just have to hope for the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never cared for this sort of &quot;hacking as a force of nature&quot; narrative.  Despite how it's usually portrayed in the media, hackers aren't magical people whose mental powers overwhelm the powers of the system, forcing it against its will to do their bidding.  They just take advantage of either human gullibility (&quot;hi, this is Bob -- oh, no Bob?  I meant Mike.  Can you give me your password real quick?  Thanks!&quot;) or software that lets people in freely (usually due to either misconfiguration by the users or mind-bogglingly obvious bugs in software written by idiots).</p>
<p>Writing software that doesn't let people connect and do what they want is not really as hard as the public has been trained to think.  Very few kinds of bugs can have that effect, and for a whole lot of applications it's not that difficult to design a system such that the parts that need to be secure are simple enough to be able to be mathematically proven bug-free.</p>
<p>I know, there are systems that have weird requirements that make all this difficult (though there shouldn't be).  My point is just that the public isn't getting the whole picture.  It's so often sold as &quot;nothing we coulda done!  Blame the hackers for your personal data being stolen.  Clearly we can't be expected to reliably stop them.&quot;  When really, it's usually just incredible laziness and unconcern on the part of those companies that makes our private data vulnerable, not some kind of engineering challenge that nobody has figured out how to solve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the same thing. A bomb is designed to explode. You can design a bomb that will &quot;fail-deadly&quot;, and it will still explode during failure. You cannot do this with computer security. While you can certainly design a fail deadly security system, where magnetic media are wiped by a powerful electromagnet, or dumped into corrosive chemicals, then while data did not fall into the wrong hands, it is permanently lost, which might be a desirable outcome, but usually not (if the data isn't important, why store it in the first place?)</p></div>		</li>
