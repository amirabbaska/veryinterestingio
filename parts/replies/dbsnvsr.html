			<div class="markdown"><p>Under atmospheric pressure dry ice (CO2) gains enough energy to jump between states easily from the ambient environment. Under higher pressure CO2 can be liquid at room temperature, kinda like what's inside a can of compressed air. The CO2 has such an easy time converting from solid to gas (at room temperature, atmospheric pressure) it doesn't have any time to dwell in a liquid phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other people here have good answers.  To further your understanding, Google phase diagram for CO2.  You'll see that it has to be really cold to freeze CO2, like -80C.  The triple point starts at -57C, 5.11atm.  So, basically, you have to have a higher pressure than 5.11atm and a little bit warmer than -57C to have liquid CO2.  At standard temperatures and pressures on Earth CO2 can only exist in gas phase.  It'd be like putting water ice in a furnace at 200C.  It would go straight from ice to steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That then depends on which conditions are necessary for the material to condensate into a liquid. I.e. temperature and pressure. </p></div>		</li>
