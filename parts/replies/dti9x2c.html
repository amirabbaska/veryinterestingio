<p>They are also fairly robust and hold up better to abuse when you have to use them everyday. </p>

<p>I used to work for a company involved in sports videography, and when people would discuss things like goal line technology (the ability to determine whether the ball/puck had definitively crossed the goal line resulting in a goal), this was lost on ... everyone.</p>
<p>I could very easily put together a tech demo of a hockey puck with the proper sensors in it to allow me to determine, electronically, whether a goal had been scored. I could possibly do it with equipment picked up from my local whatever-passes-for-a-RadioShack-these-days. The basics are not hard.</p>
<p>Now, make a deployable tech that will withstand freezing temperatures, repeated strikes against a frozen metal goal frame, being shot at 100mph, and stepped on by hockey skate blades many dozens or hundreds of times, and still work with several &quot;nines&quot; of reliability?</p>
<p>50% isn't good enough. 75% isn't good enough. 99% isn't good enough. When we go to Toronto for review, a technology failure needs to be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of event, or people will not trust the technology and may not even trust the sport as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do all these things btw. The military uses sensor packages on high powered guns with huge recoil without issue (like artillery). They usually use all solid state components and are filled with epoxy or other compounds so they become one solid object. I think trying to make one that both survives and weighs/performs the same as a puck is the problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the real issue here. Designing military tech is easier because they are not stuck with puck regulations and have an effectively infinite budget to develop and manufacture the stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The military also has the budget to routinely replace components that have an expected lifetime. And the manpower to do it.</p>
<p>Not to mention the R&amp;D budget (either directly or spread out into higher purchase costs) to do all the required testing.</p>

<p>I don't even think that's really the biggest challenge. It's more to do with cost. Any decent engineering firm could design, test, and arrange for manufacture of a &quot;smart puck&quot; that meets all the reliability and performance specs you could want. If the league/teams were willing to pay the cost for proper R&amp;D, testing, and the higher per-item component cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny you mention the size thing too. I've noticed a lot more people see &quot;big&quot; cameras as professional, even if they're not necessarily the right tool for the job, or not necessarily better.</p>
<p>I've seen guys out there with Sony A7Rs and small lenses shooting shots that could put almost anybody to shame, yet the camera itself looks like a cheapo point and shoot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, for sure the picture quality of an A7Rs would put what we shoot on to shame. But when really all we need is a shot that is in focus, framed correctly, exposed correctly, and white balanced correctly image quality takes a sort of back seat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they each have their place. Professional camera work, especially videography, is a lot different from consumer or prosumer work. Especially newscasting where getting the image/video is priority #1, and outright sharpness/quality isn't as important.</p>
<p>There's a reason why some of the most historically significant and compelling photographs aren't necessarily the most technical or high quality images. A lot of people get wrapped up in outright quality but don't realize that you can have the best camera and it doesn't matter if you don't get the shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ENG cams are 2/3 to 1 inch. No one wants a shallow depth of field on the six o'clock news. Now I also said in another post that these ENG cams usually use three sensors for each RGB color, and they capture 4:2:2 or 4:4:4 color. The megapixel count of an ENG cam will not exceed what is needed for 4K, which is 8 MP in most all cases. A great deal still only use 1080p cams.</p></div>		</li>
