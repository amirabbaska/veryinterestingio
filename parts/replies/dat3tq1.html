			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. In a movie, at a wide angle, most things will be in focus, much like our eyes, but the camera might be slightly sharper since most people don't have perfect vision or control over how much of the scene is in focus. But if the camera is close to a subject, then chances are that the background will be blurry, for two reasons. </p>
<p>1) Style choice. We prefer depth of field over everything being in focus, probably because it looks more natural. </p>
<p>2) When filming a movie, you're shooting at typically 24fps, so your shutter speed needs to be at least 1/24th of a second which means that your aperture needs to be larger to let enough light into the sensor. As a result, you end up with blur. Unless you're shooting under bright lights like the sun, it's pretty common not to have everything in focus because it requires a small aperture which isn't possible without enough light. </p></div>		</li>
