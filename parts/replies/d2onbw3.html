			<div class="markdown"><p>How? This is not my area of expertise, so I am sincerely asking. </p>
<p>The research that I do (not clinical research) almost always uses a within-subjects design. That is, each of my participants does &quot;condition A&quot; <em>and</em> &quot;condition B&quot;. But drug studies are necessarily between-subjects designs. That is, a given participant gets one drug <em>or</em> the other, then the groups are contrasted. So it's not clear to me how these studies could have data on whether a given individual would have responded better to one drug than another if that individual was only  given a single drug. How does the subgroup analysis yield these data?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For drug trial subgroup analyses, it's looking at more specific patient factors. So, in a very diverse trial, a subgroup analysis would check to see if the white males had a different % response or % side effects or whatever than the entire group. Or black females. Or males and females over the age of 65. Or those that had X pre-existing condition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subgroup analyses take the experimental group and stratify it by more stringent criteria, almost like inclusion criteria. They may look at how certain age groups in particular responded to the drug, or how certain comorbidites influenced the outcome within specific groups, what the patients disease grade is, and so on. So, while inclusion/exclusion criteria gives you a good idea of how broader populations (usually as similar to actual patients as you can get) might respond to treatment, subgroup analyses can identify if any patients within the whole benefitted, even if the overall results were not significant. The problem with subgroup analyses is just that - you lose the power to detect differences between the groups when smaller samples are used, and so subgroup analyses are often used to direct future studies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The usefulness is dependent on knowing ahead of time which factors are relevant. If it is a physiological difference unrelated to any of the things we commonly measure, it would be very hard to know whether it worked on some people and not other because of random chance or some other reason...but depending on the nature of the underlying difference, the distribution of effects could offer a clue to some unmeasured variable of importance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is not in the study design, it's in how others interpret the results later. A study might do subgroup analyses, but the media headlines may focus on the broadest finding of the study, neglecting the subgroup and individual differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is extremely inaccurate.</p>
<p>one study found that 80% of prescription antidepressants were given by non-psychiatrists. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there's a specific term in the context of clinical psychology or psychiatry. In experimental psychology the same basic idea is referred to as &quot;individual differences&quot;.  But I don't think that term would be commonly used in this context.</p></div>		</li>
