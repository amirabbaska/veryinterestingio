			<div class="markdown"><p>He means the black ceramic paint around the edges of the glass. A lot of time it will transition to the glass with little dots dithering. So parts of the glass that are made non transparent.  You could paint antennas in there since it's not being otherwise used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual reason is for the obscuration band is to protect the polyurethane adhesive that glues the glass into the vehicle from UV rays that will cause it to dry rot and lose its strength plus it is etched into the glass so it gives the adhesive a surface that it can adhere to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly. The obscuration band is printed black masking around the inner outside edge of the glass. Usually it goes all the way around the outside, and may hide (say) interior plastic moldings from being seen on the outside.
So if we look at a Ford <a href="http://autonetmagz.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-Ford-Fiesta-1.0-EcoBoost-Rear-Side.jpg" target="_blank">Fiesta</a> can you see the difference in shape between the outside of the glass, and the area that you can actually see through? It's quite a big difference on this car.</p>
<p>Premium cars (or better designed cars) generally have less obscuration and more viewable glass.</p>
<p>On the front window, obscuration may be used to hide the area where the interior mirror is glued on, or wires to the rain sensor etc.</p>
<p>Interestingly (for some) the band doesn't have a clear cut edge between black and clear glass. It blends rather nicely from black to clear using spec designed by each OEM. No two manufacturers use the same. Some are almost fractal in their design, other are just overlaid diamonds etc. Check it out, but you got to get real close, and people get weird about you staring closely at their car..  lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any other cool stories from being an automotive engineer or other technology? I recently got the chance to drive a 1982 Lincoln bill blass mark vi (a special edition of the most expensive Lincoln at the time) and the thing had so much cool stuff that wasn't standard for a while or never caught on. It had a thermometer on the driver mirror base, heated mirrors, all electric displays, quadraphonic surround sound, headlights that automatically​ dimmed when cars drove by, and a bunch of other random stuff I can't remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way the power is measured was changed in the early 70s such that the power ratings were closer to what a customer might see in the real world.  Prior to that, the power ratings were not realistic in the real world, for example it might have been measured without air cleaner, catalytic converter, muffler, etc.  </p>
<p>So a lot of those 60s cars were over rated, power​ wise.  </p>
<p>As for why that engine only makes as much power as a Corolla.... I have no idea.    However, consider that in 1990, Lexus 4.0L V8 made 250HP.  I guess it's double with less displacement, still lower than what a similar size modern engine might make.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What'd it use to detect that, in 1982? Ultrasonic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I built a home TV antenna using a 'fractal' design. This allowed me to make a relatively effective antenna in a very small space (15&quot; X 12&quot;), compared to the roof-top mounted antenna using a straight design which was 3' by 2'. </p>
<p>Did you use fractal techniques, or was that not available when you were doing your work?</p></div>		</li>
