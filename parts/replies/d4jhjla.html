It talks about how with no one to run the pumps the NY subway system would be flooded within a few days. Very interesting read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great book. If you'd like another, slightly more depressing look at these systems, I'd suggest the Long Emergency by James Howard Kunstler. It's about peak oil and the idea that we, since we're nowhere close to energy self sufficiency, will have to abandon large parts of our suburban sprawl. Also what we will no longer be able to run as our oil supplies dwindle.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were not close to self sufficiency because we dont try hard enough at it. If there was ever signs of us pulling the last bit of oil out of the ground, alternative energy plants would be popping up like starbucks. Nuclear, solar, wind, thermal, tidal, etc. We have the technology, its just alot of money to get everything up. But necessity is the mother of all creation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that the one that they made a series out of? Broke all post apocalyptic fiction for me a bit when they covered that without human intervention at nuclear power plants, cooling would not be provided and they'd go nuclear in ten days. Given how many we must have, the world and looting would be a very different landscape, metaphorically and literally.</p>
<p>Also impacted my zombie apocalypse plans. My first course of action would be to get out of the fallout zone. We gotta keep it real son.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It includes immediate drainage into some kind of sump. The sump pump will start when the liquid level gets high enough. I doubt that any tunnel under a bay will stay dry enough to not require pumping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the response I was searching for in addition to pumps. The sump can probably hold enough water to flood the tunnel before they even need to start pumping it out to begin with. I've seen examples in the past of standing water crossing a road during a storm but the driest place around is in the tunnel where the drainage and pumping system is enough to handle all but the most catastrophic conditions - which, we've also seen. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because, and this is just a guess, pumps are quite keen on electricity. Even a reasonably small one feeding a few hundred homes with fresh water consume a lot of electricity over a year.</p>
<p>Now, add to that the fact that any tunnel that you intend to use all the time needs redundancy. You can't just close down the only route westward from downtown just because the pump malfunctions. This adds up to double the initial investment.</p>
<p>Since no machinery with moving parts will ever work when you need it if you never fire it up, pumps tend to work in pairs. Or at least with a timer-switch that decides on a weekly basis which one is the master and which one is serving as a backup. You get twice the lifetime of the pumps, but once you have to do upgrades and repairs you end up being forced to repair them both at the same time.</p>
<p>Then, to make matters worse, in a large system you have to assume the worst; what if there is a power grid failure when you need the pumps the most? Well, add generators. They should also be paired, just to be sure.</p>
<p>Then, added to all this is you have to keep in mind that a large tunnel system has several outlets where they let the water out. What happens if one of them can't be used because there is maintenance done right next to the outlet? Then you have to have extra pumps to shift water from one section to another, so that you can use that outlet instead.</p>
<p>Most cities have no open water in the centre, so any tunnel system will have to be drained for quite a distance, sometimes miles, to get rid of the water. With pumps at reasonable distances.</p>
<p>Add to that the costs of maintenance of the sensors, machinery monitoring systems and the cost of the staff who has to be available around the clock for when a section is all of a sudden without power, the generators refuse to start and the water is sipping up above the traffic floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I don't know a thing about highway construction or tunnels but I am a journeyman plumber in canada and maybe I can lend an idea of why it would cost so much.  I'm assuming this highway system in Boston is at least 3 or 4 miles of tunnels and being so large and having so many commuters using it any major leak could be absolutely catastrophic and in a worst case scenario would result in loss of life.  In this case it would be wise to design an extemely thorough
, redundant and serviceable system.  </p>
<p>So assume you have 80 +/- heavy duty industrial pumps that at least half are running constantly you have electricity costs that would more than likely make your jaw drop.  The water that is being pumped is more than likely salt water, corrosion of all the piping system and pumps would be a constant issue, which would require crews to work all the time replacing/maintaining/servicing pumps and attached piping systems, these costs would be astronomical it requires specialized tradesmen working in confined spaces underground which is never cheap.</p></div>		</li>
