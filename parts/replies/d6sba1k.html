			<div class="markdown"><p>i think it's more of a fuel expenditure over time that grants smaller runners better distance. conversely look at the calves on a cyclist. cycling is in no way hypertrophic, and very much catabolic, and the cyclist benefits from being as light as possible, yet they have very large calf muscles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with you about the cyclists, at least as far as endurance specialists.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fxlUONa.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is the 2016 winner of the TdF - not so dissimilar from a marathoner's legs. </p>
<p>Compare this to some <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NJRc9mS.jpg" target="_blank">track cyclists.</a>  Certainly the fast speeds, shorter distances make a difference, but these guys spend a lot of time in the squat rack, too.  </p>
<p>I don't question the studies' conclusions about rep range variation/TUT giving similar results, but it seems like there's some minimum threshold for work over time to generate hypertrophy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has very little to do with fuel expenditure. </p>
<p>Cyclist's calves are defined due to a very low body fat %.</p>
<p>If you look at studies in rat models where a stimulus is applied at different frequencies over different rates of time, there is a point where the muscle cells stop responding in a hypertrophic manner (i.e. too much constant stimulus) and thus they simply prioritize nutrient delivery to maximize their ability to respond to the constant stimulus. This is called a &quot;tonic&quot; stimulus, where you have a very small dose given very, very frequently. This is most associated with endurance training in our considerations.  The cool thing is that the phenotypic expression of the myosin heavy chains in the muscle changes - it goes from being type II to only type I (the myosin heavy chain most useful for endurance activities).</p>
<p>Less tonic stimulation leads to greater levels of hypertrophy.  It's fascinating   You have greater expression of the bigger myosin heavy chains (type II), which is what strength training favors.  There's a lot of really great research on this, looking at individual muscles rather than the entire organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really exaggerated low vs high rep comparison and is also cardio not weightlifting. But anyway, Long distance runners run a lot of miles in training....a sample of Mo Farrah's training schedule (Olympic 5k and 10k gold medalist) showed that he runs 120+ miles a week. With that much aerobic exercise, it's difficult to maintain large muscle mass. In addition, acceleration is important in sprinting and added muscle mass gives more acceleration (additive effect). In long distance running, it doesn't matter how fast you get up to speed, it matters that you can maintain that speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but I would assume you would burn more calories over a 10km run than a 100m sprint, therefore retaining more mass.</p>
<p>Additionally 100m sprinters require explosiveness, rather than endurance, so weight training would likely be part of their routine more so than a marathon runner.</p></div>		</li>
