<p>Obligatory reminder - if your bicycle helmet has taken an impact, don't use it - get a new one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can stop the bullet due to the structural qualities of the ceramic and the hardness of the plate. Most plates are made of something like Boron Carbide, which is almost as hard as diamond. The benefit of an ultra hard surface is that when a bullet hits it, the bullet shatters. The plate also shatters a bit, but that's not a bad thing, considering the massive force that the bullet was carryingand that the splinters need to be stopped. A steel plate will also stop and shatter the bullet, but the force of the strike will travel through the plate more. This can lead to broken ribs and heavy bruising. Also the ceramic plate is half the weight of steel, which leads to better performance of the soldier wearing it. The negative aspects of ceramic are the increased cost of the plate and the reusability. If the plate is hit it needs to be replaced and any subsequent hits to the plate within 3 inches radius are less likely to be stopped. </p>
<p>I recall an episode of mythbusters that tested the bulletproof qualities of a car door and phone books. The car door wouldn't stop a 9mm, and nether would a phone book. But with a phone book taped to the car door, the bullet was stopped, because the hard but thin steel of the car door would shatter the bullet, but let the shatters travel through, and the phone book would catch the shattered remains of the bullet and keep the occupant safe. Same principle as ceramic plates, in theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually tested homemade ceramic bulletproof vests as well.</p>
<p>They bought squares of mosaic tile from a hardware store. Each 12&quot;x12&quot; square was made up of dozens of smaller tiles. They basically just taped a bunch of these squares into a vest.</p>
<p>It worked reasonably well if I remember correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ommiting the important information that is these bullet proof ceramics are only effective when used in conjucting with 10mm of polyethelene impact absorbtion material and the ceramic itself has to be bonded with several layers of resin... whats it called... material similar to fibreglass maybe kevlar... The ceramic alone is not enough to save someones life and even with the addition of the plastics not all the shock is absorbed. </p>
<p>Source: watched an episode of &quot;how do the do it?&quot; about 3 days ago where they made these materials in full. </p>
<p>Very interesting little video - ill see if I can find it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Basically, it diperses the momentum of the projectile by shattering into very fine pieces, instead of bending like metal does. </p>
<p>After shattering, the ceramic powder and shards have an effect of wearing down the shrapnel into much finer pieces.</p>
<p>It's a lighter weight alternative to the heavier, less mobile metal plates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the ceramic plate sometimes cracks after a hit.</p>
<p>Also note toughness and hardness are different qualities. </p>
<p>tough materials are usually more flexible and thus can disperse energy throughout greater area and withstand greater energy impacts. they usually deform (bend). </p>
<p>hard materials are usually more stiff, they more resistant to scratches but they crack/shatter on lower energy impacts as they cannot deform/bend to disperse energy.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is basically the perfect explanation.</p>
<p>Material in bullet proof vests is extremly specialized in order to stop bullets, but that specialization is a tradeoff; eg Kevlar is fantastic at dispersing energy, yet gets compromised by water or sunglight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only stop so much with soft body armor, both due to the limitation of the fabric as well as the fact that the energy isn't being dissipated enough and so it has to go <em>somewhere</em> (ie, you).</p>
<p>If you somehow could stop a rifle round with a vest, it's still going to break some ribs/collapse a lung and generally fuck you up assuming it doesn't kill you outright. It'd be easier and less bulky to have something that breaks apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kevlar is a thin fiber used in making bullet proof (but we should actually always say “resistant”) material. It’s only capable of so much though. If you wanted to make something absolutely bullet proof you’d basically have to make something that can neutralize all incoming force with equal and opposite force. This is truly a pure physics exercise. Physics is amazing.</p></div>		</li>
