			<p>This reminds me of a funny conversation I had last night... I told my son (9 yrs old) that I would go scouting for wood ducks this morning so we could hunt them this weekend... I made the comment &quot;I'm going to try that marsh in the morning, though I'm pretty sure that's more of an afternoon spot.&quot; to which he replied &quot;Wait, are wood ducks even out in the afternoon?&quot; After a long pause I said, &quot;Um, where else can they go? That's where they live... outside.&quot; The look of epiphany on his face was classic. </p>		</li>
