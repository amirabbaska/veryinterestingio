			<div class="markdown"><p>Other food for thought, if you bake a cake for an hour at 315 which is hotter? The cake or the cake tin? Obviously the tin will burn you immediately if you touch it but the cake wrong unless you hold it for a second or two. Same thing is happening, they're both the same temperature but metal is a conductor so it will let you know just how hot it is immediately. Cake is more relaxed, he'll let you know eventually but takes his time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why wind chill is a thing. A moving fluid transfers heat through convection rather than just conducting. This moves heat from you a lot faster at a rate that is proportional to the velocity of the fluid.  If they know the wind velocity, they can determine what temperature of still air would provide the same heat transfer and tell you it's 70 out but feels like 60. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I was in Phoenix, AZ.  The air temperature was above body temperature.  When the wind kicked up, it felt HOTTER outside, not cooler.  Wind &quot;heat&quot; rather than wind chill.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a good explanation the real answer is that you only feel the temperature of your own flesh. So indirectly the flux of the medium being touched is what is important; that is to say cold water will cool down your temperature neurons much faster than cold air, and so the water feels colder.</p></div>		</li>
