			<p>I would argue that many are disillusioned with the stock market. It's clear it's no longer the rational market of yesteryear (if that was ever really a thing) but more akin to the speculative casino atmosphere of the late 20's. <br><br>Right now all economic indicators say we are completely out of the recession but most don't feel that way.  Company stock prices might be rising quickly but it often doesn't seem to correlate with actual gains in the organization. Who wants to tie their future to that kind of uncertainty?</p>		</li>

			<p>You're right, the market is going to be jittery for a while yet following what happened a few years ago. Volatility indices were some of the highest readings they've been a few years ago but those indices have been leveling out more and more for the last two years, with the occasional spike here and there. We are definitely headed in the right direction. <br><br>The market is still a bit odd but the good news is that in my opinion it doesn't really seem overvalued. If you go to Google Finance and pull up the DJIA and set it to max view, take a look at the line. Take a ruler and use it to create an average centerline that bisects the noisy walk from left to upper right. While past performance is not a sure indication of the future, just by looking at the line you'll see that if all else constant we should be setting in he 17.2k to maybe 17.6k range. While the immediate gains are dramatic compared to where we should have been had he recession not happened stock prices are just about right, if slightly overvalued. We have to remember how much was lost in 2008... Many of these gains are still just normalization taking place. <br><br>The sad reality is that if most millenials had continued investing after the crash down to 6800, today they would have increased their 401ks by not only the amount they and their employers put in but also by nearly 300% return on the market. Anyone who did that has caught one of he largest instantaneous wealth increases in American history. </p>		</li>

			<p>Do the math and tell me I'm wrong. Here's a scenario I just plugged into Excel:  someone is 18 in 2008 and they manage to land a 20,800 a year job. Not hard to do in America even in this economy; by no means is that rich. This guy contributes 8% of his pretax monthly salary to a 401k which on his paycheck equates to about a $138 dollar monthly deduction. His employer matches this like so many do. Let's assume he never receives a promotion in his entire career but does receive annual raises over time that average around 2.8%. Starting his 401k at zero, because of compounding and record gains by 2014 his 401k has $59,404 in it. Now let's crank the interest way down and assume gains will be a more measly 6-7% over the next few decades. In 2039 at the age of 55 this guy will have accumulated $1,022,616 in his 401k. I did the math, and by no means were these assumptions overly ambitious. Because of compounding if he waits until age 65 to retire that will have grown to $2,155,528. At age 70 $3,097,898. I did the math. <br><br>When I started out I had nothing. I grew up in a poor community. I worked hard in high school and managed to get some scholarships to get me started in college but then had to take out considerable debt to finish it up. I remember breaking down crying when I was about 21 or 22 one night, absolutely overcome in fear and desperation of my situation. I managed to eventually get a good job and I paid off my debt and I saved. I saved and saved. I am telling you, I know this is possible. You just have to stick with it. <br><br>Check out /r/financialindependence<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Just because you got lucky doesn't mean it can work for anyone. As someone who worked 7 years in the food industry before starting a formal education, I can tell you that saving $138 bucks a month on 20k a year at 18 is the kind of knowledge you'd only understand much later in life. That seemingly insignificant 138 bucks is a fortune when you're a broke kid, and good luck convincing any working 18 year old to &quot;invest it&quot;. Anyone can make math work. Hindsight is 2020. People in my generation don't trust the stock market. We learned about the great depression, we saw the wall Street boom, and we saw the recession. The volatility is apparent and we are far more likely to invest in ourselves and our lives than in the potential for growth but a high risk factor of complete devastation. </p>		</li>

			<p>The thing is, and you can prove this out to yourself by opening up excel and doing the math yourself, even if you screwed up and didn't start saving until years later it is still possible to get to the million mark. Maybe you have to put in $270 starting in your late 20s instead of $138 a month but you can still get there. The late-start number doesn't get painfully large until much later in your life. <br><br>There are tools online where you can actually explore aggregated data on people's retirment accounts. If you belong to a retirment account your company likely provides this for free and allows you to see where you stack up compared to aggregate coworkers, their savings rate and on average over the years the kinds of returns people have actually been getting. Maybe this is news, I don't know, but if you look at that data nearly everyone has made quite a bit of money. Even if your market return was 0%, if you get an employer match you gain instantly at 100% right?<br><br>It's great to invest in yourself, especially in the area of education if it leads to higher salaries, but the only real way out of the hole is to save. It's a lot easier to do when you have a better salary, but it is still possible on some level regardless of where you are. It wouldn't be fun, I know that, but it is possible. </p>		</li>

			<p>And in 2068 $3M will be enough to buy a small used car, if along the way investment losses and fees don't take his stake to 0.  He's better off buying a junker, wrapping it in plastic and burying it somewhere safe for 60 years.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, that's an exaggeration. Based on inflation rates of the last 50 years, if I apply them forward to get a present value of money, the $3 million would be worth just short of $1 million in today's dollars. <br><br>Again, did the math....<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Do you think the value of investments just grows by itself? We're trying to address something much more fundamental than returns on stock investments. WHY are there returns on investments in multi-national corporations?<br><br>Slavery exists, it is rampant and it has poisoned our society and we chose to never get rid of it once and for all. Your profits are built on the backs of other poor, unfortunate souls like ones you claim to have once been. except they have no possible escape from their torment except to hope that those who have power see their plight.<br><br>It's good that you lifted yourself up, but it doesn't all have to be this way.</p>		</li>

			<p>But some jobs don't have 401ks or matching and people my age tend to job hop for various reasons. So I have an old 401k from another job and am in school for a professional degree for a year. Not really sure how that works out but admittedly, I haven't researched it hardcore since I have no income to contribute now.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can open a Roth IRA yourself if a company doesn't offer a 401k plan. <br><br>If you move from one job with a 401k to another company with a different 401k you can do what is called &quot;rolling over&quot; your original 401k's funds into your new 401k. The law requires employers to provide this mechanism. I think you have to invoke it within a certain timeframe of starting your new job though... Can't remember offhand. </p>		</li>

			<p>you did the math with numbers that may or may not happen in the future.  also you assume you'll never need to lean on those savings.  the reason more ppl aren't sold on this 'math' is because it's only true on paper.  <br><br>also what's your actual purchasing power with 3 mil in 50 years ?   is it compounded ? no. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well I used a very, very conservative series of numbers. I assumed someone in effect would continue making 20k adjusted for inflation over their lifetime, and that returns would equal 6%, which good mutuals on average have always outperformed by double. Tell me the numbers you want me to use and I'll recalculate. <br><br>$3 million future dollars in today's dollars 40 years out should be equal to a bit less than $1 million. Could you not retire on one million dollars?  Most could live off the interest alone....</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm pretty much on your side, but with one big difference.  You are greatly simplifying the psychological effect of the volatility of the stock market.  Don't forget the effect a recent huge recession has on people.<br><br>I started investing in the market around January 1999.  I did everything right.  I bought index mutual funds investing in the Dow.  Additionally, I bought a couple of tech stocks - including Iomega, which was the sole maker of the ubiquitous 100MB Zip disks that <em>everybody</em> used for everything, and balanced it with Bank of America, the most vanilla, safest yield stock there was.<br><br>Fast forward 10 years to 2009.  What's the situation?  Have any of you heard of the magneto-optical revolution that Iomega brought?  How about that conservative BAC stock...down 80%?!<br><br>January 2009:  Even my &quot;safe&quot; Dow index fund had produced -15% return <em>in ten years of investment</em>.  For pete's sake, I could have kept the money under my mattress and done better, and I envied all my friends who wouldn't have known an index fund from a hole in the ground.  <br><br>I had done the math <em>many</em> times, and 8%/yr historical blah blah blah said I was going to be a winner in the end...but the fact is that I had to make a decision to continue investing in the market based on <em>real</em> data which showed otherwise.  Believe me, that was a very difficult decision.  I'm glad I continued to invest in the stock market, but I was pretty much scared out of my wits and I can completely understand all of these 24-year-olds who feel it's just a huge scam.<br><br>My advice is - it's ok to be scared, but don't let that stop you from investing.  The market is only really going to work if you are able to invest regularly over time, so start small, and make sure to diversify as you grow.  The market is not a Ponzi scheme and the companies do produce stockholder value over long periods of time - even though there are periods of history where it doesn't seem like the case.</p>		</li>

			<p>Invest is just another way of saying saving your money. You're not opposed to that right?  Maybe the markets not for you, but you've still got to save and park that money somewhere. Whatever you do don't spend every last dime... You'll end up right where many Boomers are. </p>		</li>

			<p>Its not the same. Investment is purchasing a probability that a certain outcome will occur. Investment expects output either equal or exceeding input. Your argument is based on the idea that money needs to be constantly changing hands. If everyone holds onto their money you will have a depression. Investment is the mechanism which was invented for the purpose of creating that exchange and that economic activity while maintaining individual wealth. Saving, which also maintains individual wealth, would be me sitting on my fortune and not allowing it to exchange any hands. This, in your opinion, results in a depression. Investment is how that money can be saved with the illusion of security, because the probability of crash is relatively small. But the volatility of the market is infinitely greater than the volatility of my back pocket, while investment also offers infinitely greater return potential.The same ideologies that created the stock market and the corporatocracy prevalent in the United States and the greater western world are the exact reason we're in this mess in the first place. While your personal individual wealth and savings might be important to you, the systems that enable it are causing massive inequality and destroying the planet. There simply has to be a better option than spending my life working my ass off, having someone tell me what my life is worth on the open market, just to put all the fruit of that labor into an account i can't touch while i continue working so it magically becomes more money, so that after i'm old and cant walk and cant enjoy life that I finally have enough money to afford it. </p>		</li>

			<p>Even when you save money in your bank account, the bank loans that money out to others in the form of loans and other transactions. Banks never have the total sum of all required money on hand... They are using their account holders savings any way they want... It's only yours on paper. So it's all an illusion on some level, and saving is the same as investing except when you save you give nearly all of your money's power to the other guy instead of using it for yourself. Also you don't have to invest pretax you can also maintain trading accounts after tax / just maintain your own accounts which don't limit your access until later in life. Finally over at the subreddit I mentioned earlier they talk about legal tricks you can do to access even pretax savings early. </p>		</li>
