<p>Steam doesn't get any cut; they only get their cut when a game is purchased through their site.</p>

<p>Valve could have easily gotten a 30% cut from keys sold by 3rd parties by making a fee on creation or activation of keys. Or by batch-selling the keys themselves.</p>
<p>They chose the good guy way instead, and that's probably one of the reasons PC gaming is associated with Steam nowadays. It also created trading card farms and ruined exploration, since any developer can just give away free copies of a paid asset flip game just to get 5 cents from every copy &quot;sold&quot;. They changed the condition for card drops lately, so that's probably better now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of things Steam does right, but on the dev end, we seem to get the short stick. The developer interface for steam is terrible, hard to navigate and missing much-needed functionality. Additionally, parts of their store have been completely broken for years. We've made reports and complaints, Valve says they're looking into it, and it goes nowhere.</p>
<p>As for developers who take advantage of Valve's &quot;kindness&quot; and in some cases ignorance, they ruin it for the rest of the industry. Within the last 3 years, trust in developers has dramatically decreased on Steam. There's a ton of shady games out there right now on Steam, on EA, greenlight and fully released. It makes it hard for those of us who want to make a good game and are committed to it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I dont know if this is correct, i am guessing you might be able to tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've not heard of this happening, although, I haven't spoken with other developers about it. Our accountant didn't classify our sale through humble bundle as such, if it can be done, it will be different depending on where you're operating from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A request for a huge number of keys for a game with few or no sales on Steam.  That presumably inclines Valve to think you're up to something shady, like messing with Steam's trading card market by feeding those keys to bots run by card farmers.  I haven't heard of a legitimate developer getting a key request rejected, even for the large numbers required to do something like a Humble Bundle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off the top of my head, if Valve (Steam) thinks you're generating keys to resell on your own site (not allowed) or farming trading cards, or generating keys to give to bots to review your game.</p></div>		</li>
