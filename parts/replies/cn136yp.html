			<p>No one pays 800 dollars for a phone and 2000 for a TV. AT MOST, it's generally 300 with a recurring 100 monthly bill and 400 for a TV.</p>		</li>

			<p>It depends where you live and what are your taste. Hopefully you will see the point I made and not worry about the specifics. </p>		</li>

			<p>...actually, adjusted for inflation, my grandparents had a ~$2,000 television. <br><br>But I don't. </p>		</li>

			<p>Okay, so why don't you have any money then? I assume you've been saving at least ten percent of all your pay checks?</p>		</li>

			<p>Nope.  Expected income triples in three years,  and credit is cheap. </p>		</li>

			<p>Right. So not saving and get rich off other people's money. How's that working out for you?</p>		</li>

			<p>If by &quot;other people's money,&quot; you mean &quot;starting salary with a BBA in marketing from a reputable school&quot;, then the answer is &quot;pretty damn well.&quot;<br><br>Also, graduating with &lt;$20k in student loans, so that's pretty groovy.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's called &quot;education.&quot; Kind of expensive,  but perhaps you should try it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ma Bell was a harsh mistress - you could hit $5 in today's money on a single long-distance call.  Meanwhile,  an econobox with air and auto was 50 percent more expensive - and depreciated almost twice as fast. <br><br>And I'm pretty sure $25 at Anytime Fitness is outweighed by not dying at 62 like my tubby relatives. Stents are expensive. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's almost like the only way to not die is to join an expensive gym. I wonder how people did it before we had gyms?</p>		</li>
