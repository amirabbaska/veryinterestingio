			<div class="markdown"><p>These pipes, called 'standpipes', are located on every floor and by building codes ( depending on the country) define how much water needs to be delivered to each floor.    The standpipes my use existing water stored on a rooftop in a highrise, but typically their is an exterior connection on the ground floor where a fire engine with a large capacity pump will push water up to every floor.  <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/557883472566322909/" target="_blank">Good example of Standpipe and Sprinkler system connection</a> </p>
<p>Firefighter always carry their own hoses up to the floors to fight the fires, as the hoses usual on a floor weren't sufficient capacity and even worse, they probably aren't or weren't maintained.   <a href="http://www.truenorthgear.com/catalog/products/packs/high-rise-hose-strap" target="_blank">Typical hose rack</a></p></div>		</li>
