			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't water fairly heavy? I mean yes, recycling what you can in space is important but wouldn't dedicated O2 canisters be much lighter? $10,000 or so a pound to get things into space so it isn't insignificant. And either way you'd need a sealed container, and due to the hazards in space I'm assuming O2 and H20 canisters would both be made out of heavy duty (and just heavy) materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it depends.  Water is 16/18ths Oxygen, by mass.  If you need 100 kg of O2, you get 112.5 kg of water.  That's 13% more than liquid oxygen, but you can put it in a plastic bag that weight almost nothing.  To store the liquid O2, you're need a metal vacuum container which is likely to weigh more than 13%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's much safer to move water into space than a canister of compressed, liquid oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably much lighter too when you factor in the storage vessel. Water can be held in with pretty thin walled containers. liquid oxygen would need very high pressure containers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, humans turn O2 into CO2.  The ISS turns water (H2O) into H2 and O2 and then reacts the H2 with CO2 to make CH4 and O2.  The CH4 is flammable, so it's dumped into space.</p>
<p>Every mission to the ISS brings more water.  It's a really easy to get exactly the planned weight in a spacecraft, add a little more water or take a little less.</p>
<p>Airlocks bring the air back in, put there is always a little that leaks out.  They go to a lot of work to minimize leakage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a crazy thought: Heat regulation is a bitch in space. Could they use that methane as a sort of heat sink and dump it out when it reaches an ideal thermal saturation (Is that even a thing? Am I making shit up?)? Or does the ISS just not produce enough to even be effective in shadow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This made me think of the Martian where the supply ship they try sending to Mars explodes because the soy cubes melted and the resulting shift in weight from the liquid caused vibrations that broke it up. I know that is science fiction, but how does that hold up to them sending liquids like water up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A plastic bag in a cardboard box is pretty stable.  You have another sealed bag in the box, full of air, with a cardboard stiffener between them. If vibrations are an issue leaving Earth, you could just freeze the water before you launched.</p>
<p>That wasn't the most scientific part of The Martian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point was the vibration turned whatever they were sending into a liquid that shifted the load in the vehicle. Not exactly some crazy out of the world possibility. The liquid doesnt have to be water, it just needs to shift the center of mass of the vehicle then suddenly the rocket's thrust is pushing the center of mass in the wrong direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not analogous to shipping liquids to orbit. That scene in the Martian (IIRC) involved calculating the payload as though it was a solid, and the payload itself was uniform.</p>
<p>For these missions, they know that their non-uniform payload is liquid and &quot;pack&quot; it/calculate it accordingly</p></div>		</li>
