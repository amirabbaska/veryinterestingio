			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, that's all super interesting, so thanks for your response! Just a note on the city not intentionally trying to slow me down, that's the fascinating thing about it. I consider one road in particular a pretty major route between two interstates, and every light on it cycles like I described, and I can't particularly tell why, as there's never any traffic coming the other direction. I'm not sure if it's somehow intentional, an oversight, or what, but holy shit it gets old quick. Best guess would be that they're timed based on rush hour traffic and it stays that way all day, or it used to be necessary and no longer is. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Many of the synchronized lights are designed for traffic flow at the posted speed limit.  If you drive slightly slower than the speed limit you may arrive at each light at the end of the cycle.  Then you accelerate slowly and drive below the posted speed and hit the next light at the end of the cycle. </p>
<p>Try an experiment.  Accelerate more quickly to the posted speed, travel as nearly as you can to the posted speed, and see if you arrive on time for the lights. </p>
<p>On the flip side, if you drive faster than the posted speed and accelerate quickly, try accelerating a little more gently and following the posted speeds. Just like with driving too slowly, driving too quickly will get you to the light at the wrong time in the cycle for synchronized lights.</p>
<p>I spent several years early in my career writing software for traffic operations centers. Cities invest an enormous amount of money to reduce traffic times.  The most aggravating factor in traffic is not the lights, but the human variability.  Self-driving cars will fix so many traffic issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright so I live in Colorado and I will share my experience on the matter. Since I have lived here I have had 4 different drives to different jobs for at least a year at a time. On some smaller roads and speer street in downtown denver the accelerating quickly and maintaining the speed limit works great.</p>
<p>However, on other main arteries such as Arapahoe road, Parker road and 104th Ave, this simply does NOT work. The lights appear to be intentionally timed to stop you at nearly every light. On all of these roads I have tried different methods and kept track of which lights I get stopped at and it is usually all the same sequence of lights I will get stopped at. </p>
<p>The solution? 10-15mph over the posted limit. This, as long as you don't get stuck behind slower cars, will get you through 90% of the same lights without having to stop. I am not encouraging speeding but to me, this seems like a common theme in the area. </p>
<p>My tin foil hat theory is that if they want us to stop at more lights, waste more gas and therefore the state gets more gas tax money. (This probably is not true and it is most likely just poor design)</p>
<p>This morning for example, I was following behind 2 cars I could not pass but both were accelerating quickly to the speed limit and staying there. At 7 different stoplights (over a total of 6 miles of driving) we were just barely too far back when the lights would turn yellow. If we had been going slightly faster those lights would have changed after we went through them. </p>
<p>I wish Colorado would work on this because I have been to many states that have properly programmed signals and that feeling of driving for a mile without having to stop is nonexistent here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, as long as you drive faster than the speed limit by some multiple of the speed limit you should be just fine in that case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant speak on any professional level. But I ubderstand your frustration. My town is built along two highways. Or rather it was built and then two highways ended up crossing inside of it. Our main street, aka Broadway actually IS highway 50. So i understand it being somewhat prioritized. But another often used street crosses it in front of my current workplace. Were the corner store and Ive often found myself bored to death and counting the seconds to a terribly imbalanced street light. The highway light at peak hours is often green for around 90 seconds at a time and its crosspath sees roughly 30 seconds during this same period. During slower periods these averages drop to 50ish seconds and 10ish respectively. And even more so, I once watched the highway light sit on green for a full 70 seconds while 3 cars drove through it. Making about 12 cars wait on each side of the cross path (blocking off the entrance AND exit to our drivethru i might add) just to have it switch for a measely 9 seconds. This continued for 5 cycles before it went back to its normal 50:10 ratio. I could practically hear the blood boiling in that line. </p>
<p>Edit: This specific light is meant to be of the second variety listed above. Where the vehicle sensors send signals to the light. I know this because A: Our town council made a rather large deal of this fantastic upgrade when we got it way back when. And B: I have sent a letter of complaint due to the issues it regularly causes with my stores business and my drive home (as have many others for their own personal obstructions by said light) and the response given to me and another coworker were that the light was the highest tech light in town and it knows what its doing we ahould trust that they know more about the traffic than us lowly fast food workers. (In politer terms of course.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like the light where I live, a &quot;shortcut&quot; goes through residential area (which I happen to live in the middle of) and despite speed bumps and low speed limits, is still attractive, so they get the idea of making it hell for everyone involved. At rush hour, the line can stretch back almost a kilometer. It's insane. there is a short green and the problems really start if there is competition because almost all traffic needs to turn left. There is a dead end on other side but there could be traffic coming, could be pedestrians, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you live somewhere with a decent government admin overseeing the lights, contact the appropriate official. Sometimes the department is so busy with regular or new projects that it unintentionally drops the ball when overtime the lights slowly get out of sync.</p>
<p>My route to work a few years back was similar to yours. I hit every light going the posted speed. I took pictures at every light and noted the time. Put all of it in an email and it didn't take long to get the lights reset. (Of course I was a practicing local government attorney at the time, so that might've helped speed up the process if they knew who I was. But a tip would be to say something like&quot;I hope I'm contacting the right person. If not, please let me know who I should contact. Would it be better to contact my city council about this?) Typically gov admin workers don't want unneeded attention from the governing body. So the mere mention helps things move along. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NB: The ability to adjust timings on the fly from the control centre is actually really cool. There was a major accident on a freeway a few months ago, and in minutes they were able to reprogram all of the lights along a parallel road, so that you'd get a solid 4 or 5 minutes of green and they could reroute the highway traffic down this side road without any major backups. </p></div>		</li>

<p>if you have a minor road intersecting a major road, there may be sensors placed on the minor road, so that the lights only cycle when there is a car waiting to cross.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to crucify the engineers who give that minor road instant service instead of letting them wait 20 seconds for a couple of more cars.  When it's on the instant service system, those lights are constantly getting triggered and the intersection is always a bottleneck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's implemented well, there will be a timeout. Like, if you pull up to the minor road side, it'll go right away. But then it will wait 120 seconds before it goes again, no matter if a car pulls up only 10 seconds later. It's easy to notice in the middle of the night, when you pull up to a red and it changes right away. If you pass through the intersection and then turn around and go back, it probably won't change for you right away again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any system to prevent the light triggering for someone turning right? </p>
<p>Also, on the main road where I live I've noticed, going the speed limit will get you red lights. Speed limit is 45mph. I have to go somewhere betwee 50-55 to make the green lights, actually yellow lights. And it's almost impossible to get a green if you hit a red. I don't have a super car, just a little 3.0 inline6. It doesn't have the HP required to go from a red light up to 55mph fast enough to get the next green light. You have to just get lucky and start with a green and then maintain 10mph over the posted limit. </p>
<p>Please come to my town as a consultant. Lol. </p></div>		</li>
