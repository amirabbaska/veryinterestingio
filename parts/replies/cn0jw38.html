			<p>I used to work retail man, I've seen my fair share of crazy. Enough to know that retail is not what my job could end up being hahah.<br><br>Story from when i was a 'courtesy clerk' at a grocery market chain in the PNW<br><br>I once had to try to unlock a car ... for a woman who forgot her keys in her car. The window was open enough that I could get my hand in... But I realized I could not legally do so. So she tried to grab them ... and then I realized that SHE HAD NO FINGERS. Some how, for some reason, all gone.<br><br>I couldn't help her and she had to wait for her husband, in the cold. I was commanded to go back to other customers. I was ordered to abandon an old finger less lady in the cold.<br><br>Her spirit was not dead! She took it all in stride. The lady you ran into ... people do not act like this unless they have been deeply hurt in some way. They lash out at the whole world because of it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup. I worked retail and it made me hate old people, especially old women. They were selfish, didn't want to learn anything new, had no patience, couldn't do something as simple as scan a screen for the button they wanted unless you told them &quot;scan the WHOLE screen,&quot; they were all fat, had this awful fake blonde hair. If I become like that when I'm old, then shoot me. Please.</p>		</li>

			<p>Their group psychology is actually most similar to that of a screaming baby. Thats what they get for being the most effective demographic ... oh well they're all dying :D<br><br>Granted, there are MANY who do not fit this stereotype who are from that age range. Many of the greatest voices decrying economic inequality in recent years have been from that age group. Many have been from ours too. Its interesting.<br><br>Its essentially... instead of a class war, its a generational war. Standard rules say defeat enemy to win. But what if you could cooperate against the system that set you at war in the first place?<br><br>The last 10 years sure have been a journey into the unknown haha</p>		</li>

			<p>The rich and powerful fucked us over, not the baby boomers. Many of the rich and powerful just happened to be baby boomers. The generational divide is just another &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactic, just like racism or sexism. Don't buy in to it. </p>		</li>

			<p>The baby boomers elected those people into office that allowed the rich and powerful to take over. It most certainly is their fault considering they are the ones latching on and promoting the ideals that millennial are lazy and don't deserve anything.</p>		</li>

			<p>I would add to this that they allowed themselves to be fucked over because of the sudden easy availability of credit. When I was a kid in the 80's getting credit was fairly hard. 10-15 years later every store has its own credit card, banks are handing out credit lines just for opening up a checking account and credit is easy to get.<br><br>Because of this it became possible for a person making less money to own better things, take a nice vacation, have a decent car etc.Through credit you could live a lifestyle that was above how much you actually earned so it didn't feel as bad earning less.<br><br>Eventually, those bills came due. Housing prices went through the roof, cars got much more expensive, education costs skyrocketed and the answer to the problem was to get more credit. It seems now to be reaching critical mass where the debt is simply overtaking everything and those who are choosing not to bury themselves in it are finding themselves with a job that doesn't allow them to afford much of anything.<br><br>Had credit not been so easily available and people were forced to pay cash for more things I have a feeling there would have been more demands for higher wages.</p>		</li>

			<p>I wish boomers would all retire and make some room in the job market. For whatever reason they didn't save any money and are working in their 50s'/60s'+. <br><br>They're GOING to retire soon and the flood gate for jobs is going to open, but that's of little consequence to those of us who can't find a goddamned job right now. <br><br>I can't help but resent the baby boomers. They control the gates of employment both by filling them and by being the actual people in charge of the hiring process. <br><br>What's wrong with the hiring process? After having searched for a job for a few months I've noticed every goddamned job wants someone with 5+ years experience. The boomers have decided they don't want to work with millennials. They don't want to invest in entry level positions. Instead they sit around on their asses waiting for a boomer to come fill their position, or an Xer at this point, so they don't have to pay them to learn the job. They'd rather the job be unfilled for a year than create an entry level position. <br><br>Every single portion of the equation is infuriating. Millennials have been lied to and abused.  </p>		</li>
