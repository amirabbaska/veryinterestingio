<p>It seems it might be even more recent, due to increased trend in manufacturing of foods that have extremely high sugar or high trans-fats, cheap to make in abundance along with the increased technology that has allowed us to be less active in our work. Before the turn of the 19th century, most jobs were physical labour and most foods were less energy dense.</p>
<p>Seems that a lot of different factors lead to high percentage of obese people. In the 1980s the idea that was propagated was that fats were extremely bad for us. Then you had all these products coming out introduced as lighter &quot;low fat&quot; varieties which had more sugar and salt or flavoring to make them still taste as good as the full fat ones. Sugar is the main contributor to the obesity epidemic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to have too much food when there are advanced preservative methods. With modern food processing comes the ability to store seasons upon seasons of food for <em>years.</em> And now that food moves globally with ease, there's effectively no end to the growing season for countries that import food and grow their own as well. A place like the United States would have to collapse as a society for food shortages to occur. The only modern instances of this have been in the aftermath of hurricanes, and those are quickly alleviated by emergency food distribution programs.</p>
<p>If we didn't have the ability to so effectively preserve our harvests, we would be much more likely to suffer occasional shortages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually kind of amazes me that I can eat some meat or fish that was tinned over 2 decades ago and not only is it still edible but often still tastes fine too.</p>
<p>There's a youtube channel where a dude eats old ww1/ww2 ration packs and it's really suprising how some of the stuff in these packs (which were designed to be non-perishable and long-lasting, heat resistant etc) are still totally edible after 70+ years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Far too little credit is given to the discovery of the Haber-Bosch process, which allowed the 'fixing' of Nitrogen. The availability of industrial scale nitrogen production allows for the mass production of gun powder, explosives, and FERTILIZER. Without industrial fertilizer, the world would still be struggling to recover from WWI. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing how Fritz Haber pioneered this process, and also was an enthusiastic chemical warfare practitioner.  After one particularly effective gassing in ww1, his wife could not longer live with being married to a mass murderer and shot herself <em>with his service revolver</em> when he was home on leave from the war. Wow. </p>
<p>Also he invented Zylon B, although not for the terrible thing for which it was eventually used. </p>

<p>His inventions took many lives, and saved many many more.  </p>
<p>Extra plot twist:  He won the Nobel prize.  <em>After</em> gassing the allies.  </p>
<p>Extra extra plot twist:  He was Jewish, and had several relatives killed by his own invention.  o_0</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, not to cite the bible as a literal source in any way, but there's literally a story of some king being stabbed in the gut and his grossly fat belly oozing out around the makeshift sword.</p>
<p>So even if that exact person didn't necessarily exist exactly as that story describes, there clearly were people that fat back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolute bullshit.</p>
<p>Obviously only a small portion of the world's population had access to the kind of good resources that are required to be obese, but it's not some magical unachievable feat. Henry the 8th was absolutely obese, and while he was extreme he wasn't at all unique among the ruling classes, nor was he anywhere near the first of his kind. </p>
<p>I'd hazard the guess that as a proportion of people who actually has access to enough food there would have been significantly higher throughout most of history than it is today. People have always had the same desire for sugar and fat, it's wired into us.</p></div>		</li>
