			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay! I got it.</p>
<p>At first I was a little confused because speed is relative and you can't get velocity without speed, but then I realized the speed of light is the same for everybody so you can judge an objects velocity using the speed of light as a base...</p>
<p>... ... Nevermind, I'm still confused as hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The figure u/harper_kentucky linked is a galaxy rotation curve - i.e. how fast stars orbit the centre of the galaxy, so the velocities are measured relative to the galaxy itself.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can measure the speed of stars with spectrography. That's a lot to go into.</p>
<p>But you can get mass from that velocity with Vc= Sqrt (G M/R)</p>
<p>Where G is a constant, and R is measured (just distance from the center of the galaxy). The circular velocity at that R will tell you how much mass is inside R.</p>
<p>This gives you the mass inside that radius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, same way we do within the solar system. If we know the velocity of an orbiting object, we know the mass of the main object.</p></div>		</li>
