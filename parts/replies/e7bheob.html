			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking! That seems intuitive, right? We know there are these huge, multi-millennia effects that gradually shift our climate--so why isn't that just happening right now? We need to consider a couple different things to address this, so bear with me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First, we know absolutely that we're pumping CO2 into the atmosphere at an extremely high rate. Nobody is doubting this. It's just a known fact of what happens when you burn fossil fuels. We also know, without any doubt, how CO2 interacts with light; this can be observed in the environment, and perfectly replicated in the lab--CO2 allows visible light to pass, but absorbs infrared radiation and turns it into heat. That's what the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; is, and, again, there's absolutely no question about that science. So it's known absolutely that greenhouse gases are increasing, and we know absolutely what the effect of that is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Second --But, as I mentioned before, climate is incredibly complicated, and how do we know the current heating is due to increased greenhouse gases? Well, even though it's hard to accurately predict the magnitude that the other causes of climate change have, we do know which ones contribute, and which ones detract--and it's relatively trivial to track volcanic activity, sunspots, and the tilt of the earth. And if you just look at these factors, the earth should be cooling slightly right now, as discussed in <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GISSTemperature/giss_temperature2.php" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Third, We can look at the <em>rate</em> of temperature change that we're experiencing, and the only climate change factor it corresponds with is the increase in greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution. This relationship is elegant;y shown <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GISSTemperature/giss_temperature2.php" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that that the illustration at that link is not from a peer-reviewed article, but the author is a former scientist and engineer for NASA, and the information is very easy to fact-check, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any more questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have much to add but I have to say that this is one of the most succinct pieces of information I've seen describing how we know, factually, that we are contributing to a warming/changing climate.</p>
<p>I'd like to reference it in the future when people are asking similar questions as the person above you.</p>
<p>Thank you for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's happening way too fast to be natural. A good example is if a 5 year old grew a beard and started doing taxes. It's occurring way too fast to be even remotely normal or part of any natural cycle. So now when you hear someone say &quot;it's not humans, it's the natural cycle&quot; you know they are wholly ignorant and unaware of the timescales it takes for natural changes to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not at the speed it is occurring. Natural change takes thousands to 10s of thousands of years. This is happening in decades.</p></div>		</li>
