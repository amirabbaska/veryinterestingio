<p>Yes. When the mechanical nociceptors in the bladder start to stretch, that's how your brain knows you have to pee. When astronauts go into orbit (where gravity is much less, and therefore the bladder can get much fuller before it stretches to &quot;I have to pee&quot; levels), it's not uncommon for them to take humongous (like half-gallon) pisses. </p>

<p>From googling around, it looks like the lungs only have them on the outside. </p>

<p>Bullets (especially hollow-points) tend to transmit force over a large area.  So yeah, you'd know it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember in A&amp;P learning about referred pain. How does that fit into this discussion? It was one of the coolest things I learned about in that class, but we just touched on it as a random bullet point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it due to the pressure on the cranium from brain swelling due to increased blood flow to the brain and a lack of blood flow from the brain, basically receptors lining the inside of the cranium.  Which is why our head hurts but not actually the brain?  Idk if that's what the meninges is...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because tissues near the brain have pain receptors: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The brain itself is not sensitive to pain, because it lacks pain receptors. However, several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain. These include the extracranial arteries, middle meningeal artery, large veins, venous sinuses, cranial and spinal nerves, head and neck muscles, the meninges, falx cerebri, parts of the brainstem, eyes, ears, teeth and lining of the mouth</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A headache usually isn’t your brain hurting. The pain you feel might be in your sinuses (allergies, illness, and weather can cause this) or it might be your scalp/neck muscles (tension or fatigue, generally. The way the pain of a headache radiates definitely makes it feel like it’s your brain that hurts, though</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correction, a headache is never due to your brain hurting as the brain has no pain receptors in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this correction, thank you. A Meissner’s or Pacinian corpuscle, hair plexus, etc. is not a nociceptor. This changes the overall answer, too, because it means that we can’t feel organs rubbing together due to their lack of mechanoreceptors, not because of a lower density of nociceptors and the reduced perception of continuous sensation.</p></div>		</li>
