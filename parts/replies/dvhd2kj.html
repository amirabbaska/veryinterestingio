			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the typical movie scene, someone is severely injured (e.g. soldier) and the others desperately try to keep him awake because as soon as he falls asleep, he is dead? Is there any truth to this </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reality and Movie Reality are two different things and often don't have any connection.  In a movie, the person is forced to stay awake because it's part of the story and creates tension and drama.  </p>
<p>The way Movies/TV Shows typically depict CPR, being knocked out, amnesia and so on, is nothing like reality.  They are tropes to progress the plot.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if someone is bleeding to death and they say “ come on stay with me.” It’s alright for him to pass out? It wouldn’t have made any difference on his survival rate if he stays awake or not? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More simply, on a screen an unconscious and a dead person are indistinguishable from each other. One mustn't fall unconscious after a trauma because the viewer can't tell if they're dead or not.</p>
<p>Medical dramas don't use this trope very often. Maybe for realism but if Dr House is realistic I dunno what's real anymore. More likely, I'd guess it's because in that setting you have other ways to tell if someone is dead. Crash carts and such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably more for the character's personal comfort. If he's awake, he definitely isn't dead yet. If his eyes are closed, he might be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely a movie thing to get some drama from an actor. People don't just die. If someone is shot, even in a major artery, they will bleed and scream for a few minutes before dying. One of the more perverse ways this was used is during a guillotine execution, your head might be lifted up and shown to the crowd and your own body - sorta. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably based on description of the event if it was witnessed and the initial examination. I expect experienced enough doctors can kinda gauge which kinds of head injuries are more at risk of developing into life-threatening situations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One tool we use, for example, is the Canadian Head CT Rule, which is a gauge to determine if a head trauma is significant enough to warrant the radiation exposure associated with a cat scan.</p>
<p>It is applied to any adult not on blood thinners and who hadn't experienced a seizure after the injury, who experienced a loss of consciousness, some level of amnesia to the trauma, or confusion. If they have any of the above you just scan the patient. Beyond that if they have a Glasgow Coma Scale (another tool) less than 15 two hours after the event, evidence of an open or basilar skull fracture ( crepitus or basically the feel and sound of bone giving way when pressed, blood behind the ear drums, intraorbital bruising, bruising behind the ears, leaking cerebral spinal fluid from the ears / nose ), are over the age of 65, or have had two or more episodes of vomiting then you scan.</p>
<p>Also if they can't remember more than 30 minutes before the event.</p>
<p>There's also what's called mechanism of injury, meaning some things are so dangerous, they're likely to cause brain bleeding just based on how they happened: if they fell more than three feet, or five stairs, or they were not in a car and got hit by one, or if they were thrown from a car.</p>
<p>All these things are indications that can be performed independent of them having to stay awake for some extended period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can watch the symptom progression.</p>
<p>When I had my concussion a few years back, for example, I hit the back of my head on a hightop table while fetching a pingpong ball. Not super hard, by the way. Apparently just the right amount of force at just the wrong spot. Anyway...</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, obviously my head hurt, but my memory was fine. Knew who I was, where I was, my birthday, etc. I wasn't slurring and my balance was fine. That right there was a good sign. If the headache hasn't returned the next day, I would have been completely fine.</p>
<p>But it had. I had light sensitivity and thinking hurt, too, but my memory was still fine, no slurring or balance/coordination issues, no nausea, etc.</p>
<p>This was a mild concussion, mind, but just from looking at which symptoms presented when and how can tell you a lot without doing a scan.</p></div>		</li>
