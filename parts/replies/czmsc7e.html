			<div class="markdown"><p>There are challenges when you get this large, such as the time it takes for force to move across an object.  </p>
<p>(Im not an expert, so someone may expand on this)</p>
<p>Force can move across an item at the speed of light (Ish) but cannot exceed that speed.  You have these very heavy guide cables, all holding the circle to the earth. You push on northern part of the ring, and it moves the ring slightly during the time it takes for the force to reach the other side of the ring, where the guide cables hold it in place.</p>
<p>This would break things, since nothing is unbreakable.  </p>
<p>(Feel free to tell me all the ways I am wrong)</p>
<p>Edit: speed of sound through the material, not light. =] thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the speed of propagation of a force or impulse in a solid is the speed of sound. So the case you propose is stronger. 6 orders of magnitude stronger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be really interesting to see. A structure that is floating above, and being held to the earth by guide wires. The wire are not holding them up, but rather holding them down.</p>
<p>Interesting... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the ring would have to be much bigger or else it wouldn't be a perfect circle. 1000 feet is not that high. It will be towering above the oceans but smacking into coastal skyscrapers. </p></div>		</li>
