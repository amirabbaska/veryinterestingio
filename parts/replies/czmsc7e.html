			<p>So could we theoretically put something to keep it in place, like guide cables. </p>		</li>

			<p>There are challenges when you get this large, such as the time it takes for force to move across an object.  <br><br>(Im not an expert, so someone may expand on this)<br><br>Force can move across an item at the speed of light (Ish) but cannot exceed that speed.  You have these very heavy guide cables, all holding the circle to the earth. You push on northern part of the ring, and it moves the ring slightly during the time it takes for the force to reach the other side of the ring, where the guide cables hold it in place.<br><br>This would break things, since nothing is unbreakable.  <br><br>(Feel free to tell me all the ways I am wrong)<br><br>Edit: speed of sound through the material, not light. =] thanks.</p>		</li>

			<p>I believe the speed of propagation of a force or impulse in a solid is the speed of sound. So the case you propose is stronger. 6 orders of magnitude stronger. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I believe the speed of propagation of a force or impulse in a solid is the speed of sound<br><br>Yes, but the speed of sound depends on the physical properties of the material. The speed of sound in steel is something like 17 times the speed of sound in air, and only 5 orders of magnitude lower than the speed of light.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;only 5 orders of magnitude<br><br>Well continental drift is only about 9 orders of magnitude slower than your running speed. The age of the solar system is only about 7 orders of magnitude greater than your age. Bill Gates has only about 5 orders of magnitude more money than me.</p>		</li>

			<p>Don't worry,  I understand that you said &quot;only&quot; because you were comparing 5 and 6. Don't let these guys get to you with their tectonic plates and billionaire philanthropists. </p>		</li>

			<p>This would be really interesting to see. A structure that is floating above, and being held to the earth by guide wires. The wire are not holding them up, but rather holding them down.<br><br>Interesting... </p>		</li>

			<p>Also the ring would have to be much bigger or else it wouldn't be a perfect circle. 1000 feet is not that high. It will be towering above the oceans but smacking into coastal skyscrapers. </p>		</li>

			<p>What if it wasn't a circle...how big a circumference of a partial circle can we get away with to allow a stable orbit? E.g. sattleites</p>		</li>

			<p>It would have to fully encircle the earth. </p>		</li>

			<p>Orbits aren't about altitude.  Orbits are about velocity.  Unless you're spinning this ring like a bicycle wheel, it doesn't matter how big of a circumference it has.</p>		</li>
