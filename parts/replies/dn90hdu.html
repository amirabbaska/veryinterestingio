<p>Anyway, one of the many lies he told me (like diving onto a grenade in Bosnia) was that he hadn't slept in over six weeks.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure it was bullshit then but you just convinced me. Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason why you can't 'pre-bank' sleep ahead of having a sleepless night. </p>
<p>It's almost like imagining that your body needs a constant threshold of X hours of sleep a night to function at its best. If it gets any number less than that it will have an effect on the next night's sleep. If it gets more than that threshold it likely will not make a difference for the next night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can't &quot;pre-bank&quot; sleep prior to a completely sleepless night, but you can do it for a night you expect to get very little sleep.</p>
<p>For example, I can sleep 7 hours on Saturday to Sunday night, feel fine, then take a 3 hour nap on Sunday afternoon and 3 hours of sleep on Sunday to Monday night and I would feel well rested the whole day on Monday. </p></div>		</li>
