			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc apes have shown the understanding that a person has different knowledge to them. A test was done with an ape watching a man get &quot;attacked&quot; by a second man. The attacker hides behind screen A and the victim leaves. The attacker swaps to go behind screen B. The victim returns and goes towards screen A. O can't remember how it was tested but the apes showed they <em>expected</em> the victim to think the attacker was behind screen A rather than making the assumption that, because the ape knew, the victim knew of the swap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, there's very few instances of animals asking for information. 2 I can remember are Koko once had a question, can't remember what it was though, and Einstein the parrot once asked what colour he was.</p>
<p>Only instances I can remember, although I don't doubt there's probably a few more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's some scholarly source out there, but I'm at work, so if I remember, or still care to, later, I'll source this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the poster but if you're interested in the intelligence of corvids here's a link that cites many studies that demonstrate a lot of really amazing cognitive skills. Corvids are among the smartest non-human species out there.</p>
<p>Some of the really interesting stuff is the mirror test, tool usage, teaching (passing along the knowledge of tool making for specific tasks), cooperative behaviour and the test that indicates they have some awareness of point of view. This article gives links to each study and I encourage you to look at the methodology to form your own opinions. It's worth keeping in mind that even if something appears to prove a cognitive trait you still have a lot of philosophical questions about whether we can be sure that the observed behaviour proves i.e. legitimate comprehension of the traits we **think** the study demonstrates.</p>

<p>Edit: Correction, they cite the studies many may not be readily available to read yourself without a bit of research.</p></div>		</li>
