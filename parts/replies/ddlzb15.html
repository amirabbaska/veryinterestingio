			<div class="markdown"><p>Ratios of frequencies are not reliably correlated to dissonance. If it was a direct correlation, 1:0.99999999999999999999 would be extremely dissonant, in fact it sounds identical to unison (to the human ear). There is a range of frequencies called the &quot;critical band&quot;, which determines which frequencies will be heard as dissonant, vs. identical, vs. harmonizing. The width of the critical band changes throughout the range of human hearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From your own link &quot; Examples of perceptual universals include pitch perception, octave generalization, categorical perception of discrete scale pitches, melodic stream segregation, and perception of melodic contour&quot;</p>
<p>This is what I'm talking about. The universals and how they match up with the math.</p>
<p>The example of 1:0.99999999 being dissonant is taking the argument to the absurd. I specifically gave examples of the cultural order of consonance and dissonance relating to the order of the calculated ratios. Musical techniques such as vibrato are a clear example of intervals not requiring absolute mathematical precision in order to be perceived as any given interval. This is obvious. The point is simply that when you do the math, and observe universal cultural ideas around dissonance as they relate to intervals you get the same order. Given that we get the same order, we can assume an underlying structure which is mathematical. </p>
<p>Ratios of frequency are reliably correlated to dissonance because they are categorised within the range you are talking about, each category can be clearly ordered using the the ratio and we can then use this to compare to cultural norms.</p>
<p>If we look at the statistics, the vast majority of music does have a mood-perception correlation across cultures. Finding a handful of exceptions simply demonstrates that context has the potential to overwrite melodic/harmonic norms, which we also know due to the number of music graduates who claim to hear music like 12 tone composition as consonant. This is all assuming that music is being perceived in the same way across the groups without any form of amusia interfering with the results.</p>
<p>Music is clearly a case of nature first, then nurture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I would love to have a long dinner with the two of you, I sometimes have to explain the difference between 12-tone music as westerners are used to and the dissonance inherent in it to musicians (well, guitarists anyway) who have just noticed it and am well out of my depth, I'd pick up the tab to listen to you two battle it out!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying interval ratios are not part of the story, but they are a small part of a much more complex story.</p>
<p>You can make any interval of pitches that is not inside a critical band into a consonant one by suppressing harmonics that produce dissonances. As a concrete example of this you can combine any pair of pitches without dissonance by a) ensuring they are both very low and b) at least one of them lacks higher harmonics. There are also algorithms to synthesize &quot;chords&quot; made of (nearly) arbitrary pitch combinations without dissonance by suppressing the harmonics which would create dissonant combinations.</p>
<p>The ratio of the pitches is a rule of thumb. It's a very useful one for the craft of making music, but it isn't causal and isn't a scientific rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A few things that I'd like to point to which I think might contribute to the discussion. The relative degree of consonance/dissonance is directly associated with the number of cycles that are required before 2 (or more) notes repeat their pattern</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not true, or at least it's a vast oversimplification. Even in western music there's quite a bit more that contributes to a perceived consonance or dissonance, and the rest of your post is purely western music, which is clearly a subjective view (even if it has come to dominate the world over, that is because of the power of western culture, not that it's more inherently correct).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Whereas the tritone/A4/D5 is an irrational number which when we use the same criteria takes the biggest number of cycles before resolution/repetition of the pattern compared to other intervals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not an irrational number because an interval is by definition a ratio. It's one note played on top of another.</p></div>		</li>
