			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't find it weird at all, in fact, I find it weird to like sad music at all. Listening to sad music when I'm happy just brings me down, and when I'm sad it makes it even worse. </p>
<p>I prefer happy music or watching comedies or something to bring my mood back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something strange about being down that doesn't let me do fun things. It's like when I get sad it becomes unbearable to try and make myself happy so instead I find comfort in knowing I don't have it bad at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the same way. However, while I may be reluctant when something comes along to force me to be active, I'm always really thankful for it. These days, I try to get out of the house when I'm depressed, even if that just means reading a book in the sun. It seems to help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, like those times when you're so down that even something simple someone you love says can piss you off. In those times it's best to just plug in your earphones and just zone out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I feel like sadness is like a fever and you just have to &quot;sweat it out&quot; in order to get over it. Like wrapping yourself in a blanket to help the fever, sad music might help to let the emotions go, so you can return back to normal sooner. Sadness isn't something you can easily get rid of just by ignoring it, so confronting it might actually be a good option.</p>
<p>I do not encourage any self-pity or getting lost in a downward spiral though. For some of us it's a thin line unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>
