			<p>So the wave basically compresses at shallower depths and has much more stored energy?</p>		</li>

			<p>In short, yes. <br><br>A tsunami has a tremendous amount of energy. It has to go somewhere. Some of it is lost when the the  water becomes shallow and the wave collides with the ground. In most cases, this is enough to dampen the the tsunami to less than dangerous levels. Sometimes, that's not enough, and the sea wall (where they're built) takes over to absorb that excess energy. But in cases like the 2011 earthquake in Japan, there's just too much energy for the ground and sea walls to absorb. The coast redirects the excess energy upward and inland causing tremendous amounts of destruction.<br><br>If you were to be swimming in open waters, you may feel a bit of the force, but it wouldn't be anything like what happens on the coast.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, it trades speed for amplitude, as it enters shallow water.<br><br>In the deepwater open sea, tsunami waves can and do travel at supersonic<em> speeds!<br><br><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/phivolcs-tsunami-waves-moving-supersonic-speed" target="_blank">http://www.examiner.com/article/phivolcs-tsunami-waves-moving-supersonic-speed</a><br><br></em>for the purpose of this article, they're relating the speed of the wave to &quot;mach 1&quot; (in air).

			<p>&gt; supersonic speeds<br><br>That article didn't elaborate, but I assume that 'supersonic' is this case is the speed of sound in air, not water.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm gonna guess that if you're making that assumption then you already know what I'm about to say.<br><br>But for anyone who's wondering, a mechanical disturbance cannot propagate through a substance faster than the speed of sound in that substance.</p>		</li>

			<p>Of course, it's an examiner.com article. They're trying to relate it to a speed that some layperson reader would understand, ie &quot;Mach&quot;.<br><br>NOT the speed of sound in water.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>This is hardly supersonic. The wave was travelling at 600 km/hr. The speed of sound in air is about 1225 km/hr. In saltwater, it is more than 5600 km/hr. The wave was about as supersonic as a car travelling at highway speeds (in air) would be.</p>		</li>

			<p>So if there's a boat in the open sea and a tsunami wave travels under it at supersonic speeds can it launch that boat into the air?</p>		</li>
					<ul class="replies">
		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/outflow" target="_blank">outflow</a>
			<p>No because like I said, it's a tradeoff between speed and amplitude. In order to get that fast, the tsunami has a very small wave height, like an inch or so. You probably wouldn't even notice it hitting your boat.</p>		</li>

			<p>this is correct, the tsunamis grow larger when they get nearer to the shore because the bottom of the wave begins to interact with the bottom of the ocean. This friction causes the bottom of the wave to slow down while the top continues at the same rate which causes the waves to grow taller. When the ocean floor is deeper than the wave base ie out in the open ocean the tsunamis are no where near as large as they become when they approach the shore and begin interacting with the ocean bottom.<br><br>Source: geoscience classes</p>		</li>

			<p>I haven't seen Poseidon, but at sea there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave" target="_blank">rogue waves</a>, different from tsunami. Rogue waves were treated like sea stories for a long time until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draupner_wave" target="_blank">a wave detector picked one up in 1995</a>.<br><br>There was a <a href="http://www.ifremer.fr/web-com/stw2004/rw/" target="_blank">workshop in 2004</a> on rogue waves at which were presented a number of papers.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Those don't just happen at sea, either. The <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Edmund_Fitzgerald" target="_blank">Edmund Fitzgerald</a> was likely sunk by a rogue wave, or suffered catastrophic damage from one. </p>		</li>

			<p>The RMS Queen Mary, one of the biggest ocean liners in the world at the time, was actually struck by such a wave in 1942. In the immediate aftermath of the hit the ship was listing over 50 degrees. The estimate is that the wave was 90 something feet.</p>		</li>

			<p>That is absolutely incredible. I've never seen anything bigger than maybe five feet waves. They're claiming this rogue wave was 84 feet high! Would this happen when multiple waves meet at the absolute perfect timing? I'm thinking of when a boat makes a circle you have that &quot;witch's brew&quot; from where the wakes meet. I bet so many variables have to be met to create one of these beasts. </p>		</li>

			<p>It would happen if it had something to break off of, not in deep water though. Remember, there are seamounts in the ocean (essentially islands that don't quite break the surface of the water) that you may not know are there. <br><br>A notable example is Cortes bank off southern CA. It is a seamount that you would never know is there unless a large particular type of swell comes through. Then it comes alive creating spectacular 60+ ft monster waves breaking out 100 miles from land.</p>		</li>

			<p>It certain circumstances it may be possible, but unlikely. To create such situation  the water depth would need to be shallow and the the ship would need to broadside to the wave. Most likely, the wave would appear as a swell that a modern ship would be able to ride out without great difficulty</p>		</li>
