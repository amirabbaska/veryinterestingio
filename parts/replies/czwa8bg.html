			<div class="markdown"><p>LIGO scientist here! Great explanation! I'll add:</p>
<p>If Einstein is right (hint: HE IS), gravitational waves would travel outward from (for instance) two black holes circling each other just like the ripples in a pond. When they come to Earth and pass through the detectors, a signal can tell us not only that the gravitational wave has been found, but it can also tell us lots of information about the gravitational wave!</p>
<p>As you track what the gravitational waves look like over a (very) short amount of time, you can tell what kind of event caused them, like if it was two black holes colliding or a violent supernova... along with other details, like what the mass of these stars/black holes would have been!</p>
<p>This discovery has ushered in an awesome new era of astronomy. BEFORE we started detecting gravitational waves, looking out at the universe was like watching an orchestra without any sound! As our detectors start making regular observations of this stuff, it will be like turning on our ears to the symphony of the cosmos!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nice when your experiment works, but I don't understand why everyone has become so giddy about this. What are you going to be able to learn from these waves and what can be done with that information? Beyond a final proof of general relativity, where does this discovery take us? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note : not an actual scientists </p>
<p>While confirming something with actual data is pretty cool,  everybody already accepted gravitational waves, it's exciting but nothing really new there.</p>
<p>The great thing is that now we have a way to detect them. Granted we detected one of the most massive events in the universe,  but it's a start. </p>
<p>If we get better at detecting them we could have an understanding of the universe that is massively better than what we have now.</p>
<p>Why?  Until right now our preferred method of looking at the stars has been the light they emit. </p>
<p>But light,  while fast,  get distorted,  absorbed and blocked. </p>
<p>For example, we never really actually saw a black hole. Black holes don't emit any light on their own, we know of them because of the effect they have on the light around them.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves are not going to be affected by black holes. This wave are as fast as light and can pass through matter. </p>
<p>If we can get better at it we can ideally build an MRI for space and not only see the universe in a much clearer way but maybe discover something new that we were never been able to see.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can just see the scientists throwing their important papers to the ground and sighing loudly while stating &quot;why do we even bother&quot;.</p>
<p>It's sort of like a kid asking &quot;but why do i need to learn all this stuff? It's not like im gonna use it for anything.&quot; </p>
<p>People wish to learn for the enjoyment of learning new and exiting things. Here is something that people have theorized about and found most likely to be true, and now it has actually been proven. That is a really big thing if you thirst for knowledge. </p>
<p>What can you use it for? Well, that remains to be seen. When Roy Plunkett discovered Teflon by mistake, i'm pretty sure he didn't automatically think &quot;this would be perfect for my fryingpan&quot;. When Leo Hendrik Baekeland invented plastic in his search for a cheaper alternative to insulation, he probably didn't realize the potential of his invention.</p>
<p>What i'm trying to say is to let the brainiac's play around with this newly proven knowledge, and it may enhance our longing for the stars. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider electricity, one of the four forces. Until 1850 or so (that year is completely off the top of my head), it was known to exist, but there was not really any good way to observe and use it. Step by step, curious people examined it, and these days it's applications are crucial everywhere.</p>
<p>Gravitiy is another of the 4 forces. In many ways, our understanding of gravity is where our understanding of electricity was 150 years ago. We sorta know what it is, but cannot (or could not until yesterday) pbserve it directly, and our application of it is rather clumsy. Observing it is the first step in using it better. Might we someday be able to manipulate gravity directly? Perhaps, perhaps not, but observing it is definitely a crucial step in the right direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey mr LIGO scientist, quick question: it was mentioned that the detector uses high precision lasers. How does it put these to use? I'd think setting them up to point at a laser detector over some distance, the whole apparatus isolated from seismic activity and measuring some miniscule offsets between the detector and the emitter as grav waves pass through the area? That's off the top of my head, and I'm probably wrong, so how does it work? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is, in ELI5 mode, 100% correct!! Very good.</p>
<p>The g-wave passes and changes the distance between the emitter and detector by a very small amount--if you used a ruler, you wouldn't notice because the very fabric of space-time that the ruler lives in would be compressed or stretched, so there'd be no way to tell! BUT light doesn't get stretched or compressed (well, its frequency and wavelength change but not its speed!), so if you measure the travel time you realize it got to you faster than it did a moment before, and then slower a moment later! </p>
<p>This isn't true either, because we would have no 'ruler' to measure by at the moment. So we split the laser into two, and we send them down two different arms of a giant L (except each arm of the &quot;L&quot; is the same length)... if they come back and join together again, and if the distances are the same, then they are &quot;in phase&quot; (I'm in ELI21 mode, but sounds like you're up for it!), and nothing changes at our detector. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, if a g-wave passes through, one arm will get shorter and the other will get longer at the same time, and the light will recombine at the detector out of phase! The detector will register a change in the amount of light getting to it--a signal! </p>
<p>But that's not all... g-waves do this weird thing where one single wave will not only make one arm lengthen and one arm contract, but it will then IMMEDIATELY to the opposite--make the previously-lengthened arm contract and the previously-contracted arm lengthen. The fact that this happens twice, and in opposite phases, makes it really nice for us to detect.</p>
<p>And I like that you mentioned the seismic isolators, seeing as that is my primary research focus ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics used to be: I have an intuition about how the world works (I throw a ball, it falls, and speeds up while it is falling), so I will now work out some math about it. Yay, my math works and now I can predict some other things.</p>
<p>Physics is now: I have really fancy mathematics that give me some result... Now I need to build an intuition about what that means would happen in the physical world!</p>
<p>It's sad, but what that means is that wanting to truly understand physics without delving into the math is like asking to understand all the nuances of Goethe without being bothered to learn German. It also means that lots of people who loved physics in high school become disillusioned in college when math quickly becomes the primary focus of the class (see: <a href="http://survivingtheworld.net/Lesson2710.html" target="_blank">http://survivingtheworld.net/Lesson2710.html</a>).</p>
<p>(1) That being said, imagine you're in the middle of a pool, and there's a ball somehow floating perfectly halfway to the bottom. That ball is magnetic, and the water is all magnetic--the closer the water is to the ball, the more the water is compressed as it is attracted to the ball. So the closer you get to the ball, the denser the water is. Further out, it's less dense. That's Earth compressing spacetime*--just like the ball on the sheet. </p>
<p>Gravitational waves would be like a small bullet traveling through the water, and at the tip of the bullet it attracted all the water around it in a circle (it doesn't affect the water in the DIRECTION of travel, just in a circle outward), and the BACKSIDE of the bullet repelled the water around it in a circle. [ELI21: That's what gravitational waves do--compress and then expand space-time in only the directions PERPENDICULAR to the direction of travel]</p>
<p>*Note: This 3D representation is ALSO wrong. Spacetime is 4D, and trying to understand it intuitively is, well, very very difficult.</p>
<p>(2) But this brings up a great point: analogies are to help us understand without the complexities of in-depth study. Which means, upon deeper reflection, analogies fail. Randall Munroe expressed it best : <a href="https://xkcd.com/895/" target="_blank">https://xkcd.com/895/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't pinpoint a location, yet. One way to know how to find something is to have distance and direction.</p>
<p>Maybe you've noticed that the ripples &quot;spread out&quot; as they get further away from the splash? If you could measure how big a ripple is, you'd know how far you are from the splash -- that's distance.</p>
<p>If you measure that same thing in two places (which we did!), you can see which one is closer, and by how much (by comparing how spread-out the waves are at each place). That gives you a general direction, and so that's all we have right now -- an area of space that is about 1.5 <em>billion</em> light years away, in a general direction.</p>
<p>If we could measure the same wave in <em>three</em> places, accurately enough, then we'd have enough information to <em>triangulate</em> where the splash was. Basically, that works by drawing <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4n9gO3t.png" target="_blank">big circles showing how far away the splash was from each measuring device</a> -- wherever all three circles meet is the location.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  a couple people have pointed out that 3 sensors isn't enough to locate a point in 3D space. That is generally true, because it's spheres, not circles, and they'll intersect in more than one place if you only have 3 sensors. I <em>think</em> LIGO sensors have limited directional information that may mean not needing a 4th point, but I'm not sure -- in either case, the point about 4 sensors is valid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a &quot;six-axis&quot; LIGO experiment be possible and feasible in the short term.  Having a central detection apparatus and 6 lasers?  I would think this would allow a great deal of accuracy to BEGIN with, and then with 5 more around the globe, offer an unprecedented and very welcome (in the scientific community, at least) level of accuracy in not only measuring the wave amplitude itself, but also locating the point of origin :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it works like how we detect shockwaves and other &quot;waves&quot; or &quot;splashes&quot; then I assume that the signal hits two points that are a part from each other and one can calculate the direction and distance with the time between each &quot;impact&quot; on the two sensors. Or more.</p>
<p>Now, I know they do this for other things, but since this is so new I am not 100% sure. I shouldn't be talking out of my ass, but at least you now know it isn't entirely impossible to calculate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason we can say that the gravitational wave we measured came from 2 colliding balck holes is because the signal LIGO's teams measured was increasing in frequency. The idea was that they were spinning around eachother and getting closer and closer. The more they get closer, the faster they spin hence the increasing frequency of the signal.</p></div>		</li>
