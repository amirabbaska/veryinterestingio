			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding to this. The reason fusion bombs use a fission reaction to kickstart them, which is where this Jupiter myth comes from, isn't because it &quot;detonates&quot; the fusion bomb <em>[I have to choose my words carefully here. Detonate may be wrong word. What I'm trying to achieve is, don't think of it like adding a spark to paper to make it catch fire... and don't think of it like det-cord to explosives.]</em> What happens is the fission bomb surrounds the fusion bomb and it's the only practical thing we have to crank up the temperature and pressure enough for fusion to happen. We can't practically create the environment for fusion in such a small device without putting it in the environment of a fission bomb blowing up around it from all sides.</p>
<p>So the fission bomb doesn't &quot;catalyze&quot; the reaction per-se, it creates an entire new environment. Then fusion naturally occurs in that artificial environment.</p>
<p>Now if you were to put a fission bomb on Jupiter, it would push the gas on the planet outwards. Not really doing anything.</p>
<p>Now, hypothetically, if you were to build a planet sized fission bomb and put Jupiter at the centre of it, you would achieve fusion.</p>
<p>A little bit because of the bomb going off causing a pressure wave to go through Jupiter... but more because a bomb that large would be so dense that it would add enough mass to the system for fusion to happen naturally.</p>

<p>Edit: Now we just need Randal Monroe to get on this and tell us what would actually happen in this scenario. I wonder if it would cause a supernova or something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't affect your point much but just FYI, the fission bomb usually doesn't surround the fusion bomb actually, at least in the case of a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Teller-Ulam_device_3D.svg" target="_blank">staged thermonuclear weapon</a>. You're thinking about a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/U.S._Swan_Device.svg" target="_blank">boosted fission weapon</a> in which the fusion reaction is primarily for the purpose of accelerating the fission reaction for efficiency and not for creating a larger secondary fusion reaction for significantly increased destructive power. Even then, we still can't produce fusion without heating and compressing the fuel with a large fission weapon going off one foot away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  A focusing lense captures the emitted x-rays, and neutrons and channels them into the secondary plug which is the fusion core, but in a standard dry bomb you still need a hot atomic detonation first before you begin the fusing process with the secondary, and any boisters it nay have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you were to do that, any fusion started would be short-lived. Jupiter simply does not have enough mass to sustain any kind of nuclear fusion (which requires somewhere in the neighborhood of 13 to 65 times Jupiter's mass).</p>
<p>At absolute best you'd get a brief surge of dim light from Jupiter, followed by a changed appearance as the Jovian atmosphere reorganizes itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, when asking about a large enough bomb the answer is &quot;Yes, if by large you mean 64 times the mass of Jupiter. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting as well that the fusion (so far as unclassified sources will tell you) largely exists to burn (fission) a greater proportion of the uranium/plutonium. The extra yield isn't as much a product of hydrogen fusion itself. It's from the fission reaction being completed more thoroughly, pushed by fusion byproducts.</p>
<p>In fact, in terms of energy production per square meter, most stars are about as energetic as a compost heap., ~100w/m^3. But stars are really really big, which is why they're so hot. Fusion just isn't that energetic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the weapon design. The Tsar Bomba got 97% of its power from fusion. But it could have been made more powerful with a uranium tamper in the final stage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fusion is very energetic. It's just that for smaller stars like the sun, while the core temperature and pressure does create an environment where fusion can occur, it's not a particularly great environment for it to occur. Atoms can fuse there, but they're not really in any big hurry to do so. The actual rate of hydrogen atoms fusing is quite small compared to the amount of them available, but as you said, due to the immense volume of the sun, the numbers start to add up. </p>
<p>Significantly more massive stars have significantly hotter and denser cores, and as a result are more conducive to fusion, and that's why they tend to burn their fuel much more quickly and have relatively short life-spans compared to a star like the sun or a red dwarf. </p>
<p>Along those same lines, the core of the sun is estimated to be around 15 million degrees Celsius, but many modern experimental fusion reactors run at closer to 100 million degrees. This is because as the temperature increases, the better the environment becomes for fusion reactions, and a small volume of space at 15 million degrees just doesn't result in enough fusion to get much useful energy out of it. Our fusion reactors aren't really trying to create a miniature sun, they're trying to create a miniature version of a much more massive and hotter star. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fusion is plenty energetic, much more energetic than fission. The reason for stars having such meager power densities is that the start with protons, and making deuterium from protons is a really, really slow process. Most of the times, you just get the protons back.</p>
<p>We get around this drawback in thermonuclear bombs by starting with deuterium and tritium. These react much faster than the proton does. Much of the energy still comes from the ensuing fission, but remember that that is a chain reaction, with each neutron from the fission being able to spark more than one fission event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this why in Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;2010&quot; the monoliths start massively replicating on Jupiter? In order to give it enough mass and density to become a star? It was a central plot point to the book/movie, and I'm sure it's the reason the question of Jupiter's &quot;star-ability&quot; gets asked a lot. Which is ironic because Clarke took the time to the time to explain it in the book. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really a matter of density? Because if the problem is just that there's not enough mass for gravity to be strong enough to start a.fusion reaction, would it really increasing density change anything? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add enough mass and you increase the density due to the collection of that much mass in one spot.  It will begin to compress upon itself - for instance, the core of the sun is 150x as dense as liquid water here on earth.  As density increases due to the added mass, you begin to get heat from all the little molecules being pushed together.  Keep increasing the mass -&gt; increases density -&gt; creates heat -&gt; a star is born.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came looking for the 2010 reference. And now that I think about it, you might be right. I always just assumed it was possible because he said so. After all he was the &quot;geostationary satellite guy&quot;, and so much else sounded plausible (well, you know by sci-fi standards).</p>
<p>In fact, it looks like you need at least ~0.08 solar masses, or 80+ jupiter masses.

<p>I don't think you could convert the hydrogen to anything heavier that is (a) still useful for fusion, and (b) dense enough to maintain fusion as a star.</p>
<p>Dammit. Next you'll tell me there's no &quot;diamond neutron stars&quot; :(</p></div>		</li>
