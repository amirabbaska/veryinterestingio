			<div class="markdown"><p>That's part of it. But if we assume it's actually capable of not bursting at all, forget that it's water for a minute. A really big factor is the basic physics of forces.</p>
<p>Start with a drop moving at a given velocity.</p>
<p>If the drop hits a surface head-on, it hits at that velocity. End of story.</p>
<p>But if the same drop hits the surface at a more glancing angle, part of its movement is across the surface. That means its closing velocity is less. It hits the surface slower, so it doesn't hit as hard; it's as simple as that. The more glancing the angle, the lower the closing speed, and the gentler the collision.</p>
<p>After <strong>that</strong>, yes, <strong>then</strong> it's down to how liquids behave - surface tension and so forth - as to whether or not it actually bursts.</p>
<p>(At heart it's at least partly the difference between a racing car scraping along a wall at speed and the same car hitting a barrier head-on at the same speed. In the first case, if the car's remotely well constructed, it will probably lose little more than a few lumps of bodywork. Whereas in the second, if the barrier's not designed to cushion one <strong>heck</strong> of a collision, you <strong>really</strong> wouldn't want to be in that car.)</p></div>		</li>
