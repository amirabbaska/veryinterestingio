</blockquote>
<p>To add to that; in encryption you often also want things to be <em>slower</em> than they could be, and compiler-generated code doesn't always allow that. Specifically you don't want there to be a difference between decrypting one thing vs decrypting another thing as this would give you information about the thing being decrypted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you elaborate this? I can't figure out why decryption times would matter?</p>
<p>To my understanding (which is probably wrong or incomplete), encryption is used a) to make files use less storage and b) prevent files from unauthorized access by adding a key.</p>
<p>If you are decrypting something, doesn't that mean that you have the key and are therefore you will be able to see/access the original data anyways? So exactly what additional info would you gain if you knew how long it took to decrypt something? </p>
<p>I guess I'm missing something here, but I can't figure out what.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically - the caveat is that you do sometimes start to see slower performance in computers that are a few years old.</p>
<p>Another good example of this is in web development. Back in the dial up days, it wasn't uncommon to wait 30 seconds or so for a page to fully load. But if you try loading more modern webpages on a 56K connection, you're going to waiting much, much longer, even on for a fairly simple page (by today's standards). </p></div>		</li>

<p>This. Languages like Java and C#, with their garbage collection, libraries, etc, are a dream to use, and much, much faster for the programmer to write code, and learn to write code, but from a pure performance perspective, there is no comparison to the old C-style linked lists, pointers, and manual memory management.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not convinced.  I'm a software engineer, and I take the time to design things correctly, in Java.  The other day, I realized that I had just written an n^2 algorithm for something that could have been n log n in the same number of lines of code.  So, I went back and changed it.  I did that despite the fact that N is almost always &lt; 10.</p>
<p>I do this because I care.  It bothers me on an emotional level when I write garbage.  But from an engineering / operations perspective, it's probably the wrong decision.  N &lt; 10.  My time as a programmer is worth more than the time I saved, in that case.</p>
<p>I don't think it's about Java vs C.  It's about taking the time to do it correctly.  You can write garbage C and you can write good Java.  Granted, Java has fewer tools for doing it correctly.  But most of us don't write code at the level where that matters.  For most of us, it's just naive runtime complexity.</p></div>		</li>

Image.. we keep increasing our monitor sizes and resolution, so we'll definitely need better images. That's a maybe there.

<p>I am going to defend programmers a bit here. Much of the &quot;overhead&quot; in software is for cross-platform compatibility. Instead of writing dozens of versions of the same program for each architecture, developers will often use cross platform frameworks (e.g. React Native) that can run it with minimal extra coding effort. The upside is that the program is available across a bunch of different platforms without the extra time or money. The downside is that the program is not well optimized for the architecture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't want to sound like I'm some old man shitting on all the young kids in the software industry today - in most cases there is no longer a compelling reason to make your code more efficient, and time spent trying to trim some fat in existing code is time that could be better used writing new code for some other purpose. </p>
<p>And you make a great point here as well, which is that modularity and flexibility have become a greater priority than efficiency. That generally leads to larger amounts of code just by nature. But with hardware being less and less of a concern, code that's bigger but more flexible becomes preferable to code that smaller but less flexible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You are going on a 4 day camping trip. You have a suitcase that can fit 2 days of clothes. You have 3 matches and need to start 4 fires. You have exactly 2 litres of water for the whole trip.</p>
<p>Today that suitcase can hold 100 days of clothes, you have a flamethrower with 20 litres of fuel, and you are camping at the base of a waterfall.</p>
<p>It makes more sense not to waste time folding clothes and finding clever ways to keep the embers of a fire warm. Better to use that time doing something else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as making code faster takes &quot;work&quot;, I think code will always be around the same speed in terms of responsive user interaction.  It will be as fast as it needs to be, until it hits the point where users don't really care about the latency anymore.  Sure our expectation for how fast things should be has changed over time, but because of this feedback effect, it has changed a lot slower than CPUs have gotten faster.</p></div>		</li>
