			<div class="markdown"><p>So an analogy would be: The police in your body keeps the troublemakers at bay until you get a full-scale riot that cannot be contained by the police. Then the host body has to call in an airstrike in the form of radiation therapy in hopes of stopping the riot. </p>
<p>Yeah?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bad analogy.  Better analogy is: The police in your body keeps trouble makers at bay until someone who's on &quot;good terms&quot; with the police started causing trouble.  The police &quot;ignores&quot; these new trouble makers and then shit gets real.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you suddenly introduced a large detectable cancer in your body you would have a huge immune response that would kill it. Either that or you die from the shock of the immune response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, but instead of a riot, its more like the police get old and start retiring, but no one is there to replace them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do we keep our body police young and happy? Or rather, is it possible to replace them at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The naked mole rat also has a similar system, it has two systems for telling if cells are too close and preventing reproduction whereas most other species only have one. They also have ribosomes which are much more accurate at replicating DNA than other species have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this.  In med school we were taught that we all generate malignant cells daily that never develop into cancer due to these systems.  Also, some cancers can be treated by boosting the immune system alone.  Metastatic melanoma can be cured 5-10% of the time with administration of IL-2 (inter-leukin 2).</p></div>		</li>
