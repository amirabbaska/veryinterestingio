			<div class="markdown"><p>The factor of <em>c</em> is usually introduced to make the timelike component of the metric have the same units as the spacelike components, which is meters. So although putting c = 1 makes seconds and meters equivalent, the convention is that we use meters. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Although usually we keep the units of length and get rid of units of time everywhere, so you would typically see space-time volume measured in m^4 . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be metres^4 ~ seconds^4 (or whichever symbol in place of ~ would indicate proportionality)?</p>
<p>I was always under the impression that by setting c = 1 we weren't defining the speed of light to be 1 m/s (that would certainly lead to some incorrect math), but rather setting the distance measurements to light-seconds, thereby removing the need to use meters as a unit.</p>
<p>Granted, it's been a while since I've worked with tensors and manifolds, it's possible I'm not describing the substitution accurately, but I wanted to clarify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When dealing with spacetime, you want to measure space and time in the same units: the most common way is to measure time in meters. That is, one meter of time is the time it takes light to travel one meter. Spacetime volume then has units of m^(4). You can measure everything in seconds instead of meters if you want; the difference is a factor of c^(4), which is usually set to 1 in calculations anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be calculated differently than Euclidean volume, right? (because of the +--- metric) </p>
<p>In the case of a simple (ct, x) coordinate &quot;plane&quot;, would spacetime area also be conserved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's actually the same as the Euclidean volume for flat spacetime! In a 2D spacetime as you say it would be actually equal to the normal euclidean area. For example, a spacetime square is stretched by a Lorentz boost into a diamond of equal area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From multivariable calc I learned that you could find areas and volumes through the cross product of vectors, so I figured it would be safe to assume that the notion of area stems from the cross product. Does this mean that the non-euclidean metric doesn't change the nature (or calculation) of the cross product (though it does change the inner product)?</p></div>		</li>
