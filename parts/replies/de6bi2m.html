			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://xkcd.com/936/" target="_blank">This XKCD</a> is a quick rundown on making a good password. The key is to make a password that's easy for a human to remember, but harder for a computer guess. A short &quot;secure&quot; password (&quot;Tr0ub4dor&quot;, in the comic) is easy for a computer to guess, but hard to remember.</p>
<p>Conversely, a longer password (&quot;correcthorsebatterystaple&quot;, in the comic) is much harder for a computer to guess, but very easy for a human to memorize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have more than one password and you can't possibly remember them all. Reusing passwords is also a bad idea. Many places store passwords in plain text or improperly hash them, you never know. If you have a strong password  you reuse and some dumbass web developer stores it in plain text in their server then you're screwed. I use 1Password to create unique 24 character passwords for all my accounts and I don't remember any of them. I also use tfa on many but not everyone offers it and it can be a pain for accounts you need to login to every visit. </p>
<p>My passwords are stored in a strongly encrypted vault on my encrypted notebook harddisk using a strong password I do remember and never used for anything else and my computer is locked on sleep by another strong password I remember and use for nothing else. </p>
<p>It's probably more than required but I sleep well at night. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After this comic came out my ISP changed their password restrictions. Now you can have a password of 8 characters or more with a capital, number and a special character, or a pass-sentence of at least 16 characters and no other restrictions </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I just point out that you aren't answering the question?</p>
<p>Also, your paragraph about complex passwords only applies to places that:</p>
<ul>
<li>use proper hashing technique</li>
<li>use proper salting technique</li>
</ul>
<p>The length of your password makes absolutely no difference on websites that screwed up either of those, i.e. just using MD5; a rainbow table will have a password in 0.01s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a way to visualise the hash thing, let's say that the hash routine basically add the value of each character together and store that. You can not figure out what was the original password. So you need to compute every single possibility and check if you have a match somewhere.
So, let's say that the stored password is 23456, what will they do? try every one... &quot;password120   password 121   password123&quot; And that one will return 23456. Guess what! There is a match in the hashed password file! In fact, chance is that it contain more than one match! Bingo, the hacker just found a few valid logins!</p>
<p>However, this become less and less possible with a proper way to store the password... A more proper way would be to include an unique identifier to the hashing function, for example &quot;username+password&quot;, this cause every single hash to be different, even if it have the same password. So they need to crack every single user individually... The longer the password, the higher the chance that they give up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplest way of explaining this in non-technical terms is that when hackers breach a website and get a list of all accounts, they aren't going through the list and trying to figure out the password for each account. They're going through the list looking for accounts that use passwords they already have.</p>
<p>What they're really doing is asking &quot;Which of these accounts are using password X?&quot; It's kind of like if burglars had a master key ring of common house keys. Rather than driving around the country trying the keys on all the locks, a &quot;breach&quot; would be if a burglar got a copy of every lock in the country. In the comfort of their own home they can just run down all then locks trying their keys, and make note of the ones that worked, then target those specific houses later. They're usually not going to bother trying to pick each lock, it just takes too long. They're looking for the easy locks they can already open.</p>
<p>Hackers match accounts to passwords, not the other way around. So you want to have a password that is hard to guess so that it's ignored in the breaches. It's a little more complex in reality since it's all scripted and there is a little brute forcing, but the principal is the same; they're generating the simpler passwords and finding accounts that are using it. As someone else said, you don't have to outrun the bear, just outrun the other people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't even need to guess the correct password in a system like that, there would be so many collisions that you'd probably run into a an incorrect password that produces the correct hash before you find the correct one.</p></div>		</li>
