<p>So how do I get a paper published hypothesizing that the aversion to this sound is your body's way of sensing damage to your teeth?  The sensation I feel from nails on a chalkboard is the same as when I get a piece of grit in my food.  And since there are no nerve endings in your teeth, your body has to sense damage to them in some other way.  Sound seems to be the obvious means through which this happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of the explanations I've ever heard for this make any sense. There are plenty of high-pitched warning-like sounds you can hear without cringing in the least, but just gently run your fingernails down a chalkboard - not even hard enough to make a noise - and there's that exact same cringey feeling you get when you hear the noise of someone doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I think it's an instinct to protect our hands. If you damage your nails it's extremely painful and can hinder your ability to use your hands properly. Even a small amount of damage to your nails can make you wince. Just thinking about something sharp getting underneath your fingernail is enough. This is the only thing that makes sense to me for it to evolve. If you were a human living thousands of years ago, and you damaged your hands, you'd be losing pretty much the only thing we humans have going for us, advantage-wise. Without them you'd be fucked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe just maybe it was early tool use?  We developed the ability to scrape two things together (smooth rocks work great, they hardly wear out) and after getting used often for many generations it grew into a sort of universal warning sign as those who were more sensitive to it avoided way more predators.</p></div>		</li>
