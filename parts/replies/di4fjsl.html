<p>but the allen-head has six points of contact rather than 4, making it less prone to rounding out the hole</p>

<p>Wouldn't the allen then be <strong>more</strong> prone to rounding? A hexagon is closer to a circle than a square.</p>
<p>Great answer regardless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hex has more points of contact, but the points of contact are being driven at a shallower angle. The strength of torx is that the points of cantact are being driven nearly parallel (0 degrees), whereas a Robertsons drives at 45 degrees and a hex drives at 60 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I use Robertson and hex drive screws everyday and I've rarely seen a Robertson screw fail. I've seen lots of hex drive screws fail. There is just less material backing the corners with 6 of them. Typically if we have a problem with the Robertson, it is because there is dirt or paint in the screw head. </p>
<p>The big difference with 4 points and 6 is that the 4 point bits ware out faster than the 6.  </p>
<p>I just installed an exhibit where all the crates were screwed with hex head screws. We spent so much time removing the stripped out screws.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Phillips screws are self-centering, making powered screwdrivers possible. They're somewhat more expensive to produce than slotted-head. They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look up the patent for the phillips head you will find that the inventor did talk about &quot;cam-out&quot; as a benefit, but he was talking about the ability of the drive bit to force debris out of the screw head. It had nothing to do with &quot;cam-out&quot; as currently understood. It's a very common misconception.</p>
<p>See Chapter 2:</p>

<p>The original concept was invented by a John P Thompson.
He couldn't gain any traction though, so sold it to Henry Phillips (Phillips Screw Company), at which point it was improved (somehow?) and then patented</p>
<p>We coulda been all been calling it a Thompson screw if he'd had a bit more acumen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We mustn't forget the Reed-Prince driver-fastener interface, which is superficially similar to Philips (Thompson?) screws, but which allows drivers of any size to work with screws of any size.</p>
<p>AFAICT Reed-Prince is superior, but Philips won because that driver was capable of using both Phlips and Reed-Prince screws, while the Reed-Prince driver was only good for their own fasteners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;cam-out&quot; we refer to today is simply the self-centering geometry working in reverse. When you press the screwdriver into the screw it rotates to fit the screw. When you attempt to change the rotation of the screwdriver relative to the screw by applying torque, you end up with the force trying to separate the screw and screwdriver because that's the exact opposite of the self-centering and self-aligning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I thank you for bringing up Canada's contribution to the fastener world, a couple of things... Robertsons aren't Square-Drive.  While they're square in cross-section, the driver and the hole in the screw are slightly tapered, and the bottom rounded. This makes it much harder to strip a Robertson. </p>
<p>It also means that the screw can stick to the driver even when both are non-magnetic, which is really handy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood worker from Downunder here.  I bought a bulk box of what I thought were Phillips, but were what I now know as Robertsons.  Too far to go back to the hardware store, so, as I had an appropriate driver, decided to use this box and then go back to using Phillips.
Have never looked back.  I use an impact drill/driver and can honestly say I have not yet burred or cammed-out a single one.  Have worn a couple of drivers though.  My favorite screw now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look to see if you can get Vega brand drivers. They are the longest last I g ones I have found for impacts. They have a special impact twisted one that I use normally but I have also replaced all my other drivers with the other black ones they have. A couple things about them, they stick like crazy to robbis, its actually annoying at first untill they get worked in because it takes alot of force to pull the bit out of the screw after you drive it in. But after a thousand screws it still sticks enough to hold a drill. The other thing I have noticed is that I have a 6&quot; one of the non impacts I use in my drill, my drill got jammed but kept removing the screw and bent the bit, so I drove the screw back in and the bit straightened back out perfectly true. Any other bit would of snapped with how much this bent</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Growing up in Canada they were the &quot;default&quot; screw type except for drywall.  American stuff uses phillips most of the time but when I get screws for work at home it's always Robertson.  The nice thing about the Robertson (you probably don't have this issue as much) is that when they rust you can still get a good grip and get them out if you need to modify or take apart.  </p>
<p>Their qualities aren't limited to the initial application and that helps down the road when things need to be taken apart or fixed up.</p></div>		</li>
