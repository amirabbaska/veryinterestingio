			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good point, that the brain is taking in lots of stimuli, but for certain things, like fine texture, we are starting to make good headway into which receptors are used. It's probably the pachinian corpuscle, and maybe some of the meissner</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct - but the complete answer is not just that the tactile and lamellar corpuscles respond when touching fuzzy things, itâ€™s the <em>degree to which they respond while the others do not</em> (ie, the holistic pattern of sensory responses from all nerve types) that the brain interprets as fuzzy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let me seize the opportunity and go on asking what comes to mind.
So it's already that difficult at the sensory side?!
Are the signals modulated?
If they are, in what way?
I guess at some level they start to share nerve tracts? Do the signals merge? Do they show resonances?</p></div>		</li>
