			<div class="markdown"><p>Why actively comb the thread when people just down vote (or at least not upvote) the anecdotes anyways? It's how all of reddit works. We don't need mods for every post... This is the reason why mods complain that they're over worked, they're taking it upon themselves to be the hall monitor in every thread when they don't need to. </p>
<p>Not trying to mod hate here, I appreciate the work, I'm just saying that you guys can lay off a bit sometimes... It can scare people off from posting quality content. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just stumbled across this thread (I know it's 11 days old now), but thought I'd comment.</p>
<p>People routinely tell us what they like about ELI5 is that they can expect to have interesting topics explained in the comments.  If we didn't moderate every thread than most threads threads would instead have a non-explanation at the top.  You say that votes will act in the same way, but people just don't vote that way.  For every person that likes a good thorough explanation there are 5 people who upvote the meme or the anecdote.</p>
<p>I really don't think people are scared from posting quality content because we say we'll remove low effort content.</p></div>		</li>
