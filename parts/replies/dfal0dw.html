			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not an equivalent exchange of value for work. Whether you can dismiss $15,000 in tax debt or $150,000 in tax debt, it takes (pretty much) the same amount of work. These companies prey on the ignorance of poor people. Take advantage of someone who is wealthy and ignorant if you wish, but I think it's fucked up to make thousands of dollars off of the people that qualify for these poverty-oriented programs.</p></div>		</li>
