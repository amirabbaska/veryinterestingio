			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of planets like Earth and Mars, we can simply track rotation via surface features. The thick atmosphere of Jupiter denies us that ability. When we talk about Jupiter's rotation on it's axis, it's actually just an average of the speeds of rotation between areas like the poles and equator. That being said, there are several 'systems' for measuring Jupiter's rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, it is still just a best guess with the given information we have.  There is nothing saying that Jupiter couldnt have a solid mass at its center, its just that what we can observe would indicate otherwise, yeah?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a lesser extent yes. On earth it's the cause of prevailing winds such as the jet streams. However because it ends up moving relative to the surface it can't get going quite as fast as it does on gas giants</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.  That is counter intuitive to me: I would have thought that coriolis forces would imply that the equatorial region would rotate /slower/ than the rest of the planet, as slow moving gasses from the middle latitudes migrate to the equator and thus take longer to complete a rotation.</p>
<p>Can you explain why it is the opposite?</p></div>		</li>
