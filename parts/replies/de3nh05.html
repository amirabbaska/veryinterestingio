<p>Either the seal on the can failed, or in most cases the bacteria re-multiply until it increases the internal pressure beyond ambient and the can will bulge out or spray when opened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okej, feels like i missed something important here because was not jarring that you seal everything up and then heat everything up to over 100 degrees? </p>
<p>edit: Or is Jarring that you simply boil the entire can with everything in it?</p></div>		</li>
