<p>Chances are good that they at least tore large chunks off and swallowed them whole like most large reptiles today. Look at alligators and crocodiles.</p></div>		</li>

Other icthyosaurs <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/prehistoric-squid-was-last-meal-of-ichthyosaur-200-million-years-ago/" target="_blank">have been found</a> with fossil squid in their long-departed guts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also tell from how the rest of it is built how it lived, and therefore how it acquired food. For instance, the dinosaur Baryonyx is generally thought to have eaten fish, because it has a long, narrow snout ideal for snatching them out of the water, and claws designed like fishhooks.</p></div>		</li>
