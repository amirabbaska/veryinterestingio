			<div class="markdown"><p>I think i choose a poor wording or am misunderstanding  something. Stirling castle is yellow because of lime wash that contains ochre. Ochre is one of the most common and easily obtainable pigments. It is marvelous though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some colours are common but cannot be &quot;fixed&quot; to make into dyes or paints. An example is the bright red of beets - it simply washes out of anything it is applied to, leaving faint pink or brown stains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first started playing Runescape I used to sell dyes for 100gp ea. I thought I was making bank, way more then selling cow hides and other newb level shit. People always balked when I told them the price for purple was 200gp. But I mean, I need to combine blue and red dyes to make one purple so that's why it's twice the price...</p>
<p>I don't know why I'm telling you this story...</p></div>		</li>
