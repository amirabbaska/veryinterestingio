			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on current estimates there haven't even been a billion supernova in the Milky way. With around 1-3 supernova per hundred years and an age of 13.6 billion years, we'd only expect around 100 - 300 million supernova since the galaxy formed. At most it'd still be a small fraction of them that contributed to the molecular cloud that formed our system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is 1-3 supernova per century an average over time or is that the current average? I thought when the universe was younger there were more stars massive enough to supernova. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that actually helps narrow it down as I've wondered this as well. So the realistic numbers are 2 to 100 - 300 million. With the actual number unknowable, but probably on the lower end?</p></div>		</li>

<p>and probably a large handful of each type (with some sort of long tail on the source) </p>
<p>so likely a few hundred stars in terms of significant contributors. Many thousands for the trace amounts of things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Check out the /r/math sidebar (under &quot;Using LaTeX&quot;) to see more about how you can make your browser automagically render this kind of markup into beautifully formatted equations.</p>
<p>Although, this equation is just N ≥ 2. Probably not worth installing an extension for, and also something that OP could've just typed if they felt like it.</p></div>		</li>
