<p>What did you do to become one?  What's the general path?</p>
<p>If you don't mind me asking.  I love food sciences and I'm still interested in pursuing that path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are 50-70 accredited food science programs out there. But to be honest, TONS of people in industry don’t necessarily have a food science degree specifically (lots of chemical engineers, chemists, microbiologists, and other life scientists in my area). </p>
<p>I found food science as an undergraduate, and am now finishing a PhD. Advanced degrees aren’t necessarily required, especially if you’re interested in industry. </p>
<p>In terms of jobs available, the list is interminable. Product development, fundamental research, sensory panels, flavor houses, ingredient suppliers, health foods, tech startups, dairy companies, the list goes on...</p>
<p>I’m biased, but I think it’s an excellent area of employment - I don’t see humans giving up the need to eat anytime soon. And a lot of the hard skills translate well to other fields (e.g., biopharma).</p></div>		</li>
