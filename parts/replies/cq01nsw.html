			<div class="markdown"><p>A large fraction of the heat in the earth's core is generated from radioactive decay.  Only a very, very small fraction of those decays will be spontaneous fission.  The majority will be alpha or beta decay.  Sustaining fission chain reactions do not occur in the core.  Radioactive decay is not remarkable, low levels of radioactive decay (from naturally occurring radioactive materials) is all around us.  What makes Oklo very special is that it is a fission chain reaction.</p></div>		</li>
