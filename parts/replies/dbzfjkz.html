			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first reference contained the following paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing climate variability, however, has had a negative impact on forest growth and health, with North America reporting the largest area of forests with insect-related health problems in 2005 compared to any other region.</p>
<p>Problems include outbreaks of the mountain pine beetle, which has devastated more than 11 million hectares of forest in Canada and the western United States since the late 1990s – an unprecedented outbreak aggravated by higher winter temperatures. During the same period damage resulting from storms, wind and snow affected 0.4 per cent of the forest area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your second reference has the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No   reliable<br />
data  currently  exists  on  the  degree  of<br />
global  forest  degradation,  due  in  part<br />
to different perceptions of what degra-
dation entails and the lack of adequate
assessment  methodologies  with  meas-
urable thresholds and/or the resources
needed for their implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing  forests  not  only  means  the<br />
loss  of  this  carbon  carrying  capacity<br />
but  also  frequently  means  that  large<br />
amounts  of  greenhouse  gas  are  sud-
denly   released   into   the   atmosphere<br />
through  wood  burning  and  clearance<br />
activities, compounding climate change
problems.
Reducing  carbon  emissions  caused<br />
by   deforestation   and   forest   degrada-
tion in developing countries (REDD) is
seen by many as a potentially promi sing
approach in the battle to combat climate
change. If the REDD initiative succeeds,
it will not only mitigate climate change
but  also  reduce  the  rate  of  forest  and<br />
biodiversity loss while at the same time
providing  forest-dependent  communi-
ties  with  alternative  sources  of  income.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither of these easy to find references support the idea that forest are growing.  The remark &quot;Absolutely.&quot;  is not correct at all.  Forest gains in some parts of the world are quite offsset in other places.  While neither article is directly addressing climate change both mention it as a hazard or a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insect problems have nothing to do with forests having expanded.</p>
<p>You're right though that my second link is a poor example since it focused on deforestation due to logging. Try this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth</a></p>
<p>That study is not of selected local areas, but a global inventory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your new article states the following:</p>
<p>&quot;While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events.</p>
<p>The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may also be limited, said co-author Dr. Philippe Ciais, associate director of the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, Gif-suv-Yvette, France. “Studies have shown that plants acclimatize, or adjust, to rising carbon dioxide concentration and the fertilization effect diminishes over time.”</p>
<p>Not very good news at all.</p></div>		</li>
