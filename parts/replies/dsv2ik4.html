<p><strong>Edit</strong>, before anyone else comments: ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes are related, but they're not the same. They both involve paying investors back with money from new investors, but that's it.</p>
<p>A ponzi scheme is a flat structure - everyone invests their money directly, and as an investor you are not required to find more investors. In a pyramid scheme, your earnings depend on you finding new investors. This also makes a ponzi scheme more sustainable, because old investors can also come back as new investors, re-investing their &quot;gains&quot;, and as long as not too many people want to cash out, you could keep going forever. </p>
<p>Technically, it's harder to prove that a pyramid scheme is fraudulent (legally speaking) - in a ponzi scheme the investment itself is a fabrication, the scammer pretends that the revenue comes from one place (&quot;offshore ventures&quot; or some bullshit), while it actually comes from another (other investors' money), which makes it obviously illegal. In a pyramid scheme, everything is laid out upfront - nothing is hidden. The scheme is the promise of gains that are mathematically impossible, unless you're one of the very first investors.</p>
<p>I also stand corrected, since the case OP asked about is indeed a ponzi scheme which also involved a pyramid scheme. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that is just the referral system. Avon has basically the same commission structure:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/oMUhbN4.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/oMUhbN4.png</a></p>
<p>Bitconnect actually switched from the 7 level pyramid shown above to a 3 level payout just like Avon. Avon is a $10 billion company traded on the New York Stock Exchange -- but nobody is calling them a pyramid scheme. So, it's important to distinguish the difference between actual pyramid schemes (illegal) and companies that have tiered compensation. I know it's fun to shit on things by calling them pyramid schemes, but it makes you sound niave when it's not an actual pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>I've been in bitcoin/crypto since 2012 and the only thing I didn't like about bitconnect was how secretive they were. Their site (still right now) shows an average daily interest of 0.91% (based on the past 6 months of payments):</p>
<p><a href="https://bitconnect.co/learning-center/bitconnect-bitcoin-price-volatility-software" target="_blank">https://bitconnect.co/learning-center/bitconnect-bitcoin-price-volatility-software</a></p>
<p>To me, that's not an unbelievably high return rate that must prove they're running a ponzi scheme! I run my own bitcoin trading bot and my average daily return is 2.1%. Assuming I could scale up to bitconnect levels, I could keep more than 1% of the profit off everyone's money and still legitimately return them 0.91% (which also answers why bitconnect would want other people money if they had a bot that could make money... because they could make even more money!). It only sounds crazy to people who expect crypto volatility to be similar to stock volatility and that's a terrible expectation.</p>
<p>It's high risk, and bitconnect could be shady, but it's very possible they were not running a ponzi scheme. If they were, they probably wouldn't have refunded everyone's initial loans when they shut down... they would have run off with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK a Ponzi scheme is basically a pyramid scheme that tries to disguise its nature by claiming that the money is somehow &quot;invested&quot; and the returns come from that investment activity. But the inner working, the flow of money, is the same.</p>
<p>Edit: on second thought, a more correct way to put it is that Pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes are just different methods to hide the fact that it's impossible for everyone to win because all payouts come from the money people are paying in. Ponzi schemes pretend that there's some kind of investing happening, while pyramid schemes just draw attention away from the mathematical impossibility of finding new people to join for very long by focussing on the early winners.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ncome return. Bitconnect told the users that their money would be handled by a 'trading bot' which would result in the extensive income returns. They also asked users to recruit new users (and thus new money).</p>
<p>The platform is now offline and the money is gone. There most likely never was a 'trading bot' in the first place - it was just a pyramide scam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say to be a pyramid it should have more than two layers, here it seems like everyone is paying to a single top layer ponzi-scheme-guy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. </p>
<p>Simply put, ponzi schemes are taking investors money, never investing it, and paying off older investors with newer investment money.</p>
<p>Until they collapse, they have to continually grow. Madoff was a good one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The defining characteristic of a Ponzi scheme is that the payouts to investors don’t come from an actual product or service, they come directly from other investors. Usually, you’ll say “oh I have this trading bot that makes 40%, you can cash out anytime, but why would you? Just let it sit here, watch your gains compound on paper”. In actuality, the gains don’t come from trading at all, they come from other people’s deposits directly. </p></div>		</li>
