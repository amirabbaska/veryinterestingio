			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to an elephant park in South Africa and they said the myth of elephant graveyards stems from elderly elephants needing to seek areas where there's food they can graze on when their teeth start to go and finding common areas. We were also told that elephants don't really get sick so often what kills an adult elephant is starvation after they lose all their teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had 2 extra sets of teeth, so after the baby teeth dropped and were replaced, another set started to try to force it's way out. That required the dentist yanking out a lot of molars with pliers (I was like 10 and also, that numbing cream they use is great) as they started to grow out sideways from my gums.</p></div>		</li>
