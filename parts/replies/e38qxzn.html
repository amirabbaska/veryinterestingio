			<div class="markdown"><p>Any structural limitation on size is irrelevant because the oxygen limit from not having lungs is reached long before any structural capacity comes into play, which is why insects were larger when there was more oxygen in the atmosphere even though gravity did not change.</p>
<p>Bones are generally fairly irrelevant to keeping our organs in place anyhow, much weaker connective tissue membranes does that, and they can be fairly easily compromised through injury.  A common example is how post-pregnancy, pelvic organs often prolapse into the vagina just from damage from normal pregnancy and  childbirth</p></div>		</li>
