			<div class="markdown"><p>Just bought subnautica. Seems interesting but I can def see it has its share of problems. Hope it gets fix as it needs a quite a bit of optimizations. </p>
<p>Still don't feel really ripped off. It was on sale and I knew what I was getting into from the reviews. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Great game, but I had to delete it from my school computer because it took up too much space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems well. Haven't gotten very far as only have about an hour playtime on it. Just lot of screen tearing and some lag spikes already. Might wait a bit to see if they roll out some optimizations before playing it too much. Only thing is I wish I had a vr headset to play it because it looks like that would be really fun. </p></div>		</li>
