			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really want to go down a rabbit hole, bring up home video. That's where the actors <em>really</em> got screwed. SAG unwisely let the studios table the issue when VHS first started taking off and then could never get a good deal for it, DVD or Blu-ray afterwards. </p>
<p>Surprised there isn't the usual posts about the ridiculous small amounts actors are sent (like for 14 cents) or one about <em>Residuals</em>, a bar in the Valley that used to give everyone a free drink if you brought in a residual check for less than $1 (they stapled them to the ceiling). IIRC it closed a few years ago. </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>Residuals Tavern</em> is still open and will still give you a free SECOND drink for residual checks under a buck, but looking at their photos on Yelp, they no longer have the old ones on the ceiling. </p></div>		</li>
