			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom was selling her house recently and there was one car that would do a burnout on her lawn about once a week, I think as they turned at the end of the street.</p>
<p>So I placed some scrap metal on the yard, came out a few weeks later and found it shredded. Never had the problem again.  That's my trap story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a story someone told me about his neighbor.  There was a kid who would drive his car through the bags of  leaves put out on the side of the street for pickup.  After it happened a couple times, one neighbor decided to put an engine block covered with a black plastic bag in the middle of the other bags of leaves.  That kid was not too happy when he came cruising through those bags of leaves and reached a fuckin engine block.  The neighbor claimed he was just disposing his old engine block with his leaves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of another story...</p>
<p>A guy was fed up with kids knocking over his mailbox... It used to be a thing where kids would cruise down the road with a baseball bat and knock down the curbside boxes.</p>
<p>So after it happened again, he filled his box with cement, and put another box next to it...</p>
<p>The kid was using an aluminum baseball bat. It wrapped around the cement box, and dislocated the kid's shoulder when he didn't immediately let go of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the story was posted on one of the revenge subreddits. Probably /r/prorevenge.</p>
<p>It was winter, OP built a snowman and some asshole ran over it with their SUV. After this happened a few times, OP built a snowman around a hydrant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://q13fox.com/2013/10/22/18-year-old-couple-arrested-for-hit-and-run-that-killed-2-young-girls/" target="_blank">There's also the really sad story about two young girls who were playing in a pile of leaves by the road. A car driving by decides to speed through the leaves and kills both girls.</a></p>
<p>Moral of the story: Everyone should treat their car the same way they should treat a loaded gun. You can't know for sure if there's a person in a pile of leaves or snow. Don't plow through shit for fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a guy who did a similar thing in his alley.  He had trouble with people racing down the alley behind his house and breaking fences and trash cans and all that.  </p>
<p>He put out some sharp scrap metal each night and picked it up in the morning. A couple of nights of that and then one morning the trouble makers ended up plowing through a neighbors fence and busting their radiator.  The scrap metal was innocuous enough that no one noticed it, and the kids had to pay for the fence repair as well as the damage to their car. (plus some nasty insurance premiums I'm sure)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not a hidden booby trap, it's scrap metal on a lawn in the open in plain sight. That's not a danger to people, it would be dangerous to a car, but so is brickwork lining a garden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  This is way different from the booby trapped house.  No one would need to be under his radio for any reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He forgets it's there and sells the car, guy who buys it wants to put a new radio in. Goes to swap the old one out, winds up in the hospital.</p>
<p>Mechanic's  working on the ignition system, turns out one of the wires runs behind the radio, and the radio needs to be pulled.</p>
<p>Car's just started to catch on fire due to a short, fireman needs to yank the radio out to get suppressant into the space behind it to stop the whole car from going up.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, there are reasons that people could be under there.</p>
<p>Same shit with booby traps in a house. If your house is on fire and the firefighters go in to fight the blaze and make sure there's no one trapped inside and they get mowed down by your 23-barrel-shotgun anti-burglary device, you are probably gonna go to prison for life, and justifiably fucking so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because booby trapping your car is illegal.</p>
<p>Mostly because (a) there's no discrimination in who gets hurt with a booby trap - including the people who own the car and (b) Because the penalty for theft / trespass or whatever is not being blown up or having your hands gouged on fishhooks.</p></div>		</li>
