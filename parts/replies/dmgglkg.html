<p>you'll find soldiers that have thrown themselves on grenades</p>

<p>This guy, Lance Corporal Matt Croucher, jumped on a grenade but his rucksack took the blast and he survived.  He was awarded the George Cross, one below the VC, which is on display along with the rucksack in the Imperial War Museum in London.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Donald P. Sloat was my uncle, he died in Vietnam from a grenade that he picked up to throw away, then realized he couldn’t do safely. He was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously in 2014. Hands down the most badass uncle I’ve had, and going to that ceremony was one of the proudest trips of my life. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top comment.  Suicide bombers aren't using high explosives where the shockwave is a threat.  High explosives are difficult to ignite.  They're likely using something along the lines of gunpowder.  Which by itself, not all that lethal in a bomb except in a very close proximity (basically a firecracker).  However, when you start coating the outside in ball bearings and nails and such, that basically turns the explosion into multiple gunshots in every direction.  By hugging a suicide bomber you're body takes the brunt of the shrapnel.  Even if some shrapnel makes it all the way through your body it would've lost enough inertia that it would be much less of a threat to others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, water is VERY effective at absorbing energy. I'm sure you'd get a similar result if you set a bucket of water on top of the grenade. It just so happens that humans are mostly water, and so jumping on top of a grenade is also very effective at absorbing the blast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're like what, 60-70% water? So it's like setting an almost full 10-gallon drum on top of the grenade for anyone that needs a visual. And then the rest of the weight of the soldier himself on top of that.</p></div>		</li>
