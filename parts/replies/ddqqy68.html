<p>In both cases, nuclear workers didn't understand the purpose of time consuming procedures for handling uranium solution. They took shortcuts that seemed reasonable to them which caused a fatal criticality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious about the exact nature of the accident and found <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/demon-core-the-strange-death-of-louis-slotin" target="_blank">a description here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slotin’s procedure was simple. He would lower a half-shell of beryllium, called the tamper, over the core, stopping just before it was snugly seated. The tamper would reflect back the neutrons that were shooting off the plutonium, jump-starting a weak and short-lived nuclear chain reaction, on which the physicists could then gather data. Slotin held the tamper in his left hand. In his right hand, he held a long screwdriver, which he planned to wedge between the two components, keeping them apart. As he began the slow and painstaking process of lowering the tamper, one of his colleagues, Raemer Schreiber, turned away to focus on other work, expecting that the experiment would be uninteresting until several more moments had passed. But suddenly he heard a sound behind him: Slotin’s screwdriver had slipped, and the tamper had dropped fully over the core. When Schreiber turned around, he saw a flash of blue light and felt a wave of heat on his face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Slotin died 9 days later.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Slotin vomited once prior to being examined, and several times more in the next few hours, but stopped by the next morning. His general health seemed acceptable. But his left hand, initially numb and tingling, became increasingly painful. This was the hand that had been closest to the core, and scientists later estimated that it had received more than fifteen thousand rem of low-energy X rays. Slotin’s whole-body dose was around twenty-one hundred rem of neutrons, gamma rays, and X rays. (Five hundred rem is usually fatal for humans.) The hand eventually took on a waxy blue appearance and developed large blisters. Slotin’s physicians kept it packed in ice, to limit the swelling and the pain. His right hand, which had been holding the screwdriver, suffered lesser versions of these symptoms.</p>
<p>Slotin called his parents, in Winnipeg, who were flown out to New Mexico on the Army’s dime. They arrived four days after the accident. On the fifth day, Slotin’s white-blood-cell count dropped dramatically. His temperature and pulse began to fluctuate. “From this day on, the patient failed rapidly,” the medical report noted. Slotin suffered nausea and abdominal pain and began losing weight. He had internal radiation burns—what one medical expert called a “three-dimensional sunburn.” By the seventh day, he was experiencing periods of “mental confusion.” His lips turned blue and he was put in an oxygen tent. Eventually, he sank into a coma. He died nine days after the accident, at the age of thirty-five. </p>

<p>Creepy stuff. Hence the name &quot;walking dead&quot; for patients with severe radiation sickness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those wondering what that flash of blue light might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pa0Fmcv83nw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/pa0Fmcv83nw</a></p>
<p>It's from photons (gamma rays) shooting out into something where the speed of light is slower than they were going. This causes a light &quot;sonic boom&quot; of sorts and releases a lot of light.</p>
<p>Edit: This post is incorrect. The actual flash was likely air ionization and the flash in the video is from non-photons traveling faster than the local speed of light (beta/gamma/neutrons). The video is cool none-the-less.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Gamma radiation, which are photons, by definition can not create cherenkov radiation as they are massless particles (and thus always travel at the local speed of light). What it may have done in that situation is ionize the air and produce a similar flash. </p>
<p>The particle radiation (beta and Neutron in that case) likely would not have sufficient energy to be traveling faster than the speed of light in air.</p></div>		</li>
