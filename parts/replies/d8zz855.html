			<p>generally, no.  Obsidian has certain chemical properties that make it so.<br><br>I.e. very felsic and igneous rock (basically really really hot silica deficient  &quot;melt&quot; (or a composite of different minerals in the earth) that cools drastically to form really really sharp crystals </p>		</li>

			<p>Not just break apart <em>leaving</em> that edge, but also that the edge remains stable.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;it's happens to shatter in a way that can produce the edges thin enough‚Äù was the ELI5 part haha... But I like puns. </p>		</li>
