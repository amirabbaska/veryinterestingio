			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. </p>
<p>Another issue brought about by your point is, how about the excess cooked food that wasn't served/eaten? Generally, that's also counted as a loss (depending on what food it is). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they too make losses from that. However, I've seen many restaurants charging you additional 10% for excessive wasting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true of a lot of all-you-can-eat sushi places, especially.  If you leave anything uneaten on the plate they'll charge you the price of that item.  I assume they've had issues in the past with people stuffing themselves then ordering a dozen extra rolls just to go to waste.</p>
<p>I'm sure most places aren't super strict about it unless you're really being an ass, but I'm the type of person who's literally scraping up the last few scraps of rice before the bill comes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know any buffet that doesn't charge you for wastage. I used to think it was silly (what difference should it matter whether that extra food went into my stomach or the garbage?) but it forces people to consider whether they REALLY need another dynamite roll on their plate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They use it as ingredients for other dishes. Leftover fried chicken can be cut up to put in the salad bar, in a soup, in chicken salad, etc. leftover potatoes can be mashed, hash or hash browns, soup...</p>
<p>Like have you noticed that at every buffet they have beef slices (like brisket) and then also some sort of beef with vegetables and sauce dish that's like 2 buffets away to trick you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't worked in all you can eat places, but I've worked in summer camp and hospital cafeterias that make items in large batches.</p>
<p>There is generally only a little variance in the amount of a food that is needed. Like at the hospital, we would make 6 pans of cheesy hashbrowns on weekends, 8 pans on slow week days (Mondays and Fridays, generally) and 10-12 on busy days. We would almost never have more than a half pan of waste. If we ran out, we could just use a quick filler item like instant mashed potatoes and swap out the sign in the cafeteria. It's probably similar in buffets.</p>
<p>When you serve the same things night after night, you notice how much you tend to use under given circumstances and determine how much to make based on historical demand.</p>
<p>It's similar to how many fast food chains have programs that tell the managers how many hours of labor to schedule based on sales history for that day and time of year. It's never going to be perfect, but demand is generally pretty predictable. Hell, I worked in a gas station chain and each week they'd print up a sheet that told us how many of each donut, sandwich, etc to make per day based on recent demand.  </p>
<p>So generally, there's an acceptable margin of loss on the food. Like, keeping food waste below 20%, to use an example from a fast food place I worked at. So as long as we keep it within that 20% ish range, the loss is built into the cost of the food we are serving, as is the amount of labor needed to produce it and the initial cost of the food, plus a profit. </p>
<p>Between predicting demand and building in a certain amount of food waste into the price, you offset your losses.</p></div>		</li>
