			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing ventilation breaths (given during CPR) with &quot;rescue breaths&quot; - five initial breaths given prior to commencing CPR in arrest of likely hypoxic aetiology (adult drowning / all paediatric). Rationale is that doing compressions to pump deoxygenated blood is pretty pointless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I've never heard the terms used independently. All my source materials describe the breaths given at 30:2 ratio to be rescue breaths. As far as breaths given before compressions, those are not recommended in any case in the g2015 standard.   </p>
<p>Edit: as stated earlier, we can both be right, it just depends on your location, source material and level of training. </p></div>		</li>
