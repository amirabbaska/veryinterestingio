			<div class="markdown"><p>Other units of measurement exist.  There's <em>gradians</em> where a right-angle is 100 (and a full circle is 400) but they're not widely used.</p>
<p>Once you get into any interesting mathematics, you start using <em>radians</em>, where the full circle is 2π radians.  At first look, it seems awkward but it makes the math around trig functions <em>much</em> easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't just make it easier, radians is the only division of the circle which isn't arbitrary.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll correct myself, radians is one of the few divisions which are not arbitrary (however in my opinion it's the most &quot;natural&quot; one). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Technically</em> it's still arbitrary, as it depends on how you define the circle constant (circumference divided by diameter versus radius). </p>
<p>But relating it to pi is certainly more grounded than the alternatives. </p>
<p>Edit: Shit, yeah, I'm wrong. The 2 pi notation is arbitrary, but the number of radians remains constant. </p>
<p>Edit 2: Wait shit no it is arbitrary, isn't it? Why should we base the radians on the radius at all? Why not 'diadians' based on the diameter? </p>
<p>Edit 3: It's settled. Radians <em>are</em> non-arbitrary, but that doesn't mean there aren't other non-arbitrary measures too. Case closed! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Milliradian or a thousandth of a radian often used called mil, with 6283.1853..... mils in a circle. When you need high accuracy it is simpler to have a system that you can use without decimals. So optics and sights on rifles are in mils.</p>
<p>They can also be used for range estimation if the target size is known. For example a 1 meter wide object is 10 mils with at 100m 2 mils at 500m and 1 mil.</p>
<p>The estimation that the distance in meter is the target width in mm divided by the with in mils is useful.</p>
<p>So radians or a thousand of a radian is often used in practice even it the user might know know that that a full circle is 2*pi radians. or even that mils is miliradians </p>
<p>There are another definition of 6400 mils in a circle instead of 6283.1853..... is is used in military artillery sights and compasses. It is changed so a straight angle is 1600 mils and not a fraction. It is useful because the because you can have high accuracy without any decimals. 385 mils is simpler to communicate then 21.6 degrees</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a gunner on an LAV 25. Can confirm that the turret has markings inside divided up in mils. I don't remember using them a lot though, the sight has markings that are based of of mils and distance like you said, but you don't really have to understand mils to use it. What you do is &quot;choke&quot; the target between to tapering lines on the sight, fire a burst, then quickly adjust if you missed and fire again. Good times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radians are hard to understand at first because angles in radians are usually expressed as multiples of pi (e.g. pi/4) but the implicit 1/4 fraction there refers to a quarter of a <strong>half-circle</strong> (since pi radians = half turn). This is one reason to prefer tau to pi (tau = 2pi), since an angle of tau/4 is &quot;a quarter turn&quot; or 90 degrees.</p>
<p>Also, simple calculators say &quot;0.52359878&quot; for pi/6 radians. And since math class has devolved into calculator class nowadays, radians are of course much more complicated than degrees, just look at all those decimals.</p>
<p>This term, I asked my students, in 1st year of college: &quot;why is 1 divided by 0 undefined?&quot; (expecting an answer along the lines of &quot;because it's impossible to get 1 by multiplying 0 by a real number&quot;.) You know what they answered? &quot;Because the calculator says 'error'.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They still haven't clicked for me, despite years of studying them.  I still have to convert to degrees to understand what angle I'm looking at.</p>
<p>For this reason, I am a huge advocate for teaching radians much earlier in school -- like, as soon as you start teaching about angles -- so kids can get used to thinking in radians instead of degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking of it in terms of tau (τ) also makes it make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>τ = 2π, so half a revolution is .5τ rather than 1π. It makes more intuitive sense for a beginner.</p>
<p>I think kids should be taught about tau, but encouraged to use pi practically. Would have helped me a ton if I knew about it when learning trig.</p></div>		</li>
