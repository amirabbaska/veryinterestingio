			<p>Well if you want weird, early arthropods were about as weird as they come. Fossils from the so call Cambrian Explosion (550-500 Million Years Ago), shows us all the funky things nature tried nice and early in the evolutionary track.<br><br>Things like the 5 eyed [Opabinia] (<a href="http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/camex/opabin.gif" target="_blank">http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/camex/opabin.gif</a>), the almost squid like [Anomalocaris] (<a href="http://bioteaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/anomalocaris-500m-year-old-predator-1.jpg" target="_blank">http://bioteaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/anomalocaris-500m-year-old-predator-1.jpg</a>) , and the nightmare fuel [Marrella] (<a href="http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/video/fossil-gallery/0b1-marrella-turntable.jpg" target="_blank">http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/video/fossil-gallery/0b1-marrella-turntable.jpg</a>) are some of the more interesting ones<br><br>But for fish, I'd call the early shark [Helicoprion] (<a href="http://www.wild-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Helicoprion.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.wild-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Helicoprion.jpg</a>) is one of the strangest</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, if I could catch any one species from the past, I'd probably catch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullimonstrum" target="_blank">Tullimonstrum</a> because nobody knows what the crap it was--and even weirder, it comes from long after the Cambrian when you expect to find weird things.  </p>		</li>

			<p>As far as fish go, the weirdest ones would probably be some of the early jawless armored fish. Some of the ancestors of lampreys, or their relatives, looked like <a href="http://www.huntsearch.gla.ac.uk/zooimages/140080.JPG" target="_blank">this.</a> You might mistake it for a horseshoe crab before realizing it's actually a fish.<br><br>However, that's nothing compared to the <em>invertebrates</em> you could catch. Go back to the Cambrian and you could find the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Opabinia_BW.jpg" target="_blank">opabinia,</a> a free-swimming predatory invertebrate with five eyes and a mouth shaped like an elephant's trunk. We still don't know where this thing fits into the evolutionary tree, only that it and all its descendants died out more than 400 million years ago. They were small creatures, only a few inches long, but jump forward a hundred million years or so and you could find <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Jaekelopterus_rhenaniae_reconstruction.jpg" target="_blank">eurypterids,</a> giant clawed sea scorpions that could grow as long as a human is tall.</p>		</li>
