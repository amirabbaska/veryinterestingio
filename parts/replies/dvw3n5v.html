			<div class="markdown"><p>Concorde had afterburners.  It was used for takeoff and for accelerating to the Mach 1.7 cruise speed, at which point the engines supercruised (supersonic flight without afterburner).</p>
<p>The TU-144 also used afterburners, which were on full at takeoff and throttled low at cruise.  This is why the TU-144 didn't have the range of Concorde.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is this pedestrian M1.7 you speak of? And the afterburners were for takeoff, and to punch through transonic speeds. </p>
<p>The Tu-144 didn’t have the range because it wasn’t designed as well, didn’t have the benefit of CAD design, didn’t have a tunnel between the engine pairs to aid in lift...it’s a little too simple to say “because they were flying in afterburner all the time” when the details are so much more beautiful to explore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um. The OP / question was about engines and afterburners, so I didn't  go into the aerodynamic design differences between the Concorde and TU-144.  I was more or less supporting the previous point that afterburners use a crapload of fuel.  </p>
<p>ISTR Concorde did not use reheat above M1.7.   It cruised at speeds above that.  (you're of course correct that it was a fair bit higher)</p>
<p>Are you sure the Concorde was CAD? There were computers involved in working out the aerodynamics, but AFAIK the plane itself was designed with traditional paper &amp; ink engineering drawings.  I have always thought that the 777 took the honours of the first pure CAD design. (using CATIA, ISTR). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuel is not the only cost added by afterburners. Using the afterburner causes accelerated coating wear/loss in the combustor and other areas. This of course means more maintenance and part replacements. No way commercial airlines want to deal with these extra costs and engine downtime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly would the afterburner that is located &quot;after&quot; the turbine wear out the combustor? The sole purpose of reheat is to bring the temperature back up after the turbine work has been extracted to get this little bit of extra thrust out. Reheat doesn't change a thing in the combustor.</p></div>		</li>
