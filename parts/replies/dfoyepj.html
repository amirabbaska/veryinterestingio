			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually you will begin to &quot;see&quot; your hands and feet. If you wave your hand in front of your face in total darkness you'll see a sort of ghost like movement that your brain makes up because it knows it has to be there. If you stayed in total darkness for long enough you will even begin to put together a mental image of the cave and will see your fingers move, boundary walls, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of what sight is though. Your brain is interpreting the data. Yes, it's not going to be as vivid or complete when stuck in total darkness, but you are still &quot;seeing&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it kinda self-explanatory that in true darkness you don't see anything? Their question was about what our eyes focus on when it is truly pitch black tho, not what we actually see. When we can't see anything what are our eyes doing? Someone else said they seem to just relax tho, or use previous experience to focus on an approximate distance (unless i understood that wrong)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can't figure out which way is up or down you're supposed to spit and go the opposite way. The spit goes in the direction where there is the most gravity. It works in avalanches, should work in caves.</p>
