			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's actually because it's &quot;on the back&quot; of the card which requires you to &quot;turn the card over&quot;.</p>
<p>This simple requirement is very hard to achieve without card-in-hand and this is going to prevent a lot of fraud . The key isn't in the odds of &quot;more numbers&quot; .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they weren't. I think they gave me a new card with the new security feature in 2001 or 2002. Online shopping became a big thing in the late 90s. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> googled it. They started on visa in 01, and they're &quot;card not present&quot; security features that were originally devised in 95. Contact paper was super rare at that point. Pretty much everyone had magnetic readers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I STILL see the old &quot;ker-thunker&quot; (as i used to call them as a kid) plate/card roller machines once in a while, as some places keep them on hand in case internet/computer is down, so they can still take cards. </p></div>		</li>
