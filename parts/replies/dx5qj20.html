I don’t drink caffeine and I’m a terribly light sleeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people with the &quot;deep sleep&quot; gene variants can still fall asleep after drinking caffeine, while light sleepers can't as easily. There are also genes that affect how fast you process caffeine, though, which adds more complexity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I'm a deep sleeper, and I can fall asleep pretty much right after having a coffee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been a notoriously deep sleeper my entire life, but I’m fairly sensitive to caffeine. I just wasn’t exposed to it much as a kid, so I can definitely say the 2 aren’t synonymous for me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband, a retired Marine who works the night shift, can fall asleep in seconds and sleep like the dead for half a day even if he had caffeine right before bed or got good hours recently. Just survival habit. I can't have caffeine after 3pm if I want to sleep at all, but I have to have it to wake up because my sleep study showed I go into deep sleep about half as often as average. Bodies are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To push back on this a bit, adenosine primarily regulates sleep initiation, and is cleared from the brain rather quickly after actually falling asleep. </p>
<p>edit: adenosine has other functions besides sleep initiation</p></div>		</li>
