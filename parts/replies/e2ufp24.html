			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd take the physical symptoms of a hangover any day over the emotional ones. The panic, anxiety, self-loathing suicidal thoughts, etc. It's fucking terrible. Sometimes I do miss the temporary relief drinking provides, but it's not worth it. I literally scared myself away from alcohol because of the emotional trauma it caused. Fuck that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took a while for me to realize how much a night of drinking would affect my mental state the next day. The panic and anxiety would be intense, even if I acknowledge and think about why it’s happening. Two things made it better for me: drinking more or drinking nothing at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  I can deal with the physical symptoms and I’m in my 40’s.  They are nothing compared to the depression that sets in the following day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely. I could generally live with the headache or nausea I used to get with a hangover when I was younger. </p>
<p>In a way it was a good thing that the symptoms I got became so much more unbearable as it finally rendered me unable to just function as an alcoholic and live with having headaches every morning. It kind of forced me to make a choice between being a functional person or a drunk. Nearly a year on, I feel like I chose wisely.</p></div>		</li>
