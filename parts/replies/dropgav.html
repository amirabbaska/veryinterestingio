			<div class="markdown"><p>As a materials science and engineering undergrad, I like this response. One of my favorite examples of this happening was with the Liberty ships in the WWII era. Basically what happened is they made ships out of what they thought was ductile steel, but once they were launched the water was cold enough to make the steel undergo the transition to a brittle steel. The result was that any cracks or defects were made to be much more dangerous to the structure of the ship. Some of them actually ended up splitting the entire hull. <a href="https://metallurgyandmaterials.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/liberty-ship-failure.jpg?w=640" target="_blank">Here's a picture of one the ships that did.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was listed in my materials book as the reason portholes, doors -- basically any hole in modern metal ships -- are rounded rather than square: smooth surfaces/edges are much less likely to develop or contain cracks. </p>
<p>Tangentially, this is also why polished surfaces tend to have greater longevity -- you're literally buffing away surface cracks and removing defects from which cracks can easily form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct! The 90 degree corners acted as stress concentrators which made the steel fail at a lower level than otherwise would be expected and is also why they are now rounded, like you mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Materials Engineer (BEng) here. Good answer. The one thing I would add to put it into more layman’s terms is that, most materials will go brittle at some point and that the ductile to brittle transition temperatures differ for pretty much every material. That’s why it may seem that at cold temperatures some materials go brittle and others don’t.</p>
<p>Plastics like polystyrene for example will go ductile at about 100C. Where as Polyethylene has a transition point of around -5C iirc. It’s all to do with differences in molecular structure. Some rubbers such as polybutadiene or phenylsilicone won’t go brittle until around -80C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical Engineer (BEng) who streamed in polymer design here. This is true, and I'd add to this that especially for polymers, often times the polymer is selected and the glass transition temperature (the temperature at which they go from ductile to brittle basically) is manipulated intentionally to suit the application. The manipulation can be done a variety of ways that go beyond an ELI5 thread, but all involve changing the molecular structure in some way.</p>
<p>Polyethylene has a transition range of about -125C to -80C (depending on type), which is why you see it used for things like plastic grocery bags - they need to be ductile. Whereas Poly(methyl methacrylate) (Plexiglas), has a glass transition temperature of about 105C and you see it used for things like windows where it's beneficial to be rigid and brittle.</p></div>		</li>
