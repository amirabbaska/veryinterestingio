			<div class="markdown"><p>This. There's a huge industry based on tracking you and serving you ads across multiple devices and systems. They know much more about you than you may think, and use it to identify you behind the scenes.</p>
<p>They've gone as far as doing &quot;thumbprinting&quot; where they collect settings like your screen resolution and browser of choice and save them to a profile so they can find you later. It's all very interesting and can be quite creepy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Facebook app though wouldn't be using AdMob (or whatever Google's mobile ads solution is called these days) - it would be using Facebook's own ad network. I'd think they'd have to have used Facebook on their laptop at some point or another in order for Facebook to get useful tracking data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ad networks can overlap, user data can be sold between them. I don't know how they do it, but I'd be very surprised if they didn't share all this data with each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend started getting my eBay watch list as Facebook adverts (literally) when we were both connected to her home WiFi. As I don't use Facebook, I can I let guess eBay or something on my smartphone employ their ad scheme somehow.</p></div>		</li>
