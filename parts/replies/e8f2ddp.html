<p>In a classical model with a discrete electron orbiting a nucleus, you'd expect that certain properties like position to change in a regular, predictable way depending on the moment that you interact with it, such as by firing a well-aimed photon at it.</p>
<p>In reality this doesn't happen, it doesn't matter when you fire that photon, the result is entirely unpredictable within certain bounds, and assuming ideal conditions, those bounds never change over time either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And they just chill, with no discernable change in time. I linked a picture but if I'd linked a gif it'd look.... Just like that. No change in time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think one of the things that helps me partially particle wave duality is the explanation that if you have  a fixed known momentum, a free election is basically a plane wave. However, since having fixed known momentum is a bit 'unphysical' (via uncertainty) it's more correct to think of a free election as a sum of plane waves with different momenta yielding a more localized wave packet. Thus in some sense it 'looks and acts' like a particle but when those waves interact with anything constructively/destructively some of those waves collapse and the true wave character of the 'particle' is 'revealed'. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not what wave-particle duality is though. What you're describing, which is Heisenberg's Uncertainty, is a property of all WAVE-LIKE phenomenon. It's just something that is generally true with wav-y things that the more localized it is, the greater the spread in wavelengths you need to build that wave. Heisenberg's Uncertainy, where position-momentum is considered at least, is nothing special to quantum mechanics (QM)</p>
<p>The way you're thinking about Heisenberg's position-momentum uncertainty is very good and correct, you've got the idea, but that <em>isn't</em> what the term &quot;wave-particle duality&quot; is referring to, the behaviour you're describing is all wave baby.</p>
<p>Rather, wave-particle duality is in reference to something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_problem" target="_blank">Mott problem</a> or the case of a double-slit experiment on a screen. In something like the double-slit experiment, the WAVE-FUNCTION, looks like <a href="http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/experiments/two-slit_experiment/Double-slit.png" target="_blank">this</a>. It's not localized, it's not bunched up. It's all fanned out and wavy. But when you actually do this experiment one particle at a time, and make a MEASUREMENT you will find, with each particle, only a single particle-like trajectory is detected. But if you do the experiment over and over again you'll <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Double-slit_experiment_results_Tanamura_2.jpg" target="_blank">find</a> you'll recover the wave-function shape predicted by Schrödinger's equation.</p>
<p>So the mathematical machinery of QM is dictated by Schrödinger's equation which solely describes the behaviour of a wave-y wavefunction. This wavefunction is constrained by this trade-off you described of bunching up versus having a clear wavelength. But that's not wave-particle duality, that's just waves being waves. Once you have calculated the wave-function, its square is the PROBABILITY of a given outcome. At that point the math machinery of QM stops. It's done its job. Now you do a measurement. When you measure, you won't get the wave-function, you'll get a particle-like trajectory <em>randomly picked OUT of the probability distribution dictated by the wave-function</em>.  THAT is wave-particle duality. The collapse of the wave-function to a particle-like trajectory upon certain types of measurements.</p>
<p>Of course, in practical application, in how we used QM to build the digital age with quantum technologies like everyday computers and microchips and lasers and LEDs and so on, there is no great &quot;measurement&quot; to speak of, but rather just aggregate behaviour, which will be fully wavy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not so much unphysical as an extreme limit of the uncertainty inequality.  If you have a precisely defined momentum as in a plane wave (uncertainty 0 in momentum), the uncertainty in position has to be infinite - and so your plane wave has an infinite extent.  Adding in plane waves with different momenta does allow you to create a localized wave packet as you describe.</p></div>		</li>
