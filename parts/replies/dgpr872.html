			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Texas and for the most part no one gives a shit about the &quot;North&quot; in my experience I've heard a lot more rude and negative comments from Norther people towards the south, so for someone from the &quot;North&quot; to just assume everyone in the south still hates the  &quot;damn yankees&quot; you're just wrong.</p>
<p>Also fuck the Yankees GO RED SOX!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This incredibly pedantic comment is making my brain hurt. I'm going to assume you're from a pretty large city if you've never heard anyone complain about those damn yankees.</p>
<p>Yankees are Yankees but damn yankees never leave. They never forget to be rude to locals or constantly talk about how great the north is. I'm from the north myself and moved to the south for work. I don't get why so many other yankees have to constantly shit on the locals, when they <strong>chose</strong> to move down here. </p>
<p>&quot;Well they're all stupid and fat&quot; gee why would anyone from the south have pride in the time their grandad probably shot your grandad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Texas also and you're right I've never really seen specific &quot;North&quot; bad mouthing unless that north is above the red river. Lol Texans if anything talk smack about the rest of the country as a whole and consider ourselves as a separate entity from the South. The south from what ive seen is usually in reference to states like geoegia, alabama, Mississippi, virginia, and the carolinas. </p></div>		</li>
