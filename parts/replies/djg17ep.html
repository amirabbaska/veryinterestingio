			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who made the switch to a standing desk, it's uncomfortable to stand longer than 5-10 min without moving around a bit.  It's forced me to either sit back down or take mini breaks to get water, stretch, etc.. I'd say I'm a bit less productive but your experience may vary.</p>
<p>Before you get one, try working with your laptop/desktop on your kitchen table.  I kind of wish I did that before I built my desk (16ft long, all standing height!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I've never seen anyone with a permanently standing desk. All the variants I've seen have had a function to raise the desk from a sitting to a standing position.</p>
<p>It's definitely worth using a standing desk... If you can go back to sitting afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in an office as an office assistant. Sucked when this became a thing. I had to install about 20 of them. Only to uninstall half of them after 2-4 weeks. And constantly walking by people who stopped using them but were too embarrassed to ask administration to move it. Was not a fan of this fad. Maybe one guy was still using it when I left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did some research on this a while back and if memory serves, standing all day can be as bad as sitting all day- but they cause different problems. The least damaging thing for you is to not stay in any one position too long (ideally switching every 30-60 minutes). A balance of sitting, standing, and moving around is the ideal setup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that many people will not be able to set up a treadmill desk where they work haha.</p>
<p>Considering everything, I think the best option is the chair that the seat is an exercise rubber ball.  You're forced to balance on it and move your hips, torso, legs, etc.  even if it may look a little silly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I suspected, I think a standing position will force me to move around, and I can afford the distractability at work as most of my work on the computer gets done in 20-40 min per task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I switched to a standing desk a year or so ago. Maybe longer. It's nicer than sitting all the time, IMO, but it's not a magical cure for body aches. If your hobbies tend to have you sitting, it's probably better to spend some time standing while working.</p>
<p>The lack of walking around does get to you, though, as this thread makes clear. When I was a line cook in high school I spent the same amount of time on me feet but I was constantly moving around. That was easier to do than being at a standing desk. Thus, I do end up moving my legs and shifting positions a lot, and sit-down breaks are very nice. </p>
<p>But, since switching to a standing desk, my back is much less likely to be sore. I do manage to stand up for most of the day, but I kinda wish I had a treadmill underfoot instead of a standing mat.</p>
<p>Only thing I've got to try to fix now is my tendency to hold my head so far forward... Ain't tryna have that Bieber mugshot neck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your legs are sometimes considered a &quot;second heart&quot;. If you ever feel lightheaded just move from your heels to your toes repeatedly, or move your feet up and down if you are sitting. This will cause blood to flow back to the heart, increasing blood pressure a little. And that's because of the physiological rule: cardiac input is cardiac output. The heart has to pump out the volume of blood that comes in, so if you can increase the input you can also &quot;control&quot; the output a little :)</p></div>		</li>
