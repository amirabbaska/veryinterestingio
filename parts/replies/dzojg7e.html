			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow... </p>
<p>I'm kinda astonished by this revelation... </p>
<p>I've actually NEVER seen a bottle of 10,000 IU Vitamin D pills being sold at any pharmacy I've shopped at. </p>
<p>Personally, I think it's a bit insane to sell 10,000 IU per pill doses of vitamin D bottles, except for special cases like cancer-research, etc... </p>
<p>But yes, honestly, the highest dosage bottle of Vitamin-D I've ever seen in my entire life is 1000 IU. </p>
<p>(And I buy the stuff all the time.)</p>
<hr />
<p>BUT... </p>
<p>assuming you are correct, then yes absolutely (that's a good suggestion on your part!) and I will certainly refrain from using &quot;pill&quot; as a unit of measurement in any future comment I make here on Reddit in regard to Vitamin D. </p>
<hr />
<p>Even though... I clearly mentioned MULTIPLE times in my comment that a pill is &quot;1000 IU&quot;... </p>
<p>and my comment on Reddit is not part of a health article, nor is my message part of pill consumption instructions packaged with the bottle... </p>
<p>But I still think I will certainly follow your suggestion in the future, given how higher doses (like an insane single dosage of 10,000 IU!) have now seemingly become more frequent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People with vitamin D deficiency are routinely directed to take up to 10,000 IU per day or sometimes given a weekly megadose by prescription (50,000 IU in a single pill). Those at risk are also advised to supplement up to 2,000 IU per day. Most pharmacies do carry several different dosages over the counter. It is possible you live in a region with lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, which is why you don't see the higher doses at your pharmacy, but actually more than 1/3 of American adults are deficient to some degree. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it’s location dependent. I’d bet those living in southern areas tend to buy fewer bottles of higher dosage because it’s not needed. Here in Alaska, 2,000 and 5,000 IU are very common. I currently have a bottle of 2,000 IU I bought from Costco. I’ve had a bottle of 5,000 before.</p></div>		</li>
