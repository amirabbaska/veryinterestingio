			<div class="markdown"><p>No. My understanding was that it has only been recently that the energy of the expansion of the universe became stronger than gravity because the density of matter is decreasing.</p>
<p>There is alot of time between the big bang and that point. Shouldnt gravity have cause the universe to collapse again after the big bang ? </p>
<p>For example 1 billion years after the big bang, the galaxies were much closer together. So that eans gravity between galaxies was much stronger. How did the universe expnd with that much gravity? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Momentum. This is the same as asking why when you throw a ball up, it keeps going up for a while before coming back down, even with &quot;that much gravity&quot; from the Earth. It's because the ball has kinetic energy that needs to be converted into gravitational potential energy first. The same is with the resultant matter from the big bang. It has enough momentum to keep going for a long time.</p>
<p>The other side of this question is gravity. It's a <em>really</em> weak force. Try it. You can grab a paperclip and a little fridge magnet, and the magnet will attract the paperclip enough to lift it up. Think about this - your tiny magnet is creating a magnetic field that is overpowering <em>the entire Earth's gravitational field</em>. A quick calculation shows that gravity is about 10^33 times weaker than electromagnetism, as far as the forces themselves go.</p>
<p>So back to the big bag. You have a lot of matter travelling very fast, and this super-weak force trying to pull it back together. Momentum will win out for a long time. But of course, gravity is ever-present and inescapable. <em>Eventually</em>, gravitational attraction will pull matter together, and it has, at least on local scales, as evidenced by our galaxies, stars, planets, and us. It stands to reason then that since every piece of matter in the universe attracts every other piece of matter, eventually it'll all be pulled together again.</p>
<p>The problem is, when we look out at the universe with our telescopes, we see the universe receding away from us, <em>in every direction</em>. And what we can also see is that the further away objects are, the <em>faster</em> they are moving away from us. These two observations lead to a conclusion that the Universe is expanding, and at an accelerating rate. Which is completely at odds with our previous hypothesis, that the Universe should either be deflating, or that it should still be expanding but the rate of expansion is slowing.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the universe was acting like our first hypothesis with gravity being the dominant force until around 9 billion year ago. Acceleration of size <em>was</em> slowing down. Then, 9 billion years ago dark energy became the dominant force in the universe and started the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, and this is the universe we live in today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's that the energy being produced was simply pushing everything apart, like a regular explosion, and it just so happened that right around when you'd think it'd be slowing down and getting ready to begin collapsing again there was enough empty space (and thus vacuum energy) to repel things more strongly than gravity could pull anymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you want to look more into inflation - but that's well before galaxies/stars are formed (10^(-32) seconds) and the mechanism responsible for it is still unknown - it is the period of rapid expansion directly after the Big Bang </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are theories for everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity was not a separate force until after the Big Bang. All the elementary forces were combined into one. It wasnt until the universe cooled a bit (became less dense) that the forces separated into distinct forms. Gravity was the first force to separate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that we understand what happened up to a fraction of a second after the big bang. Did this clumping start before our point where we understsnd what happened? </p>
<p>Do we know we had this clumping? Shouldnt wverything have been uniform and this means an equal amount of gravity in all directions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't remember the word for it, but basically the energy fields are in fact NOT uniform and indeed caused the clumping we see has galaxies and such</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really, do post it as an independent question. Things acquire mass when particles are trapped by the Higgs Field (remember the God Particle years ago? It's an effect of this field). Gravity is a distortion in spacetime caused by massive objects. The Higgs Field value is zero when the temperature is higher than ~10^15 K, it just doesn't work. When the universe was hotter than this, there wasn't mass, so there couldn't be matter or gravity, but it was still made by free moving particles. When it cooled down below this point, particles that acquired mass via interaction with the field weren't uniformly distributed among the universe (not in the smallest scales at least), but formed patches of higher and lower density, these clumps attracted nearby particles and the universe expanded between the clumps. Indeed gravity was stronger, which is why the expansion rate is increasing and we can measure it. As dark energy emerges and occupies a higher proportion of the universe, the expansion rate increases, until it's effectively 100%, then the universe will expand at a constant rate (proportionally, not in absolute value. E.g.: it will double at every t interval. For now t is decreasing, eventually it stays constant).</p></div>		</li>
