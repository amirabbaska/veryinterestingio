			<div class="markdown"><p>I've bid on plenty of antique auctions in the US, and while there is a constant stream of chatter (just like radio, you want to avoid dead air), it isn't the rapid-fire speech that you see in the cattle auctions. Just a repetition of the current and next bids. &quot;I have $500, I'm looking for $550, any increase on $500, looking for $550, $500 going once, going twice, all in, fair warning... sold for $500 to paddle number X&quot; (or &quot;to so-and-so's phone bidder&quot;).</p>
<p>If you don't need something <em>right now</em> (i.e., you can afford to spend a year looking at everything that they sell and bid only when the price is right), you can save a hell of a lot of money. Most of the bidders are dealers who have to be able to sell it at a profit, so they're naturally a bit more cautious about their bids. If you're a homeowner, you're comparing your auction price to the price you'd have to pay in a store, so you can outbid them.</p></div>		</li>
