			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We borrowed the Latin alphabet so we have a very ill fitting set of symbols for our sounds and also the way we spell a lot of words is fixed to how they were pronounced hundreds of years ago but we do try to use our letters to represent sounds so our alphabet is technically phonetic.</p></div>		</li>
