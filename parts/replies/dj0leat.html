			<div class="markdown"><p>Among artists, there are painters, cartoonists, illustrators, and so on.  Just in comics, the pencils are sketched by one person usually working from a storyboard they created, traced by an inker who emphasizes certain lines and solidifies potential into sharp relief, and colored by a colorist who matches the official palette of the characters to the environment's lighting.</p>
<p>Yet we expect one writer to be able to handle character voice, plotting, foreshadowing, consequences, symbolism, continuity, dialogue, environment description, and so on, using only words; juggling all of these on a single page using a variety of sentence structures, and avoiding using the same word or words on a single page too often.</p>
<p>When the author isn't a natural or trained writer, the ghostwriter is there to save the day.</p></div>		</li>
