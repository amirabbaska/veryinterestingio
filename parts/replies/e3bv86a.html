			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a lot of controversy about boxers cutting a lot of weight prior to a fight by basically sweating a lot. This led to dehydration in the fight itself, and increased the likelihood of brain damage among other health risks. The rules around weighing in for fights were changed as a result to prevent fighters from reaching the target weight in this way.</p>

<p>Bauer is the largest hockey company in the world, and they have been working on [this](<a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/lookit/2017/9/21/16345002/bauer-neuroshield-collar-contact-sports-hockey-football-soccer" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sbnation.com/platform/amp/lookit/2017/9/21/16345002/bauer-neuroshield-collar-contact-sports-hockey-football-soccer</a> ) for quite some time now.  </p>
<p>As you can see, they are attempting to accomplish that goal by putting light but sustained pressure on the neck during play. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a strange invention! </p>
<p>What I don't quite understand is why this is an issue at all - the cerebral fluid buffer seems to have the purpose of mild shock absorption, amongst other things. It seems strange to me that it has the side effect of making stronger impacts worse for the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's more &quot;wiggle room&quot; between your brain and your skull, there's a higher chance that a blow to the head will cause a concussion since your brain can accelerate for a longer time before hitting your skull. It also allows for your brain to get more squished, increasing the chance of leisons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmmm, it's needed to clear up that the ratio is between brain and skull cavity. If the skull 'hole' is too big for the brain, as in elderly people, then the risk of trauma and bleeding is increased because the brain is not properly fixed. A big skull with a big enough brain is not at increased risk of such trauma.</p></div>		</li>
