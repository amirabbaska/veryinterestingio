			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was so interesting to find out that plasma is how your body dumps the waste in your circulatory system. It's like 95% water so my guess is the less water you've been drinking the thicker it gets. Probably why it's so hard to give blood when I forget to eat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood is indeed shear thinning, a non-nutonian property. It is essential so that when blood flow through small capillaries the blood cells to pass through with relative ease, and overall to reduce work required by the heart. This also causes the cells to migrate to the central flow path of the blood vessels and avoid &quot;bumping&quot; into the walls and thereby being damaged.  Blood is similar to diluted glycerine. Outside the body, coagulation makes it thick and sticky.</p></div>		</li>
