<p>Very similar to why we wanted to find the Higgs boson.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we safely store it (in particular, not on Earth please), it makes a great power source. Drop whatever you want to get rid of towards it, and harvest the intense radiation from its accretion disk and Hawking radiation.</p>
<p>Oh, and it would be a great object to study of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very small black holes evaporate and explode more quickly. To make a black hole capable of &quot;idling&quot; for 20 years, you would need enough mass-energy to create a 1.958e8-kg singularity to start with.</p></div>		</li>
