			<p>The energy does not go away, it just gets converted to different forms. If that happens within the volume where we want to create a black hole, that is fine (we only care about the total energy), otherwise it can be a problem.</p>		</li>

			<p>If we safely store it (in particular, not on Earth please), it makes a great power source. Drop whatever you want to get rid of towards it, and harvest the intense radiation from its accretion disk and Hawking radiation.<br><br>Oh, and it would be a great object to study of course.</p>		</li>

			<p>Very small black holes evaporate and explode more quickly. To make a black hole capable of &quot;idling&quot; for 20 years, you would need enough mass-energy to create a 1.958e8-kg singularity to start with.</p>		</li>

			<p>200000 metric tons or about 3 times the mass of an aircraft carrier. So this is 'doable' if we can crush something down that small. Antimatter ablation of the surface of a spherical asteroid might be able to crush the remainder down to a black hole. </p>		</li>

			<p>No. That is a common misconception. You cannot physically see it fall in - so what? It still falls in, you just don't see it (that is the whole point of the event horizon!).</p>		</li>

			<p>Define &quot;real&quot;. There is no clear unique way to define &quot;at the same time&quot; nonlocally in curved spacetime.

			<p>OK, I'll define real: It's what I, me, sees. I want the energy generation after all.<br><br>So, I, me, never see the object fall in because it never falls in, so it never makes any energy and black holes can not be used to generate energy.<br><br>That observers falling in can see themself falling in is quite irrelevant to me - the universe will end before they fall in as far as I can observe.<br><br>People think that not seeing the object fall in is some kind of illusion, since the person falling in seems themself fall in, so that must mean it does actually fall in.<br><br>That's <em>false</em>. It is not an illusion, it's real, from my point of view objects never fall in, it's not just an illusion on what I can see.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you have to see something to be real, I'm not real, you never saw me.<br><br>&gt; so it never makes any energy and black holes can not be used to generate energy.<br><br>This is wrong, independent of the semantics which I'll ignore now. The accretion disk forms well outside the event horizon, where you see everything. The Hawking radiation also forms well outside.<br><br>The accretion disk is the way we &quot;see&quot; black holes in astronomy.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Infalling matter does act on you - its increasing the mass of the black hole, even if you don't see light from it any more.<br><br>What? No. It has nothing to do with light. The matter doesn't actually fall into the blackhole because it takes infinite time to reach the black hole. You are again confusing the illusion (no light) with the actuality (nothing falls in) - please stop doing that.<br><br>And the mass of the entire thing, black hole, plus infalling matter, does not change at all anyway, so from a distance you notice nothing whatsoever.<br><br>And if even if you could notice something, there would be nothing to notice since the mass never fell in!<br><br>&gt; Anyway, that is a side-discussion and not relevant to the original question of using the black hole as power plant.<br><br>Yes it is relevant! It's the entire question - you can't use a black hole as a power plant if nothing can actually fall into it.<br><br>&gt; A black hole is the only object where this is highly efficient<br><br>That's just nonsense.

			<p>&gt; You get up to ~20% of the mass-energy as radiation.<br><br>From friction and gas compression leading to heating? No you don't. Not from accretion disk. An accretion disk does not convert rest-mass to energy anyway. It converts gravitational potential energy to light and heat - and you can do that with a watermill too.<br><br>&gt; They focus on Hawking radiation, but if you want to maintain the black hole mass you also have to throw things in.<br><br>Yes, and how do you manage that when it takes infinite time for things to fall in? We have written pages of text, and the only real question here has never been answered.<br><br>&gt; Anyway, I don't think this discussion is helping anyone, my last post here.<br><br>I agree with you here - I don't think you have an answer to the time dilation question.<br><br>&gt; I can't help you if you don't want to learn physics from physicists like me, and prefer bad pop-science descriptions.<br><br>I don't believe you that you are a physicist, if you were you would not keep sidestepping the time dilation question, you would not keep confusing accretion disk and hawking radiation, you would not answer silly things about &quot;seeing the matter fall in with my eyes&quot;.<br><br>It's fine, don't worry about it. I'll keep trying to get an answer to the time dilation question, but so far every single person has simply ducked the issue, telling me how from the POV of the infalling matter it does fall in, therefor it does fall in (conveniently ignoring that from my POV it takes infinite time).<br><br>And it's not like this is some fringe-science thing either - go check any description of a black hole and it's quite settled that matter takes infinite time to fall in, yet somehow people ignore that when taking about blackholes growing and consuming mater.

			<p>To the object falling in, time would slow down, but not too those away from it. So, to the object, it would appear little or no time elapses between when it gets sucked in and destroyed into energy.</p>		</li>
