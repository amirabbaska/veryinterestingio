<p>Depends if it is done in your own name or not. Some venues will issues named tickets (especially in presales), so it's fairly trivial to identify if someone is banned and not sell them a ticket. If they do use a false name you are not giving them permission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you would be on vastly better ground not to be prosecuted. Presumably they will still kick you out if they then identify you as being banned. You might even have a case to sue them and get back your ticket price, but I suspect most courts would not find in your favor. Technically they could sell you a ticket, immediately kick you out and they are winners - judge might find for you then, but I suspect most places just wouldn't want the hassle - theats what banning people is really about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, this would be negated for any venue that required you to purchase a ticket because the act of selling you a ticket would be giving you permission to enter.</p>

<p>Not in most legal jurisdictions. Making a contract in bad faith by deceit (hiding of relevant information that you are banned) would void the contract, voiding your permission to enter, making it trespassing.</p></div>		</li>
