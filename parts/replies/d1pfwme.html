			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so if I'm at the bottom of the first of the three tanks in the infogram, and the little nozzle at the top is a millimeter thick, all you have to do is fill it up with a little water to drastically increase the pressure on me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are at the bottom of the first tank or any other tank, the pressure you would feel would be identical. </p>
<p>The force you would feel would be based on your surface area and has nothing to do with the size of the tube. If it was dark above, there would be no test you could do to tell the difference about what tank you are in.</p>
<p>The only caveat is that if the tube gets too narrow, edge effects of the tube would affect the pressure. Very thin tubes would cause the water to essentially stick to the edges of the tubes and the surface tension of the water could hold the whole column up so it would not be affecting pressure below. Without looking it up, I would guess anything less than about 3 mm (1/8 inch) in diameter would be affected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, how can a small volume of water create an equal pressure due to height, as a large volume of water?</p>
<p><em>Why</em> does the shape not matter? Because the OP of this comment thread said the static pressure is caused by the <em>weight</em> of the water, but of course that's not correct if we look at the formula.. which only depends on height. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say there's no test you can do. Why would this test not work?:</p>
<p>At the bottom of a tank, inflate a balloon (releasing gas from a pressurized container or something). This increases your volume, and as long as you don't become buoyant, the water level increases. Indirectly measure the increase in water level by measuring the change in pressure, and divide your increase in volume by the increase in water level to figure out the surface area of the top of the tank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was really tripping me up.</p>
<p>Think less of it as the water in the column pushing down, and more of the tank needing enough pressure to push the water up in a column. Equal and opposite forces and all that.</p>
<p>Helped me at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also similar to how a hydraulic piston works.  Apply 10psi to a 1/2&quot; diameter hose feeding a huge piston, that 10psi is exerted over the whole big piston so get get huge amounts of force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the 1 mm scale you get <a href="http://web.mit.edu/nnf/education/wettability/capillaryrise.JPG" target="_blank">capillary action</a> meaning that the surface tension on the wall of the tube has a nontrivial effect on the flow characteristics. In very narrow tubes, the wetting fluid can often flow against other forces like gravity. It's the reason a paper towel will 'suck' up water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For water and a 1mm tube, depending on the tube's material, you'll get something like a 1cm rise due to capillary action, so if you fill the tube to a height of 10m, you'd get a pressure increase as if you went 9.99m under water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your infogram has opened up another question for me.  In the first of the little shapes on the right, we have a wide base shape, with a single column in the centre. As I passed under that column, assuming it would be of sufficient height, would I feel a difference in the pressure?  Assuming so, with enough height, would the pressure be enough to prevent me from being able to pass under it, like an invisible barrier?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question! It's not as simple as drawing a column straight up as you are suggesting. The pressure in the wide base shape will be equal regardless of whether you are underneath the center column or not. This is definitely not intuitive, as it seems ridiculous that a small column of water could increase the pressure in the wide base shape to the same extent as a large column of water, but that's actually what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in the first of the three tanks, if we were to add more &quot;chimney&quot; tubes, filled with more water, they <em>wouldn't</em> increase the pressure in the bottom tank?  That's counterintuitive, as i expect more overall weight from having more overall water, even if it's just another &quot;chimney&quot; pipe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense once you consider the effects you expect from pressure, i.e. deformation. A small deformation will cause the height of the narrow water column above and therefore pressure to decrease much more than in the open ocean for example.</p></div>		</li>
