<p>The second one, using complex numbers, actually takes advantage of confusion about the domain of the square root. Even though people sometimes say i is the square root of -1, it's just <em>a</em> square root of -1. When taken as an operator, the square root does not have -1 in its domain so in truth &quot;the square root of -1&quot; doesn't really exist.</p>
<p>The Ladder one tells a blunt lie to make the derivation, which is a bit sneaky if you ask me!</p>
<p>The last one is my new favourite paradox!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last one reminds me of &quot;There's no such thing as a non-interesting number. 1 is interesting because it is the identity element of multiplication. 2 is interesting as it is the only even prime. 3 is interesting as it is the first odd prime. 4 is the first even perfect square. 5 is the the only prime to be part of two prime triplets. etc. etc. If there were non-interesting numbers, there would be a first. Call n the first non-interesting number. However, the fact that n is the first non-interesting number makes it interesting. Therefore, there is no non-interesting number.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in regards to the second one
While that is for sure a problem, that can be resolved relatively easily by just picking root(-1)=i (we're extending the field so whether we pick +/- i they're both solutions to x^2 -1=0 so the extensions are isomorphic). The more subtle issue is the step before that one. The identity Sqrt(a/b)=Sqrt(a)/Sqrt(b) way back whenever you learned it was only proven to be true for a,b positive. The identity turns out to be false if either one is negative, even when those negative square roots are defined. Theres a nice discussion of it on the website: <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/falseProofs/guess11.html" target="_blank">https://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/falseProofs/guess11.html</a></p>
<p>EDIT:
The last one is great, I had heard it before but forgotten about it. I personally still tie my brain in knots when trying to explain ( or even think too hard) about the usual version of Russell's paradox, so anything to say it in a different way is helpful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I try to be slick and just cross out the cancelled terms to hide the division.  </p></div>		</li>
