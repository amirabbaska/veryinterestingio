			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I read it was possible for two human siblings to have more differences between their DNA than any two cheetahs in the wild have, they are all closer than siblings at this point.  They probably don't have much of a future, but it's amazing they've managed to do as well as they have, it's a really good design they have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't verify that statement, but I don't think I would be too surprised if it were true.</p>
<p>It's thought that they have likely been on the 'brink of extinction' for a very long time, given their relatively inefficient method of catching prey, considering the amount of energy they require to do so.  So the effect is likely through many, many generations of inbreeding and bottlenecks rather than a single event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there something about their past use as hunting animals that might have contributed?  Some ancient civilization kept them for the nobility and killed the wild ones so they would be more exclusive or something like that..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you think that they may have been caught in the 'Evolutionary Arms race' and naturally were on a path to extinction, regardless of human intervention. (And going on from that) Is it right for humans to interfere to preserve a species that may well be on its way out anyway?</p></div>		</li>

<p>their genetic diversity is so low that skin grafts from one animal to a separate one are not rejected by the recipient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same issue has led to an epidemic of infectious cancer in Tasmanian Devils. Cells are swapped when they fight each other, and the recipients' body can't tell the difference between foreign cells and local ones, so any cancerous cells take root and lead to facial tumors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, contagious tumors have also happened in dogs that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_transmissible_venereal_tumor" target="_blank">are capable of jumping species</a>, but yeah, low diversity could be a big factor in getting one of those started most likely. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Transmissible cancer, caused by a clone of malignant cells rather than a virus, is extremely rare, with only two other known transmissible cancersâ€”canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT), which is sexually transmitted among dogs, and contagious reticulum cell sarcoma of the Syrian hamster,[81] which can be transmitted via mosquito bites of Aedes aegypti.[82] CTVT mutes the expression of the immune response, whereas the Syrian hamster disease spreads due to lack of genetic diversity.[83]</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease</a></p>
<p>It is an extremely rare phenomenon. The dog type is only possible because it suppresses the immune response; the Tasmanian devil and hamster types are only possible because of a lack of genetic diversity.</p></div>		</li>
