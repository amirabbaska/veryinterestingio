			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen narcosis is totally different from the bends. You experience nitrogen narcosis at depth when your body... I'm not sure exactly what happens but you get the feeling of being high (poor decision making, euphoria, confusion, but no pain) whereas the bends are caused when rising to the surface too fast and the dissolved nitrogen expands in to gas bubbles the form in your joints, organs, tissues, and/or brain (which can cause aneurysms)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen narcosis is also termed &quot;the rapture of the deep.&quot;  It is thought to occur because of the behavior of N2 in the body at high partial pressures, resembling somewhat the behavior of inhalation anesthetics (e.g., isoflurane) at lower pressures.  These anesthetic gases have extremely high fat solubility and are thought to get into the brain tissues quite easily and disrupt neurotransmitter function.  Interestingly, helium at even higher pressures (higher than the pressures at which N2 does this) displays this tendency, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its just basically asphyxiation.</p>
<p>you can get the similar effects at altitude which is why above 10,000 ft you need to either be on oxygen or be in a pressurized fuselage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narcosis has been compared with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's about the extent of the similarities between asphyxiation and nitrogen narcosis. Asphyxiation is lack of oxygen, and you may think diving at depth causes a similar issue which is why deep divers use nitrox (30% oxygen instead of 20%) however that is only to minimize the amount of nitrogen in your air. At even deeper depths, the oxygen becomes toxic so helium is used to reduce the amount of oxygen and nitrogen breathed.  </p></div>		</li>
