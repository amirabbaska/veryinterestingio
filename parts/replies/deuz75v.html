<p>I don't think you can say that all recreational drug circuits lead back to dopamine.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram showing many of the interacting projections to and from the nucleus accumbens. (The NAcc is the big box that says 'GABA / NT'.)</p>
<p>There are literally a half-dozen neurotransmitters at shown in this diagram, and that isn't even all of them, since enkephalins, galanine, glycine, and fuck knows what else are also involved in the functioning of the Accumbens. Dopamine isn't even the main neurotransmitter that the Accumbens itself uses.</p>
<p>This system is not by any means a &quot;dopaminergic system&quot;.  You can't say &quot;all addictive drugs come back to dopamine&quot; any more than you can say &quot;all addictive drugs come back to GABA&quot;, since GABA is the main NT used by the nucleus accumbens, which is generally agreed to be the structure of greatest importance here.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the fact that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3251561/" target="_blank">raising brain dopamine levels does not induce euphoria</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The process of providing a simple answer to a complex question always means simplifying some aspects in a way that can be construed as &quot;misleading&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, DA is a primary actor in paranoia and hallucinations. To be more specific dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway leads to reward. Euphoria is, if I am to put on my cognitive neuro hat, enkephalin-mediated. </p>
<p>GABA is used on the nucleus accumbens to control downstream dopaminergic activity. You can name a whole host of NT's having to do with reward, but dopaminergic transmission is where all ends meet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is still very incomplete. With yes, some drugs push buttons, there are other ways for them to work. Something like LSD, pushes the serotonin buttons, and the specific buttons it pushes and how hard it pushes them makes it different from something like magic mushrooms, which also pushes serotonin buttons but in a slightly different way. MDMA, actually attaches a totally different machine called a transporter, which normally pulls the serotonin back into storage when your brain isn't using it for signalling, and reverses it, so it releases all the serotonin your body stores, making you just about as happy as possible, it also does this to dopamine and norepinephrine, so you dance and love and feel great all night.</p>
<p>Ketamine and PCP actually work by making the button hard to press, the button in this case being the Glutamate receptor. Benzodiazepines like Xanax or valium make the GABA button WAY easier to press.</p>
<p>Basically there are way more buttons than dopamine, and there are different ways of affecting the buttons beyond just pushing them, not only that, but pushing one button can affect another buttons, and that's where it get's real tricky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incomplete, but this is an ELI5. I could go into distinctions among the buttons â€“ antagonists, partial agonists, allosteric modulators, all the way down to gi/go/gs GPCR's and biased signalling of the alpha and beta/gamma subunits , but that ain't very simple is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there is one marker in common for all addictive drugs and behaviors, which modifies the reward pathways and dopamine. It's called delta fos b. Interestingly since it's involved in reinforcing rewarding behaviors and has an extremely long half life, it can lie dormant for many months, then get reactivated.</p>
<p>It's like the entire sequence leading up to the drug use was traced back over abs reinforced, then it goes to sleep. When something triggers a drug user, it's like they lit a match at the end of the fuse abd the brain just wants to continue down the old route. This makes a lot of sense considering drug users report feeling high on the way to get their drug, or smelling the drug when they think about it.</p></div>		</li>
