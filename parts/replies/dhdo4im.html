<p>&quot; PhD in theoretical quantum math here. You see, when you take the sin root of 1.5 of the hypotenuse of a giraffe neck, you get a large number, that you plug into the nitro bin of your quantum computer. Then, simply use some basic arithmeticâ€‹, find the tangent of one of the angles of the letter X, which will give you a number like 40.34567, you must then calculate the other 3 angles, and look to the sky pathagoreans. After that, make sure that if you or a loved one has recently been diagnosed with mesophelioma, you are due for a financial compensation. And X=1.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
