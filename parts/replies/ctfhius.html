<p>An ETI could be aware of habitable planets in our galaxy, much as we are now starting to discover them, and direct signals in the direction of those planets. Earth could be one of those planets.</p>

<p>Let's say a civilization is transmitting a strong, focused and intentional signal to a certain star. How exactly would that be done?</p>
<p>If you point the signal to the starlight, the star itself is long gone from that position (in respect to moving around the galaxy). So you'd have to point the signal to black space and calculate where a star would possibly be in 1000 years and then transmit it, right?</p>
<p>But the star of the transmiting civilization would have changed position too in the meanwhile. So practically the recieving civilization would get a signal from black space, correct?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That civilization's view of our star would correspond to the radio signal since radio signals are light and their view of us would be light too. So yes you have to aim ahead to send the signals, but any received signals would appear to come directly from the star.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excuse my ignorance on the topic, I'm honestly just incredibly curious, but why is that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, you receive the signal from where you see the star.</p>
<p>Think about it: I broadcast a signal from Earth to a faraway star. This signal is made up of photons. At the same instant, the Sun emits a whole lot of light. This light is also made of photons. Both my photons and the Sun's photons travel at exactly the same speed (c), so my signal and the visible light from the Sun will arrive at the faraway star system at the exact same time, from nearly exactly the same place in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In practice you'll have more trouble sending a signal that will miss the planet than one that will hit it. There are fundamental limits to how well you can focus waves, and over such extreme distances your radio signal will have spread out to cover more than enough space. Even if you build a 200 m diameter, radiofrequency (1 GHz) laser the spot size would be close to 2 ly after 1400 ly. In other words the target you have to hit would be 2 ly wide.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But if one out of every 10 habitable planets have life, and one out of every 10 of those have technological civilizations, that leaves dozens of potential &quot;hits&quot; in our own backyard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you are leaving out time. We don't just need for intelligent life to exist close by. We need for such a civilization to at least overlap with our own for a century or so. Enough so that they could generate a signal and for it to get to us. However those dozens of civilizations could all easily miss each other by millions of years. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If there are any ETIs in our galaxy, the odds are very strong that they are much older than our own civilization. </p>

<p>Is that the case?  As I understand it, the third generation of stars would be the first with planets like ours, and the sun is a third generation star.  also, life on earth arose fairly quickly after the planet formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our species is about 200,000 years old, and we've only had the ability to communicate via radio waves for 120 years. Our galaxy is 13.2 billion years old. So if there are other planets in our galaxy where intelligence life has evolved or will evolved, the odds that they happen to be anywhere near our current level of technology is ridiculously low. They are likely either still far too primitive to communicate, or they have eclipsed us by many millenia in technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was unaware of the third generation distinction. Do you mean planets with enough heavier elements to be rocky?</p>
<p>In any case, even if intelligent, technological intelligence is only possible with third generation stars, the geological timescale of star evolution, planet formation, and the evolution of life is still vast compared to the history of civilization and technology. We've only had radio telescopes for less than a hundred years. If you say that civilization began with the advent of agriculture (even if we wouldn't count at the time by SETI standards, lacking the ability to receive or transmit electromagnetic signals), that's 12,000 years or so, which is still dwarfed by geological time.</p>
<p>Basically, we're at the beginning of our civilization. (If you're pessimistic, you would also say we're near the end of it too.) The odds that we'll find another civilization that's just at its own beginning is really unlikely. More likely, they are somewhere in the middle. And if &quot;somewhere in the middle&quot; means a few thousand years of more technological advancement, that means that it's very likely that any civilizations out there are much more advanced than us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's somewhat circular definition, but the point is that <em>we</em> have only been a (non-E)TI for X years, but the universe is much older than X, so other lifeforms either aren't <em>yet</em> ETIs, or have been for ages. It's kind of a meaningless assertion really, if you think about it too much. Kind of like saying &quot;the outer 1% of an apple is very thin&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
