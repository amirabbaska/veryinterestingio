			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that &quot;cancer&quot; was an umbrella term used for any number of ailments back in the day.  Maybe people in prior epochs recognized a tumor here or there, but in the majority of cases where someone is recorded to have died from &quot;cancer,&quot; it is not certain to bear any resemblance to what we clinically know as cancer today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be implying here that there's more cancer because people are living longer. This is misleading. Humans have always been able to live till old age...but tons of horrible shit generally killed them before they got there...primarily and especially in infancy. </p>
<p>Extremely high rates of infant / childhood mortality is what brought the entire life expectancy average down. Modern medicine has drastically reduced these numbers, which has had the effect of  drastically increasing the overall life expectancy average. In other words, you probably won't die before the age of 1, meaning you have a higher chance than any other time in history of living to 80...and of getting cancer of course.</p>
<p>Cancer has been around forever. Up till recently it wasn't very well understood, under diagnosed, or not diagnosed at all depending on the era. The idea that it is more common now is very misleading (in terms of per capita of adults / elderly), as we really don't have comprehensive records of past populations like we do now, nor did those eras have the medical competency to diagnose the countless types of cancer we now know exist. We are however getting better at understanding the prevalence of cancer in past centuries. We've actually been able to see evidence of cancer going back to ancient Egypt. Although more thorough medical documentation didn't start till about 16th century...when autopsies became more commonplace.</p>
<p>This applies to all kinds of other diseases as well - including neurological, cardiovascular, etc. Back in ancient Egypt, they would just associate dementia with old age. Alzheimer's disease wasn't even identified till 1901. So it's not like Alzheimer's suddenly became more common in 20th century, we just got better at identifying / diagnosing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what he's implying at all. He said we've been focusing on it more, not that it's more likely.</p>
<p>Yes, average life expectancy was lower because there were other things more likely to kill you before you reached old age. At this point in history, we've solved most of those other problems, so more people are living to experience cancer.</p>
<p>More people are getting cancer as an absolute number, not necessarily as a percentage. Possibly as a percentage as well. Both because there are simply more people in the world, and more people surviving past all of the other things that can kill you. We're studying cancer more because cancer is now one of the more likely health issues to encounter when compared to other health issues, not compared to cancer rates in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard, longer lifespan and cancer risk do correlate because your antibodies allow certain cell mutations pass, and those mutations start hating on the other cells with correct genetic replication. I'm not a cancer doctor or researcher</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure he was almost explicitly stating the opposite, we focus on cancer more now because we've dealt with most of the things that used to kill us before we'd get cancer, so cancer is more prevalent.</p></div>		</li>
