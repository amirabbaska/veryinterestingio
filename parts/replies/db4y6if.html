			<div class="markdown"><p>The pipeline wasnt going to go through an indian burial ground. Media caused this to be a misconception. My brother in law went there first hand. They're concerned with the oil infiltrating the water and also concerned with the chemicals if there was ever a leak</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The media didn't cause this misconception. Just about every news outlet I saw said exactly what you said. I even saw several making a point of emphasizing that it wasn't going through sacred ground. Some of the general public might've <em>assumed</em> that's what it was about, but we can't blame the tribe or the media for that assumption. Every time I saw a member of the tribe talking about this they said it was about the drinking water, they wanted it diverted a few miles away, and they were pissed that none of them were ever consulted, because if they were they would've said just keep it away from the drinking water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly going to blame media for almost everything. I saw videos firsthand stating the pipeline was going through indian land territory. (Now my sources for these videos was awful -facebook, I should've done my research and should've found the correct information)</p>
<p>I also live in charlotte, and approximately 3 minutes from downtown charlotte. During the charlotte riots, I wanted to see what actually was happening. Longboarded downtown to find out there was actually nothing going on. Very peaceful protests. What happened was there was maybe one bad bunch of protestors out of maybe 10 groups, and the media was only filming the bad protestors. (Overall, I am saying the media intensifies everything just for the publicity)</p>
<p>Later on in the night, I find facebook had the option to mark &quot;I am safe&quot; in charlotte. I was just thinking, this is so ridiculous. Never trusting media again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drinking water angle was bullshit as well as the band is currently building a water processing plant that accesses a completely different location. It will be completed sometime in 2017. If you read the judge's September 9, 2016 decision that denied the band a stop work in Junction you will discover that the band leadership is completely incompetent. DAPL has willingly moved the pipeline plan over 150 times due to concerns from the other five bands that they were able to deal with successfully.  There was a huge amount of effort to get Standing Rock in on consultations and they didn't engage at all for the first year or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the maintenance side to it.  Should there be a problem, like everything man-made,  eventually it may break.  When an <a href="http://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/California-Oil-Spill76.jpeg" target="_blank">oil pipeline breaks</a> it becomes an environmental disaster.</p>
<p>Ya,  So not only is your view destroyed,  but all that lovely water you drink,  destroyed.  All the plants and animals that depends on that water?  Gone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to make that point in the beginning of my last paragraph without going into detail about it, but you are right. I probably should have exaggerated the importance of maintenance and what I personally would consider necessary components of maintenance.</p>
<p>Because, hey. You are right. When they are operational, they are just ugly. When they are leaking, they are a disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure where people's heads are at,  but major pipe lines may cross hundreds of small and large waterways.  The waterway that the &quot;Water Protectors&quot; are supposedly protecting already has a pipeline underneath it in that region. The new pipeline is going to be far beneath the water and will be double walled.  Hydrocarbon product has to move one way or another and pipelines are by far the safest method to do so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't eliminate the chance of it happening. And if it does happen, they're looking at oil in their water. If something happens it can be REALLY BAD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly fair write-up. Just a few things to nit-pick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, in honestly, a really ugly piece of structure that will for the foreseeable future cut your property in half if you happen to get your land prospected for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For safety reasons, modern pipeline are mostly buried. Not ugly. If your land is prospected for it then you have every right to say no, and if you say yes then you have every right to a lease agreement that works for both you and the company. If your terms are for a buried line, tada buried line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, imagine that you happen to belong to an indian tribe, and you  get a pipeline prospected straight through an ancient burial ground. Then it's not just about scenery any more. It's about your heritage. Your traditions. Your rights. Your land. Your everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, now imagine your reservation is a half-mile <em>away</em> from the pipeline site. You ignored dozens of public reviews and other meetings you were specifically invited to attend. Suddenly the construction site will be active in a few days so you get your lawyers to take some 'burial artifacts' to the judge. The judge sees through it and the pipeline proceeds, but the convenient timing means you can get environmentalists and slacktivists to bandwagon your cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it right here!! It doesn't even go through the land that they own and they were given more than their far chance to comment/discuss/negotiate there terms of construction. They chose to not engage in those talks. It is the equivalent of if America wanted to build a pipeline a half a mile away from Canada, asked them if they had any input/request/objections and Canada never responded. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, there is some serious historic drama. The Treaty of 1851 granted this land to the Sioux, and then the Fort Laramie Treaty pushed that border back, and later we arrived at the reservation system as we know it.</p>
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers has also historically worked in favor of infrastructure projects that fuck over natives, including Standing Rock specifically, who lost land when the dams were built.</p>
<p>I'm just saying there are NO saints here.</p></div>		</li>
