			<div class="markdown"><p>For those curious about the tidbit about PSPs, look up 'PSP Pandora battery'.  Cutting a specific chip leg in the battery and modifying a memory card to have a specific serial number allowed you to boot previously bricked PSPs.</p>
<p>Though honestly, I don't remember needing to open up my battery. Odd because I recall having a specific battery with 'pandora' written on it on a piece of masking tape.</p>
<p>God, this must've been a decade ago by now.  I remember using my PSP while donating plasma, running M33 3.51 firmware, because smartphones weren't a thing yet. I'd browse 4chanarchive or something on the web browser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember doing this, when I was breaking one of the pins off the battery it shorted and a puff of smoke came out. Threw it across the room because I thought it was about to blow up! Still worked in the end though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer, and well written.</p>
<p>I do worry about how computers are becoming more like phones instead of the other way around though. For example that Mac's App Store, which so far is just 'recommended', but I doubt many would complain if it was mandatory.</p>
<p>And Intel is making progress every year on more protected-audio/video-path stuff. Basically they're embedding a separate processor to which you have no control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Everyone else is simply saying 'you mess with computers at a higher level than phones' without explaining <em>why</em> that's the case. It's because whoever made your PC wants you to be able to install different operating systems on it, and whoever made your phone really doesn't. So you have to go deeper to change things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't go deeper on phones, it's all about access to the loader. Same for routers. If you don't have loader acces you can brick by replacing os with wrong/faulty code. </p></div>		</li>
