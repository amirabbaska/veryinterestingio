<p>Most incumbents get re-elected even though congress has dismal approval ratings. The most likely explanation might just be that name recognition matters.</p>

<p>Another likely explanation is people can hate congress but like their congresspeople. There are lots of senators I dislike, but I like the two from <em>my</em> state. Even if everyone in the country only approved of 2% of the Senate, we might never see them voted out of office if the 2% everyone approved of were the ones from their state.</p></div>		</li>
