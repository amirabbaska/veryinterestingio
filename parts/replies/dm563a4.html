			<div class="markdown"><p>These schemes are:</p>
<p>-Trajectory - creating lines in space by climbing up and jumping down. Dropping items from up high. (Throwing food from high chair) </p>
<p>-Positioning - lining items up and putting them in groups. (Cars/Trucks etc) </p>
<p>-Enveloping - covering themselves or objects completely. Wrapping items up or placing them in containers. (Hiding in boxes)</p>
<p>-Rotating - enjoys spinning items round and round. Likes to run around in circles or being swung round. (Pretty self explanatory) </p>
<p>-Enclosing - adding boundaries to play areas e.g. fences around animals. Adding borders to pictures. </p>
<p>-Transporting - carrying or moving items from one place to another; (carrying items in containers or bags.)</p>
<p>-Connecting - setting out and dismantling tracks, constructing, joining items together with tape or glue. </p>
<p>-Transforming - exploring the changing states of materials, transforming them from a solid to liquid state and back again. </p>
<p>-Orienteering â€“ an interest in positioning themselves or objects in different places or positions e.g upside down or on their side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally see that as more of a sign of openness to new experiences.</p>
<p>And don't fool yourself, in your 20s your brain is still changing, we don't go into stasis when we &quot;finish development&quot; at around 24.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only the immature ones. A grown up farmer has no need for fences, their power is so magnificent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as being in touch with my inner child... Being 43 I still like to stack things on top of eachother. Not lego blocks, just random things. A cup, scissors and an orange, if that's whats around. </p>
<p>And lining things up on a table makes it look neater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow, this is good info!  I don't have kids yet, but I'm curious and I love  knowledge - where do we go to get started on these concepts for a kid's development?  I come from a generation where child rearing was pretty basic compared to today, so this is all so amazing.</p>
<p>By the way, to turn one line into two, you can put two spacebar characters where you want the new line.</p>
<p>So it would be like
Line 1 <space><space><br />
Line 2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much. Spent ages attempting it first go then gave up when it came out as a paragraph again. IT=Not my forte </p>
<p>I can link up loads more easy to read theories if you're interested. Scaffolding is another awesome theory for understanding how to support the children's development.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're much welcome.   Yeah, I went through the same experience when I first joined Reddit (then someone told me).  </p>
<p>Thanks for the link about scaffolding!  It's really interesting to see a kid's development not as luck or let-it-be behaviour, but rather a science where patterns and theories can be developed.  And yes, I would be very interested in the other theories too! (I'm a bookworm). </p></div>		</li>
