			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some widely-released products ship with a shortened code shared between products due to small packaging. This is common for candy, gum, etc. This can cause problems if the store the product is being sold at has an internal SKU system using the same number of digits.</p>
<p>For instance, a Baby Ruth candy bar rings up as a 80 dollar jacket at my store.</p>
<p>We actually had to issue these products separate internal SKUs at our store and we keep a little flipbook on the side of our computer monitors so we can sell them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My point being, in theory, the standards are brilliant. In practice, not so much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having done some minimal investigation, it's likely because each code is extremely expensive unless bought at enormous scale.  For small businesses, it's an appreciable cost.</p>
<p>Nationalizing the codes would be a boon to small business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for an electro and electronics wholesaler.
We ran into a lot of issues with suppliers using all the different systems, we had 1000's of suppliers and some of them came with close to 50 million product ID's (which is likely the reason they weren't fans of strict adherence to standards, cause that shit ain't cheap), so we opted to create our own for our system and if absolutely needed printed whatever supplier code was provided as a smaller barcode on the labels.</p>
<p>They were much longer then the ones you usually find but included a lot more information too. You could split the codes up into pieces too and print them on separate lines.</p>
<p>Since we opted to put a lot of information right into the code and had an eCommerce website, we adopted QR really early on (pre-2000's) and prepended the website address to the decoded classic barcode string to both have legacy barcode information and the easily accessible webpage for the product.</p></div>		</li>
