			<div class="markdown"><p>Normal progression is burst of estrogen leading to ovulation (egg bursting from shell). Estrogen has made the uterus favorable (good swimming conditions) for the sperm and egg to meet and do their thing. The &quot;shell&quot; the egg bursts from turns into a progesterone production machine.  Progesterone switched the uterine environment away from good swimming towards good nesting (implantation) and growth. When the sperm-egg fusion (zygote) implants it sends a signal (hCG) back to the egg shell (corpus luteum) to keep pumping out progesterone to keep the fertile uterine layer alive. If no implantation occurs no signal is sent to the corpus luteum. It dies off, progesterone production stops, and the uterus lining is shed (menstruation). </p>
<p>The corpus luteum is the source of progesterone until ~ end of 1st trimester when the placenta takes over. During this &quot;progesterone handoff&quot; from corpus luteum to placenta, the risk of miscarriage is high if it doesn't occurr successful (loss of progesterone = loss of fertile uterine layer).</p>
<p>So yeah, progesterone is a vital part though the entire length of pregnancy and that analogy has merit.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that progesterone is only half the story and most birth control have estrogen as well. Both of these inhibit a hormone released from your brain (pituitary gland) called FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) that triggers development of the &quot;shell&quot; around the egg. No shell (follicle) development = no ovulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is/was brilliantly described.</p>
<p>A little off-topic, but in similar fashion, could you continue describing what exactly happens or goes awry in PCOS ?</p>
<p>Why does menstruation get delayed, cycles are irregular, poor progesterone and over-secretion of estrogen by the body ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would call it misleading, though I get why people use that explanation. Both hormonal birth control and pregnancy create hormonal states that prevent ovulation (and thicken cervical mucous). However, they do this in really different ways, even though they involve some of the same hormones. None of the key pregnancy signal hormones that say &quot;pregnant!&quot; are in birth control, though. Think about what it would mean for the body if they were.</p>
<p>Your body definitely doesn't <em>actually</em> think it's pregnant. If it did, pregnancy hormones would start to be released, and your body would start doing pregnancy things which we really don't want to have happening on a daily basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you have the answer to this but, if the pill literally stops ovulation, meaning that your eggs don't get released and stay in your ovaries (and women are born with a finite number of eggs in the first place), does this mean menopause is put off for longer than women who don't take the pill? Because menopause happens when she gets low on eggs? </p></div>		</li>
