			<div class="markdown"><p>Theodore Roosevelt, John Quincy Adams and Franklin Pierce were all sworn in without a bible.  LBJ wasn't either but he swore on a different religious text on air force one so it was probably just that they didn't have a bible handy.  Funnily Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush and Barack Obama swore on two bibles so god knew they were double serious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obama's bibles were the Bible used by former President Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, when he took the oath for his first term in 1861. The second Bible was the so-called &quot;traveling Bible&quot; used by Martin Luther King, Junior. Fun little side fact </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distinction is the word &quot;affirm.&quot;  You have to &quot;swear or affirm.&quot;  Swearing on the bible started in the U.S. after anti-Quaker sentiment spread through Maryland.  Quakers can't swear on a bible, so the law was made to prevent Quakers from taking office.  These days, we do &quot;swear or affirm.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a Quaker, but if I understand things correctly, it's because they take lying seriously. So swearing on a Bible implies that they may or may not be telling the truth when they <em>aren't</em> swearing on a Bible. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, Quakers have nothing to do with oatmeal.  Quakers were associated with honesty, so they made &quot;Quaker Oatmeal&quot; to capitalize on it being made without any additives.  This was the time when Heinz was breaking new ground by having clear bottles where you could actually see the ketchup you were going to buy.  Think pre-FDA.</p></div>		</li>
