<p>I accidentally did this the other night. I eventually did get to lucid dream, however even in my lucid dream I was trying not to move so I would fall asleep. Waste of a lucid dream. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When I started with lucid dreaming I fell asleep when trying to WILD. Since my mind was revolving around me trying to lucid dream, I actually ended up dreaming that I tried to lucid dream hahaha. Got really frustrated when I woke up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis isn't perfect and you may not always be 100% paralyzed, and it will vary from person to person. I too, move a lot during sleep. </p>
<p>During your sleep your brain will undergo five different stages of sleep. Those stages are not continuously chained together, and will have a time frame between the stages. During those time frames you are actually somewhat awake, you will not remember those awake periods. It is common to move and re position during those awake periods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason we toss and turn at night is because sleep paralysis/muscle atonia only activates during REM sleep (this is when dreaming occurd), which only represents a small percentage of our total sleep cycle. Once in Non-REM sleep SP/MA is deactivated and we are free to toss and turn until the next cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude. I am a PhD student. I study motor control during sleep,  specially during rem sleep. </p>
<p>I need you to get a referral to a sleep clinic. Your behavior, if it is as bad as you say,  sounds like you have rem sleep behavior disorder. </p>
<p>You need to find out if you have this for multiple reasons. Primarily the fact that you are affecting sleep health and general health. </p>
<p>Also,  Not to freak you out but 98 percent of individuals that suffer from Rbd develop Parkinson's disease twenty years later... So it might be a heads up. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16152765" target="_blank">here's the pubmed.</a> You're completely misconstruing the facts, highly dangerous if you're really a PhD student in a med field. The report says 60-98% first of all. Much more importantly, they're saying that 60-98% of Parkinson's patients have rbd, not that 60-98% of people with rbd go on to develop Parkinson's. I'm guessing telling patients things like that would be about the fastest way to get sued.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sleep paralysis. Just concentrate in moving your index finger instead of a larger part of your body. Other method is to relax until you fall asleep again (this can be quite tricky).<br />
I've had them for years and with practice it is very easy to control them. And you can have easy lucid dreams as a plus, which is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading about this on Reddit a few years back actually &quot;cured&quot; me. I used to get sleep paralysis frequently and that would totally freak me out. Then I read the explanation and learnt it was quite common so it didn't seem so scary and I was able to relax which helps getting out of that state I think. Now it rarely happens at all, and when it happens I just try to move my hand and patiently wait until I wake up.</p>
<p>Never had the looming guy/demon either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't really have any problems or fears with the paralysis, I find it quite fascinating since i get to see my dream get &quot;built&quot;. The trick is to not open your eyes lol. It gets quite confusing when you begin to hallucinate that you open your eyes haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it just comes from being aware, but not being able to move due to the paralysis. When people can't move, but feel &quot;awake,&quot;  they are likely to assume that their inability to move is due to something suppressing them. That is a scary thought, and since they are in a a perfect situation for dreams to form, they create the image of whatever is &quot;suppressing&quot; them. Typically, it's not a friendly force that prevents you from being able to move. If I recall correctly, sleep paralysis is attributed to &quot;evidence&quot; of ghosts/demons back in the day, before we understood what SP was. </p>
<p>Also, for what it's worth, I've heard that SP isn't frequently as terrifying as the Internet makes it out to be. I used to practice lucid dreaming techniques a lot (I have slowed down on that a bit), and would only occasionally have those experiences; however, it's also worth noting that when I <em>did</em> have those experiences, they were pretty fucking scary. You get over it, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: tl;dr: if something is holding you down in bed, you are likely to assume that it is a horny demon trying it get its cuddle on</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It isn't. Everyone in this thread has gone and ruined it for the newbies by telling them about demons and stuff. It's like that &quot;don't think about elephants&quot; thing. Now you're thinking about elephants and it will take a long time to forget about them. </p>
<p>Now the newbies will go and see demons in their SP because they expect it.</p>
<p>When I first started I learned that you will see images of various objects, including vegetables. And because of this, I saw vegetables during sleep paralysis. But once I learned what sleep paralysis actually was  I began to have nightmarish visions </p></div>		</li>
