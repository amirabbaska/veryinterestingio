			<div class="markdown"><p>The authors didn't evaluate the level of worry we should have.  They just listed the metric for a large number of minerals, and I reported the ones they listed that have short reserves compare to usage rate.  For all of them, there are options including substitution in some applications and hunting for more reserves.  For diamonds, there's also the option of synthesis.   I'm not claiming that we should expect a crisis in 10 years for any of them.  Just that if there is going to be an issue, those are the likely ones to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, we know how to make diamonds in the lab. The problem is, even though they are useful, these quality of these synthetic diamond is nowhere near that of natural diamonds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know when that article was published? The demand graphs end in 2000, which indicates it may not take into account current usage trends. I notice cobalt is listed at the top end of the 50-100 year range, yet it is currently moving into a high demand, low supply situation. </p>
<p>On the other hand, silver tends to be a by-product in many mines, particularly lead/zinc deposits. The silver credits aren't usually reported as they're folded into the reserves for the main product. So worldwide reserves of silver would be under-reported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question--it was 2000.  Here's <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AIWpCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=mbqRZh0wgt&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;f=false" target="_blank">the same chart in a 2015 book by the same author</a></p>
<p>Cobalt is in the 50-100 year range, and the 10-25 year range includes </p>
<p>Cadmium, tin, silver, gold, zinc, chromium, lead, and antimony.</p>
<p>This chart does not attempt to consider whether the use of these is rising, falling, or projected to rise or fall.</p></div>		</li>
