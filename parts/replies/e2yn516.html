			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear about your stroke, but congratulations on working hard in therapy! I'm currently a speech therapy student and my clinic this semester is with dysphagia. Do you mind if I ask whether you still have a tube?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a condition called Eosinophilic Espophgitis (probably butchered the spelling) that can cause my esophagus to close premeaturely and cause food to get stuck. <a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/eosinophilic-esophagitis" target="_blank">https://acaai.org/allergies/types/food-allergies/types-food-allergy/eosinophilic-esophagitis</a> this link will explain it better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to just comment that if you're triggering your gag reflex by accident, attempting to make yourself swallow might prevent further triggering. I've found that after a night of drinking, this helps with brushing your teeth, for example (as long as you don't actually swallow the toothpaste, mind you. You should not be swallowing toothpaste.)</p>
<p>But the comments under your are a graveyard. What the hell happened.</p></div>		</li>
