<p>People with Parkinson's Disease need close monitoring of their meds because they can develop psychosis if they take too much. </p>
<p>Also - remember Bath Salts? That drug that made someone eat the face off another human? It basically works by increasing the flow of dopamine while simultaneously blocking the reuptake of it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was never bath salts. That was just media paranoia. The person only had THC in their system after he was drug tested.</p>
<p>And of course using your faulty logic one can claim marijuana causes people to eat people's faces. Just fundamentally flawed logic. Drugs DO NOT cause people to eat the faces of other people. No drug does that. Bath salts are just typical stimulant drugs. The paranoia and propaganda regarding them has been absolutely absurd. </p>
<p>Do not ever buy into propaganda regarding drugs. If a claim seems unusual or frightening about a drug it's most likely a lie. It's true for marijuana, and it's true for all other drugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that LSD is a dopaminergic drug. The drug enhances dopamine D2 receptor protomer recognition and signaling. So you can see a parallel here with someone on LSD and a schizophrenic person actually experiencing the same thing in many ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LSD and other psychedelics are primarily serotonergic, mainly 5-HT agonists. While LSD is a D2 agonist, most of its effects are from the 5-HT agonism. Probably mostly 5-HT2a agonism.</p>
<p>Quetipine and risperdone both are 5-HT antagonists (and probably D2 antagonists also) you're not wrong paralleling the two, anti-psychotics &quot;turn off&quot; a lot of what psychedelics &quot;turn on&quot;, but it's not just a dopamine things, especially concerning anti-psychotics. Anti-psychotics are sorta a hammer, they hit a little bit of everything from serotonin and dopamine to histamine.</p></div>		</li>
