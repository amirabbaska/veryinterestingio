			<div class="markdown"><p>That particular arrangement is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widmanst%C3%A4tten_pattern#Lamellae_formation_mechanism" target="_blank">Widmanstätten pattern</a> and yes, it requires a slow cooling rate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The formation of Ni-poor kamacite proceeds by diffusion of Ni in the solid alloy at temperatures between 700 and 450 °C, and can only take place during very slow cooling, about 100 to 10,000 °C/Myr, with total cooling times of 10 Myr or less.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meteorites are remnants of asteroids (or comets, but that's a different question), which are remnants of a planet which either never fully formed or which was blasted apart during some planetary collision back during the early part of the solar system. In the case of metallic asteroids, both. </p>
<p>Some planet formed and the dense (read: metallic) elements all sank to the center, just like our planet's core. Then two such bodies collided. Barring outside influence, a new planetary system would have formed. Incidentally, this is how the Earth is believed to have obtained the Moon.</p>
<p>But there was an outside influence: Jupiter. Jupiter's gravity prevented the formation of another planet where the asteroid belt is. Instead we have asteroids formed from planetary core material. That is, they are formed of highly refined metals. Give them a few million (or billion) years to continue to cool and you get interesting crystal formations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called <em>spangle</em>. It's not decorative, it's just the result of galvanising (coating steel with a layer of zinc to prevent corrosion). The Wikipedia article about galvanisation linked in this thread has some info about it.</p></div>		</li>
