<p>The bubbles form the characteristic white color because of optics! As you probably know, light bends as it enters different media. Normally this doesn't affect the quality of light we see because there are at most one or two different surfaces where the light bends. However, when you add thousands of bubbles, that offers thousands of places for the light to bend and scatter. Rather than seeing a transparent or translucent picture, we see all the light  hitting the foam scattered and reflected toward you. This results in white light, making most foams appear white. This is also how egg whites go from being transparent yellow to a nice white color after whipping them.</p></div>		</li>
