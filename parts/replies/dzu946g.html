<p>I can't find the article where I got that info from. I'm at work so don't wanna keep searching &quot;average penis size&quot;.</p>
<p>But the article I read said they were able to compare the size differences in what has been recorded throughout the years.</p>
<p>Also fun fact: human males have the largest penis of all the primates. Go us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also know its size is largely due to sexual selection rather than some kind of physiological advantage since the average human vagina is a couple inches shorter than the average human penis, indicating that there is absolutely no biological reason it needs to be that long.</p>
<p>ETA: guys, seriously, ramming full force into her cervix doesn't feel good and bragging about your length to a woman past a certain point just sounds painful. If her vagina is only 5 inches deep and your dick is 10 inches, that's not going to feel nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While correct, that's a little too simplistic.  If the things that influence evolution such as food supply, climate and the presence predators are the same on both sides of the river then the two populations will evolve similarly.  I do love the bare skin as a river analogy though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't have a source handy but the idea is that the rate of genetic mutation on average is fairly constant, and by comparing the genome of pubic lice vs head lice you can approximate the point where the two diverged, which then is used to conclude the approximate time period where humans lost the majority of their body hair, separating the habitats of the lice</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have one either, but I learned in math class that this is a famous problem as well. If you have two genomes and look at them as a sequence of A T C G or whatever, you can model them as the burnt pancake problem, and then you have the minimum number of mutations that you need for the two sequences to diverge. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting#The_burnt_pancake_problem" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake\_sorting#The\_burnt\_pancake\_problem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake\_sorting#The\_burnt\_pancake\_problem</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are talking about Motoo Kimura’s Neutral Theory of molecular evolution and the molecular clock theory which is related to that. The neutral part is important as it allows for mutations that have no effect. When I was a molecular genetics undergrad in the 90s and genome sequencing was getting underway in a big way relationships between species were being confirmed  based on comparisons of genes that are shared across virtually all species. The genes for the proteins in ribosomes were a good examples at that time as the number of differences basically allowed you to infer how long ago different genomes separated.</p>
<p>Note: current proper scientists might contradict/update/clarify some of that as I haven’t been up to date since graduating in the limited sense that an undergrad is and I only just about did that.</p></div>		</li>
