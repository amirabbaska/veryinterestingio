			<div class="markdown"><p>Shaking the martini with ice makes the ice melt a lot more than if you stirred it with ice. So if you want as little alchohol as possible, shake it. If you want a true martini, stir it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Not a gin martini (a real martini) at least.<br />
As /u/umnikos said shaking will produce more dilution (depends really on how long you shake for) What you're really going for is mouthfeel. Shaking introduces air bubbles and makes your drink have a lighter mouthfeel. Stirring is the way to go for martinis, old fashioneds, manhattans. Anything that's supposed to be very boozy should be stirred really. As a general rule you shake anything with citrus juice in it.
Now back to a gin martini - if you shake gin you 'bruise' it as they say. Essentially by shaking a gin you give the botanicals in the gin a method for escape and you then have on your hands a botanical-less gin (they'll never all leave) so essentially a vodka!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, it is actually turbulence that provoke transport phenomena such as difusivity and dispersion (mixing). And what creates turbulence is shear stresses in the fluid. If by inversion you mean turning an experiment tube upside down I might not be able to give you such a quick answer because this motion would also provoke a lot of mixture and shear stresses from the multiphasic interaction and such, there should be a study about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.   Though lets be careful with our terminology. The driving force behind diffusion is the concentration gradient (or chemical activity gradient) and not physical forces.  The diffusion rate of a compound in the surrounding matrix is unaffected by physical mixing, assuming constant environmental conditions.  Rather, mixing allows for homogeneous diffusion throughout the entire volume. </p>
<p>Additionally diffusion and dissolution are separate beasts all together.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my bad, I always get this mixed up because I'm a Mech Eng Masters Student, and we don't study much mass transfer along with transport phenomena, we focus on the Fluid Dynamics part haha. </p>
<p>What I am referring to is: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulent_diffusion" target="_blank">Turbulent Diffusion</a> which is driven by shear stresses and not concentration/momentum/heat gradients and tends to be faster than the molecular diffusion whicb is a different phenomenon.</p>
<p>And turbulent dispersion is the particle dispersion in a turbulent flow. (I'm not so sure about this, it seems that there is no consensus on what is dispersion exactly, at least in English)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, does this mean that when I make a shake I should also shake like that to rapidly mix the contents? Seems more efficient (even if it's not completely full and the up/down motion would work).</p>
<p>I need my perfectly shaked shake!!!</p></div>		</li>
