			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know how to answer this simply. I would say no because the changes in air density and airspeed would have a related change to thrust ratio requirements.  Simply stated; as air density goes down or the air gets thinner, the easier an aircraft will move through it.  Similarly, it is easier to keep an object in motion once it is moving.  Like your car, it will move more efficiently with smaller horsepower demands at higher speeds, and maintaining said speed, than it will accelerating. Typically an aircraft will fly at higher speeds at higher altitudes and slow at lower altitudes.  </p>
<p>The ratio of thrust between the high-bypass and combustion nozzle with remain close to constant because of air density and engine control modules adjusting fuel/air mixtures.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. I’m an operator and not a designer, so a lot of this is allowed to remain PFM to me. I had always guessed that the fan’s contribution was reduced at high level vs low level because it’s basically just a ducted fixed-pitch prop, and the fan/low pressure turbine RPM at high level doesn’t vary all that much from at low level, say 60% vs 80% in straight and level flight at 10000’ vs 35000’, while true airspeed increases a lot more. I’ve never had the chance to ask an aerospace engineer about it. But the engine controls only affect the highest pressure spool directly of course. </p></div>		</li>
