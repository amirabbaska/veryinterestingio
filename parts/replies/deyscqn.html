			<div class="markdown"><p>The TRIUMF facility at the University of British Columbia at least used to conduct proton therapy for treating ocular cancers. Basically setting the system up so that the bragg peak was within the tumor, hopefully destroying the cancer cells without affecting surrounding tissues and hopefully preserving as much eyesight as possible.</p>
<p>The basic idea is the (very large) cyclotron would be used to produce a proton beam. This would then be run through a specially machined plastic block to shape the beam (and adjust the location of the bragg peak), and then finally into the head of the patient (who would be bolted down for the duration of the treatment).</p>
<p>Obviously they weren't operating at obscene powers, but I always did wonder if they showed the patients the machine behind the wall... </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently they do operate at the full 520MeV for the proton beam...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Bragg peak is the depth into a material that ionizing radiation dumps off most of its energy. As this peak can be quite pronounce it allows you to ensure that most of the radiation only interacts at a narrow range of depths in the material. This allows you to target a tumour.</p>
<p>You are perhaps thinking of Bragg diffraction which is an unrelated phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, the Bragg peak thing seems a bit confusing to me as well. Is the tumor crystalline or something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, the Bragg peak has nothing to do with crystallines structure, or Bragg diffraction. It is a characteristic of a proton's energy deposition vs depth. As the proton beam slows down, it's energy loss increases until the Bragg peak, where the proton loses most of it's energy. This is favourable as in principle with protons you can deliver a high radiation dose to a target whilst sparing healthy tissue. </p>
<p>In terms of shaping with plastic, perhaps shaping isn't the right word. Proton beams have a finite range depending on their energy. The plastic in question is likely to be a degrader that absorbs beam energy thus decreasing the proton range that will bring the Bragg peak to the target. Spatial shaping of the beam is performed either with thin foils which scatter the beam and collimators, or by using magnetic fields to produce a pencil beam that can be raster scanned over a patient.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In theory it's not a problem, but from an engineering point of view shaping in real time a beam of particules with magnet is not that easy. (In comparison with producing a piece of plastic with the right shape)</p>
<p>Since a few years it start to be standard in proton therapy centers to use magnet to &quot;shape&quot; the beam. But (not that) old facilities still use plastic piece to shape the beam .</p></div>		</li>

<p>Key part. You don't directly see the beam, you see the energized particles and subsequent photons emitted. </p></div>		</li>
