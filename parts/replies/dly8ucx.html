			<div class="markdown"><p>That lump in your throat feeling that you get when you are upset/stressed is called Globus pharangeus. It is the sensation that you get when you have been given some bad news, watched a particularly sad movie or if you have just been told to speak in front of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>There are a number of muscles in and around your throat and when you are under physical or emotional stress  the muscles tense up causing the Globus sensation. For some people they can have this sensation momentarily, for others it can remain and requires some speech therapy to work on reducing the muscle tension.</p>
