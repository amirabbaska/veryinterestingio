			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really as simple as this. I am a certified diver and I do the giant stride from time to time to but a lot of times walking around with those giant flippers is a pain in the ass. Backward roll is just easy... all the gear creates a cushy pillow for when you fall into the water. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just don't forget to inflate your BC first!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if your BCD swims faster than you do! This is why you'd only do it in calm conditions.</p>
<p>I was taught this technique and used it a few times - it's fairly easy. You set up your tank, BCD and regs; loosen the shoulder straps completely; inflate it; throw it in; jump in; then you get it under your bum and sit on it; line up your arms with the arm holes; then slide off the BCD and your arms will go straight into position then secure your BCD and tighten the straps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did it all the time when diving on the reef in grad school.  I think somebody did have to free dive down to fetch an uninflated BC once.</p>
<p>Would probably not be wise in cloudy water, but when you can see straight down to the bottom 40 or 50 feet below it's not so much of a big deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing the coolest way by far to go into the water: Front Flip Entry.</p>
<p>Basically you line up for a Giant Stride but instead of lamely stepping forward and letting yourself drop down you lean forward, push off with both legs to give yourself some momentum, do a front flip, and hit the water with your tank first. Requires a properly inflated BCD so you float up head-first after hitting the water. And it requires you to hold your mask and other stuff securely in place which you should be doing anyway.</p>
<p>It's a little disorienting once you hit the water but a lot of fun. It's also a lot easier than it looks, and it looks very cool. Learned this from my PADI instructor when doing the Advanced Open Water course and never regretted it. Can't always use it though because it has the same requirements as the Giant Stride: a stable platform to step off from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you'd either need really beefy leg muscles or quite a bit of distance down to water level to complete 3/4 of a roll with lots of lead and a heavy tank on. I can imagine it being fun though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really don't, I have spindly legs :) It's much easier than you'd think. Distance to water doesn't matter much either, all that matters is that you have a stable surface to do it from and enough room to land (no obstacles, either in or on the water).</p></div>		</li>
