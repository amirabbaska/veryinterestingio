<p>At least 500ml.</p>
<p>If all else fails, bucket of KFC and a nap. And a beer if you're not a sissy. Don't let people tell you it's inappropriate to crack another tin at 8am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gatorade and a multivitamin is something I will swear by. Especially vitamin B12. All of those hangover cure drinks/shots? They're loaded with vitamin B12. I worked at a gas station, and the one we sold had something crazy like 1600% of your daily B12</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many, many variables which could contribute to a worse hangover. Amount of food eaten, amount of water drank, sleep quality, hours of sleep, baseline liver and kidney function. Hangover severity cannot be reduced to the quality of the alcohol. Vodka and liquor are made in very similar ways and pricing is manipulated to create the illusion that higher price = better quality </p></div>		</li>
