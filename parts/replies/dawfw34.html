			<div class="markdown"><p>All good points. Also don't hesitate to google the authors name and do a little research. If the article doesn't have a by-line then credibility goes down. Misspelled words, subjective language and any other signs of a lack of editing makes credibility go down. Always remember to check sources, check for opposing takes on the subject, and never ever get all your news from just one place. </p>
<p>...even Reddit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll piggy back and add that also note if a piece is an opinion piece versus an article. Opinion and even hyperbole or sensationalism don't automatically equal fake news. But understand the author's point and that they have an agenda and purpose for their piece. That doesn't make it fake, but it can be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This should be your first sign in any written piece, but be careful not to confuse <em>technically</em> good writing (where everything is in the right place, commas are well distributed, apostrophes are used properly, ditto capitalisation etc.) with objectively good writing. Lots of really shitty sources (Breitbart, Salon, Observer) tend to have well-written pieces.</p>
<p>Generally, however, if something is competently written and/or edited then you ought to weight it a little more towards 'credible'. It's a very handy rule of thumb.</p>

<p>This is the biggest point for me. Two takes on the same underlying story: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly dangerous to suggest that credibility can be tied to not-making-people-upset language. There are a lot of people who mix emotions with logic, and this gives people offended by facts they disagree with the grounds to dismiss a source as incredible based on its content not aligning with their preconceived notions rather than re-aligning their stance with the facts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, no, I didn't disagree with how you said it. I disagree with using the tone of the article as a determining factor. You CAN use it as a suggestion, or a clue, that the article may not be fully credible, but that probably shouldn't be your only judgement point. </p></div>		</li>
