			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the huge jump in puberty followed by the slowdown in late teens makes most 18-22 year olds think they’re fully grown and thus a match for any adult. In reality they won’t hit peak natural muscle mass until late 20’s, so even though your old man / stepdad / mom’s boyfriend is past his prime he will still outclass you for a few more years. Problem is most 18-22 year olds aren’t gonna wait that long to test it, so they’re gonna run headlong into a surprising dose of “old man strength”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer.</p>
<p>If you've ever shaken hands with a 60 year old accountant, they're not going to crush you, because they've been gripping pens and golf clubs for 40 years instead of hammers and tool boxes. </p></div>		</li>
