			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree and will add whenever you see a headline that marijuana kills cancer cells, they are talking about cancer cells in a Petri dish.</p>
<p>The cancer cells in a human are interspersed throughout the body with all the healthy cells and you can't take a dropper and put some THC on each one. And pretty much any household product will kill cancer cells when dropped on them in a dish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comparison to homeopathy/acupuncture is absolutely absurd; homeopathy is fundamentally extremely unlikely to have any sort of effect. The proposed mechanism of action is simply wrong and unscientific, and therefore homeopathy treatments literally do nothing, either medicinally or even physiologically whatsoever. </p>
<p>Acupuncture is based on similarly shoddy science, though it at least could have some sort of effect in theory (speculating; but gate control theory of pain for example) as it is not simply water with a particle or two of something. But it's still very barely substantiated to have any significant physiological effects.</p>
<p>While I will agree marijuana has not earned it's panacea status that some circles promote it as being, it most definitely has potent physiological effects. It contains substances known to be indisputably psychoactive (THC primarily, with CBD having modulatory effects). It has been proven to interact with the immune system via the CB2 receptor pathway.</p>
<p>Now, what the research you've linked to implies is not that marijuana does little to nothing, but that we need more high quality human studies to determine what it's best for, how it compares to other treatments, and possible side-effects. The primary fault of the lack of exciting human studies so far are draconian drug laws that make performing studies extremely difficult.</p></div>		</li>
