			<p>the hardness is more important in this regard - You can make a cutting edge 1 atom wide pretty easily through chemical etching or tearing the metal in some instances - the issue is it'll deform and roll out into a nice big blunt region as soon as you use it on account of how soft metals are.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes. It's hard and not malleable. It can dull by breaking but won't &quot;roll&quot; over the edge like a typical knife.</p>		</li>
