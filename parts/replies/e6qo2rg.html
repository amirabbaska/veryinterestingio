			<div class="markdown"><p>The hearing with Christine Blasey Ford is not a criminal trial, so it doesn’t exactly follow the same rules. The purpose of the hearing (from Ford’s perspective) is not to prove Judge Kavanaugh guilty beyond a shadow of doubt in order to sentence him. It is just to convince 51 Senators that installing Kavanaugh as a SCOTUS judge is a risky enough move <em>politically</em> that they vote against his nomination. So any circumstantial evidence that makes her appear more credible is in play, even if it wouldn’t stand up in a court of law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Testimony is evidence. The majority of evidence presented in a trial is testimony. Supporting evidence helps corroborate it and the collective whole is used to determine the result of the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately if he was accused of this earlier there wouldn't be this much media or effect but the opposition purposely left it until right before his nomination was accepted. This is the main point that bothers me. </p>
<p>The timing and everything makes it look like it was a fabricated or stretched story to keep him from being nominated. Its an absolute BS move and if it is true, should have been brought to light much earlier. </p></div>		</li>
