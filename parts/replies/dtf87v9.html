			<div class="markdown"><p>Cartels are a general economic term meaning a bunch of producers of like items gang up and manipulate the market.  It doesn't have to be an inherently illegal enterprise for a cartel to form.</p>
<p>Canada, for example, has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Quebec_Maple_Syrup_Producers" target="_blank">Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers,</a> that works to manipulate the price of maple syrup by storing syrup reserves and controlling output.</p></div>		</li>
