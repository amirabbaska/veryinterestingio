			<div class="markdown"><p>As a gardener, I grow flowers for their ability to attract some bugs, and some flowers help me prevent bugs (like marigolds)  Seeing flowers for sale reminds me of how easy it is to raise flowers.<br />
We also raise flowers to eat - my housemate fries up the flowers from eggplants in a tempura batter and they are very good. The flowers from cantaloupes are yuck even if fried!  pumpkin flowers are bitter when fried.  She eats other flowers raw. </p></div>		</li>
