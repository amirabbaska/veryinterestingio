			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a pain researcher, and unfortunately it's not that simple. Primary sensory neurons are not as unimodal as we once thought. The same primary sensory neuron often responds to both cooling and noxious heat.Hell the same neuron can even respond to pinch or brush too. Then there's also convergence in the brain of inputs leading to phenomena like the thermal grill illusion. It's actually a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I study basic transmission of pain in the spinal cord, so I just record the electrical activity of those neurons in naive and chronic pain conditions. Nothing too crazy lol</p></div>		</li>
