			<div class="markdown"><p>It's confusing to me how all the top answers in this thread are a bit backward and not really ELI5.</p>
<p>So here is my go:
A long time ago a plant was non-toxic.
Mammals would eat it, so it would not get spread too far.
Then one seed/plant mutated and got poisonous to all mammals so only birds would eat it.
Bird flies a long way, poops out the seed.
Plant now grows in a completely different area, probably without direct competitors, allowing it to spread rapidly. All it's suceedoors are now also poisonous to mammals, allowing further spreading!</p></div>		</li>
