			<div class="markdown"><p>When insects demonstrate some kind of protective response to a damaged body part, then it might be open for debate.</p>
<p>Some insects react to some damaging stimuli but not others, and react the same way to non-damaging stimuli. It's easy for people to project human perceptions onto other things (we'll anthropomorphize <em>anything</em> whether it's even alive or not) but that doesn't mean they are experiencing anything like what we would experience in the same circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instinct and pain are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Insects avoid some hazards because evolution has selected for the ones that do. It's not some kind of conscious decision or categorization of something as dangerous, they lack the neurological complexity for that. It's why an endless stream of moths will fly into a bug zapper and die; they don't have any instinct to deal with this, and the zapper killing other moths right in front of them does not tell them that it's dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
