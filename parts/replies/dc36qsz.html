<p>I can just cut the mold off of cheese and eat what is underneath</p>

<p>Well...</p>
<p>The thing is, the mold you see on the surface? That's mostly not the actual organism, just it's reproductive organs.</p>
<p>The actual fungi has been growing invisibly inside the outer layer of the cheese and reaching farther and farther inside. It doesn't actually develop the visible part you think of as the mold until it's well established and has been living in the cheese for a while. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But is it not the surface mold that has the terrible taste? I've eaten bread and such right up until the mold is visible, and it tastes completely fine (aside from maybe some general staleness or other tastes it may have picked up from food nearby) it's not until i see the mold that it has an off-putting taste. I could be wrong. </p>
<p>Also, I was always told that mold on food itself isn't particularly dangerous unless your allergic to it, so aside from the taste, there's no reason to avoid eating it... again, I don't actually know, this is only what I've heard. I don't eat mold either way, aside from a few times where I failed to inspect the food before biting into it. </p></div>		</li>
