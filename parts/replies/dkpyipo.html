			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Spain and I've never seen the tipping customs you mention. The closest is leaving the returned money if its not a lot (Like in something cost 19.90 and you left the 0.10c). In my experience, those who leave tips usually are those who want to show off that the can leave tips.</p>
<p>In fact, in my experience is the other way around: When you become a &quot;regular&quot; in a bar or restaurant you end up getting free shit (Shots, some more food, whatever).</p>
<p>For reference, I'm talking about Madrid, and usualy either irish-like pubs or small bars and &quot;cheap/normal&quot; restaurants (&quot;Oriental&quot; food, kebaps, VIPS, Foster's Hollywoods...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience in Spain is between the both of you. People tipping has never been to show off. They genuinely liked the service.</p>
<p>There's also another factor: service in Spain in general is poor. For a country that lives off tourism in many cases, it astounds me just how bad service is in so many places.</p>
<p>As a regular in about 5 different bars and 3 cocktail bars, I do get free shit all the time or bigger portions or stuff... but I always tip them in return. I am a regular there because of the service and food.</p>
<p>Although, the most common thing for your average place if you are going to tip is leave the change. In larger groups people will pitch in 1 euro or 50 cents if everyone pays by card.</p>
<p>What can we take from this? Tipping in Spain is all over the place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived all my life on Madrid and I don't know what are you talking about. Tipping is one of the usual things to do.</p>
<p>Usually if you like the service you tip some little coins (10, 20 and even 50 cents) but not the smallest ones like 1 or 2 cents excepts if they gave it to you as change for what you paid.</p>
<p>It's not obligatory and no one expects you to tip but you do it to show you liked it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've lived almost all of my life in Madrid and the problem is you think giving someone a bit of change is what Americans consider tipping. They give 20-25% of the total bill as a tip. I've never seen anyone in Spain give say a 20€ tip when they spent 100€ on food. If you gave the server 10€ in that scenario in the US you'd have the manager come and ask you what was wrong.</p>
<p>Giving 2-3€ ocassionally on an 80€ meal for 4 doesn't count as tipping.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Leaving the change, as said, is not tipping. I have to admit that even this is something I haven't seen usually done, but that depends on the situation and group of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say people who tip are usually just tipping to show off ? </p>
<p>I grew up in Spain, and still live here and that is not how I see it, at all.</p>
<p>When we go out, if the service and food was good, we will leave a few euros. If we leave nothing it's because the service or food sucked. Leaving a tip is absolutely normal, though often it might not be very generous.. may a couple of euros. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a server and eventually worked my way up to the corporate office of where I served. We are legally bound to make paychecks for servers and bartenders who don't meet minimum wage. But they (myself included at the time) would rarely ever claim all of their monetary tips for tax purposes and sometimes to get that extra paycheck. On the other hand, there are also the workers who think they get enough in tips that they don't have a paycheck. We have hundreds of paychecks for those people who never bothered to see if they had one. It's a pain in the ass to get ahold of some of these people because they change addresses without telling their employer or they don't have cell phones or check their emails etc. We also have a ton of paychecks from cooks and other workers with hundreds of dollars on them but for some reason were also never picked up. </p>
<p>So LPT: if you're a server or bartender in America, ALWAYS ask if you have a paycheck, and no matter what job you do, if you move, tell all of your employers since the last tax season especially if you don't work for them anymore. If you don't pick up your paychecks the money will eventually go back to the state (or your W2 will take a lot longer to reach you.)</p>
<p>Edit: and also, to make life easier for everyone, always ask if direct deposit is an option. It's available in most places now and you'll never have to worry if you missed a paycheck (but still always check anyway in case your company is ass) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I waited tables/bartended for about 5 years at a few different places, never had an issue making good money except for at my short run at Chili's, which is a big chain.  Other places I worked that were locally owned I averaged anywhere from $15-30/hr from tips alone. Usually the hourly wage was just enough to cover income taxes, my paychecks would sometimes be less than a dollar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be fair, if you don't make minimum wage with tips while waiting tables, you're either extremely unlucky, a terrible server, or just nobody showed up to the restaurant. It's not likely to be an issue except in edge cases.</p>
<p>Almost every server I've ever known who works in a sit-down restaurant made the equivalent of $15/h or more with tips (such jobs were actually considered pretty desirable where I was from).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also average the amount over an entire pay period. If you make $2.35 an hour during the day but make $100 for an hour at night you will be getting paid $2.35 an hour by the restaurant and the customers will be paying the rest of your wages the entire day. </p></div>		</li>
