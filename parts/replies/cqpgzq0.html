			<div class="markdown"><p>The calculations are misleading though; this assumes that sound loudness scales with energy perfectly, but more importantly that the sun emits sound waves in the same way as a bomb. It wont send out a shockwave because its vicinity is already super hot. These calculations would be better if the sun were to be suddenly &quot;turned off and on again&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A constant level would produce no sound. You could try connecting a speaker to a battery. There is an initial pop then no sound. Sound is only produced during a change in current. The sun would really only make sound from fluctuations on the surface. So things like solar flares would be much louder than a (relatively) calm portion of the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about an on/off cycle like our day/night cycle? </p>
<p>I imagine there'd be a major difference in perceived sound when facing the sun vs when on the opposite side. I realize this is &quot;on/off&quot; from Earth's perspective. Not sure if that matters. </p>
<p>Makes me wonder what a sunrise and sunset might be like. You'd think the moon would bring its own sounds as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hearing scientist here. 120dB deafens mice within 2 hours. Similar for humans, but at mid to high frequencies. Lows are near impossible to destroy. So, &quot;what frequencies would the sun be?&quot; is the real question. Below 20Hz might not be problem, unless we speculate about infrasound. If the sun was 150dB at 1Hz, not sure we'd even notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we wouldn't hear it but things would be pretty messed up, at 150dB you're talking enough air moving to be easily palpable.  I think it'd be some kind of crazy 1hz breeze that was constantly pervading everything.  Infrasound is also not trivial, around 18hz it can cause  hallucinations due to induced vibration in the eye. (no, really) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our ears are less sensitive to low frequency sound so you need a proportionally higher sound pressure level near the edges of our hearing range to produce damage. At low volumes you may need as much as a 70 dB boost to low frequency sound to produce the same reaction as frequencies our ears are more sensitive to. Near the damage threshold there is still a ~30 dB difference from reaction to low to mid frequencies. </p>
<p>Hearing loss is caused by damage to small hair cells in our ears that will correspond to different parts of the audible frequency spectrum. The hair cells responsible for low frequencies are less sensitive and will need a higher sound pressure level to damage than mid frequency cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a guitar string. At the higher frequencies all the cells are a little smaller and the membrane they sit on is more tight. Just like a guitar string that is too tight, too much force can cause the string (in this case cells) to snap. The low frequency region is more flexible, and like a loose guitar string it can handle more force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a good start. however you're making a pretty big assumption that all of that 383 yottawatts would be heard as sound. In reality, most of that power figure is dissipated as EM radiation in the visible spectrum. The short answer is that you probably wouldn't hear it at all. </p>
<p>The power density of the sun peaks at frequencies with a wavelength of around 483nm. and quickly decreases at frequencies with a wavelength below 100nm. </p>
<p>For comparison, the audible frequency range of the human ear is approximately 50-20,000Hz. The equivalent wavelengths are 6 meters to 15 mm.  </p>
<p>All that aside, what little sound there might be would quickly be absorbed by this  theoretical air at a rate of about 10^-3 dB/m. Considering the distance is about 1.5 <em> 10^11 meters, the intensity would be further reduced by about 1.5 </em> 10^8 dB. So, assuming the 125dB number were even remotely accurate, absorption would knock it down to a decibel level of roughly -1.5 * 10^8 dB which is well below the audible threshold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're making the inverse assumption, that the Sun's audible output would only result from the processes that release EM energy.  We need to know what vibrates and rumbles in the audible range to answer this question. Solar flares? Convection?  Other things?  The sun definitely is pretty dynamic (not nuclear explosion shockwave dynamic like the first guy suggested, but not a still emitter of radiation like you posit either).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well no not really. If there is a medium that conducts sound in a similar manner as air, it stands to reason that it will have similar absorption rate as air. Assuming that the peak output is concentrated in the audible frequency range, free space loss and atmospheric absorption would attenuate any sound well below the ambient noise background by the time the sound got to earth. </p></div>		</li>
