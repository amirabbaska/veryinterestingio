<p>The amount we consume wouldn't be enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its funny because we are so used to thinking about biological issues in terms of an evolutionary logic we make hypotheses based on it.</p>
<p>However I don't think this stands up.  In the wild losing a limb is a death sentence.  If it was simply a matter of needing 10K extra calories a day you could totally manage it to save your life.  </p>
<p>What I would instead suggest is that this is one of those things that evolution said no to because of cancer.  If your body has the ability to regenerate massive systems quickly on demand (such as an arm or hand), that is going to get turned on sometimes by mistake (cancer) and kill you.  My guess is that organisms with this ability simply died out from cancer (or had other cancer fighting systems that prevented them from evolving out of some smaller niche) and organisms without it &quot;won&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But lizards can grow things back, right? They don't get cancer.</p>
<p>Yes it all comes down to unanswered questions. Sorry. Biologists are trying, we can wait.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that because many reptiles and amphibians <em>can't</em> regenerate their limbs that the ability to do so evolved independently. We didn't lose the ability, we just didn't lose limbs enough in order to evolve the ability to regenerate them. Mammals don't lose limbs nearly as often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting thought. Is our metabolism and cell regeneration rate even capable of it? Wouldn't it just take longer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is from a hazy memory but i read a paper once on the therorized posibillity of &quot;unlocking&quot; the mechanism we have while in the womb.</p>
<p>It would require being in a hospital the whole duration of frowing something back.</p>
<p>I could try to dig it up if intrested, it was in norwegian but probably translated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So generate various scaffoldingâ€‹ (bone, muscle tissue, etc) in the shape of your new arm, 3D print stem cells onto it programmed to be those new parts and strap that artificial womb they grew the lamb in on your shoulder and wait <time> for it all to cook. </p>
<p>Got it, easy. </p></div>		</li>
