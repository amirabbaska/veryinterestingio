			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I can. It's why I clicked this post actually.</p>
<p>Almost as a type of meditation, I guess. I breathe deeply in then back out while focusing &quot;on the back of my spine&quot; is the only way to describe it. It helps if there is wind or a cool breeze.</p>
<p>I feel a shiver run down my spine, out my arms and across my head, leaving my covered in goose bumps, my scalp feeling tight, and a feeling of being alert, calm and centred.</p>
<p>It's something I've mucked around with for some years now. It's interesting what you can train your body to do.</p>
<p>(reading some comments after I write this, it seems everyone does a similar thing to what I describe in focusing on the rear of your head/neck/spine. Super interesting!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds a lot like the feeling I get when I take Adderall. I can even stimulate it by running my fingernails across my scalp to the back of my head. Sends shivers down my whoooooole body </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something weird; in addition to what you described, I can also experience a feeling that feels a bit like being in freefall, quite odd from the back of the neck down to the legs. It seems like shivers accompany this, but maybe it's not purely a shiver.</p>
<p>I sit normally in a chair, exhale, then keep my mouth/airway closed while very lightly using the muscles for breathing in. Then I try to imagine pushing down on the floor with my legs, but with the restriction that I can't use any leg muscles whatsoever. Something about this restriction results in this weird feeling; might be interesting to try. Also wondering if there's any explanation for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i think about it, and try not to get them, they happen.  For me it's like a tingle down the right side of my back, down to the hip.  What's interesting is I get really intense occurrences when listening to ASMR or when the barber brings the clippers close to my ear at the barber shop.  The ones I get from those last two stimuli are really powerful, and it's all I can do to keep myself from jumping out of my chair. It's odd because they are both pleasurable and really uncomfortable at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always assumed it was some sort of danger response and then my brain suddenly realising I wasn't actually in danger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh god, I couldn't sit still with the buzzer thing at the back of my neck. Way safer than scisors, but the sound and vibration gets me. I've learned to resist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, one of my strongest triggers for this experience (frisson I guess?) is also the clippers being near my ear in the barber shop! Gets me every time, and I actually recall once in my childhood when I did leap from the chair at the sensation -- which of course resulted in me having to get a buzz cut as a result of the wicked stripe I caused the barber to take off... I always figured it was the thought of there being a hand/blade near a vulnerable area of my body that caused it, but I guess the auditory signal of that insect-like buzz could have something to do it with it too. Cool stuff!!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading this thread, I wish I could. I feel like I need to shiver but can't and it's a very strange feeling of annoying lack of satisfaction. Kinda like knowing you need to crack your knuckles but you can't. I've never felt this before and I don't like it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that annoying lack of satisfaction with yawns sometimes. I can make myself yawn but if I do it too many times in a short period then I can't get over the peak of the yawn and I get the lack of satisfaction because it feels like I need to yawn when I can't. </p></div>		</li>
