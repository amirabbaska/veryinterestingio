			<div class="markdown"><p>My Dad and I figured out method 2 to make jelly filled muffins. Freeze whatever pie filling in an ice cube tray. Pour some of the muffin batter into the baking sheet as you normally would. Place one portion of frozen filling in the middle of each cup/well then finish filling the sheet with batter.</p>
<p>I think we might have adjusted the cooking times slightly, but they turned out great.</p></div>		</li>
