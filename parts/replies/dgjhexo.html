			<div class="markdown"><p>So in fact you are not sliding on ice you are sliding on water, water acts as lubrication so to speak.  What then causes the ice to melt, is it just friction, or pressure from the object on the ice?  Can ice and the surrounding ambient temperature be cold enough so that less water is created and the ice is less slippery?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The &quot;sticky&quot; aspect is the tendency of that small amount of water to rapidly re-freeze if its attached to any sizable mass of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up, the reason that pressure melts ice is because water expands as it solidifies. The hydrogen bonds in the liquid form an open crystal lattice that allows liquid water to expand when frozen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is actually perfectly usual. </p>
<p>An increase in local pressure causes the saturation temperature to fall, meaning the ice changes phase into liquid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a hockey player, I can tell you that VERY cold ice stops being slippery. Below about -30C, it's too cold to melt on contact and it's sticky like concrete to your shoes. At maybe -50c, I've heard you can no longer skate on it, as the pressure of the skates can't overcome the extreme cold. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The &quot;slipperiness&quot; of ice is actually a variation on hydroplaning. Essentially, you melt the outermost layer of ice, and your shoe/skate slides around on that now-fluid water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't melt the ice, it's already melted: scientists have done <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~jay/846/skating.pdf" target="_blank">studies</a> and found that ice actually naturally has a thin layer of liquid water on top of it (just a few nanometers thick, but it's enough to cause slipperiness). The common theory is that the ice melts due to pressure, but that is (almost obviously) wrong: if it were true, light objects such as a hockey puck wouldn't be able to slide on ice (pressure <em>can</em> raise the melting point of ice, but the pressures involved are extremely high: higher even than a pair of ice skates can form, at least for ice more than a couple degrees below zero).</p>
<p>I don't actually know why ice doesn't form this liquid layer over surfaces it's in contact with, but my guess would be that it only forms at an air (or other gas) boundary with the ice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is the correct one. The pressure melting has nothing to  do with this. </p>
<p>Theason there is a very thin layer of 'water' on top of ice is because of the ice crystalization. Basically, ice forms hexagonal crystals like you see in meta scales in snow flakes. When water crystalizes or freezes at the top layer the molecular hexagons are not complete and the ice remains in part crystalized form making it water-like and slippery. In extremely cold temperatures the crystals are easier completed and the ice is not that slippery.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't have to be colder. Just get the right boots where the rubber sole has small grooves to wick away the water allowing the boot to make better contact with the ice surface itself. Ice is actually rather rough and grips well. Same principle applies to racecar tires for ice and wet conditions. Tires have very fine grooves which water flows into, and rubber makes contact with ice (or asphalt) allowing high performance in seemingly impossible conditions.</p></div>		</li>
