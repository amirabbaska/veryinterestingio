			<div class="markdown"><p>this is ultimately the correct answer. to further emphasize the 35% <em>penalty</em>, apple floated a multi billion dollar bond to pay dividends and perform stock buy back, with essentially a loan at 3% interest, rather than pay the 35% off their own cash.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the same time tho what's the point of even making so much money then if they really can't do much with it because they have to keep it outside the country? I mean I guess it's there if they really ever desperately need it but what if they operate for the next 200 years and that pool of money just keeps growing </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, making more money is always good. Their stock is valued based on sales growth and volumes. Higher val = more sales = more cash. So the point is keep making tons of money and maximize shareholder value. What to do with that cash? Not sure. Some people get paid a ton of money to answer that question. </p>
<p>Edit: I think. Nintendo has the same thing. They can operate at a loss for a long one because they have so much cash. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple has stated (along with a few other tech companies) that they would bring their cash back to he U.S. if they did another tax holiday.  I don't know why the Oboma administration never took them up on the offer.  The last one that was offered was either under Bush or Clinton I think.  </p></div>		</li>
