			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds great, but...</p>
<p>If you wash plastic tupperware in the sink, using cold to moderate water temperature, and wash ceramic plates and steel pots at the same time, and put them all in a dish rack at the same time, the plastic stays wet for much longer than the ceramic or steel. </p>
<p>The ceramic plates and bowls will be dry in minutes. The steel pots and utensils will be dry sometime later. The plastic tupperware, cups and spatulas will remain wet for thirty minutes or more. </p>
<p>This can't be due to ceramic &quot;holding&quot; more heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Water evaporating or beading on a surface has much more to do with the attractive or repellent properties of the material. Ceramic and glass are attractive to water so it sheets and evaporates. Plastic is repellent so the water beads and sticks around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Beads will have a far greater volume-to-surface-area, which will make evaporation take longer. On ceramic, water doesn't head so much as spread out forming a thin layer, much more ready to evaporate</p>
<p>Edit: you all are making great points in the replies. Truthfully, I don't know enough about how dishes dry to make a competent reply to your replies. Cheers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're referring to is called surface tension. Everything has a different surface tension due to its chemical make-up and how tight the molecules are that make it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's a good point, but there is no reason why both scenarios have to explained by the same phenomena </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that they don't necessarily need to be explained by the same phenomena. However it seems, on the surface, that since a plastic container stays wet longer than glass or porcelain after washing in a hot dishwasher <em>or</em> a cold sink, that the two would be related. </p>
<p>I can't say for sure, but my guess is that it has something to do with water tension. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the water tension scenario described below, you're completely ignoring the shape of the plate vs. the plastic containers. Plates are basically flat discs. You put them on a drying rack, the water mostly slides right off the plate. If you stand there for a minute, before any water evaporates, you'll notice most of it actually drips off the plate completely. </p>
<p>Plastic containers on the other hand, are, well... containers. Bowls, box shaped, whatever. Water collects on the inside even if they are in a rack since they're usually not <em>completely</em> upside down. Also, the lip that curves out and downwards for the lid to snap onto always has water collecting in there. And then the surface tension comes into play where the water doesn't slide off quite as easily, but this is secondary to the shape of the container itself. </p>
<p>Wash a plastic cutting board (not a banged up one with lots of cuts in it) and put it next to a ceramic plate on the drying rack. I'd wager it wouldn't take <em>that</em> much longer for the cutting board to dry. </p>
<p>Edit: people saying the shape isn't important... cracking me up--put a little bit of water in a ceramic bowl and a plastic bowl and set it on the counter. See how long it takes to evaporate. This isn't even science we're talking common sense. More water on the dish=more time to completely evaporate. If you want a scientific explanation, the rate of vaporization is directly proportional to the surface area of the water. A flat dish will have greater surface area to spread the same amount of water over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think plastics <a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html" target="_blank">actually have a much higher heat capacity than ceramics?</a>  But that doesn't mean they get more or less &quot;hot&quot; as everything is heated to the same temperature.  However, the ceramics are heavier, much more mass, so they can retain more heat for longer, despite the evaporative-cooling of the water, and so probably evaporate more water, in spite of their lower heat capacity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's per mass. Not only is tupperware less dense, but it's typically much thinner too, making it over an order of magnitude lighter and holding less heat capacity per unit of dish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And so I repeat, the plastic actually has a <em>higher</em> heat-capacity, but the ceramic plates have way more mass, and thus 'retain' the heat for longer.  But, in truth, I am not at all convinced that 'heat-capacity' is the correct answer, here.  People are arguing that a higher heat-capacity (per unit mass or per unit dish) would mean that the material cools down &quot;slower&quot; since it heats up &quot;slower&quot;.  But the units of heat-capacity do not include time, and thus it says nothing about the 'rate' of cooling or heating. After-all, we can heat things up in one way and cool them down in quite another. And again, you cannot say that the plastic is &quot;hotter&quot;, it is not.  All are the same temperature, provided that the dishwasher has achieved equilibrium. </p></div>		</li>
