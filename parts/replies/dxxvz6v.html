			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the engine angle is dictated by the need for the thrust to go through the centre of mass for spaceflight, otherwise there'd be a turning moment. The ideal angle for the intake is different for the reasons you discussed. Hence the bend. Although the cowling curves down, from the drawings I've seen the nozzles point straight backwards.</p>
<p>This is rarely seen in normal aircraft because they don't require the thrust to be aligned with the CoM because the aerodynamic forces from the wings and tail can counteract any misaligned thrust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If looking at this <a href="http://3zmaj.hr/images/37.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> at the front or rear view of the craft, the engine pods are quite far below the centre of mass, assuming it is located roughly in the geometric centre. This should not be that far of, given that most of the craft is fuel and oxidiser tanks before and aft of the central cargo bay. </p>
<p>Therefore some downward angled thrust is probably required in order to have the thrust vector through the centre of mass. If the engines have thrust vectoring, the neutral thrust direction might still be straight backwards though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that some of that angle has to do with the reduced lift at those altitudes plays a much larger part.  Even a small bend like that is going to give you some lift.  Back of the envelop, something like a F100 (F-15 engine) at 15000 pounds of thrust with a 5 degree tilt is going to give you ~1300 pounds of lift.  When you start hitting greater than 45,000 feet you need to speed up (which this jet most certainly will start to do) to keep lift, but until they hit &quot;space&quot; they may need to keep their speed down due to friction.  (Which is why rockets go straight up to get orbit, the atmosphere is a speed killer.)</p>
<p>Edit: My tense/phrasing was off from the original content of the parent post.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this: They go straight up at first, because they start vertically. A vertical start needs less structural reeinforcement due to lower aerodynamical forces - way less lift and shear forces than a plane. The whole design of a vertical take-off launcher is a lot more mass efficient than a spaceplane that has to rely on atmospheric lift.</p>
<p>Going horizontal as soon as possible is still the most effective way to get into orbit though every second you burn vertically, you lose 9.81m/s of delta-v, because of gravity (for 60° 8.5m/s, for 30° 5m/s and so on)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn’t have more to do with lift during takeoff and landing? Supersonic aircraft take forever to get airborne because the engines are designed for efficiency at upper atmosphere. Just look at Area-51’s runway, it’s been awhile but I seem to remember it being 5 miles? Fact check that though. </p>
<p>If you’re airborne and need lift from engines wouldn’t they just trim the nose up? </p>
<p>Edit: never mind, pitching the aircraft at cruising altitude is the flight plan. The angle of the engine inlet keeps it normal to the direction of travel which keeps the shockwave symmetrical as it enters the engine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. Given the small wings, it sounds reasonable that they want the intakes to directly face the incoming air during high angle of attack flight.</p></div>		</li>
