<p>For me, after 4 years of messing with my sleep, I've found that perfect sleep for me is 9 hours a night on a 26 hour cycle. For a 24 hour cycle I'd put it around 8:15 a night. I expect this is a pretty average number</p>
<p>The sleep cycle stuff is more complicated and is one of the reasons figuring out sleep takes a while. From what I can tell, sleep cycles don't significantly affect sleep, just how you feel in the morning before fully waking up. It's not good to judge your sleep in the morning for this very reason, but rather how you feel throughout the day and evening, and how that relates to the sleep you get the next day and how you feel that day as well.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway I've learned from sleep cycles is that it makes waking up easier, so if you're only going to get 5 hours of sleep, getting 4.5 instead will make it easier to resist the urge to press snooze, fall back asleep, or neglect responsibilities to get more sleep.</p></div>		</li>
