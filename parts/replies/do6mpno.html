<p>Where do you get them, do you have one butterfly guy or multiple vendors?</p>

<p>How do they get them? or is it a don't ask don't tell?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need to visit a butterfly sanctuary, my friend!!!</p>
<p>I can personally vouch for The Butterfly Palace in Branson, Missouri. But I would imagine most are similar. </p>
<p>If you have children (of ANY age) it will blow them away.  Being in an aviary with thousands of butterflies flitting around, landing on you, feeding on nectar you hold in your hand, is just amazing.  And I'm a 31 yr old biker.</p>
<p>And the kids get to release newly hatched butterflies for their first ever flight.  </p>
<p>Seriously, find a sanctuary to visit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn. See, I've always wanted to go there every time I've visited Branson, but it's always a trip with extended family and I'm always overruled. I teach high school biology and I have two kids, so I'm dying to visit. I'm going to go with my kids next time whether anyone else wants to or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I'm really glad I live in an age where we have such easy access to information, although I do wish every once in a while (very fleetingly) that there was still more mystery. I think it's amazing to think about how little people knew about biology and nature until the scientific revolution.  Must've been an incredibly different experience growing up with most people illiterate and only knowing what their local religious authority taught them. Crazy stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  A few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By its mom do you literally mean the mother moth, or a human that chose the wrong food?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was the maturation process delayed / elongated?</p>
</li>
<li>Could it reproduce? If it did, were its offspring adversely affected?</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>The mother moth. She decided to lay eggs on the 'wrong' plant for the caterpillars to get proper nutrition. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It likely took much longer to reach adulthood than normal. I believe we only discovered it as a cocoon. It was like 7 years ago so details are a little foggy. </p>
</li>
<li>If a male it would probably still be able to mate but may not be picked by a female. If a female she wouldn't be able to produce many eggs. If either sex did succeed in mating I would expect the offspring to have minimal complications. </li>
