			<div class="markdown"><p>In all seriousness, the first thing you should do when you get lost its to stop and make yourself a cup of tea. While this presumes you brought the requisite bits to do so, it's the advice I give everyone that goes out. Stopping to do something practical gives your racing thoughts something to focus on, and the warmth and hydration from the tea are always a good thing. And when people think of this before they go out, hopefully it means they brought a few supplies with them. </p>
<p>On the joking side, I always carry a length of fibre optic cable with me when our in the back country. That way, if I ever get lost, all I have to do is party the fibre on the ground, kick some dirt over it and wait a couple of hours until some yahoo shows up in a backhoe to cut it.</p></div>		</li>
