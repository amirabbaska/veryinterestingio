			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge difference between cleansing and over-cleansing though. If you use a good gentle cleanser and some moisturiser, it shouldn't cause irritation and over compensation of oil. If on the other hand you use a harsh cleanser like you described, especially a foaming one, then that's going to cause huge issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best thing I ever did for my skin was switch to a cream cleanser and use a facial oil at night instead of a moisturiser. That's right, I put oil on my skin and it stops being oily! Thanks skin :) no more foamy cleansers and harsh toners and rough scrubs, and my skin is 50x better (and the upkeep is cheaper).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my dermatologist prescribed big overdoses of vitamin B and it worked wonders against my acne, they had to monitor my liver (and kidneys?) though to intervene with organ failure because of the increased risk. i had a pretty bad case of acne, hadn't touched my face in a year because it was just all swollen and painful, when i woke up my pillow often had bloodstains. pretty glad i went to a specialist for it, 10/10 would advice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why you need to moisturise after washing your face. I'd argue that washing + moisturising regularly leads to clearer skin than not doing either, and is definitely better than washing only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you have to clean the bacteria, like with the rest of your body, with water and gentle soap. But then your face gets dry because you also washed off the sebum, therefore you have to replace it with some moisturizer to prevent over-production of sebum. I'm pretty sure this is the best way to do it, unless you have perfect skin that doesn't require any maintenance, which happens to some lucky people.</p></div>		</li>
