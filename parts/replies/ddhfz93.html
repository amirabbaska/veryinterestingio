			<div class="markdown"><p>Just reading that made me shudder. I was pulling out of our housing complex one time and a spider dropped from the visor over my head to about three inches in front of my face. It was not very large, probably 8â€“10mm, but it was enough. Fortunately, I was only going ten miles per hour at the time, but I still almost wrecked trying to swat it away in a fit of irrational arachnophobia. Even thinking about it now gives me the creepies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Park your car somewhere else at home. Then get the vacuum cleaner out and clean the vehicle inside out. You may have to do this several times as you won't catch them all at first. </p>
<p>Edit: they mostly get into your car through the gaps in the door frames.</p></div>		</li>

I think you might be talking about these guys. They like trees and hiding in peoples houses. In the Wikipedia it says some types are attracted to petroleum in car engines and they are active at night. I get them in my car a lot and they are very upsetting.</p></div>		</li>
