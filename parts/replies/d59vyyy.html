			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser Drills suck.  With a big enough laser, you can vaporize stone at the bottom of the hole, but then your hole fills up with vaporized stone, and you can't shine a laser down it until that stone vapor clears out. Plus, lots of that vapor is going to be deposited on the walls of your hole instead of finding it's way out.  Real drilling rigs often circulate &quot;mud&quot; to help transport ground rock from the bottom of the hole.</p>
<p>Lasers are pretty awesome in an open, well ventilated space. Very precise, and threr's no chance that the toughness of the material you are cutting will push the cutting head around, as often happens with mechanical cutters.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not correct. It's strong enough to retain it but not for indefinite lengths of time. Mars can only not retain an atmosphere in geological time scales. If for some reason we were able to suddenly puff up the atmosphere to Earth levels, it would be human livable for millions of years with no additional atmosphere creation. The drain of atmosphere from solar wind is very slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this question presumes heat and pressure are primary problems, but I'm not sure that is the case.</p>
<p>Going even a few meters deep provides important protection from radiation and meteorites. Even at that depth I imagine the rock would insulate quite well and the heat of all the various activity inside would be well contained. An artificial atmosphere will be required regardless and keeping it sealed with a near-vacuum outside doesn't seem <em>that</em> difficult, at least not compared to tunneling many kilometers deep.</p></div>		</li>
