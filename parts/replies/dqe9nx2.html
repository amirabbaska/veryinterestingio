			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically speaking, what you are describing is linear independence. If we have multiple dimensions like seconds, hours, and days then that is linearly dependent system since you can 'build' hours out of seconds meaning there are multiple ways to describe a point. </p>
<p>3D space using (x,y,z) coordinates is linearly independent because no matter how much you go left or right you will not be able to go up or down. </p>
<p>If OP is interested in learning more I recommend taking a class on Linear Algebra. It really helped me see the connection between the physical world and mathematics. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That video explained it well for me from a programming/linear algebra point of view. To move properly within a dimension you need to use one dimension higher. I think it helped me realise what the 4th dimension is and how higher dimensions would work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not quite correct. Time is different than spatial dimensions as it transforms differently under Lorentz Transforms and differs by a minus sign in our spacetime metric.</p>
<p>What you are describing would be our universe being 4 dimensions, x y z and t. However, the universe is actually 3 + 1 dimensions (unless you ask a string theorist).   If you are looking at the length between two objects in spacetime, time actually behaves as a complex coordinate. That is, the arclenght of a path through spacetime is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2 (note you might see the minus sign on the space components and plus on time, it's all matter of convention). This value is invariant under any relativistic reference frame. So, to keep this invariance time can't just be a &quot;4th&quot; dimension.</p>
<p>As for why we don't have more time dimensions, I don't know. It's just the way the universe works. Mathematically you can add extra time dimensions and see how physics will change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I kinda meant to say this in my original comic. I'm reminded of the video of Richard Feynman responding to &quot;why&quot; questions in physics, where he basically says &quot;why&quot; questions start to get tricky to answer without a certain amount of knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe time IS three dimensional (or any other number) but the effect of our interaction with it is exactly the same which ever direction we're travelling through it.</p>
<p>...Like, time could be like a uniform cloud of needles and matter is like a cluster of party balloons. It doesn't matter which direction you move the balloons through the needle cloud the effect is always the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure how this would work, though. Time <em>t</em> is a measure of the increase of the average entropy of the universe. On the largest of scales, entropy can only increase, never decrease; we are led to a lower energy configuration, never higher. The measure of that increase is then time. How can we measure <em>n</em> dimensions of entropy?</p></div>		</li>
