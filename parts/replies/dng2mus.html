<p>We grow enough corn to feed 14 people per acre per year. The actual amount of corn that gets used for food is enough to feed 3 people per acre per year.  Its a terribly inefficient system propped up by 20 billion dollar a year subsidies. It provides little nutrition and does huge damage to the environment.</p></div>		</li>
