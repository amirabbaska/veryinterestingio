In fact, Alberta oilsands only recently became profitable to tap, as the cost of more accessible and more easily refined sources went up. Same with Venezuela's sludgy heavy petroleum. We didn't used to do deep-sea drilling due to cost, but now it's common. That trend will continue all over the world.</p>
<p>The catch is, it's only profitable as long as someone's able to pay for it. The concept behind what's termed 'peak oil' is not, as often thought, a failure of <em>material</em> supply (&quot;running out&quot;), but a failure of <em>affordable</em> supply. The concept posits a point where the cost of extraction, refining, and delivery exceeds the market's ability to pay for it, while the market still relies on the product, thus triggering sudden, widespread, long-term economic failure. While traditional economic theory would hold that the cost of a product people 'need' will be met by market demand, we already know that's not the case where healthcare is concerned: People can and do die for lack of ability to pay. There's no reason to assume that energy markets are fundamentally different in that respect.</p>
<p>But energy is different in one respect: <em>everyone</em> relies on it. Because it supports everything else. If the price of wheat goes up, then the price of flour and bread go up, but the price of gas doesn't. But if the price of motor fuel goes up, then the price of <em>everything else</em> goes up with it, since pretty much everything is economically dependent on motor fuels.</p>
<p>Looking back at the start of the current economic slump we're still pulling out of, most people point to unstable securities, overextended investment, and inflated real estate as the cause, and they're right about that. Those things were the big factors that came tumbling down the moment the market became unstable and creditors started finding themselves unable to cover their own risks, leading to a collapsing house of cards.</p>
<p>But what people forget is that the initial trigger for all that was a sudden spike in motor fuel prices lasting more than a few days or a week. The moment I saw that spike, I had a feeling that it would trigger damaging waves of economic damage, and i was right. But that's not because I'm smart or anything; I'd already read about that potential effect from the kinds of people who talk about things like peak oil. Those people may or may not be right about peak oil, but they're clearly right about how motor fuels affect entire markets of developed societies.</p></div>		</li>

(obviously 3rd world has much greater potential market/room to grow than 1st world which is somewhat 'stuck in our dirty ways' due to our very deliberate exploitation of carbon rich resources that took millions of years to form)</p></div>		</li>
