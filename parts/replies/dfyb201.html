			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I wish more companies would realize this. And stop locking my down so hard. I don't care if it's cheap if I can only watch it on my desktop, without ad blockers, while you show me ads every 5 minutes, oh and I can't resume from where I left off.</p>

<p>We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem. If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate's service is more valuable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This a thousand times. Netflix is still not the service I'm looking for either, since I want the actual file, and i know a little bit about networking. The internet was not designed for netflix, but everybody was afraid of torrents bogging it down.</p>
<p>Then the payment model. Steams is perfectly fine, you buy a game, a cut goes to the dev/publisher and some to steam. A subscription model doesnt go to who you like, it goes to 'everybody'. You're not going to see more of what you like in the future, as you have no control over where your money is going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I ever pirated heavily was music. But now that I can pay $15/month to Google for a family plan streaming service that also gives me access to YouTube Red I don't even bother. But I do share my Google Play music login with my dad and he gives his HBO login. Account sharing is the new piracy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Netflix proves that if you ask people to pay a reasonable sum for content and provide it in a nice, easy, manner, you don't have to worry about piracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nicely said. My only real concern with them is that they're very quickly cornering the entire damn market, and pretty soon those reasonable sums will become steadily more unreasonable.</p>
<p>As it becomes more and more difficult to pirate (via DRM enforcement strategies) they will drive up the price for their services quicker.</p>
<p>We need piracy, if not only as a last resort to force companies to not screw their users.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well Netflix can put whatever DRM it wants in its code.  As soon as you have data being displaced on a PC screen, and sound being played out of a PC's speakers it becomes possible to record same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's only that, sure -- but the danger of allowing DRM is the danger of them putting other stuff in the code that you don't know about.</p>
<p>For a browser, that could be access to your webcam, stored passwords, etc, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I say let them have the market. They're making better shows than cable, and a lot of good movies too. If they're playing the game better, then maybe other mediums will step up. And I don't see it getting more expensive, as their customer base is growing rapidly.</p></div>		</li>
