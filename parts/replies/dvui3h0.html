			<div class="markdown"><p>I expect people didn't believe him at first? The idea of exactly zero resistance sounds completely contrary to how most of physics works in the real world, so did other scientists doubt his measurement? Or was the testing mechanism sufficiently accurate or constructed in a way that removed all doubt?</p></div>		</li>
