			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do they say that a stolen ATM is more expensive than the amount of cash in it?</p>
<p>I've heard it multiple times. Is it a myth? If a cheap one costs $2500, then what's the cost for the &quot;average&quot; one?</p>
<p>I thought they were $50-100k each or something.</p></div>		</li>
