			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait... but different ants in different roles are totally different looking. Does this mean the reserve ants are just like stem-cell ants that can grow or change to fill any role? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully someone can help me out with a source for this but certain ants can 'morph' between roles amazingly quickly, leaf cutter ants are an amazing example. When there is a perceived need for more 'cutters' in the colony (through chemical signals most likely), a portion of soldier ants simply adapt the tools required. When a colony is under serious threat, males literally grow wings, females are produced and they fly in search of a new place to colonize, land and their wings drop off before your very eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been discovered that ants change jobs as they age and when needed to, but I'm not sure about 'adapting' the tools required.</p>
<p>Are you sure the larvae aren't just allocated to the new roles as needed?</p>
<p>I didn't think they could alter their morphology after pupation, because adult insects don't moult.</p>
<p>Also, to my knowledge, adult males don't 'grow' wings; pupae that are designated to become reproductive alates emerge in their adult forms with the wings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately that's impossible. The morphology of the ant is determined by the amount and kind of food it gets while being a larvae. They can't change their shape when they're grown, although they can adapt to many roles as needed. (and we're talking only about polymorphic species - most of the species don't have &quot;castes&quot; - their roles are determined by age, size and current needs)
Males and females always have wings after pupation. Females cut them off after mating and males just die. </p>
<p>Source: been fascinated by ants for many years, keeping them at home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in what degree are these &quot;signals&quot; different from human hormones? If they are similar, what makes the ants' response to the hormones different from human emotions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in many ways ants are more like a cell in your body than they are like a human. And in that analogy pheromones are extremely similar to hormones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pheromones are not as much similar as they are identical to hormones. But what im wondering is what the exocrine system really differs from the human endocrine system. They say the ants are mindless and follow only pheromones.. But so do we! We follow adrenal hormones, sex hormones, etc etc. Why is exocrine mindless, while endocrine masterful? Seems so knee-jerk from biologists to label them as such</p></div>		</li>
