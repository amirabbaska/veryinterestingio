			<div class="markdown"><p>Until... oh, the last four years? I often went more than a week without brushing my teeth. These days I brush them after I shower in the morning. It's a habit I never formed as a child and the only way to maintain it now is the wake up, shower, brush, in that order. Bed time varies so I find it hard to remember to brush before bed. </p>
<p>I'm just glad I finally got half of the habit and really, really thankful I won the teeth jackpot (they're stupidly strong and good). Otherwise I'm positive I'd have had a fair few extractions by now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you don't brush at night your letting bacteria or dental plaque thrive in your mouth for 6-8 hours untouched. In the morning you eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, you drink water or munch on snacks or gum there's so many oral activities that plays with your saliva which is the main contributor to cleaning your mouth. </p>
<p>I guess I just hate going to the dentist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the week I have no problem, brush before work, easy. But on the weekends I will often have left it till quite late and then I am nearly having lunch and don't want to ruin the taste of it. Plus pretty sure I have heard you shouldn't eat near the time you brush anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And you shouldn't brush immediately after eating either. Which is a no win scenario for me because then I'm like 'it's hard enough maintaining ONE routine stand now this thing has tucked it up!'</p></div>		</li>
