			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but no that was a metaphor. I believe it's not an actual EQ but the construction of the speaker is meant to not be a flat sound. So the speakers acoustic profile is what does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with damping and other methods of acoustic design. There’s no circuitry effecting the sound other than the impedance of the drivers themselves. </p>
<p>Some powered speakers offer a feature called DSP (Digital Signal Processing), in which case that’s exactly what they’re doing. They tune it with EQ and other limiters and such to make it sound better digitally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I didn't really know how it worked, other than that it was not an EQ processor, for non powered speakers. Since I have you hear; how do they get monitor speakers to be flat? Like a) what benchmark do they use and b) what construction techniques must they therefore employ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s pretty much the question all speaker designers ask, huh? There are tricks of the trade and design principles that can go waaaaay over my head, and there is also a lot of info online if you google “speaker design”.  Enclosure design, bracing, driver construction, waveguides, crossover, amplification, etc. EVERYTHING effects the sound in some way and it can be very difficult to balance out. </p>
<p>As far as benchmarks, there are many, but they all revolve around calibrated mics and oscilloscopes. Every design could have a different benchmark, and by that I mean perfectly flat isn’t always the goal, and often not even remotely possible. </p>
<p>For instance, I’ve used a lot of high-end studio monitors while recording, but many of them have a sound that isn’t designed to be “pleasant”, but instead, they need to reveal problems and translate well to other environments. Studio monitors are closest you’ll get to truly “flat”, though by what degree of precision depends on $$$$</p>
<p>My favorite speakers tend to be warmer, with tight lows and smooth highs. </p>
<p>How to get that in a speaker? I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to pay somebody smarter than me to figure it out. </p></div>		</li>
