<p>Besides no one brought up a simple point. If vision is near vestigial in delphinids, then why would orcas spy hop when hunting seals on ice. </p>
<p>Also I have a question for you, is the rate at which pupil shape changes known?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It changes near as fast as our pupils dilate, but their retinas still have to adjust to he difference in brightness, so frequent switching is easier in bright light</p></div>		</li>
