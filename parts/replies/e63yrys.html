			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! even I understood. can you ask your wife that if we can mutate the genes during above process to.... you know .... get babies with super-hero powers! </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>at least super-hero rats or turtles </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To do gene manipulation studies of this nature, scientists usually do the DNA mutating outside of the cell - these are known as &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments, which in Latin means &quot;in glass.&quot; The opposite of this is &quot;in vivo&quot; which translates to &quot;in the living.&quot;</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two steps to the process:
1) In vitro manipulation of the genetic material. This is where scientists will do gene splicing, DNA editing, etc., where they change the ATCG strucutre of DNA.</p>
<p>2) Injection of manipulated DNA into an egg cell nucleus. Prior to this, the nucleus is emptied by the scientist in preparation for the new manipulated DNA. If the scientist successfully injects the cell nucleus with a complete set of DNA, then cell division will continue as normal. </p>
<p>However, the organism can only develop successfully if the introduced mutation isn't deleterious - meaning that it causes the death of the organism. Our bodies are far more complex than we realize, and there are connections we can't possibly know exist. Sometimes the introduction of something new into the genome of an organism, or the removal of something ancient, can have lethal consequences.</p>
<p>Still super cool though!</p>
<p>You might find &quot;Dolly the Sheep&quot; interesting, if you haven't already heard of her. She was one of the first clones, and she was produced by using the nuclear DNA of one sheep (her clone) and injecting it into a different sheep's egg cell.</p></div>		</li>
