			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a question I get asked a lot! Sometimes I wonder whether this is because people hope that they themselves are not vulnerable to creating false memories…</p>
<p>Certainly there are individuals who we consider more vulnerable, such as those with low IQ, children and teenagers, and mental illnesses like schizophrenia that already make it difficult for individuals to engage in “reality monitoring” - essentially anyone who may already be bad at telling fact from fiction is probably more likely to generate false memories.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, in my own research on &quot;normal&quot; adults, I did not find ANY systematic personality differences between those who did and those who did not form false memories. I tested for Fantasy Proneness, Compliance, and the Big Five personality types… in addition to testing for gender, age and education. I found nothing. </p>
<p>This does not mean that such personality vulnerabilities don’t exist - they probably do - but they are probably not as important as we may assume. I am convinced that everyone can, and does, make false memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, Dr. Shaw.</p>
<p>You clearly looked at a wide variety of variables that might covary with susceptibility to creation of &quot;false memories&quot;.  I'm curious whether you evaluated how other memory phenomena may correlate.  For example, a non-trivial body of work exists on inhibitory mechanisms in memory retrieval and there is some evidence that these mechanisms are subject to executive control.</p>
<p>Perhaps you agree, calling memories &quot;false&quot; and &quot;true&quot; is somewhat misleading? Human memory seems to be by nature reconstructive, not a literal recording of states or events.  All reconstructions are incomplete or inaccurate to some degree and the importance of the incompleteness or inaccuracy is a matter of context and interpretation (as well as resulting behavior).  Inhibitory mechanisms that are employed to resolve competition at the time of retrieval may be seen as critical to accurate reconstruction (i.e., they prevent the mixing of distinct memory traces that are simultaneously cued).</p>
<p>So... my point: have you evaluated how much individual variation exists in phenomena related to inhibitory mechanisms (e.g., retrieval-induced forgetting, directed forgetting) and whether that may correlate with susceptibility to the creation of &quot;false&quot; memories?</p></div>		</li>
