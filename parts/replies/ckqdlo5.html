			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecommunications consultant here - I'd like to point out that it not only has to fly by DOJ, but also the FCC.  The docket is MB Docket 14-57, and the current status is that a request for additional time has been denied and a request for additional info has been sent to Charter Communications.  Generally, comments were due Aug 25, replies are due today, and counter-replies Oct 8.  (translation, peeps be busy over in FCC land)</p>
<p>It's worthwhile reading the 30 pages or so of request for comments, because it's not a plain straight forward merger we're talking about here, given that it involves a divestiture and formation of another company, transfer of some licenses, people swearing up and down that they won't acquire more control of other assets for X years, etc.</p>
<p>TL;DR - more than just the DOJ is on the case.  DOJ can halt the merger in it's tracks, the FCC can also nickel and dime it to death.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It was the FCC (not the DOJ) that put the nail in the coffin of the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that the issue wasn't that they will be a monopoly because of a lack of competition. I thought the issue is whether their size will lead to a situation where they basically buy the exclusive rights to channels. In a simplistic example, they could make a deal for Fox that is too good to pass up and all Fox channels would only be available through them. Therefore, if you want Fox in this part of the country, you have to have them, and not satellite. </p>
<p>What do you think about that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've touched on an important issue, and one that I neglected in my original comment. You are right -- this isn't just a problem of two competing cable companies merging (a horizontal merger), although that <em>is</em> a major issue.  The fact that Comcast also owns content -- and can use its dominant position as a cable provider to harm competing content providers -- may create competitive concerns as well.</p>
<p>Susan Crawford is probably the country's leading authority on competition in the cable industry.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still SHOCKED the NBCUniversal/Comast merger was allowed to go through. Especially since that precedent was set with a very clear cut entertainment case: United States v Paramount Pictures.</p>
<p>The AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger feels like a comparable anti-trust issue. The #1 and #4 telecom carriers weren't allowed to merge. Here you have Comcast (#1) and Time Warner Cable (#2 cable provider in the US) in a similar market dynamic. Why is this any different?</p>

<p>Thanks for the FT article. Could you imagine if cable operators were capped at 10% of nationwide customers, like commercial banks are with depositors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is already a problem because they own content creators NBC and comcast sportsnet. Sharks (NHL Team) are part of that broadcast and for a while you could not get this channel on any other carrier besides comcast. So no Dish or AT&amp;T U-Verse...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this if it's not too late.</p>
<p>/u/Ah_Q mentions that politics is core to the issue.  I would like to go a bit deeper into this issue if I could.  The truth is that antitrust enforcement agencies have limited resources.  The unconfirmed but widely believed way the agencies deal with these limited resources is to rely heavily on settlements.  Now, in order to negotiate good settlements - the kinds of settlements that actually help consumers - the agencies must have credibility when they say you can take the deal or try your luck in court.  Agencies like to preserve their winning records because not only does it make the people winning look good (and therefore help their careers) it also helps them to negotiate tough settlements and keep them from wasting too much resources in court.  So in a way, every court battle becomes a mechanism by which they can efficiently resolve many more cases behind the scenes.  This is probably a good thing.  You can go to the FTC or DOJ website and see how many cases they are able to deal with because of this strategy.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is that the agencies tend not to push too hard on unsettled areas of law.  There are many things we'd like to see them active on, like dealing with egregious patent trolls, but they are extremely cautious in new applications of law because they know that if they make a wrong choice it can set the agency's negotiating power and reputation back (see the recently begun study on patent troll business practices that will likely take years to complete, this would be like step 0 in actually acting against these entities).</p>
<p>This brings us to Comcast / TWC.  The classic antitrust theory of harm doesn't work here because there is no reduction in consumer choice.  Comcast customers can't switch to become TWC customers if they wanted and TWC customers can't switch to Comcast if they wanted to.  So those opposing the deal have to use arguments that are less settled.  Take the monopsony (buyer power) argument.  There aren't many cases dealing with monopsony power and the knee jerk reaction is that buyer power is good.  There are a lot of internet based arguments as well, but these aren't necessarily merger-specific and the FCC is trying to resolve many of them industry wide through it's ongoing open internet rule making (side note: the agencies have a merger-specific requirement in examining the issues in a merger - the benefits and harms they examine must be specific to the merger).</p>
<p>So the question is are these theories sound enough that the agencies would be willing to devote a significant amount of resources to litigate the issue if it came to that?  Remember the agencies have to be willing to litigate every case - if any company ever called an agency on a bluff and revealed it to be a bluff the agency would lose all credibility.</p>
<p>I can't really comment on this question unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>
