			<div class="markdown"><p>Firstly because the electron is approximately 1/1836 as massive as the proton, the former moves much faster. In a molten metal, the outermost s- and p-orbital electrons are <em>still</em> delocalised, so any force that is exerted on the liquid will produce greatly different accelerations on the protons (strictly speaking, inner-orbital electrons and nuclei as a whole) and electrons. This ensures that a current is definitely generated, which in turn generates a magnetic field by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet#Ampere.27s_law" target="_blank">Ampere's Law</a>. </p>
<p>Next, the metal flows through a magnetic field that's already generated elsewhere, such as above (it's self-sustaining; see the link in my reply to /u/WormRabbit).</p>
<p>Both these mechanisms combine to greatly amplify the overall electromagnetic induction and hence electromagnetic effect throughout the core.       </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer that resonates in my mind is that the free electrons have a different viscosity than the ions (nuclei with the remaining bound electrons).</p>
<p>Parcels of a fluid move because of inertia, bulk forces (i.e. gravity and electromagnetic forces), pressure differences (i.e. direct pushing), and velocity shear (i.e. viscous dragging).  </p>
<p>With a rotating object, there will <em>always</em> be velocity shear.  On a merry-go-round, the outer riders are moving faster than the inner riders.  For a solid, this is no big deal, it maintains its shape (unless it breaks).  For a fluid (gas, liquid, or plasma), this necessarily causes some stirring.  Layers at different distances from the axis of rotation will be rotating at different rates.  The exact function depends on the viscosity of the fluid.</p>
<p>Molten iron may not be an actual plasma, but any conductor can be modeled by considering the conduction electrons to be a plasma with the ions still locked in the background.  For a liquid conductor, the ions would also be free to move around.  So the liquid conductor is somewhat similar to a gas plasma, with two overlapping and intertwined fluids.  </p>
<p>So why is there a net current that produces a magnetic field?  After all, the charge is balanced.  A moving conductor doesn't necessarily generate magnetism.  The free electrons are more mobile, and have a different viscosity than the ions.  This affects the net velocity of the electrons as a function of distance from the axis.  With the electrons and ions having a different velocity profile, there will be a net current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrostatic charge on the core doesn't matter. Melt some metal in a crucible, and if you give it a stir, <a href="https://physics.aps.org/story/v19/st3" target="_blank">there <em>is</em> electric current</a> (and a magnetic field, because stirring = circular motion, and once again, circular current = <em>dipole</em> magnetic field) merely due to the fact that the metal is moving, which means the electrons are moving, too.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I'm still confused. Since an electronic shouldn't have a preference for an average overall direction of motion with respect to its atom are we discussing valence electrons moving across atoms like on a copper wire or what's going on? Or is it that since the electron is further from the center of an atom overall and therefore covers a larger distance in the circular motion of the current that it generates more current?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When people think don't think nickel is magnetic it's often because of stainless steel, as many people who work with metals are used to checking the quality (nickel content) of stainless by whether a magnet still sticks. (steel is magnetic, steel + nickel = stainless = non-magnetic) However it's actually stainless steel's structure keeping the field unaligned, rather than dilution by a non magnetic material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what? I was under the impression stainless steel was iron + carbon + <em>chromium</em>, not nickel... An <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalloy?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">iron-nickel alloy is still ferromagnetic</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont have any formal metalurgy training and I have never taken a geology class or physics class.  My experience with nickel comes mostly from working with it, and in the forms that I see it which are most definitely not pure, it is usually not magnetic or has a pretty weak magnetism, but according to the link you posted in your top comment, I am wrong and i must have been working with mostly alloys, which really makes the most sense.</p>
<p>Of course in regards to the original question about the earths magnetism, I suppose the magnetism of nickel really does not matter so much as its conductivity which is actually pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I wasn't specific enough. I'll use a quote from Wikipedia to clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are different types of stainless steels: when nickel is added, for instance, the austenite structure of iron is stabilized. This crystal structure makes such steels virtually non-magnetic and less brittle at low temperatures. </p>
