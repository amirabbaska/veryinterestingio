			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yea, you could do what ever you want if you're the head of a country, but there is no point in doing so.</p>
<p>You gotta allocate time, money and man power to prevent enemy citizens from leaving.</p>
<p>You gotta allocate time, money, location and man power to imprison them and keep watch of their activities.</p>
<p>If you want to go a step further, you gotta allocate time, money, munition and man power to exterminate them.</p>
<p>The first two option will be a finacial burden to you and considering that you're at war, every bit helps.</p>
<p>The final option will invoke the criticism from the U.N and might incentivise them to join in the fight against you. </p>
<p>If you let them leave though, the otherside would do the same if you have any citizen in that country. </p></div>		</li>
