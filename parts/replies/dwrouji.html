			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a source on your claim that nitrogen blocks taste bud receptors? Given that nitrogen gas has 1% the solubility of CO2 in water (<a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/gases-solubility-water-d_1148.html" target="_blank">source</a>), there isn't much of it actually in the beer in the glass.  In fact, any bar without a direct draw system is pouring all of their beers with a mix of nitrogen and CO2 to avoid over-carbonating.</p>
<p>My understanding is that beers poured through a stout faucet are smoother thanks to the lower amount of CO2 and the super-creamy head created by pouring through the stout faucet. The nitrogen gives the beer enough force to fly through the restrictor plate without pouring pure foam (as high pressure CO2 would).</p>
<p>Edit: Appears /u/Brettgraham4 edited his post to note that nitrogen &quot; partially blocks the mechanism that causes certain molecules to activate bitter taste in the tongue.&quot; I still don't think this is accurate... it is still about less CO2, not more nitrogen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was always my understanding from doing a ton of research on the subject as an avid and active homebrewer for a few years.</p>
<p>Nitrogen barely dissolves into beer and the stout faucet uses a restrictor plate to force the beer through tiny holes, giving the stout an extremely creamy texture and head.</p>
<p>The co2/nitrogen mix is usually around 70/30 nitrogen/co2 and generally called &quot;beer gas&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my path was simpler. Worked in restaurant with sommelier. </p>
<p>Classes pale in comparison to the trade shows available to industry folk, which are always free, have a lot more good stuff to taste and are often even open to non-buyers like staff and servers. Great for networking too, just ask cuz it doesn't cost the bar or  restaurant anything. Its all about tasting as much as you can when you start out. </p></div>		</li>
