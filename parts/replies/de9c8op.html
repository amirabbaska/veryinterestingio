			<div class="markdown"><p>The moral problems in healthcare around being in a vulnerable spot are easily handled by advance preparation when you are healthy so that when you get sick you go into it knowing what will happen and there aren't unpleasant surprises.  We do this all the time in life - we write laws to deal with criminals or to regulate situations, we build drainage ditches so that when it rains we don't flood, we buy food when full so that we won't go hungry.  It has nothing to do with what society thinks is best - if I bought a plan and get sick that means I sacrificed some past consumption under the promise that society would take care of me in an adverse situation.  Simple contract law and not particularly complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best value doesn't preclude you from making advance preparation it merely means that you may have to work harder or go with less.  For instance we all know that we will die at some point but we do what we can to avoid that.  </p>
<p>From what I can tell medical establishments not quoting the cost of treatment seems to be an ironic effect of high corporate tax rates and deductions for unpaid bills.  If hospitals can jack up costs they can submit the losses for tax purposes which might actually get them more money than if they simply billed a reasonable sum. For instance if I charge 100k for an operation that with reasonable cost + profit would end up at 10k but I know that a poor uninsured person will probably only pay 5k I can write off 95k of otherwise profit on taxes which means that at 40% tax rate (actual corporate rate in America) the hospital just saved about 40k in taxes when the entire operation in a sane world would only cost 10k.  I believe that is a big driver for cost obfuscation and is one of the reasons why I am really really hoping that Trump's proposal to massively cut corporate tax rates happens.</p></div>		</li>
