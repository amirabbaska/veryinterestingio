			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the decision to use CG dinosaurs in Jurassic Park wasn’t made until the film was well into production. Jurassic Park was originally going to use stop motion dinosaurs until someone showed Spielberg a CG animation of a T-Rex walking in broad daylight and he decided to replace all the stop motion scenes with CG. Overall there were 14 minutes of dinosaur footage in the film, only about 4 of those were CG, and a typical shot like the one with the T rex smashing through a log while chasing the jeep took months to animate despite only being 75 frames long!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Abrams really likes his physical sets, props, and costumes. Compare Star Wars VII, which had a TON of practical costumes (and even a fully-functional BB-8 for every scene, if not every single shot) to more or less the same level of aliens and exotic sets in Guardians of the Galaxy. Star Wars feels much more &quot;real&quot; because of an unusual reliance (for today) on physical presence between the actors and the scene. He's not quite on the same level of Del Toro's fantasy-action, but he's close. </p>
<p>...but I still hate what he did to Star Trek with those awful Abramsverse movies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what practical effects are though.  No one expects a fully functional droid, it just has to look right and reacts to the environment correctly.</p>
<p>In Interstellar, they used a Jeep with a spinning rod attached to the model to create the effect of TARS pinwheeling through the water on the water planet.  It looks great, but no one expected that they built a fully functional articulating robot for the movie (though it would be damn cool).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you stood up for Abrams in that respect, he doesn't just CGI everything. As a huge Trekkie I have to say I enjoyed the 1st Star Trek and even the 2nd one (though he jumped the shark a good bit). The 3rd (not his) was garbage. I fully realize they're not made with the same formula as Star Trek usually is (which is amazing), but I enjoy them for what they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a huge trekkie as a kid, and I was so disappointed by Kirk being an even dumber zack morris (being given command of flagship without bothering to write a believable reason), spock spending the whole time screaming and making out, not to mention there were lightsabers... and then the whole part about cold fusion freezing a volcano... the new movies make me want to punch myself in my own face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What in the world!? Beyond has been hailed by lots of Trek fans (that'd include me) as the best Abramsverse Trek movie thus far. It had way more of the spirit of Trek than the movies, so I'm actually baffled that you thought it was garbage. It was more &quot;Trek&quot; than the first one while being <em>monumentally</em> less frustrating to watch than the second.</p></div>		</li>
