			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to struggle with these ALL the time. Minimize acidic drinks. It’s all about the PH level in your mouth. Get a mouthwash that has some peroxide in it or just mix peroxide and water and use that. It really works trust me.</p>
<p>When you feel one coming in, use mouthwash 2-3 times a day and keep doing that until it’s gone.</p>
<p>I’ve had a few pop up over the past year or so and if I hit it with mouthwash they immediately stop growing, then get smaller, then go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to get them all the time as well. Still get them on occasion as an adult. For me, certain apples and apple juice are guaranteed to give me one. Sometimes other fruits as well. Anyrate, my doctor told me once to take L-Lysine when they pop up. It’s some type of amino acid supplement. Sure enough; I double the dose on the first day and it’s typically pain free by day two and gone on day three (I take the recommended dose after day one til it’s gone). You can find L-Lysine in the vitamin/supplement section of any major stores. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lysine also works wonders on cold sores, in ointment form. Especially if you catch it at the first tingle or sign of a bump. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? That's good to know... will keep this in mind. My personal anecdote, I always feel one coming when I'm about to catch the flu or cold-like symptoms. If I can contain the canker sore, I never get sick. If it opens, I usually get sick a day or two later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Using listerine every morning completely stopped me from getting these sores that I had suffered from for many years.</p></div>		</li>
