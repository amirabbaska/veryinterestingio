			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol this Fallout vault was doomed by the overseers from the beginning. But because of the actions of a couple, going against the higher powers, the society was saved ultimately due to the spreading of valuable information!</p>
<p>Wait...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see absolutely NOTHING on this from major outlets such as CNN, NBC, and PBS. It's clearly being repressed from mass public knowledge, and it's great that guys like Philip are helping to break the news when much of the media isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bro, google. It's everywhere. Large outlets are probably planning on reading joining forces, parsing it, and consulting experts before they go in depth, but the media is far from &quot;silent&quot; about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the problem is, even when educated about what's happening 4/5 people have the same response.. </p>
<p>&quot;who cares? if you aren't doing anything illegal you have nothing to worry about. I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.&quot;</p>
<p>this response is ignorant on so many levels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest red flag is that Vault 7 has evidence that the CIA can fake hacks from foreign governments.</p>
<p>Isn't there a big story recently about a foreign government hacking an important American event? The question is now that evidence can be faked by the CIA, can we believe this evidence?</p></div>		</li>
