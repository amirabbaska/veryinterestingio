			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually more to it than just that too. The history of all species and the entirety of life, and infact of civilizations themselves, all point to oin inevitable fact.. in time, in populations with constant exchange, there are only so many niches, and once they get filled, which happens pretty quickly, evolution is mostly about which genes/animal/culture/idea is most successful in that niche. This limits how much we can flourish.</p>
<p>In other words, the earth is now one bowl, and it allows for one or a few small cultures to flourish. Just look at what has happened before and after globalization. Before the travel and communication and industrial revolution, the earth was 'big', and lots of cultures flourished in their own ways. After, it is now 'small', and only one or a few cultures are rapidly spreading over everywhere.</p>
<p>Spreading beyond earth will allow us to continue to have new niches and environments to let more of the creativity, ingenuity, and potential of humanity, and intelligent life in general, to continue to progress and diversify in multiple ways. Limited to earth, we will gro like a bamboo.. still progressing, but in one particular way that wipes the one before. Once we spread out, we will be able to progress like branches in a tree, all potentially evolving in different ways in a splendid variety of intelligent cultures!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thesis. I much lament the destruction of human cultural diversity I see at the expense of a few dominant thoughtways. I see it as seriously impoverishing the potential of human intelligence. Yet perhaps by going elsewhere, we create diversity once again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair to Earth, it still has a few years in it. Current theories suggest that we have another 600 to 800 million years of Earth being able to sustain multicellular life left on this planet before the sun gets too bright to allow the current carbon cycle that makes photosynthesis possible stops working. At that point the only thing left will be some single celled extrmophile organisms living deep down in thermal vents or similar and they will die off too as Earth cools down until another 7 billion years later Earth gets engulfed by our sun having become a red giant.</p>
<p>So the idea of Earth naturally being unable to host life as we know it  is not exactly an urgent problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand extinction events do seem to be a disturbingly regular thing on geological timescales at least.</p>
<p>On the gripping hand humans appear to be quite capable of destroying their own species and civilization without much help from mother nature.</p>
<p>It would certainly have helped if we had some backup planet with a backup copy of human civilization on some place like Mars during the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>On a more sci-fi note there are all sorts of ideas about the fermi paradox and how any civilization only slightly more advanced than we are right now should be able to seed to galaxy with von-Neuman machines and yet there don't seem to be any around or for that matter any aliens sending signals to the universe at large.</p>
<p>Some people have suggested that either intelligent life is extremely rare for some reasons or that there is something that prevents it from getting to the point where they are unmistakeably visible to us. the idea of some great filter preventing civilizations from getting to that point. We have no idea what that might be or if we have already passed though that filter successfully, but it might be a good idea to have more than one shot at it if it is still ahead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah... I don't think it's a paradox; life just arises spontaneously so rarely that we needn't expect to cross paths with it. Those equations were cooked up by physicists; if you look at the question biochemically it's plain to see that abiogenesis is probably incredibly (astronomically!) rare. </p>
<p>Back on topic: if there's life on Mars, it'll be our cousins. It would be alien life but not that much more alien than the stuff at the bottom of the ocean. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A backup of human civilization on mars is actually terrifying considering that the world is currently &quot;peaceful&quot; as a result of the threat of mutually assured destruction by way of nuclear weapons. If politicians and businessmen can pull the trigger from another planet, the threat of making earth uninhabitable is less of a deterrent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not really fair to the Earth. It's the only planet we know of that has food and air recyclers growing out of the ground, breathable air that stays on the planet without having to hold it in, and natural radiation shielding. This is like saying there's no reason to live in a 5-star hotel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And yet no country is really taking space travel seriously. Sure there are a few independent companies that are blazing the trail, but it's like pulling teeth for them to try and get enough support to make it happen in a reasonable time frame. Even if/when we get off earth, I'm not sure if we'll ever get the extraterrestrial colonies past the &quot;research&quot; stage. Because right now, people don't have a good enough reason to leave Earth. And by the time they do, it will be too late.</p></div>		</li>
