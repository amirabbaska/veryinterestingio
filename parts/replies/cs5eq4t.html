			<p>So, for Microsoft it was because they were abusing their monopoly/market share? Otherwise everything they did was legal? <br>True, Apple doesn't prevent you from installing other music apps, but they are never the default. Just like the Calculator app, Calendar, Maps (Safari Browser, funny enough) etc etc. if I don't purposefully open the competition Siri or whatever other app, will default to the Apple version. With Microsoft, even back then I could make Netscape default and it would automatically open certain files. <br>But I guess none of this matters if it is only about the market share and not some sort of &quot;abuse&quot; of their preferred software/Apps?</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; So, for Microsoft it was because they were abusing their monopoly/market share? Otherwise everything they did was legal?<br><br>Correct.<br><br>Microsoft did three things, none of which ran afoul of the law individually, but together resulted in legal trouble for them.<br><br><em> They obtained a monopoly on the desktop OS market.  This in itself is not illegal - plenty of companies have legal monopolies.<br><br></em> They threatened to stop selling their product to another company as a means of coercion.  Again, not illegal, and not a super uncommon business tactic.<br><br>* They bundled a piece of their own software with another piece of their own software.  Obviously not illegal, since most software companies do that. <br><br>The problem is that once you become a monopoly, you become subject to a number of rules that disallow you from taking certain actions which are deemed &quot;anticompetitive.&quot;  Whenever people ask why company X gets away with Y when Microsoft was prosecuted for the same thing -- it's generally because they don't have a monopoly on a particular industry.</p>		</li>

			<p>In the European Union, coercing under the threat to stop supplying when you have a monopoly, is prohibited under art. 102 TFEU. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;They also don't stop you from installing any other music app, and if you do you can choose which one to use as the default.<br><br>They do stop you from choosing the default, but you definitely can download and use Google Play Music or Spotify on an iPhone.</p>		</li>

			<p>People are underestimating the importance of this fact. Microsoft had 90+% market share. Apple is not in a remotely similar market position as Microsoft. </p>		</li>

			<p>False. AOSP is able to be completely modified. Google are under no obligation to then allow you to include Google Play Services in your fork. Their stuff (including &quot;stock&quot; Android on Nexus devices) isn't the same as AOSP. <br><br>They've actually also come under fire in the last few years for effectively killing off some AOSP apps, and replacing them in their implementation with Google apps. </p>		</li>

			<p>A vendor could (and does, see Amazon), but in reality no phone vendor with any sense would release a phone without Play Services just to be able to change a bit of code in AOSP. </p>		</li>

			<p>No in practise you'd either have to be an idiot or insanely rich (See Amazon) to do Android without Play Services, but in theory, it is possible. </p>		</li>

			<p>Apple still rakes in 90% of the mobile app market profits, though. With Apple you are paying for the phone and the software. With Android you pay the phone vendor for a phone and then Google gives you free software so they can sell your data to advertisers. Same way Gmail, Google Search, and pretty much all their products work. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not anymore. The 90% profit stat was during the iPhone 2-3 and Apple App store reign, which has greatly diminished now. Even then it was &quot;smartphones&quot; and not &quot;feature phones&quot;, and the smartphones space had no competition (early Motorola Droids and... Microsoft Phones).<br><br>(Un)surprisingly, Samsung is making dollar over fist in the smartphone world nowadays.</p>		</li>
