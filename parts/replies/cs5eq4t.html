True, Apple doesn't prevent you from installing other music apps, but they are never the default. Just like the Calculator app, Calendar, Maps (Safari Browser, funny enough) etc etc. if I don't purposefully open the competition Siri or whatever other app, will default to the Apple version. With Microsoft, even back then I could make Netscape default and it would automatically open certain files.
But I guess none of this matters if it is only about the market share and not some sort of &quot;abuse&quot; of their preferred software/Apps?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Microsoft did three things, none of which ran afoul of the law individually, but together resulted in legal trouble for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They obtained a monopoly on the desktop OS market.  This in itself is not illegal - plenty of companies have legal monopolies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They threatened to stop selling their product to another company as a means of coercion.  Again, not illegal, and not a super uncommon business tactic.</p>
</li>
<li>They bundled a piece of their own software with another piece of their own software.  Obviously not illegal, since most software companies do that. </li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that once you become a monopoly, you become subject to a number of rules that disallow you from taking certain actions which are deemed &quot;anticompetitive.&quot;  Whenever people ask why company X gets away with Y when Microsoft was prosecuted for the same thing -- it's generally because they don't have a monopoly on a particular industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point with IE was not that they had it preinstalled (though that was also a seperate complaint, however with less valid arguments too it), but that they were trying to use their contracts with manufacturers to prevent the deployment of other browsers. That's called anti-trust.</p>
<p>The logic that Microsoft simply can't bundle a browser with their OS is absurd, because why not argue that they should be allowed to bundle a Notepad app, or a media player, or MS Paint, or photo viewing software, etc. Microsoft makes the Windows operating system, they have the right to put what they want in it. They do not however have the right to use their contracts to interfere in business between other companies (saying &quot;We will not do business with you unless you drop your contracts with X&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
