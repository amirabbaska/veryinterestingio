			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there is evidence that massaging can relieve DOMS. It is by no means a <em>complete</em> solution but it has been shown to reduce pain. </p>
<p>Here's a link to a study published in the British journal of Sports Medicine: <a href="http://bjsmbeta.bmj.com/content/37/1/72.full" target="_blank">http://bjsmbeta.bmj.com/content/37/1/72.full</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its an interesting study, the authors have said that nothing physiologically has changed post massage, and the 48hr result is likely a placebo effect, but there study is too under powered to determine this.</p>
<p>Its a shame there is no current systematic review or Cochrane review.</p></div>		</li>
