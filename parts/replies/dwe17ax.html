<p>These are general statements, but they should illustrates that a linear scaling does not hold at all. I think drag coefficient on wing profiles will stay constant but almost other variables change. </p>

<p>Nope; drag coefficient is a function of Reynolds number which is ul/(ν) where u is fluid velocity, l is a characteristic length, and ν  is kinematic viscosity. U and ν are constant so the Reynolds number changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am just wondering what fluid mechanics education, if any, you have by making a statement like that. Because one of the things that everyone learns in their first fluids course is dimensional analysis, and if you did learn about it, that should have been the first thing that popped into your head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly what I was trying to get at with the statements about the nonlinear relationship between surface area and volume. </p>
<p>I read the OP as a casual inquiry, so I tried to keep the response jargon-free. As important as dimensional analysis is, the application is not immediately obvious to most people until they work through a few example problems. To be fair to your point - Im not sure I've heard anyone refer to dimensional analysis by name in awhile. It's a basic and common tool that most people just assume the room understands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're backpedaling. Your handwavey claim that &quot;dimensional analysis is so common that it's assumed&quot; sounds like you genuinely didn't know what it was until just now. Same with your assertion that OP somehow didn't deserve a correct answer because &quot;it would be too hard for him&quot; - sounds like the correct answer was too hard for YOU.</p>
<p>You don't have to use jargon at all to explain similitude (the principle behind dimensional analysis, and every wind tunnel in the world). That is really the most correct answer here, and what you should have thought of first. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Volume has a cubed relationship with length, surface area has a squared relationship.</p>

<p>Sure, that's not specific to aircraft though. What I'd be interested to find out is the dependence of lift, drag, and wing efficiency on the scale, since air Reynold's number changes with scale too.</p>

<p>I am aware of that, hence the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The particular dependence of lift and drag coefficient on Reynolds number is specific to the shape. For many shapes, the general dependency is something like this: the drag coefficient decreases with increasing Reynolds numbers at Reynolds number up to about 10^3, then the drag coefficient is approximately constant up to 10^5, then the drag coefficient decreases til about 10^6, and then from 10^6 on, the drag increases with Reynolds number. These numbers are approximately true for a sphere. As Reynolds number scales linearly with linear dimension, that's generally what the drag behavior looks like. Now, for airfoils, as an example, the behavior can be even more complex. Typically, the airfoil will be designed such that it has a drag minimum at or near its typical operating condition. </p>
<p>The drag itself is proportional to surface area so you have even more complex interactions.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-54bdc522aab708a0f42b8a05faf89a5d" target="_blank">lift drag polar with a family of curves based on Reynolds number tells you how the coefficients scale based on size. As I said, the drag equation itself is dependent on surface area (planform area of the wing) which might itself be a non integer exponent scale with linear size.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that's informative. Does lift (per unit area) stay constant?</p></div>		</li>
