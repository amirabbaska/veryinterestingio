			<div class="markdown"><p>I've definitely seen a lot more complete professional porn videos on these porn sites compared to complete movies I've seen on YouTube. I'm talking about Kink.com production value porn on PornHub that have been up for months.</p>
<p>I think it also has to do with how much more advanced YouTubes content detection algorithms are and MPAA aggression on piracy. It might also have to do with the amount of time I spend searching for this stuff. I've been refining my Google searching skills since high school to find the perfect videos to nut to. </p></div>		</li>

<p>People are confusing a video (1-15 minutes) to a movie (45 -120 minutes). Millions is probably an exaggeration, but there are definitely hundreds of thousands of porn movies out there you can easily get for free with just some easy google searching.</p></div>		</li>
