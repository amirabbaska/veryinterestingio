			<div class="markdown"><p>Compounding and research pharmacists are very knowledgeable.  &quot;Much more in-depth&quot; I find a stretch.  Retail pharm functions mostly in the check and balance system.  However, they are usually much more in the know about business related issues such as insurance, rebates, preferred formularies, aid programs, purchasing options, negotiating community deals, and such.</p>
<p>If you are really interested in &quot;what they do&quot; review some medical malpractice cases and see where and when the blame gets placed and on whom...</p>
<p>All that being said, pharmacists are awesome and save lives everyday ( both Dr' sand pts ).  No joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are prescriptions in this day and age still written out on slips of paper in ink?! It should be required to be typed at the very least. Preferably it should be done electronically to your preferred pharmacy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what we have in the UK. Scripts are either printed or sent electronically to the pharmacy. In my case, I just get a text message every eight weeks from my pharmacy reminding me to collect my medication - they've already got the electronic script from my doctor and prepared everything. </p></div>		</li>
