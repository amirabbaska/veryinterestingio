			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of when I was first exposed to the idea of eating lots of small meals every 3 hours to keep the metabolism up. (Their analogy is that it's like keeping a fire stoked, gotta keep adding firewood)</p>
<p>I told my dad, and he said that was stupid. I was convinced and tried following it, eating a bunch of small meals, and it did nothing and I gave it up.</p>
<p>Then I skipped breakfast because I read something else (16 hour fast, don't eat so late, sleep, skip breakfast) and I felt way better and didn't overeat as much.</p>
<p>From that, I learned there is a lot of stupid shit out there when it comes to eating, and I feel like we're finally unlearning a lot of stupid stuff. (we're also making up new shit)</p>
<p>Thanks for the book reference, I'll check it out and keep it in my backpocket for the eventual &quot;breakfast is important&quot; conversation</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> the term is intermittent fasting. There is a subreddit, r/intermittentfasting with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/4vnnx6/the_most_commonly_asked_questions_regarding/" target="_blank">FAQ</a>. You can also google it, I thought the first <a href="http://jamesclear.com/the-beginners-guide-to-intermittent-fasting" target="_blank">result</a> wasn't bad, as someone shows the measurable results of him using it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See you brought up a point that I think about a lot. We're unlearning a lot of shit and making more shit up. No other subject is as fickle as the subject of food/diet/nutrition. There is SO much contradictory information that sometimes it makes me want to scream. And I think to myself, will there EVER come a time when there is a consensus on what's good for you and what's bad for you as far as food? Here is just some of the endless knowledge we've gained over the years. </p>
<p>Fat is good for you. Fat is bad for you. High carb diets are best. No wait, low carb is best. Maybe even no carb. Calories count. Calories don't count. Calories count but don't count calories. Eat all the fruit you want. Fruit is just like candy so it's bad. Sugar makes you fat. Sugar doesn't make you fat. Sugar only makes you fat if you eat fat with it. Red meat and eggs cause heart disease. No actually you can go nuts on red meat and eggs but cut out all sugar. Dairy builds strong bones and teeth! Oh wait, humans aren't made to consume dairy. Breads and cereals should make up the bulk of your diet! But wait no, all gluten and wheat is evil so scratch that.....</p>
<p>And on and on it goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an epidemiological perspective: nutritional epi is <strong>hard</strong>.  That is, it's very difficult to reach definitive conclusions about what is good or bad for you.  People don't just eat one thing, they eat a whole variety of different foods, and these eating habits can change considerably over time.  So testing the relative benefits of one specific eating choice is hard for a number of reasons, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When people eat more of one food, it's usually as replacements for other foods which may have their own health consequences</li>
<li>The measurable effects of diet are usually long-term; it's hard for people to accurately assess their food intake over years or decades</li>
<li>Food choices are linked to many variables (such as socioeconomic status, exercise, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and other difficult-to-capture cultural factors) which may influence health outcomes</li>
<li>Food can affect numerous outcomes (e.g. cancers, assorted heart diseases, diabetes, obesity) and foods which may be protective against certain outcomes could be harmful for others</li>
<li>People (including researchers) have strong pre-existing ideas about health consequences of specific foods, and these opinions can implicitly bias the interpretation and uptake of nutritional research</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons and more, it's not uncommon to have multiple studies with seemingly contradictory results.  Generally speaking, don't put too much stock in any one study, the best information comes from the overall scientific consensus (based on all relevant research) which can be found from trusted sources like the CDC or the American Heart Association.  </p>
<p>Nutritional epi can be confusing, but I don't want to suggest that it's all hopeless, since eating right is perhaps the most important thing people can do for their long-term health.  We're pretty sure that a diverse diet including many fruits and vegetables, lean proteins (e.g. fish, chicken, nuts), primarily whole grains, and vegetable oils can lead to substantially longer, healthier lives.</p>
<p>PS - But yeah, the research on breakfast is very muddled</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really no wonder it's so hard for most people to eat healthy when we're told all this complicated &amp; conflicting information.</p>
<p>You know what's worked best for me? Two rules: One, eat more real food &amp; less overprocessed pre-packaged stuff (more corn, less Little Debbie; more cooking from scratch, less Hamburger Helper). Two, eat when hungry, not when bored. If I overthink my food any more than that, I kinda lose my mind and just give up. So it's really slow, it's not CRAZY healthy (Hamburger Helper is actually a &quot;not-bad, kinda almost real food&quot; night for me), but it's not gonna kill me.</p>
<p>I see people say things like 'oh I feel so guilty, we made burgers on the grill last night' and I just shake my head. Add some tomato &amp; lettuce and eat the damn burger, it's FINE. Doubly so if you put it on some kind of whole wheat bun, you know? That's actual food! It's better than the four boxes of girl scout cookies I was hoarding at my desk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our family looked at my husband like he was crazy when he started fasting 14 hours a day. Which means a full 14 hours every day (counting sleep time), he doesn't eat at all. They were like &quot;3 meals a day!&quot;, &quot;he's skinny enough!&quot;, etc. </p>
<p>In doing so, he ended up curing his gout that he had had for years. A few days into the fasting diet and all of his gout symptoms are gone. 2 months later now and still no signs of even an attempted breakout and he's eaten whatever he's wanted to during that other 10 hours. Pretty miraculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, intermittent fasting is totally a thing. My husband cured his gout that he had had for years by doing it. It's been a couple of months since he started, but he went from constantly being on the edge of an outbreak (that involves the ER) to having no symptoms whatsoever. </p>
<p>Pretty sure gout has a lot to do with insulin, NOT meat consumption, as is claimed by mainstream medicine. He's been able to eat whatever he's wanted to eat as long as it's within that timeframe every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another intermittent faster here. I was doing it for years before I knew that it had a name and was a &quot;thing&quot;. I just naturally found that I don't feel like eating a breakfast and stopped bothering years ago. When I wanted to lose some weight I started exercising during my lunch break so I became a &quot;doesn't eat lunch&quot; guy. Without planning it out I was by default fasting from when I went to bed until after I got home from work the next day. </p>
<p>I do drink a few cups of coffee with skim milk during the day but otherwise nothing, not even a stick of gum. It is normal for me. I don't feel hungry because my body is used to eating in the evening. It doesn't expect anything during the day. </p>
<p>Even the skim milk thing is a fluke. My wife happens to buy the low fat version of milk and has done all the time I have been with her so that's what I tend to drink. Full fat milk tastes too rich to me now. </p>
<p>I am a very healthy person who is active and fit with high energy levels. Yet my friends and family freak out whenever I wave away offers of food during times they consider &quot;critical&quot; to be eating. </p>
<p>People who sit on a couch and watch TV while I train for my next sporting event tell me how unhealthy I am. It's almost funny if it wasn't so sad. People love their stock wisdom especially when it supports their preferred lifestyle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You and I both know that calling it the most dangerous meal of the day is not fact, at all. </p>
<p>Its true that breakfast causes a spike in blood sugar. However, omitting breakfast and going straight to lunch also causes a massive rise in blood sugar (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/div-classtitlecarbohydrate-rich-breakfast-attenuates-glycaemic-insulinaemic-and-ghrelin-response-to-span-classitalicad-libitumspan-lunch-relative-to-morning-fasting-in-lean-adultsdiv/002631D10E870A64AF12B34EF8E336AF/core-reader" target="_blank">source</a>) as your body doesn't know the difference between breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p>Theres a phenomenon known as the second meal effect, where after the first meal of the day (regardless of the time it was consumed), all subsequent meals show a much more controlled increase of blood sugar. For this reason, evidence is leaning towards encouraging those with diabetes or impaired insulin control to consume breakfast. </p>
<p>I'm not particularly pro-breakfast, either. In fact I believe everyone should avoid the high carb, frosted lumps of coloured sugar that are pedalled out by cereal companies, but something like porridge can be great. Or, if you don't want breakfast thats fine too. Just calling it the most dangerous meal of the day is a crock of shit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big thing a lot of people in this thread are ignoring is the fact that <em>every meal</em> has an accompanied spike in blood sugar. So it's certainly reasonable for diabetics to eat smaller meals, which will induce lesser spikes in blood sugar which can be more easily addressed by remaining function or insulin treatment (with less risk of toxic glucose levels).</p>
<p>Nutrition research is a mess. Bodybuilders tend to eat many small meals to keep a ready supply of nutrients during activities yet the new fad science is saying intermittent fasting yields longer lifespans in all models (holding my judgement on the latter for a few years for more studies). Just about everything has some grain of truth and really the only universal truth of the area is to never believe someone telling a nutrition method as an absolute.</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>One book written by a single researcher (what are his credentials by the way?) should not be taken as fact, specially in a topic and a field that is plagued by discrepancies and contradictory findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You make an assumption where breakfast is bad because it is &quot;typically filled with sugars and food with low nutritional value&quot;. Any food that falls in that category is bad for you, independently if you eat it at breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed, most people can hold a fast for an extended time during the morning due lower appetite, but if you are performing physical extraneous tasks for an extended period of time, you will probably feel better if you have a healthy meal before starting.</p>
</li>
<li>Yes, corporations promote the idea of breakfast being the most important meal of the day (especially if their products are part of it), but just because some &quot;evil corporation&quot; says that, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is completely false.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, I have breakfast pretty late in the morning (around 4 hours after I wake up) and usually hold a fast of about 14 hours which is pretty ok. I have a very small piece of an apple if I run early in the morning, before breakfast, because this is what works for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a purely anecdotal level, I do not eat 3 meals a day. 2 at best, and never breakfast. However, for a business trip, I went down to Costa Rica, and had the privilege to stay with some friends I knew.</p>
<p>Breakfast to them is very different, it includes a plate full of beans and rice with an egg on top, among other things. A very heavy breakfast. Before then, I never ate breakfast, but not clearing your plate in some parts of the world is seen as rude. </p>
<p>So after forcing myself to eat these heavy breakfasts for a few days, it became second nature. When I got back to the states, it stuck with me, and I needed this huge breakfast in the morning.</p>
<p>So will you be hungrier throughout the day? I can't comment on that. But you can certainly condition yourself to expect/eat a large breakfast. I ended up eating more food overall because of it.</p></div>		</li>
