<p>The TLDR is 132 characters, and English encodes about 2-bits per letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 bits would only allow for 4 unique characters, right? Did you mean 2 bytes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English words aren't entirely random, though. Some combinations of letters are much more common than others, so you can't treat every letter as truly independent of the ones around it.</p>
<p>Envelope math: English has somewhere on the order of 200,000 unique words, with an average length of about 5 letters. </p>
<p>So if each <em>word</em> was independently chosen (which is still unrealistic!) then it would carry about 18 bits of information, meaning we'd expect just over 3 bits of actual information per letter in a full english text. I'm sure a more thorough analysis that accounts for word patterns within sentences could argue that down to 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See responses below. The actual information content of English, not the highly inefficient representation we use :-)</p>
<p>[ Of course, as noted, there are lots of reasons to use a redundant language. In a fully-compressed representation, even a single typo would make a word or sentence unreadable. You couldn't understand anyone in a loud room if you missed a single phoneme. </p>
<p>So I joke that it's highly inefficient from a entropic point of view (just like a .WAV file after the invention of MP3) but it's probably a Very Good Thingâ„¢ ]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a source to say 256-bit encryption?</p>
<p>My old garage door opener was like 8-bit encryption...You'd set a bunch of binary switches in the opener and the receiver to get them to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Your math still stands, but i'm curious to know the source to say that keyfobs are 256.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was just an example. Different manufacturers will do whatever they want and this sort of this is the Wild West where everyone decides what they want to do as they go along. </p>
<p>And yeah, those old garage door openers are a joke -- you can scan through all the codes in a few minutes. </p></div>		</li>
