			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest I don't know how much you would have to drink and how fast you would have to drink it to get this problem. Maybe? If you manage to get medical care after your ordeal then the appropriate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_dehydration" target="_blank">management of dehydration</a> involves giving an IV solution of electrolytes. A 15 kg kid would get 450 ml in their first hour alone with adults probably getting several liters in the first hour (the article doesn't say.) But this is over the course of an hour not 5 minutes and it's an electrolyte solution not pure water. The electrolytes make all the difference here.</p>
<p>You could also drink an electrolyte drink like Gatorade or a medical grade re-hydration formula or you could probably make do with a few bites of cracker in between sips of water. Just don't do it too fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the use of a colloid IV vs a crystalloid electrolyte make a difference to the risk of cerebral oedema? Or maybe not, since my understanding is that cerebral oedema only happens when the plasma becomes dilluted, which shouldn't be a problem with proper (i.e. non-water) fluid resuscitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming that you can't get them to a hospital or vet? First make sure that they're awake enough to drink anything. You don't want to drown anyone by pouring a glass of water down an unresponsive person's throat. </p>
<p>Severely dehydrated people will have all the obvious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration#Signs_and_symptoms" target="_blank">signs and symptoms</a> such as headache, thirst, constipation and so on. They'll also often show something called &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dehydration+tenting&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fbgzU_uqIJfMsQSR-oH4Cw&amp;ved=0CEUQsAQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=978" target="_blank">tenting</a>.&quot; If you pinch their skin for a moment it will &quot;stay&quot; that way rather then snap right back.</p>
<p>So what to do? You can make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy#Basic_ORT_solutions" target="_blank">your own improvised electrolyte drink</a> with two tablespoons of sugar, half a teaspoon of salt, and a quart of water. Some people in developing countries drink this instead of Gatorade. Have them sit someplace cool and shady and drink it slowly for the first few hours. Maybe a cup or two an hour? And make sure they sip it! After that they can probably tolerate larger quantities safely.</p>
<p>But what if you don't have any of that stuff? Just give them regular water with some food that has a few carbohydrates and salt. Have them munch on some bread with peanut butter or pour in a little soup with their water. Be creative! </p>
<p>Just don't give them too much sugar/salt/food or the dehydration will get worse. And make sure they don't eat and/or drink too fast or their brain will swell up. Also it's important to make sure that the water isn't contaminated; you can dehydrate badly from diarrhea and drinking more water laced with cholera won't help you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this advice. The scary thing is I have been in this situation before.</p>
<p>It was during a heatwave in Sacramento, three-figure temperatures, and a homeless man started knocking on my front door desperately. He looked sick and was coated in sweat. I've never seen anyone look more dead while still breathing. He told me he passed out in the alleyway from the heat. He kept saying that he had a headache and his eyes looked extremely dazed, the way people look when they've pulled an all-nighter.</p>
<p>Anyway, he asked me for water and I gave it to him... maybe three glasses worth... and he chugged it right down. No food, no electrolytes, just tapwater. I gave him my phone and he called someone and she came and picked him up about a half-hour later and he seemed to be doing better, but it's scary to think that I could have contributed to his death by trying to save him. That was eight years ago, but your explanation gave me a bit of a flashback.</p>
<p>I feel like more people should be told this stuff, especially in hot, dry climates. I mean, we all learn the &quot;if someone passes out, put them on their side&quot; rule, and &quot;stop, drop, and roll&quot;... but if you live in the desert you're more likely to experience dehydration than be set on fire.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again.</p></div>		</li>
