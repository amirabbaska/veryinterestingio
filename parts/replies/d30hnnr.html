			<div class="markdown"><p>With the telescopes we have in the making, we will absolutely be able to get exoplanet spectroscopy data! Further, with some luck, we might be able to get some biosignature gas spectra from exoplanet atmospheres, as early as from TESS scheduled for launch next year and JWST the year after!</p>
<p>I would be confident that within a decade, we will have a list of planets with water as well as unstable biosignature gases in the atmosphere, which will at the least let us state with some confidence that there are ongoing life processes going on in them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We won't get that from TESS. TESS is going to be searching for planets using the transit method, and will be able to give us masses, radii, and densities, but we'd need follow-up observations to get any spectra.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but TESS can find planets close enough to us (unlike most of Kepler's) that JWST might be able to get us their spectra if we're lucky!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that a photo of earth from Saturn was described by Carl Sagan as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot" target="_blank">&quot;pale blue dot&quot;</a> (see photo here: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pale_Blue_Dot.png</a> ), getting a photo of exoplanets at the resolution the blue marble photo is a long way off.</p>
<p>But &quot;ever&quot; is a long time. So probably. Hell, I'm typing this on a device so much more advanced than Captain Kirk's communicator. I'd wager my mother watching Star Trek in the 60s never expected she would own one.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever? Sure.  </p>
<p>In the near term, no, nothing like that. But it would require sending a probe there and that is a ways off most likely.</p>
<p>However with something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwhelmingly_Large_Telescope" target="_blank">this</a>, we might be able to get enough data to make a very basic map. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, very few if any.</p>
<p>The example you gave was of a star that's around a magnitude 8. This is a bit fainter than the human eye can see, but fairly bright. The stars that Kepler finds planets around tend to be some magnitudes fainter. 5 magnitudes fainter, the star is only 1% of the brightness.</p>
<p>To do anything like surface maps and spectroscopy, you need to find planets around bright stars. Kepler is great for finding a large number of planets so that the statistical work can be done, but to characterize individual planets you really want planets around brighter stars. There's other current searches that are looking for these planets, and TESS is a space mission that will look for planets around brighter stars as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We already have some spectral information for exoplanets. <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010Natur.465.1049S" target="_blank">Here</a> is a paper. You basically need to subtract out the stellar spectrum, and stars are fairly well understood, so that's doable.</p></div>		</li>
