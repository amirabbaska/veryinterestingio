			<div class="markdown"><p>I realise this is more theoretical, but many in this thread say that there is no such thing as random, whether or not humans can/can't determine a pattern.  </p>
<p>What do you say about this? </p>
<p>Of course, in a practical sense, if no computer or human can find a pattern, then it is random enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They haven't studied quantum mechanics. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem" target="_blank">actual experimental proof</a> that quantum measurements ARE random. Like someone else pointed out connecting a geiger counter to a computer is an easy way to achieve true (very slow) randomness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but Bell's Theorem (which you linked to) doesn't quite &quot;prove&quot; that those measurements are random, only that the (observed) predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be caused by a theory of local hidden variables. They can, however, be brought about deterministically in a nonlocal theory such as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory" target="_blank">Bohmian mechanics</a>. In other words, it's possible that those measurement are not, in fact, random, but that reality is deeply weird in <em>different</em> ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't rule out non-local hidden variables, meaning that there still could be unseen explanations for quantum behavior other than randomness. One deterministic quantum interpretation is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory" target="_blank">de Broglieâ€“Bohm theory</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, it is random as far as we know. I don't think that we have--or maybe ever will be able to--determine the mechanism that causes the supposed randomness in quantum mechanics, but it is currently the most random thing we know of.</p>
<p>So at the very least, it is the truest random among other things that are not so truly random.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden_variable_theory" target="_blank">hidden-variable theory</a> and fails to satisfy the Bell inequality. (Doesn't mean it's wrong, but that it just can't explain all of the random of QM.) In essence, QM is random because it's random. That's all we have for that. But we know it can't be anything less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, some microcontrollers (and maybe microprocessors, not sure about that) include true random number generators.  I believe these are generally based on thermal noise, which (as far as I remember) is a quantum phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh, that's a mixture of classical and quantum physics. There's also the problem with them being open to manipulation by controlling the temperature. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I hadn't heard this.  Can you point me to some paper or article examining this?</p></div>		</li>
