			<div class="markdown"><p>A tertiary reason is that reflected photons can be aimed. That way, solar sails can sort of tack into higher or lower orbits by having a component of the net force going parallel to it's orbit. A black solar sail would only be able to add dV normal to it's orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, I would argue this is the central misconception behind OP's question. Yes, more energy is transferred to an object if it absorbs the photon. But that energy is  mostly converted to heat and isn't used in a constructive way. When the photon is reflected, less total energy is absorbed, but the kinetic energy change is doubled (approximately).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put it this way.   If you were floating in space and had a gun and fired it away from you, you would move in the opposite direction.  </p>
<p>Similarly if you got shot by a bullet you would absorb the bullet and travel in the same direction as the bullet.  </p>
<p>Now think about this:  if you got hit by the bullet and were somehow able to load that bullet into your gun (suspend disbelief that bullets arent easily used twice) and fired it back in the direction it came, you'd get twice the gain in momentum.  </p>
<p>The other reply has all the details including how to work out the ratios of velocities and masses to ensure conserved momentum but I hope this clears up the basics.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are a sail and you catch a photon. Catching the photon pushes you backward.</p>
<p>You then absorb the photon as heat and that's it.</p>
<p>Now you are also a mirror so after catching the photon you also &quot;throw&quot; the photon away from you back where it came from, doing this also pushes you backward.</p>
<p>So you end up getting two pushes instead of one when you are a mirror.</p>
<p>Extra credit: When you throw the photon back toward the sun you are moving away from the sun slightly faster than you were before before, so the end speed of the photon is just a bit slower. (You subtract your speed from the photon.) This change in speed is where the energy of the sail comes from. Photons are special and don't ever change speed, instead they change color and the photon is redshifted (red has less energy than blue) when it leaves the sail.</p>
<p>If you are not a mirror then the leftover energy is just wasted as heat that you absorb.</p>
<p>A solar sail wastes a lot of energy, but a regular rocket wastes even more - all that mass you fire out the backend is &quot;worth&quot; a ton of energy in an E=MC^2 way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is a conserved quantity: for a given collection of objects or what have you, it always stays the same. For every day objects, momentum equals mass times velocity. For massless photons it's a bit more complicated, but roughly the same concept. </p>
<p>Say you are 100 kg, and you are standing still on a frictionless surface. Someone throws a 1 kg ball at you in an easterly direction at 10 m/s. You have zero momentum, and the ball has 10 kg m/s of momentum. If you catch the ball, the combination of you and the ball will still have 10 kg m/s of momentum, which means you will be moving at (10 kg*m/s)/(101 kg)=0.099 m/s to the east.</p>
<p>If the ball instead bounces perfectly off of you, and heads back where it came from at 10 m/s, the total momentum of the system (you and the ball) still has to remain the same. When it bounces off in the opposite direction, it now has negative momentum in an easterly direction: -10 m/s. You can put the equation like this to solve for your final velocity (p is momentum, m is mass, v is velocity):</p>
<pre><code>p1_initial + p2_initial = p1_final + p1_final</code></pre>
<p>(break down momentum into m times v)</p>
<pre><code>m1*v1_initial + m2*v2_initial = m1*v1_final + m2*v2_final </code></pre>
<p>(substitute in known values)</p>
<pre><code>(1 kg)*(10 m/s) + (100 kg)*(0 m/s) = (1 kg)*(-10 m/s) + (100 kg)*v2_final</code></pre>
<p>(multiply where possible)</p>
<pre><code>(10 kg m/s) + (0 kg m/s) = (-10 kg m/s) + (100 kg)*v2_final</code></pre>
<p>(add 10 kg m/s to both sides)</p>
<pre><code>(10 kg m/s) + (10 kg m/s) + (0 kg m/s) = (10 kg m/s) + (-10 kg m/s) + (100 kg)*v2_final</code></pre>
<p>(add where possible)</p>
<pre><code>(20 kg m/s) = (100 kg)*v2_final</code></pre>
<p>(divide both sides by 100 kg)</p>
<pre><code>(20 kg m/s)/(100 kg) = (100 kg)*v2_final/(100 kg)</code></pre>
<p>(Divide through and we have our answer!)</p>
<pre><code>(20 kg m/s)/(100 kg) = v2_final
(20/100 kg/kg m/s) = v2_final
0.2 m/s = v2_final</code></pre>
<p>So you can see, bouncing imparts more momentum than absorption! So by having the photons bounce back instead of getting absorbed, the solar sail gains more momentum.</p>
<p>Sorry if that was too much math, but I couldn't find a good video demonstration so I thought breaking down the problem step by step would make it easiest to understand. If you're still lost, here's a demonstration of momentum on the space station...notice how when the balls bounce off each other they both end up with a higher final speed than when they stick together: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IYDb6K5UF8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IYDb6K5UF8</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lol'd when I saw an ask for a simple explanation, and then saw a bunch of equations. The equations did explain it well, and you did a good job, but the first glance was hilarious.</p>
<p>The best simple explanation I've used is similar to the ball example you used, so I'll use it again.</p>
<p>A ball is going 10mph north (I'm American, so this is easier :)). It hits you, and imparts all of the force that a 10mph ball imparts. The ball went from 10mph to 0mph, and you took all that energy.</p>
<p>If instead the ball bounces, and starts going south 10mph, then it has, in effect, lost &quot;20mph worth of energy&quot;, and that has transferred to you. Going 10mph north to 10mph south requires negative 20mph of force. </p>
<p>So, in effect, the bounce ends up giving you 20mph of force, which is double the original 10mph of force.</p>
<p>Note: mph is not a measurement of force, but I used it to mean the amount of force exerted by a ball going 10mph.</p></div>		</li>
