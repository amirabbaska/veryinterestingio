			<div class="markdown"><p>As a massage therapist, I really enjoyed your answer. One of my favorite, long lasting methods of treatment is &quot;myo facial release&quot; therapy and &quot;unwinding&quot; is specifically light pressure that, when applied&quot; allows the facia to release from a tense state. </p>
<p>Also, you mentioned excercise... keep in mind massage is a passive workout for your muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm watching this documentary on facia that explains with help of diagrams and real life examples: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/91863i/the_mysterious_world_under_the_skin_2018_under/" target="_blank">https://old.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/91863i/the_mysterious_world_under_the_skin_2018_under/</a></p>
<p>I would love to see more medical people discuss this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory: I am not a doctor</p>
<p>But I think that in time, this research on fascia and the various discoveries associated with it will cause the diagnoses of &quot;fibromyalgia&quot; to disappear, and will be replaced with something like &quot;Atrophying Fasciitis&quot;</p>
<p>And before any of you chronic pain sufferers jump down my throat, please, watch it. I'm very sympathetic to your pain, and I don't think its in your head any more than my own is.</p>
<p>But also remember that what we call &quot;fibromyalgia&quot; today, was once &quot;Morgellon's&quot;</p></div>		</li>
