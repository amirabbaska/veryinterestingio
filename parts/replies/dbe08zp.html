<p>Cleaning Windows with a squeegee is a pain in the ass, and until you get good at it (Trial and error eperience and muscle memory) your windows will be a streaky mess. </p>
<p>The trick is maintaining consistent motion and pressure, as any deviation in force or pressure will cause the blade of the squeegee to bend or bow slightly, and these deformations will leave streaks in their wake. </p>
<p>Even when you get good, you're still going to have streaks, but you'll clean those up on your next pass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dawn dish soap, Hot water, a quality squeegee, and a good technique will avoid streaks. </p>
<p>Source: I cleaned windows for rich people in million dollar+ homes near the beach. </p>
<p>Oh and fuck your cut ups. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Better yet, use newspapers, unless you are young enough not to have any newspapers. But it turns out the newsprint mailers you get in that box on a post by the curb work well at cleaning mirrors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will do full axes of wiping though, from one side to the other and don't wipe in reverse from where they left off. That might be a terrible explanation but picture a window washers arm movements compared to you wiping a window or a mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or use reasonably high quality isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) on your last pass. You can get &gt;90% IPA cheaply over the counter and it does the job very nicely.</p>
<p>IPA + lint free cloth = cleanest glass surfaces ever with low effort.</p></div>		</li>
