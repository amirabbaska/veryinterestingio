			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, ok, thank you for posting. I definitely need to see a gyno. My cycles have been a mess since becoming obese. No cysts or PCOS, but maybe I need to ask about endometrial hyperplasia. I dunno, but this post was an important reminder for me to get on that ASAP. I’m overdue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PCOS is a set of related symptoms, not a disease per se, and may have different causes in different people. It’s correlated with obesity, but it’s not clear whether that’s a cause or an effect of PCOS. Losing weight often improves the symptoms, but PCOS tends to make it more difficult than average to lose weight, and women at a healthy weight can still have PCOS. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have PCOS without being obese. I have it and I'm barely overweight/normal weight fluctuating.</p>
<p>The more you weigh though the worse it will present as there's more fat triggering more hormones. At my higher weights my facial hair is/was much worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had heavy but reliable periods when I weighed 331lbs. Since losing weight (155lbs in the last 15 months), my cycle is erratic and lengthy. I have terrible mood swings and bloat and bleed for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>I asked my gynecologist about it and she wasn't able to offer much advice, maybe you might have some insight to offer?</p>
<p>I have read that fat cells release estrogen... But do you have an experience with or know of any literature regarding estrogen production during weightloss? I've read that fat cells can deload estrogen during weightloss but I can't find anything validating that. I also wonder if my body is still producing <em>too much</em> estrogen and if so, how long it will take to stabilize.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I weigh less now than I did at puberty.</p></div>		</li>
