			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a good point. The adrenalin release from the adrenal glands is not just epinephrine, but cortisol, and dopamine, and possibly some others as well.</p>
<p>It's neurochemical, and interacts with the neurophysiology to create those visible reactions.</p>
<p>Also, we get that HUGE zing when it happens. Recall riding my bike, and nearly got hit at a corner by a big car. Felt that huge &quot;zing! throughout my body as I fell down and nearly scraped the skin off my knee to the patella bone.</p>
<p>Then had to make a choice, go back the house and clean up, or continue the beginning of my ride.  Went home, because about 20' later the cateholamine boost of the flight or fight bilateral adrenals release wore off and the PAIN began coming in. Found two places had also been wounded which had been missed.</p>
<p>DA and epinephrine are ALSO pain killers, giving us time to get away. Also, anandamide receptors are stimulated, giving pain relief as well. and anandamide is also affected strongly and longer by THC,and so we thus see the pain relief mechanism there, too.</p>
<p>It's very interesting neurophysiology, and not completely, but well enough understood. And interesting topic.</p>
<p>The &quot;goosebumps&quot; we also get with surprise and fright are DA mediated as well.  Some of us can voluntarily release dopamine (DA) and get that &quot;zing&quot; as well as the good feeling. AND the piloerection of the hairs on our body, which comes with it.</p>
<p>This is how it largely works. The first sections tell more about it and how the body uses it and we can learn to use it, too.</p>
