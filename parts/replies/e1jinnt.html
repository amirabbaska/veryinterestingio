			<div class="markdown"><p>In humans bacterial gut infections cause diarrhea so that the bacteria can escape the host and contaminate and grow in other environments or hosts. It’s all about replication and resources so bacterial colonies are always trying to grow at any opportunity. </p>
<p>In sea life it’s probably better to be in a bigger host with more resources to use up than a smaller host so they work to benefit their future at the detriment of the host. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably worth mentioning (I'm certain that most understand this) bacteria don't 'want' anything. They have evolved to cause diarrhoea because this allowed their descendant strains to continue living and infecting. With the primary driving force of survival. The bacteria only survive well inside a body, however do not survive long due to the immune response of the body. The surviving strains are ones able to continue getting into other hosts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the same reason certain plants and animals are poisonous (not venomous). It doesn't save the poison dart frog's life directly, but it can serve as a deterrent. The frog still dies if it's eaten, but the animal that eats it is going to have a very bad day. The same principle could be at work here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The poisonous trait is usually mixed with warning coloration that discourages predation. Giving a predator a bad day <em>after</em> the prey dies is still not a particularly useful situation from the point of view of natural selection. So you have to let the predator <em>know</em> you're not good to eat, and then rely on previous learned/evolved behaviors on the predator's part.</p>
<p>This sort of thing would not have evolved all at once or even for the present purpose. For example, ancestors of Monarch caterpillars likely found themselves caught up in evolutionary chemical warfare with their food plants. Plants can survive being eaten quite a bit, so for plants, evolution of toxicity can be very direct and literally kill herbivores while they're feeding. Plants are chemical factories, producing a massive bestiary of &quot;phytochemicals&quot;, including some of the most deadly poisonous and most useful pharmaceuticals we know of.</p>
<p>The caterpillars had to evolve a means to either detoxify or sequester whatever nastiness oozed from their still-living (and actively fighting) salad. Sequestering the toxins is what apparently worked for the caterpillars, who also just happened to become poisonous as a result. Initially, being poisonous didn't help them much. They got eaten by birds anyway, then the birds got sick. But this didn't kill the birds, and birds are smart buggers. So the birds learned to avoid the caterpillars that looked a certain way. And populations of caterpillars evolved to make themselves look as distinctive as possible.</p>
<p>Probably. The difficulty with evolution is that it's easy to come up with reasonable explanations. But it's much harder to find the millions-year-old evidence to support it, because most of it is long gone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to a lake where the water lights up and sparkles whenever you move it at night. The explanation was that the bacteria gets eaten by the smaller fish so it developed bioluminescence in order to attract the bigger fish that will eat the smaller ones and protect it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A leading hypothesis is that they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescent_bacteria#Purpose_of_bio-luminescence" target="_blank">want to be swallowed by fish</a> and the fish have co-evolved an attraction to light due to its common use in the deep ocean as a means of communication. Light could mean many things - food, mates, warnings to stay away, etc.</p>
<p>Being swallowed by fish doesn't mean the death of the bacteria. They or any of their clonal offspring will get crapped out alive and well some time later. This helps the bacteria move around. If they don't like their current part of the ocean, no problem, just get eaten and hope the fish craps you out somewhere nicer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other species take advantage of this for their own purposes - they know that the light means they'll find not just the bacteria, but the fish that eat them.</p></div>		</li>
