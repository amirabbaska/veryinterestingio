			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dark matter&quot; is a big change to physics, but we already know that matter comes in different forms, so introducing a new type isn't super-shocking.</p>
<p>Something massless that warps space-time would be more revolutionary, I think. As would gravity bleeding into our universe from elsewhere.</p>
<p>So we call it &quot;dark matter&quot; for now because that's the simplest hypothesis that fits the observations. Occam's razor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true and perfectly understandable but I think Tyson is right and we should've called it &quot;gravity&quot;, not &quot;matter&quot;, because that's all we know for sure that it is. </p>
<p>But you're right, it's probably matter, because, where else can gravity come from? Those other ideas are weird and matter is ordinary.</p>
<p>Too late now, I suppose, to change the name, but it's still a good point.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion I think that it must one of those other things, not matter, because it's so diffuse and everywhere at once.  Gravity from mass is concentrated on some one place.</p>
<p>I think it's gravity leaking in from another universe or something.  But what do I know?  What does anyone know about Dark Gravity?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Massless particles absolutely do warp space time. Throw enough photons together with identical momentum and you can (hypothetically) create a black hole. Energy warps space in the same way matter does.</p></div>		</li>
