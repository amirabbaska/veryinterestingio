			<div class="markdown"><p>Radon is ridiculously unstable, and you need fairly pure gas to make a gas discharge light.</p>
<p>Even if you could somehow obtain enough radon to fill a tube, and you surrounded it with massive amounts of cooling so that it didn't melt itself, within minutes there would be a lot of radon decay products floating around in the tube. They'd very likely interfere with the function of the light, probably by creating a short circuit so that the electrons pass through the decay products and not through the radon gas.</p>
<p>Of course, if you somehow got such a vast quantity of radon, it would probably emit plenty of light on its own. I mean, in a neon light you're energizing gas with electrons accelerated to a thousand volts or so... radon is constantly emitting beta-minus electrons with energy in the millions of electron-volts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radon 222 has a half life of 3.8 days. Ridiculously unstable is right. In about a month it would be a tube of Lead, but the Lead is a much denser solid than the Radon gas was. I’m guessing the tube would end up in a hard vacuum. If there was enough Lead to short the high voltage leads it would vaporize and you would have a Lead vapor lamp. Maybe?<br />
Now if you fired up your Radon lamp and left it running for a month you could watch it change… from a safe distance.<br />
Of course you could keep your Radon tube recharged by including a ton of Radium in it. A literal ton. </p></div>		</li>
