Interesting how this seems to be common knowledge though, while Bart and Bombardier seem to have recently discovered this. <a href="https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2016/news20160831" target="_blank">https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2016/news20160831</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can say that Bombardier makes both trains and trams for Australia, and their Diesel locomotives have conical wheels while our trams make a distinctive screeching noise when cornering. Probably just their light rail division that hasn't heard of them, they seem to do ok for trains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I take BART across the bay every day. I thought the descent from West Oakland into the tunnel was bad, but oh my god, the SF side is somehow so much worse. I flew out of SFO a few months ago and took BART there. I couldn't believe how much louder some of the peninsula tunnels are.</p></div>		</li>
