			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on a bunch of things, like wind direction, what type of ground is getting heated (peat/sand/rock), relative altitudes, and the duration of the fire. If a fire is at the top of a hill, and you're at the base, the updraft should suck warmer air from the bottom, making the wind colder. Obviously water takes a lot of energy to heat up, so if things are wet, or the water table is close to the surface, that's a factor too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it mean that in some tropical countries like India where the Sun shines throughout the year, could develop an artificial layer of cloud just to prevent the excessive sunshine that often has more negative effect on peoples lives? </p>
<p>I have heard about cloud seeding where they induce rains, artificially. </p>
<p>If the heat from Sun could be prevented at all many problems would be solved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle yes, and a group at <a href="https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard is researching it</a>, but it doesn't solve all of the problems. For one, we've specifically been taking particulate pollution <em>out</em> of the atmosphere because it is bad for public health (just talk to anyone in the Northwest right now and they'll tell you how hard it is to breath there right now). The theoretical solution is to pump these particulates straight into the stratosphere, so high up that we won't have to breath it. This also has the added effect that it's cooling powers are stronger. Three main criticisms of this &quot;geoengineering&quot; approach are: 1) CO2 is still increasing in the atmosphere so it doesn't solve ocean acidification, 2) you'd need to increase the amount of particulates you put in every year that the CO2 increases so it's not a longer term solution, 3) there may be unexpected consequences like accidentally overshooting the cooling, environmental disaster, or something else unexpected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also remember seeing a NASA video about climate change where they talked about geoengineering solutions and one was using some kind of network of watercraft to shoot water up into the sky to artificially increase cloud cover.  Again, they stressed that geoengineering should be a drastic last resort because of the reasons you already mentioned.  I'll see if I can find the link.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in 2001, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, with all the planes grounded for a while, they noticed a reduction in the maximum temperature but an increase in the minimums (the overall net change is still not clear though) specially in regions that are prone to the production of condensation trails (those line clouds coming from the tip of the wings or the exhaust of the engines).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious about this too! (Also live here)
I was also wondering if it lowers the risk of getting sunburnt. I kind of assume it would, but I still put sunscreen on the kids I nanny.  </p></div>		</li>
